1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,300
Couple of announcements first.
Um,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,790
it looked like the personality 
assessment program got overloaded on the

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,624
due date.
I presume that was because a large 

4
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:15,570
number of people in the class,
we're doing it in the last two hours.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,200
So I've recalibrated the due dates.
The earliest due date is a week from the

6
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,314
previous due date,
which I think is the 23rd and then I've 

7
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:26,514
divided it up by your last name.
So you should've got an email from me 

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,283
telling me,
telling you when the personality 

9
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:38,481
assessment is in fact dupe.
So those of you from a to h or something

10
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:40,470
like that,
have to hand it in first,

11
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:43,200
but you still had an extra week so that 
shouldn't be too bad.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,040
There's also no class on Thursday.
I have to be out of town.

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,270
So that's the announcements.
Okay.

14
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:56,271
So today we're going to talk about a 
personality trait,

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,373
which is agreeableness and one end of 
the distribution and something called 

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,630
sometimes called antagonism on the other
end.

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,133
MMM.

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,013
It's difficult.
It's a difficult trait to conceptualize 

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,613
in my estimation.
It's always been the one that's puzzled 

20
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:15,834
me the most in some ways.
And I also think it's the one that gets 

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,560
most obviously troublesome at both ends 
of the spectrum.

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,293
So extremely agreeable.
People are empathetic and Compassionate 

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,673
and compliant.
But the downside of that is that they 

24
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:41,700
are not that good at standing up for 
themselves and their,

25
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,280
and so they're often manipulated and 
pushed around.

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,170
Um,
for example,

27
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:49,530
they're not as good at negotiating for 
their own salaries.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,740
And that's something we'll discuss in a 
little bit.

29
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,710
And my experience clinically as being 
that agreeable people,

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,083
the consequence of their compliance is 
that they tend to be resentful because 

31
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,003
just because you're agreeable and 
compliant doesn't mean that at some 

32
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:10,260
level of your psyche you're not 
interested in a fair deal.

33
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,040
And if you're not particularly good at 
negotiating for yourself,

34
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,910
especially in the presence of 
disagreeable or antagonistic people,

35
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:22,140
then you're going to be left with the 
short end of the stick.

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,300
I think the typical complaint of someone
who's very agreeable is I do so much for

37
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,940
other people and they seem to do so 
little for me.

38
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
And so if you feel that way,

39
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,333
mmm,

40
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,010
there's a reasonable probability that 
you're agreeable,

41
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:37,844
there's some probability that you're too
agreeable and maybe you should stop 

42
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,663
being so easy to get along with.
And that's one possibility on the other 

43
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:49,040
end of the distribution,
the antagonistic end,

44
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,730
well,
if you're antagonistic enough,

45
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:53,564
he ended up in prison.
It's the best personality predictor of 

46
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:58,064
antisocial behavior.
It seems to be associated with sorta 

47
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,240
cold blooded aggression rather than the 
reactive form,

48
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,810
which would be more characteristic of 
negative emotion neuroticism.

49
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,950
So,
and I think that people who are lower in

50
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,700
agreeable,
denser,

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,240
higher antagonism are probably 
predatory.

52
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,191
Now,
you know,

53
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,024
human beings are predators and we have 
been for a huge swatch of our 

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,250
evolutionary history,
maybe for all of it,

55
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,850
you know,
maybe not when we were one cell down and

56
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,320
most,
but for a huge,

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,080
a huge chunk of it.
And during that time,

58
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,980
our capacity to be predators is 
definitely been key to our survival.

59
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,503
Um,
we perhaps started to cook 2 million 

60
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,870
years ago.
It's very peculiar human activity,

61
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,183
you know,
the use of fire and cooking and there's 

62
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:57,520
no other animals that do that.
Um,

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,440
it made me much more digestible for us.
It shortened the length of our digestive

64
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,274
system a lot.
So if you look at human beings compared 

65
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:07,480
to chimpanzees,
you know how to chimpanzee has shaped a,

66
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,643
they're sort of shaped like this and 
it's because a chimpanzee is mostly in 

67
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:12,604
test dines.
And the reason for that is because they 

68
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,454
mostly leaves.
They do hunt though they will catch 

69
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:18,580
monkeys,
but they mostly leaves.

70
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,414
And so most of what a chimpanzees life 
consists of is sitting around chewing 

71
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:27,310
leaves and then digesting them because 
leaves are not particularly nutritious.

72
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,473
Whereas human beings,
we figured out how to hunt very 

73
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,234
effectively and then we figured out how 
to use fire and fire makes almost 

74
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:38,510
everything more digestible and increases
the Ph,

75
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,693
the caloric efficiency of the food and 
it in it in particular it meat makes 

76
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,490
meat more digestible.

77
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,323
And so that meant that we could decrease
the length of our gut and increase the 

78
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:52,510
length of our,
the size of our brain,

79
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,120
which seems like a pretty good trade off
fundamentally.

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,270
So
anyways,

81
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,780
before we can talk about this,
I'm going to go over something perhaps I

82
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:05,440
should have gone over before,
which is a bit of elementary statistics.

83
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,560
Well,
they're not so elementary because people

84
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,663
dispute them continually,
but I want to talk to you about the 

85
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:15,430
normal distribution because you're going
to run into this in,

86
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,783
in it pretty much in every science,
but particularly in psychology because 

87
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:20,494
most psychologists will tell you that 
most things in the world are normally 

88
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:27,280
distributed.
That's it's not exactly obvious why that

89
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:28,114
is.
It's all so not obvious by the way that 

90
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,253
that it's true.
There are lots of things that aren't 

91
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:35,890
normally distributed.
Money is not normally distributed.

92
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,680
Productivity at work is not normally 
distributed.

93
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,710
The number of books people publish is 
not normally distributed,

94
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,873
nor is the number of records people 
record or the songs that they write or 

95
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:46,204
the paintings that they make.
Virtually anything that has to do with 

96
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:51,820
productivity is distributed in a prieto 
distribution,

97
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:53,920
which we'll talk about more towards the 
end of the class.

98
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:58,730
And a premio distribution is a 
distribution where most people,

99
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,590
at least in the human case,
where most people have or do very little

100
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,780
of the productive work in a very small 
minority,

101
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,150
do virtually all of it.
And so,

102
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,523
um,
it's a vicious distribution and it's 

103
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,044
much more common than you'd think if you
went through the average psychology 

104
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:17,264
training program.
I didn't really learn about premio 

105
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:19,064
distributions till about 10 years ago.
And then it was because I had a client 

106
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:26,120
who was a financier and a and a 
psychologist at the same time.

107
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,490
And he taught me a lot of things that I 
didn't know,

108
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,830
which was quite convenient.
So anyways,

109
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,683
back to the normal distribution.
Psychologists will tell you that things 

110
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:36,344
are normally distributed and almost all 
the statistics that you will encounter 

111
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,723
are predicated on the assumption that 
the data that you're manipulating is 

112
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:45,194
normally distributed.
Now you're supposed to check that 

113
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:49,010
assumption before you engage in this 
statistics.

114
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,440
And if the data isn't normally 
distributed,

115
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:54,080
there's various things you can do to it 
too,

116
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,140
too deep to make an approximate a normal
distribution before you do the analysis.

117
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,283
Although sometimes you can do,
I think real conceptual and empirical 

118
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:08,330
damage to the data by forcing it into a 
normal distribution,

119
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:09,164
especially when it's one of the things 
that actually isn't normally 

120
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,164
distributed,
which aren't theoretically aren't 

121
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,650
supposed to exist,
but which do.

122
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,500
Now this is,
let me show you some,

123
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,820
some something about a normal 
distribution and this is,

124
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,290
this is a golden board.

125
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,123
That's what this thing is called and 
golden was this incredibly intelligent 

126
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,403
polymath from the late Victorian Times 
who made contributions in a whole 

127
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:38,300
variety of scientific disciplines,
psychometrics being one of them.

128
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:39,134
The measurement of human behavior,
a golden is often regarded as the first 

129
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:46,760
person who studied intelligence,
but that's not true.

130
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,594
Actually gotten studied what he called 
Eminence and Eminence was sort of the 

131
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:57,230
probability that you'd be in the same 
class structure,

132
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:58,064
say as an aristocratic Englishman,
and he thought of that as an inborn 

133
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,610
trait,
you know,

134
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:09,170
which made the British aristocrat 
superior to the British commoner.

135
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:12,320
And then of course superior to everyone 
else as well.

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,780
And people confuse that with 
intelligence.

137
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:18,050
But if you read golden carefully,
you find out that he really,

138
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,260
he didn't conceive of intelligence,
it was more like talent or ability while

139
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,820
or eminence,
which is what he called it.

140
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,050
So now golden was interested in 
measuring things.

141
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,510
And so he made a lot of measurements of 
people,

142
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,780
various aspects of people,
physical aspects,

143
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,614
and he started to develop some of the 
presuppositions that we use in our 

144
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:41,474
statistics today.
And one of the things he noticed was 

145
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:45,830
that a lot of things that you can 
measure,

146
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:46,664
like height are normally distributed,
which is to say that most people are 

147
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:50,564
average and there's a distribution 
around the side so that most people are 

148
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:54,554
average.
A few people are really tall and a few 

149
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:59,460
people are really short and it's kind of
a continuous distribution across,

150
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,750
across that entire span.
And so that's a normal distribution.

151
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,584
Now the theory is that things are 
normally distributed when a lot of 

152
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:08,784
different factors contribute to them.
So you can imagine in the case of 

153
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,580
height,
well what,

154
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:16,260
what might contribute to it.
Um,

155
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,333
prenatal conditions might be one.
Nutrition might be another genetic 

156
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,040
heritage might be other.

157
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,873
Another,
which you could also divide into the 

158
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:25,944
genetic component you get from your 
mother and the genetic component that 

159
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:31,780
you get from your father posture.
Um,

160
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,800
gender,
those are a few,

161
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,360
maybe ethnicity.
The Dutch,

162
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:38,220
for example,
are extremely tall.

163
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,593
Um,
so there's a variety of factors that 

164
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:45,150
might contribute to height.
And when a variety of factors contribute

165
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,984
to something,
then it tends to be normally 

166
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:48,960
distributed.
That's the hypothesis.

167
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,220
And so now it's because the variation is
random.

168
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,780
So let me show you what it means for 
variation to be random.

169
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,300
Now,
so golden figured this out.

170
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,163
Now this is a golden board.
Now a go when a golden board would 

171
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:05,370
normally be,
would be a board with nails.

172
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,204
So each of those little dots there,
you imagine those are nails and then it 

173
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:09,744
would be slanted a little bit.
And then there'd be a spout at the top 

174
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,370
right in the middle that would drop 
marbles down.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,833
And then at the bottom there's a bunch 
of containers where the marbles could 

176
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:18,774
land.
And then you can see how the marbles 

177
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:24,480
distribute themself if you let them fall
randomly.

178
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:28,830
Now this is random because at each nail,
imagine a nail is a choice point,

179
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:31,410
right?
The marble can go right or left and it's

180
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:34,260
entirely random.
And so here's what happens.

181
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:36,810
If you run something randomly,

182
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,633
now you can see as the ball's accumulate
or the marbles accumulate that they're 

183
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:05,974
starting to be considerably more in the 
center and considerably fewer out on 

184
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,784
that edges.
Now the technical reason for this is 

185
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:17,900
that there's lots of ways to get to the 
middle and hardly any ways to get to the

186
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,100
edges,
right?

187
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:21,800
Because if you want to go all the way to
the right for example,

188
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,930
then you'd have to,
yeah,

189
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,993
here we go.
If you wanted to go all the way to the 

190
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:30,950
right or the left,
then every time you hit a nail,

191
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,360
you'd have to go either,
right?

192
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,471
So write,
write,

193
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:33,951
write,
write,

194
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:34,490
write,
write,

195
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,840
et Cetera,
or left,

196
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:36,351
left,
left,

197
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:37,184
left,
left,

198
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,280
et cetera.
And you can imagine since there's only a

199
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,114
0.5 probability of each of those,
that once you have 10 or so of those 

200
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:44,684
stack together,
the probability that you're going to 

201
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,990
take that particular path is vanishingly
small where there were in the middle.

202
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
There's all sorts of different ways you 
can there,

203
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:53,951
right,
left,

204
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:54,551
right,
left,

205
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:55,450
right,
left or right,

206
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:56,021
right,
left,

207
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:57,940
left,
or while you get the picture.

208
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,360
There's all sorts of ways.
So there's more paths to the center.

209
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,553
Then there are paths to they had just.
And so that's why you get a normal 

210
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:10,150
distribution and the normal distribution
does some pretty weird things.

211
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,730
So for example,
we'll go to this next one.

212
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,510
This is another kind of golden board.
And uh,

213
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,343
you know,
we'll run the first part of it and 

214
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,980
you'll see that you get your typical 
normal distribution.

215
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,380
So you could imagine that each of those 
little nails is a factor in some sense,

216
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,620
a random factor determining where you 
end up in the distribution.

217
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,030
Okay?
So after,

218
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,150
after we fill this up and we have a 
normal distribution,

219
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,700
then you see the little yellow and black
line there.

220
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:46,490
We're going to take that out and then 
the balls are going to fall again.

221
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:47,324
What do you think will happen when they,
when they go to the next level and it 

222
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:54,830
guesses?
Yeah.

223
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,670
Okay.
So that's one hypothesis.

224
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,590
The bolts will be more likely to go to 
the edges.

225
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,960
Anyone else?
What do you guys think?

226
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,300
Be More flattened.
More flat.

227
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:08,630
And people don't agree with that.
Okay.

228
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:09,464
So,

229
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,040
okay,

230
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,410
you better withdraw quickly.
It's starting to stack up here.

231
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:14,191
So,
okay,

232
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:15,210
let's see what happens.

233
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,203
Oh,

234
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,530
Lo and behold,
if we kept running this,

235
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:41,270
you'd,
you'd get another normal distribution.

236
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,643
So it actually doesn't change it a bit.
So the normal distribution has a pretty 

237
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,860
robust phenomena.
So

238
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,670
now if you're doing basic statistics,
let's go back to that for a minute.

239
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,630
What you're really trying to do is to 
figure out

240
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,880
what the probability,

241
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,310
yeah,

242
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,340
what the probability is that two 
distributions will overlap.

243
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:13,174
So for example,
let's say you took the distribution of 

244
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:15,814
height among women,
which is about five foot four on 

245
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:21,810
average.
And so there'd be a,

246
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,103
you know,
a normal curve around that because 

247
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,410
there's some very short women and some 
very tall women.

248
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,543
And then there'd be a normal 
distribution around men and men are on 

249
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:30,934
average five foot nine.
And then you could calculate the 

250
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:38,641
probability that those two curves were 
the same by chance.

251
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,790
And that would depend to some degree on 
the number of people in your sample.

252
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:46,210
So to do this statistics,
you need the two normal distributions,

253
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,580
you need the number of people in the 
sample,

254
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:49,414
and then you need a way of calculating 
the probability that those two 

255
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:55,370
distributions could have been drawn from
the same population.

256
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,683
So that's your hypothesis.
Basically that's the null hypothesis is 

257
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,510
that the two samples are drawn from the 
same population,

258
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:03,344
in which case there's not going to be 
any difference between them or there's 

259
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,550
going to be random differences between 
them.

260
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,600
And the cut off point is that if you're 
to populate,

261
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:16,250
if the two samples you draw have normal 
distributions that overlap,

262
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,560
that overlap in such a limited manner 
that that would only happen in one of 20

263
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,550
cases.
Right?

264
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,010
So you're drawing random samples from 
the population,

265
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,500
then you presume that that's a 
significant difference.

266
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,633
Now it's arbitrary.
That's P is less than 0.05 it's 

267
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,770
arbitrary.
Now you might say,

268
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,604
well why did psychologist picked P is 
less than 0.05 and answer to that is 

269
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,913
there.
There is no reason except that there's 

270
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,940
all,
there's two areas that you can make when

271
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:47,774
you're calculating your statistics.
One error is you find a difference when 

272
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,810
there is,
when there isn't one right?

273
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:57,500
You find a difference when there isn't 
one and the other is that you don't find

274
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:01,280
a difference when there is one and those
are type one and type two errors.

275
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,090
And what you're trying to do is to 
minimize both of them simultaneously.

276
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:10,091
And that's that's you.
You can't say where that's most suitable

277
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,200
because by reducing one error you 
increase the other.

278
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:15,034
So psychologists had to pick some cutoff
and 0.05 seem to be as good as anything 

279
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,680
else.
So

280
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,493
now here,
here you want to look at this because 

281
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,623
actually you really need to get familiar
with what a normal distribution looks 

282
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:34,751
like and the ways that it's parsed up.
So you see right at the center,

283
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:39,080
that's the mean and the median and the 
mode if the,

284
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,230
if the distribution is perfect and 
normal,

285
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:44,270
those three things are going to be the 
same thing.

286
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,230
Um,
at the,

287
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,040
the next level there you see percentage 
of cases.

288
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,670
So at three standard deviations below 
the mean,

289
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,533
there's only 0.13% of the population 
that's three standard deviations below 

290
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:02,720
the mean or three standard deviations 
above the mean.

291
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,553
So we could say we can think about Iq 
because people are sort of cognizant of 

292
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:09,134
Iq to some degree a hundred which would 
be the mean in terms of Iq is the 

293
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:17,981
average Iq of someone who's your typical
high school graduate.

294
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,813
And then 115 is the Iq of your typical 
state school graduate in the u s so 

295
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:28,130
there's a difference of 15 points.
And that corresponds.

296
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,870
If you look here in terms of 
percentages,

297
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:30,704
which is the the,
you know the bottom line is 50% of 

298
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:40,931
people have an Iq above 150% have an Iq 
below and it's,

299
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,180
it's because it's defined that way by 
the way.

300
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,820
And then if you go up one standard 
deviation,

301
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,893
you see that pretty well.
It's we'll 85% for the sake of 

302
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:51,594
simplicity.
85% of people have an Iq below 115 and 

303
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,150
then if you go up to two standard 
deviations,

304
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,840
you see that 98% of people have an Iq.

305
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,240
Okay?

306
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Below two standard two standard 
deviations and three standard deviations

307
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:09,294
is 99.9 so when you get up to 130 
there's only two and a half percent of 

308
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,164
the population has an Iq that high.
That's about where you guys are 

309
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,730
somewhere between 120 and 130 so you 
know,

310
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:24,564
you look around and you think,
well you know this is an average class 

311
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:27,164
of university students,
but you're not average in terms of 

312
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:31,950
intelligence.
And that makes a huge difference because

313
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,800
intelligence is one of the best 
predictors of career success.

314
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:35,634
For example,
do you grow up to three standard 

315
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:37,854
deviations?
That's an Iq of 145 you know when 

316
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,780
there's undoubtedly a couple of you in 
here,

317
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,480
um,
well there's,

318
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
it's one in a thousand in the 
population.

319
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,234
There's a couple of you in here that 
have an Iq of 145 or maybe more than a 

320
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,020
couple.
Now,

321
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,003
one of the things you want to notice is 
because people get very confused about 

322
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:56,940
this with regards to percentages.

323
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,650
So let's say that you were assessing to 
people to hire them,

324
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,530
or you were assessing them for their 
intelligence,

325
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:06,510
which is something that might be done.
For example,

326
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,344
if you were screening them to go to 
university because the sats do that in 

327
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,860
the u s or if you were screening them 
using the graduate record exam and you,

328
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,890
you'd have you at one candidate who's 
98th percentile and then other candidate

329
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:21,180
who's 99th percentile.
Okay?

330
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:25,890
So think about that for a minute.
98 99 where's the,

331
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,350
where is there more difference?
You have three candidates,

332
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:31,290
one is 85th percent to all one's 98th 
percentile,

333
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:36,291
one's 99th percentile.
Where's the biggest difference?

334
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,470
Is it between the 85th and 98
yeah,

335
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,990
in terms of of improbability.

336
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,613
So it's the same distance.
Now that's what you have to remember 

337
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:54,094
when you're thinking about percentiles 
because 99 to 99.9% I'll don't sound 

338
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,294
very different,
but they're the difference between one 

339
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:02,890
and 101 in a thousand so it's a huge 
deal.

340
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,993
That's why you see that the normal 
distribution is divided up into these 

341
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:07,804
standard deviations and those are 
basically identical differences and 

342
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:15,250
those are often identical differences in
terms of ability.

343
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:16,690
So for example,
you know,

344
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:20,620
you might think that once you hit one 30
going above that isn't going to matter,

345
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:21,454
but that's not right.
There's just as much difference between 

346
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:28,141
someone who has an Iq of 130 and someone
who has an Iq of 145 as there is between

347
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:29,614
someone who has an Iq of 115 and an Iq 
of 130 even though the percentile start 

348
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:34,684
to switch around.
So you need to know these sorts of 

349
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:36,814
things if you're,
when you're starting to think 

350
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:42,280
statistically because otherwise while 
you can't understand what you're doing,

351
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:44,260
and that's,
that's generally not a good thing.

352
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,340
So although it's very frequent,
okay,

353
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:53,170
so agreeableness is one of the five 
dimensions of the big five.

354
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:55,690
We all know that.
And it can be broken down into these two

355
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,640
aspects,
compassion and politeness.

356
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,743
And so you can kind of figure out how 
agreeable you are by looking at these 

357
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:02,314
items.
They're all positively scored for the 

358
00:21:03,191 --> 00:21:04,024
sake of simplicity.
So if you intensely feel others' 

359
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,374
emotions,
if you're always in inquiring about how 

360
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,154
others are doing and you actually care 
rather than doing it for the sake of 

361
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,140
show,
if you,

362
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:19,870
if you're capable of sympathizing with 
other people,

363
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,550
if you respect authority,
if you don't like to see him or be pushy

364
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,680
and you don't like to impose your will 
on others,

365
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:27,514
then you're an agreeable person.
And a disagreeable person or 

366
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,970
antagonistic person obviously is the 
opposite of that.

367
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,160
So they're in don't feel peoples' 
emotions very profoundly.

368
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,640
They're not really all that concerned 
automatically about how other people are

369
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:47,410
feeling and they're not that 
sympathetic.

370
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,440
Um,
it's funny cause in my clinical practice

371
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,483
I can tell the difference between the 
agreeable people in the non agreeable 

372
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:57,430
people because when the agreeable people
come and they have a cup of coffee,

373
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,850
they always bring me one.
But when the disagreeable people show up

374
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,713
and have a cup of coffee,
they only bring a cup of coffee for 

375
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:06,730
themselves.
So it's quite comical actually.

376
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,360
So now you might think that,
you know,

377
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,860
cause our,
our,

378
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:15,970
our,
what would you say our society is at the

379
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:16,804
moment,
tilted towards regarding agreeableness 

380
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:19,960
as a virtue.
You know,

381
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:20,794
because you should be kind and you 
should be empathetic and you should be 

382
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:24,100
compassionate and all those sorts of 
things.

383
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:24,934
But our research,
this isn't published yet because it's 

384
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:29,764
complicated to,
to communicate and we haven't figured 

385
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:32,290
out how to do it yet.

386
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,230
But what we've found is that if you push
any of the,

387
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,990
um,
traits too far,

388
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,590
they fall off a cliff fundamentally.
So if you get too agreeable,

389
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:44,020
then you're dependent and you can't make
decisions and so on.

390
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:46,840
And maybe you're kind of afraid.
And Eda pull mother too,

391
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:47,680
right?
You're so,

392
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,870
you're so,
uh,

393
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,073
concerned with your,
with your child's wellbeing that you 

394
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,164
can't,
you're not harsh enough to send them 

395
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:55,294
outsider or make them do anything they 
don't want to do because it might upset 

396
00:22:58,421 --> 00:22:59,830
them.
And so that's not so good.

397
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:03,040
And then if you're to disagreeable while
I already said what that was like,

398
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,560
if you take antisocial people who were 
in prison,

399
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,701
you know,
they're,

400
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,430
they're aggressive and violent and you 
know,

401
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,130
the criminal types and they're,
they're predatory,

402
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,340
are low in agreeableness.
So you can see how that's a bad thing.

403
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:17,440
But then in the middle range,
it,

404
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,393
it gets more complicated because then 
agreeableness that where you're located 

405
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:23,950
on the normal distribution,
how good that is,

406
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:27,760
depends to some degree on what it is 
that you are going to do.

407
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,743
So one of the ways to think about how to
maximize your success in life is to 

408
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,790
attempt to match your personality to the
environment.

409
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,350
And so now what we're gonna do is we're 
going to look at how agreeableness plays

410
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:44,770
out as far as we can tell in the actual 
world.

411
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,820
No,

412
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,320
this is,
I should tell you too,

413
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:49,154
this is,
this is the sort of discussion that 

414
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:51,584
really people really don't like.
Everything we're going to talk about 

415
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:54,194
pretty much from here on end rubs people
the wrong way because our culture is 

416
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,710
very,
um,

417
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,003
likely to assume that most of the 
differences between people are cultural 

418
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,100
in origin and almost none of the data 
show that what they show is that right

419
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,810
as at least as your culture becomes more
egalitarian,

420
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,850
which is hypothetically what you're 
aiming at.

421
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,480
The differences,
gender differences for example,

422
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,553
not only become more biological because 
you've eradicated all the cultural 

423
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,470
difference,
but they also become more pronounced.

424
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,873
So for example,
the gender differences between men and 

425
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:31,934
women are largest in the most 
egalitarian societies like Norway and 

426
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:36,194
Sweden and so on.
And so the theory there is that well 

427
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:41,210
once you've eradicated all the 
environmental differences,

428
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,610
all that are left are the genetic 
differences.

429
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,690
And so that's sort of echoed in a weird 
finding in families.

430
00:24:47,691 --> 00:24:48,524
So you know,
you might think that if how you raised 

431
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,200
your children mattered.

432
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:55,570
Okay.

433
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,403
And children who were raised well would 
be more similar than children who were 

434
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:03,700
raised badly cause that would reflect 
the effect of your parenting.

435
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,370
Right?
So you've done a good job as a parent.

436
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,040
So your children are more similar where 
someone who just ignored them,

437
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,430
those children are different.
But that's actually the opposite of what

438
00:25:12,431 --> 00:25:16,660
happens is that the children that are 
neglected are more similar.

439
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:19,150
And the children who are attended to 
well are more different.

440
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,373
And the reason for that I think is the 
same reason that we see more pronounced 

441
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:26,440
differences in need galitary and 
societies,

442
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:31,150
which is if you care for your children,
it means that you make a very individual

443
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:34,780
relationship with each of them.
So you're not necessarily using the same

444
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:38,790
strategies for each child unless you 
think of them as Meta strategies.

445
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:43,030
And like I met a strategy might be,
well I get to know you and I get to know

446
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:43,330
you.

447
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,030
And because you're different people,
I react differently to you.

448
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:46,864
And what's what constitutes my 
philosophy of parenting would be act 

449
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:54,340
differently towards the children's 
differences.

450
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,070
And so maybe if you're particularly good
at that,

451
00:25:57,071 --> 00:26:00,160
your children turn out maximally 
different from one another.

452
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,593
And that's because you're allowing their
genetic differences to manifest 

453
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:05,350
themselves.
You know what oppressing them,

454
00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:06,184
you know,
and trying to cram them into the little 

455
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,490
box that you think that they should fit 
it.

456
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,790
Now the downside of that is that you're 
going to get differences,

457
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:13,624
you know,
and some of them might be quite 

458
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:15,790
surprising to you.
So

459
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,050
all right,
so let's look at some gender differences

460
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:23,950
to begin with.
So women are half a standard deviation,

461
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:27,620
more agreeable.
So we looked at the standard deviation.

462
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,140
So,
um,

463
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,150
half a standard deviation would 
represent,

464
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:37,220
let me see if I can figure it out here.
So

465
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,930
50 smoke,

466
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,990
34,
so 1767,

467
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,260
the average woman would be,
have to be

468
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,150
less agreeable than 67% of women to be 
as disagreeable as the typical mat.

469
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,630
So that's,
that's the basic size of the effect.

470
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,840
Okay,

471
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,190
the difference.
Now you see,

472
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,380
now you see how the two distributions 
overlap,

473
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:08,214
right?
So what the first thing you can see is 

474
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:13,320
that in the middle of the two 
distributions,

475
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:17,280
there's a space and that's a space 
that's filled with men and women.

476
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,200
So most of this space is occupied by men
and women.

477
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:25,950
But if you look off to the right,
say,

478
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,293
the most agreeable women,
the most agreeable people say three 

479
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,070
standard deviations from the mean.
They're all women.

480
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,500
Well,
that might not be that relevant,

481
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,543
but if you go to the left,
all the people who are three standard 

482
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:42,720
deviations below the mean are man.
Now that really starts to matter.

483
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,660
And here's one way it matters who's in 
prison.

484
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:46,494
Most men,
now you don't throw anyone in prison 

485
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:50,814
unless they're like three standard 
deviations below the mean in 

486
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,254
agreeableness,
which would put them at about one in a 

487
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,150
thousand.

488
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:55,983
In fact,
more people ended up in prison than 

489
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:58,350
that.
But the point is,

490
00:27:58,351 --> 00:27:59,184
once you get out on that edge,
then the gender differences become 

491
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:05,010
absolutely staggering.
And that's,

492
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,200
that's a weird thing about normal 
distributions,

493
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:08,034
right?
You can have a very little mean 

494
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,160
difference because the mean difference 
here isn't that big.

495
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:14,040
It's only half a standard deviation.
It's not that massive.

496
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,980
But as you move out towards the 
extremes,

497
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:21,960
the effects accumulate and they have 
huge societal effects.

498
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,783
So the cl here,
and I can't remember what that stands 

499
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:28,734
for,
the probability that a randomly drawn 

500
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:32,274
woman will be more agreeable than a 
randomly drawn man is 63% now women are 

501
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:39,120
also higher negative emotion and the 
difference isn't quite as big,

502
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:40,590
but it's,
it's roughly comparable.

503
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,970
So fundamentally the two big gender 
differences are in agreeableness.

504
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:45,804
So women are more compassionate and 
sympathetic and empathetic and less 

505
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:48,750
confrontational.

506
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,850
And then negative emotion and negative 
emotion is anxiety,

507
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,310
emotional pain,
frustration,

508
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:57,144
disappointment,
they all kind of clumped together into 

509
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:01,560
one
axis.

510
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,353
So the agreeableness dimension
seems to be stable across the lifespan 

511
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:09,704
that the gender difference,
where's the neuroticism difference only 

512
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:12,444
seems to emerge in puberty for women and
then it stays constant pretty much for 

513
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:19,410
the rest of the lifespan.
So,

514
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,023
so this is one of the things this means 
is that the probability that a given 

515
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:27,060
woman is more agreeable than a given man
is.

516
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:31,260
It is about 63% and then also in terms 
of negative emotions,

517
00:29:31,261 --> 00:29:33,510
say it's approximately the same thing,
but then you might think,

518
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:34,344
well,
what's the probability that a given 

519
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:40,470
person will be higher negative emotion?
And more agreeable.

520
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,810
And then you see how,
because these dimensions are orthogonal,

521
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:45,940
right?
They're unrelated essentially.

522
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,043
So that means you can add them together.
And so once you start to add the 

523
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,300
personality differences together between
men and women,

524
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,940
they actually start to become come quite
big,

525
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,850
far more than half a standard deviation.

526
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,580
Women are also more extroverted than 
men.

527
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,893
So that's funny because extroversion,
extroversion is a positive emotion 

528
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,044
dimension,
whereas neuroticism is a negative 

529
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:08,710
emotion dimension.
So,

530
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,113
but women are more extroverted too,
which means they experience and display 

531
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:17,500
more positive emotion.
And that seems to be the aspect of,

532
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,810
of extroversion that seems to carry most
of the gender differences,

533
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:26,590
enthusiasm rather than assertiveness.
And so women laugh more than men,

534
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,020
for example.
So when,

535
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,800
when,
when,

536
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,633
you know,
there's an old cliche that women are 

537
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:33,400
emotional,
more emotional than men,

538
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:34,234
and that actually seems to be the case.
If you look at negative and positive 

539
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:37,684
emotions specifically conscientiousness 
also sing seems to be linked to emotion 

540
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,590
to discussed into shame and the guilt.
And there's no,

541
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,510
there's very little gender difference 
there.

542
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,463
So it isn't like women are more 
emotional than men across all the 

543
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:50,164
emotions,
but the gender differences are larger 

544
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:54,970
and more egalitarian cultures.

545
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,813
While the thing is,
this is starting to become difficult to 

546
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:01,660
dispute because the size of these 
studies is starting to become extreme.

547
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:03,850
So this one study,
Schmidt at all,

548
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,163
uh,
they studied 18,000 people across 55 

549
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:08,614
cultures.
So that starting to become a pretty 

550
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:10,940
impressive,
you know,

551
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:13,720
a pretty impressive sample.
Um,

552
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,273
UN indices of gender equality and 
economic development were associated 

553
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,340
with larger gender differences in 
agreeableness,

554
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,280
but not an extroversion or neuroticism.
So,

555
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:25,790
so that's interesting.
So the,

556
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,470
the,
the,

557
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,373
the effect of egalitarianism doesn't 
seem to be spread across all the gender 

558
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:33,490
differences just in terms of 
agreeableness.

559
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,130
So,
and gender predicts more powerfully than

560
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:38,180
gender equality.
Now the,

561
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,750
these are interesting studies and you 
know,

562
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:44,170
I,
I don't think that that the theorists in

563
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:47,020
the humanities have really caught up 
with them because there's a huge,

564
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,450
there's a huge stress in the humanities 
and modern universities on the idea that

565
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,040
gender differences are cultural in 
nature and can be eradicated by cultural

566
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:57,874
transformation.

567
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,990
But the evidence seems to suggest that 
the only way you could eradicate them by

568
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,560
cultural transformation would be by 
working very,

569
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:08,890
very hard against the biological 
substrate.

570
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,740
And you got to wonder if you really want
a society to do that,

571
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:13,900
you know,
like what kind of society do you want?

572
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,310
Do you want a society where everyone is 
allowed to be who they are,

573
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,620
so to speak,
and to be successful at that?

574
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,693
Or do you want a society that does 
everything it can to make people the 

575
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:26,860
same regardless of their individual,
you know,

576
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,350
of the individual differences that are 
intrinsic to them.

577
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,040
It is by no means obvious that that's 
what you want.

578
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,473
So you'd have to do some pretty wicked 
social engineering to eradicate 

579
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,260
differences.
And it looks like the social engineering

580
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:45,110
that you'd have to do would run counter 
to egalitarianism.

581
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,021
Right?
Because he,

582
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:48,680
since egalitarianism seems to heighten 
the differences,

583
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,813
it only makes sense that you'd have to 
run counter to egalitarianism to reduce 

584
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:53,810
them.
So,

585
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,523
okay.

586
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,470
The lippa study here where,
where there's an association between the

587
00:33:01,471 --> 00:33:05,400
UN indices of gender equality and gender
differences in agreeableness.

588
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:09,780
I think that was 500,000 people.
So the,

589
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:10,920
you know,
the net has made,

590
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,990
uh,
the Internet has made it possible to run

591
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:13,824
huge samples.
Now here's some interesting things to 

592
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:17,710
um,
the,

593
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:23,180
the occupational preferences between men
and women are actually a lot larger than

594
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:27,150
the,
than the personality differences and the

595
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:30,390
occupational differences are large and 
not,

596
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:34,050
and like the gender differences in 
personality,

597
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,123
the occupational preference differences 
increase as you move towards more 

598
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:40,554
egalitarian societies.
So the big difference between women and 

599
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:45,714
men seems to be that women prefer 
working with people and men prefer 

600
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:50,544
working with things.
Now it's an interesting way look at it 

601
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:55,680
because for a long time,
you know,

602
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:58,800
if you're thinking about sexist 
stereotypes,

603
00:33:58,801 --> 00:34:02,230
say up till the 1950s,
maybe a little later than that,

604
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,560
maybe up to the mid sixties or so.

605
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,103
Um,
the idea would it be in that whatever 

606
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:12,180
gender differences there were in an 
occupational,

607
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,090
uh,
uh,

608
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,860
skill in,
in,

609
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,773
in,
in occupational distribution would have 

610
00:34:19,171 --> 00:34:21,630
had more to do with skill that was so 
that,

611
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:22,710
you know,
men were more skilled,

612
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:24,780
say at engineering and women were less 
skilled at it.

613
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,913
But what seems to have been what seems 
to be the case is that if you look at 

614
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:33,090
the basic predictors of success,
like intelligence and conscientiousness,

615
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,370
there's virtually no gender differences 
at all.

616
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:36,803
Now.
So what that seems to mean is that the 

617
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:42,000
reason that there are occupational 
differences,

618
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,380
at least in egalitarian societies is 
because the occupational differences are

619
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:48,780
driven by choice,
not by ability.

620
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,540
Now that's something to think about.
You know,

621
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,100
because again,

622
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,703
that seems to indicate that if you're 
going to push hard against gender 

623
00:34:58,411 --> 00:34:59,244
preferences,
what you have to do in some sense is 

624
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,403
restricted degree to which people's 
choices determine their occupational 

625
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:08,860
outcomes.
And you know,

626
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:09,694
and once again,
it's not exactly clear that you'd like 

627
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:13,100
to live in a society that would do that.
I mean it,

628
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,243
unless you think that precisely quality 
across every dimension in terms of 

629
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,680
occupational,
um,

630
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,093
what the number of men in the number of 
women in each occupation is such an 

631
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:29,670
important index that it actually trumps 
what people as individuals actually want

632
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,970
to do when you allow them free choice.
So,

633
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,900
so the big difference is,
and it's one standard deviation.

634
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,700
So to be as interested in things as the 
typical man,

635
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,680
the typical woman would have to be more 
interested in things than 85% of women.

636
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,473
And to be more interested in people than
things to be as interested in people as 

637
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:54,750
the typical woman.

638
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,500
A man would have to be more interested 
in people than 85% of men.

639
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,900
And that's starting to become a very 
large difference.

640
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,860
Now there's other differences too.
This is using the Holland categories.

641
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:05,694
Holland is a very well renowned 
industrial organizational psychologist 

642
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,540
and he divided jobs into these six 
categories,

643
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,790
realistic,
investigative,

644
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,680
artistic,
social,

645
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,383
enterprising and conventional.
And what you see is that men show 

646
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:22,650
stronger,
realistic,

647
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:23,484
and investigative interest.
The realistic category is particularly 

648
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:27,204
big.
It's eight tenths of a standard 

649
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:30,270
deviation.
And women show strong artistic,

650
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,490
social,
and conventional interests.

651
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,503
And there was no sex,
no gender difference at all in the 

652
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:38,280
degree to which people prefer an 
enterprising occupations.

653
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:43,850
So
here's from the,

654
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,873
from a different study from 
psychological bulletin looking at 

655
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,540
there's,
there's this,

656
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,890
there's this phenomena that,
that people are quite upset about,

657
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,813
especially in the u s although it's also
an issue in Germany that women are 

658
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,310
underrepresented in science,
technology,

659
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:01,920
engineering and mathematics dimensions.

660
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,593
And so,
but if you look at the interests of men 

661
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:07,824
and women,
you see under men that men are 1.1 

662
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:11,994
standard deviation,
more likely to be interested in 

663
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:15,594
engineering and three,
four tenths of a standard deviation to 

664
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:19,704
be more interested in math,
science and three tenths of a standard 

665
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,210
deviation,
more interested in math.

666
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,800
Now that has,
again,

667
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:28,620
that has nothing to do with ability.
So you know,

668
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:33,850
for there there is some evidence,
although it's really highly disputed and

669
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,420
the evidence I think keeps going back 
and forth,

670
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,553
that men are better at spacial rotation 
and that seems to be linked to 

671
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:42,210
testosterone.
But I,

672
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:43,044
like I said this,
this idea has been attacked very 

673
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:45,700
heavily.
Um,

674
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,110
there's also some evidence that if you 
look at the intelligence distribution of

675
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:51,990
men and women,
that the women women's distribution is a

676
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:54,660
little higher peaked and little less 
wide.

677
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,733
And what that means is there's far more 
men who fall into the extremely 

678
00:37:58,441 --> 00:37:59,274
intellectually impaired category.
And that sort of seems to go along with 

679
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:08,481
the fact that the vast proportion of of 
children in school who are in trouble,

680
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:10,614
our boys,
but they're also overrepresented at the 

681
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:16,500
extreme upper end of the continuum.
So the mail distribution has flattened.

682
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,660
And the people who believe that believe 
that,

683
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:21,780
well,
it's typical in animal communities,

684
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:22,614
mammalian communities,
for them to be more variability among 

685
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:25,464
the man.
So because men are expendable 

686
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:28,974
fundamentally,
and so in some sense the species can 

687
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:34,500
take a bigger chance with variability 
even though the means remained the same.

688
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,160
Now that was what Larry Summers was 
referring to.

689
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,323
He was a prison president of Harvard 
when he suggested that there might be 

690
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,100
intellectual differences between men and
women.

691
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:47,380
That in part accounted for the 
differences in,

692
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,390
in stem,
um,

693
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,253
prevalence.

694
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,330
And he just got roasted for that.
In fact,

695
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,610
I think they fired him,
which was really unfair.

696
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:57,550
I thought because he was just referring 
to a study.

697
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,310
He wasn't making a claim that that was 
his opinion.

698
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,483
But,
but we can put that aside for the time 

699
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:04,414
being.
It doesn't look like you need to invoke 

700
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,610
an intellectual capacity explanation to 
account for the underrepresentation.

701
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,410
You can just see that in the interests 
diverged.

702
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,423
Now you know,
you could attribute that to stereotypes 

703
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:20,674
and so forth,
but then you run against running up 

704
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:23,254
against the problem that the differences
are bigger in the countries that have 

705
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,970
done the most to eradicate the 
stereotypes.

706
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,983
So I don't really see how that's 
hypothesis can survive as far as I'm 

707
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:34,744
concerned.
It's just been proved wrong in the last 

708
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:39,730
10 years.
The gender differences are not primarily

709
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:42,040
cultural.
So,

710
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,580
so then you see this underrepresentation
here,

711
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,880
um,
completing degree in employment in math,

712
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,043
50% fewer women in math,
40% in the physical science is 25% the 

713
00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:59,360
computer science and 25% in engineering.
So

714
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,780
here's other occupational differences 
that,

715
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:04,614
that are quite extreme.
And then there's other reasons for 

716
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:07,704
these.
I don't think that these are only 

717
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:12,600
interest related.
So let's say what other differences,

718
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,310
what are differences between men and 
women?

719
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,141
Just once,
right?

720
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:19,720
There's the primary and secondary sexual
characteristics.

721
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,860
What else is different?

722
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,310
Adoption.
Okay.

723
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,900
These jobs are more dangerous kind of 
jobs.

724
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,560
Yes.
Well that that goes along with this sort

725
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,350
of nail expandability issue,
right?

726
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:35,763
So yeah,
they are board dangerous jobs in the 

727
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:38,764
probability that a man will be killed at
work is extraordinarily higher than the 

728
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:44,170
probability that a woman will be killed 
at work.

729
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,300
So,
um,

730
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,610
what other differences are there between
men and women?

731
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,550
Lennar and Margaret?
Yeah,

732
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,463
there were about four inches taller.
They're known as much happier as you 

733
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:56,730
would think.
I thought it was bigger than this.

734
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I'll show you one 64 versus one 94.
Those are the American averages.

735
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,213
So here's,
here's differences between men and 

736
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,910
women,
the gender differences,

737
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:09,400
these sort of physiological gender 
differences.

738
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:10,234
The cycle of psychological gender 
differences to some degree too can be 

739
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:15,790
lumped under a biological category 
called sexual dimorphism.

740
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,313
And in some animals,
sexual dimorphism is how much 

741
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:21,970
difference.
The reason the morphology is between the

742
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:24,250
male of the species and a female,
if this pcs,

743
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,040
and there can be a lot like with the 
elephant seals for example,

744
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:30,800
the males are like 10 times bigger than 
the females,

745
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,130
usually in a situation like that,
the male has a Harem.

746
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,990
So there's extreme male reproductive 
success on the part of a couple of males

747
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:41,870
and then extreme male failure among the 
rest of them.

748
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,063
So there's some seems to be some 
relationship between lack of sexual 

749
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:51,941
dimorphism and monogamy among mammals.
So the last dimorphic,

750
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,000
uh,
a species is the more likely they are to

751
00:41:56,001 --> 00:42:00,980
pair bond and human beings are 
relatively non

752
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:07,110
dimorphic.
So we're a little are dimorphic than the

753
00:42:07,111 --> 00:42:07,944
typical monogamous animal,
but a little less dimorphic than the 

754
00:42:10,381 --> 00:42:11,750
typical,
um,

755
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,990
polygamous animal and gender 
differences.

756
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:16,824
These sorts of gender differences with 
the male being larger and more 

757
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,470
aggressive than the female are not 
characteristic of all mammals,

758
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,390
although their characteristic of many of
them.

759
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,950
So the one,
the major,

760
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,813
the major exception or hyenas and the 
hyena females are very testosterone 

761
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,350
arised and they're very,
if that's a word,

762
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,873
they're very much,
they have very high levels of 

763
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:38,334
testosterone and they're slightly larger
than the males and they are more 

764
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:41,424
aggressive.
But the price they pay for that is that 

765
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:43,854
their reproductive organs mimic the 
penis and that's what they have to give 

766
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:49,870
birth through.
So it isn't exactly clear that that's a,

767
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,290
I'm not sure that's an advantage.
Okay.

768
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,124
Well so,
so here are some of the differences 

769
00:42:59,061 --> 00:42:59,894
between men and women.
So you could see there's a five inch 

770
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:04,310
difference in height,
a 30 pound difference in weight.

771
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,563
Um,
men are about 40 to 60% stronger in 

772
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:10,940
their upper body in about 70 to 75.
Oh,

773
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:13,400
sorry,
that's wrong.

774
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,773
Women are 40 to 60% as strong as men in 
upper body strength and 70 to 75% in 

775
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:23,990
terms of low of lower body strength.
Men have thicker jaws,

776
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,973
heavier jaws.
Women who are ovulating prefer men with 

777
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:28,040
thicker jaws.
So,

778
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:28,874
for example,
if you show women pictures of the same 

779
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:35,510
men across their menstrual cycle and all
you do is widen the jaw,

780
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,463
the narrow jaw guy is more preferable 
when there's less probability of 

781
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:42,830
conception.
And the wider jog guy is,

782
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,570
is uh,
more,

783
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,630
more desirable when the probability of 
ovulation is high and jaw dimensions are

784
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,330
associated at least to some degree with 
aggression.

785
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,590
Why would that be?

786
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,990
Why would that be?
Cause it's for biting.

787
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,041
You know,
like,

788
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,480
think about animals,
they bite,

789
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,730
you know,
and human beings can bite too.

790
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,953
So the jaw,
the relationship between jaw dimension 

791
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,274
and disagreeable to say seems to have 
somewhat of a hangover from our 

792
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:15,734
evolutionary past.
Women have a higher proportion of body 

793
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:21,740
fat.
Women are very resistant to diseases.

794
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,350
That's a good deal for women.
They live longer.

795
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,010
That's a good deal too.
There's way more male homicide victims,

796
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:32,910
which seems spectacularly unfair until 
you notice that there are many more male

797
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:33,744
homicide perpetrators,
which then seems to sort of even things 

798
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,500
out.
Um,

799
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,540
men kill non intimate acquaintances or 
strangers,

800
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:46,980
80% of the time where women kill 
intimate partners or family members,

801
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,113
60% of the time,
of course they're doing it a lot less 

802
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:51,360
frequently.
So,

803
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:52,194
and you never know how many of those are
in something approximating desperation 

804
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:57,510
and self defense,
right?

805
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,210
Uh,
excluding the odd psychopathic woman.

806
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,980
So,
um,

807
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,240
let's see.
Okay,

808
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:08,400
so back to these construction,
forestry,

809
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:09,690
mining,
utilities.

810
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:12,300
Well,
you can kind of see maybe that these are

811
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:14,250
jobs,
you can tell me if you disagree,

812
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:18,930
but these seem to me to be jobs that 
might require more physical strength.

813
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:23,430
That would certainly be the case in 
forestry and mining and construction and

814
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:25,470
likely in utility work too.
So,

815
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,020
and then there are also things like 
jobs,

816
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:29,550
right?
So these aren't,

817
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:30,803
you know,
there's not a lot of value on fostering 

818
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:38,790
close human relationships in these sorts
of occupations.

819
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,200
You know,
so

820
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,540
yeah.
So here,

821
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,750
here's some interesting things.
10 most dogs,

822
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,780
male dominated occupations in the u s so
I guess one of the things that you might

823
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,390
ask yourself is,
um,

824
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,860
do,
wouldn't you be interested in a job like

825
00:45:57,861 --> 00:45:58,694
this?
So hypothetically man are more 

826
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:04,510
interested in jobs like this than women.
Brick Mason block,

827
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,440
mason stone masons.
So you know,

828
00:46:06,441 --> 00:46:08,660
carving up stone,
cement masons,

829
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,420
electrical power line installers and 
repairs.

830
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,463
That's a tough job.
Aid be very hard to do that like during 

831
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:16,760
the ice storm.
That would be hard job.

832
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,150
Carpet floor and tile installers,
heating,

833
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:21,650
air conditioning,
refrigeration,

834
00:46:21,651 --> 00:46:24,710
mechanics structure,
iron and rebar workers,

835
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,830
bus and truck mechanics and diesel 
engine specialists,

836
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,410
miscellaneous vehicle in mobile 
equipment,

837
00:46:30,411 --> 00:46:32,840
mechanics tool and die makers and 
roofers.

838
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,810
So,
and those are overwhelmingly male,

839
00:46:35,811 --> 00:46:36,644
right?
If you look on the right hand column 

840
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:38,204
there,
there isn't even 1% of the total number 

841
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:46,490
of women in those occupations isn't even
1% you know,

842
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,223
it's funny you don't,
you don't hear a lot of like gender 

843
00:46:50,931 --> 00:46:55,730
affirmative action calls for structure,
iron and rebar worker,

844
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:56,900
gender equality.

845
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,490
So what's your,
wow,

846
00:46:58,491 --> 00:46:59,840
I think that's interesting.
You know,

847
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:00,674
if it's,
if it's merely a matter of gender 

848
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:03,800
inequality,
then why does it differ?

849
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,210
Why?
What difference does it make?

850
00:47:05,211 --> 00:47:06,044
What the category of employment is?
That sort of argument shouldn't be 

851
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:13,070
reserved for only the upper echelons and
the most desirable jobs,

852
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,323
you know,
otherwise that's not a coherent 

853
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:19,130
argument.
It either applies across the spectrum of

854
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:21,590
jobs or it's incoherent.
Those are the alternatives.

855
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:22,783
So here's the 10 most female dominated 
occupations in the U S it's still 

856
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,800
secretaries and administrative 
assistance.

857
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:30,550
Now,
you know,

858
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:35,550
that was the most common female job in 
the 1950s and it is still overwhelmingly

859
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,830
the most common female job.
So that's quite interesting.

860
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,440
Although it's incredibly dominated by 
women.

861
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:45,370
So you know,
is that a good thing or a bad thing?

862
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:46,204
It's like,
it's not that easy to tell childcare 

863
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,980
workers.
Well that doesn't really come as much of

864
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:52,150
a surprise,
but it is,

865
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,920
it is notable.

866
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,650
And was one of the things you see in the
Scandinavian countries,

867
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:58,270
for example,
it's pretty much related to this,

868
00:47:58,271 --> 00:48:00,380
is that there's a,
in this,

869
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:01,773
there's a 20 to one difference,
men versus women in engineering and 

870
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:08,350
there's a 20 to one women versus men 
difference in nursing.

871
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,053
So,
and it's this Scandinavian governments 

872
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,993
every now and then go through a fit of,
of enthusiasm about attracting more 

873
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,490
women into engineering.
And so they,

874
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,473
you know,
crank up their social engineering in 

875
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:24,550
there and their information about how 
desirable profession that is.

876
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:28,420
And then the proportion of women who go 
into engineering rises slightly,

877
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,550
not very much.
And then as soon as they stop,

878
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,750
you know,
pushing it hard,

879
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:35,950
it just drops right back down to 5%.
Teacher assistants,

880
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:37,780
registered nurses,
bookkeeping,

881
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:41,140
accounting and auditing clerks made in 
housekeeping,

882
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:42,640
cleaners,
nursing,

883
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,750
psychiatric and home health aides,
personal and home care aides and general

884
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:47,650
office clerks.

885
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,110
So that's where the bulk of women are in
the,

886
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,490
that's where the bulk of the female 
dominated occupations are.

887
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,550
So
let's see,

888
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:58,870
now,
did I cover all those things?

889
00:48:58,871 --> 00:48:59,704
Yeah,
I did.

890
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,950
So
here's,

891
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,380
I've been trying to figure this out for 
a long time.

892
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,760
Like what this agreeableness thing is 
and this is sort of what I've concluded,

893
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,893
um,
because I'm always interested in tying 

894
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:17,461
this down to the biology and Jaak 
Panksepp has a very good neuroscientist,

895
00:49:17,611 --> 00:49:20,770
is identified a number of fundamental 
biological,

896
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:22,670
emotional systems.
Um,

897
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,470
some of which we've alluded to already 
and some of which we really haven't.

898
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:27,304
So for example,
it was Panksepp who identified the 

899
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:33,160
existence of a place system
for engaging,

900
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:35,020
for example,
in rough and tumble play.

901
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:38,380
And that seems to be something that 
males prefer more than females prefer,

902
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,513
but he's also identified a care system.
And you could think about that as the 

903
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:45,250
basic it there has to be a care system.

904
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,420
I mean,
for God's sake,

905
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:47,560
we're mammals,
right?

906
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:50,110
I mean,
the definition of a mammal is,

907
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:52,780
well first the mammal is warm blooded 
and has hair.

908
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,050
But the next part of it is that the 
mammal is fed breast milk.

909
00:49:56,051 --> 00:50:00,340
And so obviously there's a dependent 
relationship there and it's not only a,

910
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:04,330
like it's a dependent relationship and 
it's a difficult dependent relationship.

911
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,850
You know,
like children are very,

912
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,013
um,
not able to care for themselves for a 

913
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:10,234
very long period of time.
I don't remember if I mentioned to you 

914
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,650
this or not,
but a mammal of our size should carry an

915
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:18,484
infant for two years gestation.
So you should be pregnant for two years 

916
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,340
and then the baby would be born.
And would be,

917
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:26,680
you know,
good for something walk round.

918
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:29,390
And so like,
like many mammals can as soon as they're

919
00:50:29,391 --> 00:50:30,224
born.
But because our heads are so big and 

920
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:36,200
because women's hips have to be narrow 
enough so that they can run,

921
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,650
there's an evolutionary arms race 
between the structures in some sense.

922
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:41,960
And so what's happened is that,
you know,

923
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:42,794
women compromise by having wider hips 
and babies compromised by having heads 

924
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:46,784
that can be be compressed during 
childbirth and also by being born much 

925
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:51,794
earlier.
But the price that's paid for that is 

926
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:57,020
that they're incredibly dependent.
And so,

927
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,820
so when you think,
well,

928
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,603
okay,

929
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,833
there has to be,
well it's foolish to even argue 

930
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:07,254
otherwise.
People fall in love with their bayberry 

931
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,793
babies to a staggering degree.
And the typical response of new parents 

932
00:51:14,311 --> 00:51:14,671
is,
well,

933
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:18,090
I never knew it would be like this 
because even if you're not interested in

934
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:18,924
someone else's baby,
you tend to be unbelievably interested 

935
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:22,164
in your own baby.
And that's a good thing because there 

936
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,164
are a lot of trouble.
And so there's a system and maternal 

937
00:51:27,091 --> 00:51:28,770
system,
primarily a care system.

938
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,513
It's a system that's shared by men 
because men are also very maternal for 

939
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:35,034
mammals.
And so I believe that's on the one end 

940
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:38,454
of the agreeableness spectrum.
It's like the maternal care system is 

941
00:51:41,461 --> 00:51:44,460
what's driving empathy and sympathy and 
all of those things.

942
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:48,300
And you know,
I think actually that it was the,

943
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:54,510
it was the expansion of the maternal 
care system to include men that actually

944
00:51:56,921 --> 00:52:00,100
resulted in human beings capability to 
pair bond.

945
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,273
Because one of the things that's really 
weird about people is that they share 

946
00:52:04,181 --> 00:52:06,250
food because animals aren't very good at
that.

947
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,360
Like chimps,
we'll do it a little bit,

948
00:52:07,361 --> 00:52:08,194
but they're not too happy about it.
And wolves sort of look like they share 

949
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:12,550
food,
but that isn't really what happens.

950
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,563
The dominant ones just eat until they're
full and then they don't mind if you 

951
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:18,430
know the subordinate ones eat what's 
leftover.

952
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,680
But human beings will share a food.
Now,

953
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:21,514
of course,
female mammals often share food with 

954
00:52:23,411 --> 00:52:24,244
their infants,
but they don't generally share food 

955
00:52:25,901 --> 00:52:26,770
with,
you know,

956
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:28,660
their,
their compatriot.

957
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,610
And you know,
you think about all the,

958
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:34,900
think about the language that couples 
who were in love use to each other.

959
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,393
You know,
there's a real infant tile element to 

960
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:38,200
it.

961
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,033
It's baby and deer and you know,
they make little cooing noises and they 

962
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:44,650
give each other a little pet names.
Like there's something that's,

963
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,690
that's like there,
there's,

964
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,553
there's a juvenile element to it that it
seems to me to be a consequence of the 

965
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:54,490
activation of this care system,
you know,

966
00:52:54,491 --> 00:52:58,360
between adults rather than from the 
adult to the child.

967
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,210
And so,
anyways,

968
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,430
then on the other end,
well,

969
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,120
there's a predatory aggression system 
and I think that they've,

970
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,230
they've come together in evolutionary 
history to balance each other out.

971
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,980
So both men and women are carrying and 
predatory,

972
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,950
um,
women more caring and less predatory and

973
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,784
men more predatory and less caring.
But both genders have that both 

974
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:27,290
capacities within them.
And I think they've evolved so that they

975
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,124
are mutually inhibitory,
so that a predatory male is not that 

976
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:35,280
likely to kill infants,
whereas,

977
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,100
and,
and fairly likely to care for them.

978
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,340
Now there are exceptions to this,
you know,

979
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:42,510
and,
and they're not trivial.

980
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,400
So for example,

981
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,320
stepchildren are much more likely to be 
killed,

982
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:54,310
especially if they're under two.
You are at 100 times more risk for abuse

983
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,830
from a step parent than you are from a 
natural parent.

984
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,100
And so you see echoes of this in the 
animal kingdom too.

985
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:01,934
So for example,
if a girl has have harems and then of 

986
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:07,050
course one gorilla has,
you know,

987
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,940
offspring with a variety of female 
gorillas and all the adolescent grillers

988
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:11,783
is sort of outside that little circle 
just waiting and tapping their feet for 

989
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:18,610
the guy in the middle to get tired or 
hungry or you know,

990
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,230
exhausted so they can come and run in 
there and you know,

991
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:24,200
overthrow him.
Fundamentally when they do that,

992
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:27,350
they kill all the infants and so to 
lions,

993
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:29,563
so

994
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,950
no predation and care systems,
you know,

995
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,793
they're very tightly balanced and they 
are influenced to a large degree by 

996
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:39,420
genetic similarity.
Rough as that is.

997
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:42,463
So

998
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:47,490
in caring professions,
5% males,

999
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,620
let's look at predation.

1000
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:57,210
8% of the male population hunts exactly.
Quite large number.

1001
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,310
When you think about how many people are
urban,

1002
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,450
right?
Because it's hard for,

1003
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:02,400
what are you gonna we'd get hunt 
raccoons,

1004
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:03,234
you know,
I mean once you're in an urban 

1005
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,690
environment,
it's not that straight forward to hunt,

1006
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:08,910
but in a rural environment it's,
it's you know,

1007
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:09,744
right there for you fundamentally.
So it's only 8% of the male population 

1008
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,450
in the u s that hunts.
But you know,

1009
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:16,284
you have to factor the urbanization 
issue in their 91% of those people are 

1010
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:20,574
male.
So hunting isn't something that 

1011
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:23,580
generally appeals to women.

1012
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,760
So
now

1013
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,660
what other reasons might there be for 
the gender differences?

1014
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,853
Well,
this is more speculative than what I've 

1015
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,420
discussed with you so far.
So you can think about it.

1016
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:43,254
I mean these are the things I'm trying 
to get straight and so I'm going to 

1017
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:50,460
share you share with you some of the 
pathways of my current thinking.

1018
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:51,563
So there is evidence that more 
disagreeable people are more likely to 

1019
00:55:55,441 --> 00:55:58,560
be successful as managers.
Now,

1020
00:55:58,561 --> 00:55:59,394
why?
Well Boudreau who wrote a paper called 

1021
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:04,530
effects of personality on executive 
career success,

1022
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:05,903
said the following,
agreeableness associates with being 

1023
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:10,350
trusting,
submissive and compliant,

1024
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:14,580
which could be perceived as naivete 
docility and a tendency to follow rather

1025
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:16,230
than lead.
All right,

1026
00:56:16,231 --> 00:56:20,640
so that's his opinion.
But then here's what he measured.

1027
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:25,210
So these are effects of five traits on 
career success.

1028
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:25,721
Now,
you know,

1029
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:28,480
career success can obviously be defined 
a number of ways.

1030
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,680
It could be career satisfaction or it 
could be like external markers of career

1031
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:33,620
success.
And,

1032
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:34,463
and they did both.
So we're going to look at direct cause 

1033
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:37,324
that's the external sort of objective 
markers weren't you see is that if 

1034
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:42,034
you're high in neuroticism,
that's not so good for how much money 

1035
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:47,290
you make.
There's a negative correlation of 0.3,

1036
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,930
which by the way,
that's a big correlation.

1037
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,633
So you know,
you'll hear people say that 0.5 is a 

1038
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:56,660
large correlation and 0.3 is moderate 
and you know,

1039
00:56:56,661 --> 00:57:01,661
point to a small and that's wrong.
And that that was clarified four or five

1040
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:04,020
years ago.
Um,

1041
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,520
I'll get the paper for you.
I can't remember.

1042
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:09,130
It was an American psychologist,
but the guy who wrote the paper,

1043
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:12,880
what he did was he looked at a whole 
bunch of social science studies and then

1044
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,360
calculated how frequently different 
effects sizes showed up.

1045
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:21,250
And what he found was that 0.5 was 
unbelievably large.

1046
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:22,503
You know what,
if that 5% of social science studies 

1047
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:26,524
ever got a correlation of 0.5,
it's like if you get a correlation of 

1048
00:57:28,781 --> 00:57:29,614
0.5 and your study,
you've either made a dramatic error or 

1049
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:35,740
you've replicated something that's 
already well known or you know you're in

1050
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:39,040
science because it never happens.
Point three,

1051
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,800
that's a pretty good correlation.
So,

1052
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:43,530
okay,

1053
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,363
so the fact that neuroticism is 
negatively correlated with how much 

1054
00:57:46,621 --> 00:57:49,060
money you make,
how likely you are to ascend,

1055
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:53,670
and then how close you are to being ceo.
Obviously the effects size decrease.

1056
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,410
So,
um,

1057
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,200
neuroticism is oss,
or sorry,

1058
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,423
extroversion is a reasonable predictor 
only of how much of your ascending and 

1059
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:06,810
it's pretty small.
Um,

1060
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:10,950
openness has a correlation with how much
money you make,

1061
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,490
but that's probably because openness is 
highly associated with intelligence.

1062
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,330
And so openness is not a good marker for
intelligence.

1063
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:21,450
Iq tests are much better markers.
So that's an attenuated relationship.

1064
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:22,830
But then you look at agreeableness,

1065
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:25,320
okay,

1066
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,920
it's negative 0.3,
two in total,

1067
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:29,783
put negative 0.2,
four for direct in terms of how much 

1068
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:32,550
money you make.
So you know,

1069
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,413
that's an interesting thing because one 
of the things that determines how much 

1070
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:39,750
money you make is how willing you are to
say no.

1071
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:43,360
Right?
Cause if you're negotiating with someone

1072
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,493
then

1073
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:49,350
the only thing you have at your back is 
your ability to say no and to push it or

1074
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:51,360
even to ask for a raise.
And you know,

1075
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,610
pushy people are much more likely to ask
for race.

1076
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,730
And of course those who ask for a raise 
are much more likely to get it.

1077
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:59,010
So the guys who were hard to get along 
with,

1078
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:00,990
because most of the people that were 
hard to get along with,

1079
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,120
our guys are more likely to be paid 
more.

1080
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,700
They're more likely do as sand the 
corporate ladder.

1081
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,060
They're more likely to be close to the 
CEO in terms of proximity.

1082
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,470
And,
uh,

1083
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:14,070
they're even more likely to be rated as 
employable.

1084
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,980
It's funny because you'd think that,
you know,

1085
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:19,290
if you're agreeable in easy to get along
with and all that,

1086
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:22,700
that people would be more to rate you as
a suitable employee.

1087
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:25,370
But that is right.
That's the opposite seems to happen.

1088
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:29,930
So you know,
in the agreeable guys are less satisfied

1089
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:34,931
with their jobs.
No,

1090
00:59:40,431 --> 00:59:41,264
sorry,
the agreeable people are less satisfied 

1091
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:44,240
with their jobs as well.
So,

1092
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,773
okay,
so now let's look at motivation 

1093
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:52,060
variables.
So the extroverts work more evenings.

1094
00:59:52,061 --> 00:59:53,020
The agreeable people,

1095
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,370
the uh,
agreeable people are less likely to,

1096
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:04,863
okay.

1097
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,193
So it's a funny thing too because 
disagreeable extroverts are narcissists 

1098
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:14,860
and there's some evidence that you can 
derive from this data.

1099
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,694
You don't,
cause there's always this talk about 

1100
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,633
disagreeable extroverts are narcissists 
being more likely to rise up to CEO 

1101
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:24,610
level.
And there is some evidence for that,

1102
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:28,300
at least in so far is agreeableness is a
negative predictor of doing such.

1103
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:30,933
All right.
So,

1104
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:31,883
so one of the things we've just found is
that one of the predictors for 

1105
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:39,700
ascendancy and proximity to a high 
status position is low.

1106
01:00:39,701 --> 01:00:41,560
Agreeableness.
Now,

1107
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,590
the next thing you might think about is,
well,

1108
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:47,380
what,
what role does that play in terms of the

1109
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:50,380
factors that men and women find 
attractive at each other?

1110
01:00:50,381 --> 01:00:52,150
So you might say,
well,

1111
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,390
what do you want in a mate?
If you're a woman,

1112
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:56,410
you might say,
well you know,

1113
01:00:56,411 --> 01:01:00,670
you want someone who's kind and loving 
and forgiving and empathic and those are

1114
01:01:00,671 --> 01:01:02,230
all good things.
But,

1115
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,513
but it isn't necessarily the case that 
the empirical studies show that that's 

1116
01:01:07,001 --> 01:01:09,340
what drives mate selection.
So we could look,

1117
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,520
this is an interesting study.
So it's a few years old,

1118
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:17,550
thousand French Canadian respondents,
433 males and 700 females.

1119
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:20,930
And so here are,
here are the variables.

1120
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,123
One is possession of resources.
It's a composite index composed of 

1121
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:28,760
occupational prestige,
income and education.

1122
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,990
And then the other variables,
acquisition of partners,

1123
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:33,853
sexual partners,
that is number of lifetime and 

1124
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:37,724
proceeding year sexual partners.
Lifetime occurrence of simultaneous 

1125
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:41,894
partners says yes or no variable and 
lifetime frequency of simultaneous 

1126
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:48,050
partners,
one to five with five being very often.

1127
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,360
Here's the assumption.
You can,

1128
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:54,850
you know,
decide for yourself if you think this is

1129
01:01:54,851 --> 01:01:57,010
a warranted assumption.
The number of partners,

1130
01:01:57,011 --> 01:01:57,844
a member of sex,
a acquires is taken as an index of how 

1131
01:02:00,881 --> 01:02:03,970
often this individual is chosen by sex 
b.

1132
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,030
So that's an indication of re 
reproductive fitness,

1133
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:07,893
desirability,
at least as assessed by members of the 

1134
01:02:09,491 --> 01:02:12,400
opposite sex,
who you would think would be the logical

1135
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:16,960
judges for that sort of thing.
Male criteria

1136
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,280
166 on attached

1137
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,030
women ages 25 to 50 correlation between 
fertility rates,

1138
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:24,864
a number of partners and previous year 
equals 0.94 males choose fertility 

1139
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,640
indicators,
beauty waist to hip ratio,

1140
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:36,270
youthful appearance,
and neotenous facial features.

1141
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,413
Neotenous means there's a tendency among
animals as they evolve to increasingly 

1142
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:47,670
look more in their adult stages,
like their juvenile forms.

1143
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:50,280
So here's,
here's an example.

1144
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,070
If you look at the skull of a baby 
chimpanzee,

1145
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,010
it looks almost exactly like the skull 
of an adult human.

1146
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:57,743
So what's happened is we've as adults,
we're more like baby chimpanzees then 

1147
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,380
than the adult chimpanzees are.
We've,

1148
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,393
we've,
we've maintained a lot of our juvenile 

1149
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:09,930
characteristics,
playfulness,

1150
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,700
you know,
the ability to continue to learn,

1151
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,410
plasticity,
all those things.

1152
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:14,573
Um,
there's a preference in our objective 

1153
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,013
beauty analysis,
say a facial features for men to prefer 

1154
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:24,690
more neotenous female faces.
So,

1155
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,540
and you can tell that if you look at 
pictures of models,

1156
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,820
they generally have relatively small 
noses,

1157
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:30,840
relatively big eyes.

1158
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:31,883
The sort of things that are associated 
with cute and cute actually is a pretty 

1159
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,380
pretty identifiable category.
Most of the things that people find cute

1160
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,273
have large eyes and relatively the rest 
of their facial features are relatively 

1161
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:47,100
small.
There's other things that are associated

1162
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:49,350
with cute that aren't necessarily 
associated with,

1163
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,673
you know,
sexual attractiveness cause cute things 

1164
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,960
also have sort of random movements like 
baby,

1165
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:57,390
like movements.
And so the things that people,

1166
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,543
you know,
relatively short arms and just think of 

1167
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:01,830
a teddy bear.
So anyways,

1168
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:04,230
those are the male,
those are the male criteria,

1169
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,423
female criteria,
all respondents correlation between 

1170
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:12,480
socioeconomic status and frequency of 
simultaneous partners.

1171
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:16,500
For men it was 0.49 that's a big 
correlation.

1172
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:21,000
For Women,
it was 0.04 that's a zero fundamentally.

1173
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,133
So the correlation between male 
socioeconomic status and frequency of 

1174
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:31,251
simultaneous partners is 0.5.
It's a huge effect for women at zero.

1175
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,330
And that's a big difference.
So,

1176
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,250
you know,
one of the things you might ask yourself

1177
01:04:35,251 --> 01:04:36,084
too,
I don't know if this is a reasonable 

1178
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,840
thing to ask or not,
but

1179
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:43,580
I've always thought that

1180
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,650
the hard people to explain,
or the people who are hyper achievers,

1181
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:51,860
you know the ones who are way out on the
Frito distribution and there aren't very

1182
01:04:51,861 --> 01:04:54,770
many of them and they're usually,
they're usually man,

1183
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,173
you know.
So if you look at the media num number 

1184
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:58,520
of publications,
for example,

1185
01:04:58,521 --> 01:05:00,830
that a female academic makes had a male 
academic,

1186
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:04,250
they're pretty much the same,
but the mean for men is higher.

1187
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:05,084
And that's all driven by a small subset 
of men who are way the hell out in the 

1188
01:05:07,641 --> 01:05:09,560
prieto distribution.
Now you might ask,

1189
01:05:09,561 --> 01:05:10,520
well,
why is that?

1190
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:12,230
Well,
it's simple.

1191
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,990
If you want to be way out on the prieto 
distribution,

1192
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:18,520
so you're in the top,
say 1% of performers or even one 10th of

1193
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:20,950
1% of performance,
what do you have to do?

1194
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,250
Well,
first having an Iq of like 145 or above,

1195
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:28,540
that's really helpful.
Then you should be insanely industrious.

1196
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:29,403
So maybe you'll work 90 hours a week or 
a hundred hours a week at nothing but 

1197
01:05:34,091 --> 01:05:34,924
your stupid occupation.
And maybe we'll do that for like 50 

1198
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:39,640
years.
And so if you do that while you're going

1199
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:43,540
to be in that top one in 1000 category,
well

1200
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,210
the issue isn't why there are so few 
women in that category.

1201
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:51,510
The issue is why are there any men at 
all in that category,

1202
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,650
right?
Cause it's,

1203
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:55,470
it's an insane lifestyle in many ways.
You know,

1204
01:05:55,471 --> 01:05:58,540
um,
it,

1205
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,760
it means that there isn't much left 
there for the rest of your life.

1206
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:04,400
You're hyper concentrating on a single 
thing.

1207
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,370
Now why would men do that?
Well,

1208
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,473
here's the hypothesis.
One of the things that drives the 

1209
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:12,824
probability that a woman will find a man
attractive enough to sleep with his his 

1210
01:06:16,251 --> 01:06:17,150
status.

1211
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:19,920
So then you can think,
well,

1212
01:06:19,921 --> 01:06:22,170
that's an extra motivational boost for 
men.

1213
01:06:22,171 --> 01:06:23,490
Now,
whether that's conscious,

1214
01:06:23,491 --> 01:06:26,670
motivational boost or not is not the 
point.

1215
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:28,110
The question is,
is it a,

1216
01:06:28,111 --> 01:06:28,944
is it a boost that might have been 
instantiated as an evolutionary element 

1217
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,340
of general motivation or men are more 
competitive,

1218
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:36,263
they're more disagreeable,
and if they're more disagreeable and 

1219
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:40,950
more competitive,
they seem to do better,

1220
01:06:40,951 --> 01:06:41,784
especially in high status jobs.
And then women are more likely to pick 

1221
01:06:45,181 --> 01:06:46,014
man like that for sexual partners.
So it's at some point it becomes 

1222
01:06:48,811 --> 01:06:53,811
difficult to avoid the conclusion,
especially since we know that the man on

1223
01:06:54,751 --> 01:06:55,584
the way out on the tail end of the 
prieto distribution are 

1224
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:01,830
disproportionately likely to sleep with 
many women.

1225
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:07,770
So Warren Beatty,
I think 15,000 that was his estimate,

1226
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,440
15,000 women.
And uh,

1227
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:15,030
Kareem Abdul Jabbar,
the basketball player,

1228
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:18,230
he figured 10,000 so,
and so for the,

1229
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,140
for every one guy who's got those 
numbers racked up,

1230
01:07:22,141 --> 01:07:22,974
that's 10,000 guys who don't.
So the male success distribution is 

1231
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:29,573
extreme and it's associated with outlier
success in some important dimension of 

1232
01:07:37,851 --> 01:07:38,684
socioeconomic economic success.
And then female rep productive 

1233
01:07:44,391 --> 01:07:48,470
opportunity is not.
So,

1234
01:07:48,471 --> 01:07:51,020
you know,
is that relevant?

1235
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:52,371
Well,
you know,

1236
01:07:52,371 --> 01:07:55,370
it depends on how you think.
It's hard for me to see that it can't be

1237
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:59,000
relevant.
So questions if the question,

1238
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:03,680
the higher the job,
like the higher status,

1239
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,940
the more partners they have.
Oh Yup,

1240
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:08,170
Yup.

1241
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:09,670
Slowly and then,
but this,

1242
01:08:09,671 --> 01:08:13,210
this is a single study,
but this data is Coleman.

1243
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:14,323
Now there's,
there's some interesting correlates of 

1244
01:08:16,281 --> 01:08:17,750
this.
So for example,

1245
01:08:17,751 --> 01:08:18,584
you might say,
why are males much more likely to be to 

1246
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:24,134
engage in homicide?
And Daly and Wilson figured this out a 

1247
01:08:27,391 --> 01:08:29,870
long while back.
And what they showed was very,

1248
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:32,780
very cool study.
They took

1249
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:37,460
the level of income inequality in each 
county,

1250
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:38,294
in the u s and in Canada.
And then they correlated that with the 

1251
01:08:40,911 --> 01:08:41,744
homicide rate.
And what they found was that the higher 

1252
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:46,880
the rate of inequality,
so the more people at the bottom and the

1253
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:51,460
fewer people at the top,
the higher than male homicide rate.

1254
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,500
And the correlation was

1255
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,080
okay

1256
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,410
0.8 something like that.
Point eight five it was like,

1257
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,813
it's the whole reason.
So what happens is that when the 

1258
01:09:02,581 --> 01:09:07,581
competition between men gets intense 
because hardly anyone can win than males

1259
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:09,750
start to kill each other.

1260
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,530
Okay.

1261
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:12,363
Now daily,
also Martin and daily also tried to 

1262
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:15,904
figure it out if that was a good idea.
So they studied Chicago and what they 

1263
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:19,534
found was,
well most male and male homicides are 

1264
01:09:21,911 --> 01:09:22,744
young man and a lot of them there within
race and they're often in dominance 

1265
01:09:26,921 --> 01:09:27,940
disputes.
It's like,

1266
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:30,550
you know,
maybe it's a gang thing and it's like,

1267
01:09:30,551 --> 01:09:31,384
well you shoot me or I'll shoot you.
It's like who's victim and who's 

1268
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:37,030
perpetrator is not that obvious.
So what happens in Chicago?

1269
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:38,590
Well typically

1270
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,310
the charge is plea bargain down to self 
defense.

1271
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:48,350
Then no one's willing to testify against
the guide because well after all he just

1272
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:51,800
shot someone and then he's in prison for
two years cause that's the,

1273
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,740
that's the sentence.
And then he's out in 18 months.

1274
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:55,574
If he behaves reasonably well.
So then he's killed someone and he's 

1275
01:09:58,371 --> 01:10:00,380
back on the street.
And guess what,

1276
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:01,783
his status has increased substantially.
So you can think about it as a socio 

1277
01:10:06,071 --> 01:10:06,904
economic slash sexual decision.
And we also know that as economic 

1278
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:16,220
disparity grows,
the social stability decreases.

1279
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:17,263
And the reason for that seems to be,
well mostly it seems to be male on male 

1280
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:21,440
aggression.
And so what I,

1281
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:22,303
what I think probably happens is that
if there's a fair bit of chance for men 

1282
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:27,914
to climb the ladder,
then only the most disagreeable of them 

1283
01:10:30,921 --> 01:10:31,754
become violent.
But as you crank down on the 

1284
01:10:33,861 --> 01:10:36,860
opportunities so that the competition 
gets more and more intense,

1285
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,143
the level of disagreeableness that it 
takes in order to catalyze aggression 

1286
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,393
starts the level of disagreeableness 
that it takes to catalyze aggression 

1287
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:47,294
starts to decrease until if it gets so 
intense that there's no possibility for 

1288
01:10:50,901 --> 01:10:53,330
status,
then the whole bloody society's going to

1289
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:56,120
flip over because the guys at the bottom
who are like,

1290
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:56,954
all the guys are going to decide that 
this is a stupid game and they'd rather 

1291
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:03,950
flip the board over and you know,
set the markers to zero and see how they

1292
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:05,300
come up in the new society.

1293
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:06,703
So it's possible that
one of the things that motivates 

1294
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:18,120
revolutions in human society is 
excessive inequality.

1295
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:18,983
And the reason that that's a problem is 
because it's so tightly linked to male 

1296
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:24,990
reproductive opportunity.
So,

1297
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:28,040
okay,

1298
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,873
look at age 30 to 39 correlation between
socioeconomic status and frequency of 

1299
01:11:33,411 --> 01:11:35,120
simultaneous partners.
For Man,

1300
01:11:35,121 --> 01:11:38,810
the correlations 0.92 it's very small 
land for women,

1301
01:11:38,811 --> 01:11:43,130
it was 0.11 it's difference between 
perfect and zero.

1302
01:11:43,131 --> 01:11:43,964
Fundamentally,
female criteria might reflect the 

1303
01:11:47,421 --> 01:11:50,600
tendency on the part of females to 
choose high status partners during their

1304
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:51,434
own peak reproductive years.
This might account for the especially 

1305
01:11:54,051 --> 01:11:54,884
strong relationship found in men age 30 
to 39 women who typically prefer men 

1306
01:11:59,631 --> 01:12:00,464
three to eight years older than they are
would then be in their mid to late 

1307
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:04,603
twenties a time when fecundability.
And that sensitivity to male resources 

1308
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,203
is at its peak.
Evolutionary related hypotheses about 

1309
01:12:13,401 --> 01:12:14,234
gender differences and mate selection 
preferences were derived from Trevor's 

1310
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:18,283
Parental Investment Model,
which contends that women are more 

1311
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:21,674
likely than men to seek a mate who 
possesses nonphysical characteristics 

1312
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:25,784
that maximize the survival or 
reproductive prospects of their 

1313
01:12:28,281 --> 01:12:29,450
offspring.
Offspring

1314
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:32,050
as predicted.
Women.

1315
01:12:32,051 --> 01:12:35,260
Oh square accorded more weight than men 
to socioeconomic status.

1316
01:12:35,261 --> 01:12:37,990
Ambitiousness character and 
intelligence.

1317
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:39,243
And the largest gender differences were 
observed for cues to resource 

1318
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:45,490
acquisition status and ambitiousness as 
predicted,

1319
01:12:45,491 --> 01:12:46,324
gender differences were not found in 
preferences for characteristics 

1320
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:53,590
unrelated to progeny survival,
sense of humor or personality

1321
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:57,583
when valid comparisons could be made.
The findings were generally invariant 

1322
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,440
across generations,
cultures and research paradigms.

1323
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:06,583
So

1324
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:14,140
any questions?
What do you think about that?

1325
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,153
You know,
it's,

1326
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,740
it's harder stuff as far as I can tell.

1327
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,030
Does that,
because the character,

1328
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:27,050
what we did a study that unfortunately I
never published,

1329
01:13:27,051 --> 01:13:28,340
we showed women,
I thought,

1330
01:13:28,341 --> 01:13:30,980
no,
women aren't after resources.

1331
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,350
That's wrong.
Thereafter,

1332
01:13:33,351 --> 01:13:34,184
the factors that predict resources.
So what we did was we showed women a 

1333
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:41,120
bunch of pictures.
It was this say,

1334
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,043
say several pictures of the same guy.
So there was several guys and each guy 

1335
01:13:46,851 --> 01:13:47,684
was in four conditions.
The photo of each guy was in four 

1336
01:13:49,401 --> 01:13:50,450
conditions.
Same photo,

1337
01:13:50,451 --> 01:13:54,230
right?
So one guy was poor and stupid,

1338
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,000
pouring,
useless.

1339
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,433
One guy was rich and useless.
One guy was rich and useful and one guy 

1340
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:04,310
was poor and useful.
So the rich,

1341
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:05,203
useless guy had won the lottery and it 
paid out like $4,000 a month for the 

1342
01:14:08,571 --> 01:14:10,790
rest of his life.
So no matter how useless he was,

1343
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:13,150
he couldn't all of it.
He had resources,

1344
01:14:13,151 --> 01:14:14,230
right?
The poor,

1345
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:16,780
useless guy.
Well we don't even have to define that.

1346
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:19,960
Everybody understands that the rich 
useful guy.

1347
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:20,794
Well that's easy to understand.
The poor useful guy worked for 

1348
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:24,550
nongovernmental agency.
It was a charity,

1349
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:26,140
you know,
in a charitable organization.

1350
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:26,974
And so he was,
he had high occupational status but low 

1351
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:33,910
income and that wasn't likely to change.
So then we asked women to rate these men

1352
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:34,783
on a bunch of different attributes 
including personality but also on data 

1353
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:39,394
ability basically and also on 
probability of considering a longterm 

1354
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:45,940
relationship with someone like this.
And what else had no main effect?

1355
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,150
The only effect was usefulness.
So the poor,

1356
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,030
useful guy and the rich useful guy where
attractive,

1357
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,133
more attractive to the women.
Then the two useless guys regardless of 

1358
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:58,410
their socioeconomic status and the women
judged.

1359
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:02,800
The useful guys is higher in openness 
and conscientiousness,

1360
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:03,634
which was pretty smart because openness 
is basically intelligence and 

1361
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:06,634
conscientiousness is hard work and those
are the best predictor of socioeconomic 

1362
01:15:09,851 --> 01:15:11,470
success.
So yay women.

1363
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,620
Good work.
Any other questions?

1364
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:19,403
Yeah,

1365
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,940
no,
it's not exactly appearance.

1366
01:15:21,941 --> 01:15:25,900
It's more like signs of health and 
that's associated.

1367
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:27,663
It isn't even that
the things that have made women 

1368
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:32,223
attracted to men across time are the 
things that are associated with health 

1369
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,230
and therefore reproductive capacity.
So for example,

1370
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,460
waist to hip ratio was a marker 0.68 
seems to be about ideal.

1371
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,560
Why?
Well,

1372
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:49,190
it turns out that women who have a lower
higher,

1373
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:52,660
huh.
I can't figure it out at the moment.

1374
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:57,910
More waste than hips.
Arma are more likely to die.

1375
01:15:57,911 --> 01:15:59,860
For example,
of cardiovascular disease.

1376
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,650
It's an unhealthy distribution of body 
fat for women.

1377
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,340
And so that seems to be a negative 
fitness marker.

1378
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:10,600
And then symmetry for example.
I mean women like symmetrical men too,

1379
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:15,560
don't get me wrong,
but man are more attracted say to,

1380
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,980
to physical health than women.
Um,

1381
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:21,663
what are the markers for physical health
is also symmetry and that's associated 

1382
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:26,890
with beauty.
Clear skin.

1383
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:29,650
All these things are associated with 
health and youthfulness.

1384
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,150
Yeah.
And that's,

1385
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,690
that's pretty much that.

1386
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,160
What about like,

1387
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,193
that's a good question.
I had actually had a paper that I was 

1388
01:16:44,301 --> 01:16:48,320
looking at that this morning,
but I didn't have enough time to include

1389
01:16:48,321 --> 01:16:49,154
it.
So I don't know exactly what the 

1390
01:16:50,091 --> 01:16:53,000
predictors there are.
What do you think?

1391
01:16:53,001 --> 01:16:53,834
They'd be

1392
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:03,970
evolutionary,
whatever,

1393
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,160
male characteristics

1394
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,561
you'd think so.
Yeah,

1395
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:09,980
that's right.

1396
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,580
Well,
that would be,

1397
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,410
that would be a very useful thing to 
look up.

1398
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:16,220
Yeah.

1399
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,120
Attractiveness.

1400
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,073
Yeah.

1401
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,190
Hard to say,
but hard to say.

1402
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:27,280
But a quick glance at popular culture 
would suggest so.

1403
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:32,150
So,
okay,

1404
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,710
we'll see you next Tuesday.
