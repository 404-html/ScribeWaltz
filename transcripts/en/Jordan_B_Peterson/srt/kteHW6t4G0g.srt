1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,540
I'm here today with Ben Shapiro,
about eight months ago,

2
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,590
wave came up to Toronto,
would gave a rousing talk and uh,

3
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,740
talk about political correctness at that
point,

4
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,010
credit,
politically pointed political talk and 

5
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,010
how you got a couple of questions for 
you.

6
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,590
One is what,
what,

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,380
what,
what are you planning to do in 2018?

8
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:39,140
What do you want to see happen in 2018 
personally?

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,620
And then what?
Like,

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,160
so what are you aiming at?
Why?

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,730
So I mean obviously I'm aiming it at 
broadening the reach of the political 

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,860
messages that I espouse and the messages
of,

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,960
of I think,
personal responsibility in virtue that 

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:54,960
I,
that I tried to espouse.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,670
I'm also working on a book that I'm 
really interested in right now about the

16
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:02,671
roots of Western civilization.
What is that makes for a happier and 

17
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:06,691
more fulfilled Western civilization?
What generates purpose for civilization 

18
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,111
and for individuals and why it is that 
we seem to have lost purpose because my 

19
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,081
general theory is that the reason that 
we're trying to murder each other 

20
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,470
politically and the reason that we hate 
each other so much is that there is a 

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,400
purpose shaped hole in our heart that we
are now filling with anger,

22
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,200
tribal anger at each other.
Uh,

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,400
and I'm trying to trace back,
kind of backtrack and say,

24
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:22,000
okay,
where did,

25
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:23,110
where did we go wrong?
Where,

26
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,190
where was purpose?
It's sort of,

27
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:25,720
it's,
it's high watermark.

28
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:26,960
And why are we now at Loeb?

29
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,870
Okay.
One of the things that I found in the 

30
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,040
discussions that I've had over the last 
year,

31
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:36,000
especially the public discussions,
public lectures,

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,010
let's say,
is that it seems perfectly possible to 

33
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,451
make a room go silent by speaking to,
especially if it's a room full of young 

34
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:47,080
men by speaking to them about 
responsibility of truth.

35
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,590
And this is really staggered me because 
those are obviously saleable messages 

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,300
now,
especially for someone who's rather 

37
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,300
cynical about the fundamental nature of 
human beings.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,940
I'm not saying that I am,
but if you,

39
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,690
if you launched a business plan to the 
typical observers and said,

40
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:09,691
well,
I'm going to base up public movement on 

41
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:14,640
the adoption of access,
responsibility and the requirement to 

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,731
speak the truth,
and that's going to become hyper 

43
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:19,831
popular.
The probability that people would agree 

44
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,230
that that's a possibility.
It's pretty much zero.

45
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,920
And so I've been thinking that we've 
spoken about rights for so long and 

46
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:29,710
spoken about freedoms for so long,
let's say since the early sixties,

47
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,130
just essentially speaking,
we've actually left a conceptual whole 

48
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,930
inner culture and that seems to be akin 
to,

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,410
to the point that you're making with 
regards to this book and now you,

50
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,450
you,
you mentioned responsibility and why 

51
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:46,450
that specifically?

52
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,750
Well,
I think that what you're talking about 

53
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:50,750
is exactly right.
People in the West have seemed to pose,

54
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,790
writes in,
in direct opposition to duties.

55
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,580
So,
uh,

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,460
the American founding particularly was 
obsessed with this idea of,

57
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,510
of rights and individual rights,
but there was also this corresponding 

58
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:02,740
idea of duties that's very clear in 
founding thinking.

59
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,500
George Washington talks about duty.
Benjamin Franklin talks about duty.

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,500
The idea was that duty was to be 
socially generated,

61
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,550
not by government,
but by,

62
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,430
by society itself,
like small communities,

63
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:13,840
by churches,
by your family,

64
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,080
and that that would fill the gap that 
allowed you to actually have a 

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,140
functioning society of rights,
but we seem to have left duty completely

66
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:25,141
behind now.
It's just all about the right to not 

67
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,881
about the duty and what's happened is 
that that's collapsed in on itself 

68
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:30,301
because the society of only right to 
know duties ends up generating raw 

69
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,630
generating duties masquerading as 
rights,

70
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:31,780
right?

71
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,270
Positive rights that are actually not 
right at all.

72
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,660
There are me imposing a duty on you in 
order to further my own perception of my

73
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:42,661
rights.
And that's I think where we've been 

74
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:44,701
going and it's in.
It's a dark place and it creates an 

75
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:45,370
enormous amount of opposition.
But when you say Jordan,

76
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:48,130
when you,
when you talk about the fact that people

77
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,160
would not have thought of building a 
movement on notions of truth and 

78
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,501
responsibility,
that's because I think for a long time 

79
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:55,750
people just took it for granted that we 
all agreed on these things.

80
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,010
Um,
but there's been an actual forcible 

81
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,620
counter movement for generations now 
against both truth and responsibility.

82
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:04,210
The idea that there is no objective 
truth,

83
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,210
it's socially defined.
We can make it up as we go along.

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,660
There's no t los rev.
I talk a lot in the new book about,

85
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:12,460
about a teleological way of thinking.

86
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,460
This idea that you actually have a 
purpose for which you were created and 

87
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,211
that it's your job to fulfill that 
purpose and that's completely been left 

88
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:21,211
by the wayside.
So there's no truth,

89
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,300
there is no capacity.
Even write the scientific materialist 

90
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,930
worldview actually robs you have the 
capacity to even change yourself.

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,990
Right?
The studies that I've seen suggests that

92
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:30,910
if you believe in a certain form of 
determinism,

93
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:35,911
if you believe in hard determinism,
you're less likely to go out and 

94
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,431
actually change your life and make it 
better because you buy into your own 

95
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:41,041
philosophy.
And I think that as a side sort of 

96
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,291
bought into that,
that we're all victims of our own 

97
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,911
biology.
Victims of own raise victims were on 

98
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:44,911
ethnicity or our situation and there's 
no way for us to get out of that.

99
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:49,831
So we may as well throw up our hands or 
at least give the power to the only 

100
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:49,831
thing that can change things,
which is this,

101
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,440
which is this massive collective that 
comes in and is the boot stomping on the

102
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,220
human face forever.

103
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,710
Well,
there's also the strange misapprehension

104
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:59,690
I think with regards to the nature of 
rights,

105
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:04,691
because as far as I can tell,
I mean rights rights are a multifaceted 

106
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:10,070
phenomenon,
but I think the least metaphysical claim

107
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:13,150
that you can make about rights is that 
if I have a right,

108
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,250
then that brings with it a parallel 
responsibility,

109
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,260
not only to myself to act in a manner 
that is in accordance with that,

110
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:22,520
right,
whatever that happens to be,

111
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:27,521
but I also have a responsibility.
Is the right is universal to act in a 

112
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:32,051
certain manner towards you.
And so because there is no difference 

113
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:35,690
between rights and responsibilities,
fundamentally they're just mirror images

114
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:40,691
of one another.
Now that that's to say nothing about 

115
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,000
their potential metaphysical orange and 
I don't want to talk about that,

116
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:46,001
but it doesn't seem to me to be 
logically 10 bubbles have an incident 

117
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:50,291
conversation about rights without having
a parallel conversation about 

118
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:50,291
responsibility.

119
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,350
So there's a logical flow and that 
leaves that gap that needs to be filled.

120
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,630
And then the other thing that's occurred
to me is that the,

121
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,890
the genuine meaning in lights,
and I do believe that likes has a 

122
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,300
genuine meaning.
I think I can make that claim without 

123
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,001
even making it metaphysical,
although I don't mind the metaphysical 

124
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:10,640
addition to it.
Um,

125
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,210
it seems to me that almost all the 
things that people find meaningful in 

126
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,160
life that aren't merely impulsive 
pleasure,

127
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,580
which of course create thrown 
entanglements,

128
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,700
have to do with the voluntary adoption 
of responsibility.

129
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,150
So families like that.
Okay.

130
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,170
So,
all right,

131
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:28,430
so then,
okay,

132
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,380
so here's,
here's the next question.

133
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,290
What do you think it is?
It's driven our loss and of that half of

134
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,240
the conversation,
what's happened?

135
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,230
So I,
I think that this has been basically a 

136
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,230
200 year movement that first manifested 
itself in Europe.

137
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,190
And it's finally reaching American 
shores about 100 years later,

138
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:51,191
which seems to be the pattern.
All the bad stuff from Europe hits 

139
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:52,040
Europe about 50 to 100 years before it 
hits here and now it comes here.

140
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,910
I think that what happened here is that 
the enlightenment mentality was built on

141
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,340
certain fundamental premises,
including the use of human reason,

142
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:02,900
the capacity for free will and all of 
that in turn rested on assumptions about

143
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,060
the universe,
including the idea that the universe has

144
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:10,061
a discoverable design that we can 
actually find and pursue and that in 

145
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:11,060
doing so,
we will find happiness.

146
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:16,061
The Aristotelian idea of happiness is 
very much bound up with the idea of you 

147
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,800
fulfilling your lowe's.
The Judeo Christian idea of happiness is

148
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,420
you fulfilling God's purpose for you.

149
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,850
There was always this idea of a higher 
purpose that you were seeking.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,100
And I think what happened is that the,
the,

151
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,130
the enlightenment project,
which started off in an attempt really 

152
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,290
in the 13th century by people like 
Aquinas,

153
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:35,291
my monities to unite religion and 
science fell apart when they started to 

154
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:35,800
divide the two.
Instead of it's we're,

155
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,830
we're seeking the same thing.
Religion and science are both seeking a 

156
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,110
universal truths that can be applicable 
to our own lives and make us more 

157
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,380
fulfilled.
The project of science became to destroy

158
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,290
one pole to destroy religion,
and then by doing that,

159
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,840
science almost turned in on itself.
Reason almost eight itself.

160
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:53,000
So I think reason basically turned into,
okay,

161
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,550
we're going to follow to the logical end
point.

162
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,840
All of the,
all the nonreligious bases of,

163
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,010
of human thought.
And once you do that,

164
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,610
it's very difficult not to fall into a.

165
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,760
So a sort of self refuting trap about 
human thought.

166
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,820
You're just a set of neurons that are 
firing neurons don't have 

167
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:12,830
responsibility.
Your dog doesn't have responsibility.

168
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:14,230
Do you have responsibility?
Uh,

169
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,880
you are a product of your environment,
your biology.

170
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,400
Does that carry with it?
Any sort of moral responsibility,

171
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:21,800
you don't have the capacity to choose if
you don't have the capacity to choose.

172
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:26,801
How do you have moral responsibility?
I debated Sam Harris on particularly 

173
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,010
this issue and I thought that actually 
the most telling point of the debate and

174
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:31,190
discussion was not anything the two of 
us said it was a woman who got up at the

175
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,020
very end instead of Sam.
I totally agree with you.

176
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:36,280
There's no free will in the hard sense.
You can't make any sense you.

177
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,480
There is no choice other than to write 
you.

178
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:41,180
You will have to do this just driven by 
your biology and environment.

179
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,020
But I have a five year old son.
What do you want and what,

180
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,100
what should I say to him?
And Sam basically said,

181
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:48,230
lie basically said,
well,

182
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:50,210
tell him that he's capable of making a 
choice.

183
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,240
And that's the truth about civilization.
Either you believe that's a lie and 

184
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,910
you're actively engaging in Plato's good
lie basically,

185
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,690
or your or you have to believe in free 
will.

186
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,270
And I don't think,
I don't think the capacity to choose and

187
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,980
the capacity to self better,
uh,

188
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:05,940
is,
is a lie.

189
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,950
I think that people do have the capacity
to do that.

190
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:10,830
I think even Sam believes that,
but he refuses to acknowledge it because

191
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:14,070
otherwise I don't think he would be in 
the educational position that he is.

192
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:19,071
Right.
He spends his life trying to educate 

193
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:19,071
people so that that's.
It's all weird.

194
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:19,071
I mean,
I actually said in the,

195
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:20,550
in the discussion,
why are we all in this auditorium?

196
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:25,551
We were just sort of predestined by the 
universe to be in this auditorium at a 

197
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:25,551
certain time.
Like,

198
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:26,880
do you feel fulfilled by that?
If so,

199
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:28,110
you really have no choice in the matter.

200
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,210
Well,
one of the things that bothered me about

201
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:34,720
the new atheist types and the hyper 
rationalist is that there,

202
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,480
as far as I can tell their conduct is 
performative contradiction.

203
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,190
They say they believe certain things,
but they don't act that way.

204
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,960
And,
and in my sense,

205
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:48,550
because I'm an existentialist at heart,
is that what you believe is what you act

206
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:51,070
out,
what you say might be in accordance with

207
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:52,750
that and it might not,
but,

208
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,720
but,
and,

209
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:57,280
and there's no reason to assume that 
your beliefs are transparent to yourself

210
00:09:57,281 --> 00:10:02,281
regardless of your plate.
And so I also don't see any evidence 

211
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:06,871
whatsoever that the society can exist 
that functions over any reasonable 

212
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:11,610
period of time,
in any reasonable manner without 

213
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,670
predicating itself on the beliefs that 
people are both capable of freewill am,

214
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,680
that they're responsible.
And so the fact that it seems to be 

215
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,951
impossible to build a functioning 
society or even functioning dyadic 

216
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:27,511
relationships for that matter in the 
absence of the presupposition of free 

217
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:31,761
will and the capacity for voluntary 
change indicates to me some evidence for

218
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,820
the existence of those capacities.

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,290
And you have to be a staggeringly 
cynical person to think that no,

220
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,300
we just have to believe that that's true
even though it's a lie and predicate or 

221
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,360
cultures or not.
I mean that's first of all I know,

222
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,580
I think it's a weak claim.
I don't think that it's also not the 

223
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,940
rock upon which you want to fall into 
your culture.

224
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,720
So one of the things that struck me 
about the mythological stories that 

225
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,500
aren't immersed myself in is that 
there's always three.

226
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,930
There's always three prime characters in
it.

227
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:04,360
Ms Dot logical story.
There's culture,

228
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,070
right?
So that's the great father,

229
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:08,800
let's say.
And many mythological guises and there's

230
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:13,830
nature that's the great mother and so 
you can say that that's the biology and 

231
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,451
society of the modern scientist,
but then there's the independent 

232
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:21,580
individual as a causal force who has a 
nature that enables,

233
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,610
enables choice and free will in all of 
those things.

234
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:29,611
And that that independent third factor 
is something like the logos that gives 

235
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,180
rise to being at the beginning of time,
right?

236
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:34,180
The cast that calls order fourth out of 
chaos.

237
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,960
And the fact that we can't account for 
that scientifically.

238
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
Although I don't think we can deny it 
either,

239
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,980
doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.

240
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,440
Yeah,
I totally agree with that.

241
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:49,441
And of course I enjoy maps of meaning.
So I'm pretty familiar with the 

242
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:49,570
terminology that you use because I've 
read your book,

243
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,870
but I think that there's this idea that 
you can find meaning in a meaningless 

244
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,581
universe that we're just meatballs 
wandering through space with a little 

245
00:11:59,581 --> 00:11:59,581
bit of sentience.
Uh,

246
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:01,090
understanding that where our meatballs 
wandering through space,

247
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:06,091
I have a hard time building any sort of 
system on that and the refusal of the 

248
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,500
new atheist to even recognize that the 
morality that they promulgated right,

249
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:13,501
the trip that they have on religion 
typically is that religion is barbaric 

250
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,410
and backwards and promulgates all sorts 
of horrible moral values that with which

251
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:19,411
they disagree and what they refuse to 
acknowledge that their moral values are 

252
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:20,460
predicated within that system,
right?

253
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,710
For the vast majority of human time,
the values that they are espousing or 

254
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:25,710
not,
not only not universal,

255
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,200
they're not even minority valleys.

256
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,720
They didn't exist for the vast majority 
of human time.

257
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,250
They are absolute creations of the Judeo
Christian system that is combined with a

258
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:38,251
Greek reason to come up with what we 
have today and this is essentially the 

259
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:42,871
theory that I have come up with is that,
and this is the thesis of the book that 

260
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:46,321
I'm writing right now,
which is that in order for an in order 

261
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:46,840
for society or an individual to feel 
fulfilled,

262
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,300
you basically have to have four things.
You have to have an individual purpose.

263
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,190
You have to feel like you have a purpose
in the world.

264
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,750
You personally have a purpose in the 
world.

265
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,730
You have to feel like you have an 
individual capacity.

266
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,990
You have to feel like you are capable of
pursuing that with alacrity.

267
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,500
Uh,
you have to have a communal purpose.

268
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:02,560
You have to feel like you alone with 
others are pursuing a higher goal.

269
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,810
That means something and you have to 
have communal capacity.

270
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:09,811
So a system that has been built that 
allows that community to activate when 

271
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:13,111
it needs to activate and back off so 
that the individual can exist in that 

272
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:16,381
vacuum and we have torn away at all the 
roots of those things because all of 

273
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,420
those things that I think the apotheosis
of the.

274
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I think the apex of modern thought was 
basically the unfulfilled but universal 

275
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,080
theories of the American founding 
fathers,

276
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:29,020
I think is about as good as it got a 
internal governmental theory.

277
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,670
I don't think it's gotten better since 
then.

278
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,290
I think that it's been extended more 
broadly.

279
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:37,291
I think the universalism that they were 
implying has now been applied in many 

280
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:37,291
ways and that's a great thing.
Right.

281
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,610
Did the founders obviously still held 
slaves?

282
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,640
Many of them,
but they're,

283
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,970
their principals were not in favor of 
slavery.

284
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,130
Uh,
so the principles that they espoused 

285
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,130
were based on,
again,

286
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,480
these two competing poles that are,
that are constantly intention with one 

287
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,721
another and this sort of Leo Strauss he 
intention with one another between 

288
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:58,500
reason and revelation,
the Judeo Christian tradition and the 

289
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,460
Greek tradition of reason and the tug 
and back and forth is what allows you to

290
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,920
have one foot in rights and one foot in 
duties.

291
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,700
So we really good to have a lengthy 
conversation about this at some point 

292
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,340
because there's some things in here that
really have to be delving deeply like 

293
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,750
the day you have to find your own 
purpose.

294
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:20,751
Argument was one that was put forth 
third stroke and after he announced the 

295
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:22,620
death of God,
he said that people would have to resale

296
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:27,621
you good and evil and to come up with 
their own definitions of what 

297
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:28,680
constituted morality.
And like the Nietzschean criticism of,

298
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,850
of Christianity is about as deep as it 
got with the possible exception of 

299
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,890
Dostoevsky.
But there's,

300
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,080
one of the things I really liked about 
Carl Young,

301
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,920
and it's really struck me as,
as is irrefutable,

302
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,580
is use fundamental response to nature,
was that,

303
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,040
well,
um,

304
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,450
let's,
let's take the argument of the death of 

305
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,661
God to its logical conclusion.
And then let's the idea that human 

306
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:55,700
beings have to be the creator of the 
creators of their own systems,

307
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:56,240
of meaning.

308
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,180
You idea.
And this was also the case for the other

309
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,500
side,
psychoanalyst Swiss.

310
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,740
That's just palpably false because it 
turns out that you're not the sort of 

311
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,640
creature that can create your own 
meaning.

312
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,910
You're the sort of creature that has to 
discover the meaning that already exists

313
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,120
in coded within you.
And part of that is that you're not your

314
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,390
own slaves.
And so,

315
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:18,950
so it's a critique not only of the idea 
that you can,

316
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:23,951
will your own destiny in its entirety 
while completely ignoring the fact that 

317
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:25,760
you have in nature,
but it's also a profound critique of the

318
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:30,761
socialist Utopian ideas that human 
beings can be mold in any way that they 

319
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:34,571
see fit.
And so young subjection was something 

320
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:34,571
like,
well,

321
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:37,220
try to generate a meeting on your own,
out of nothing,

322
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,630
and then try to force yourself to follow
it and see how far you get.

323
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,260
What you'll find is that you rebelled 
your own nature,

324
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:50,261
rebels in every possible way against the
arbitrary imposition of a certain of 

325
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:55,240
just any old moral framework on the 
manner in which you're going to conduct 

326
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,240
yourself.
And so

327
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,650
yeah,
I think this is potentially it's,

328
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,170
it's such a deep critique and I think 
that it's.

329
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,180
It's so telling because what we've come 
up with is that the substitute for what 

330
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,620
you're talking about,
which is this acknowledgement that there

331
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:08,190
is a universal purpose,
that we ought to be aspiring to discover

332
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,350
that it's actually out there.
There's a purpose out there and it's our

333
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:12,970
job to uncover it as opposed to self 
creating it.

334
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,320
That that is a really deep divide in in 
America.

335
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:19,020
I think in the West generally because 
what people have said is,

336
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,500
well,
okay,

337
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,630
we finally realized that we do need this
thing called purpose,

338
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:22,620
right?
We can't just be a hedonist,

339
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,360
solve the time,
drugs and sex aren't going to cut it.

340
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:27,630
We're actually going to need to come up 
with some purpose for Hydrus,

341
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,420
right,
but well,

342
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,960
but we're not going to be able to,
but but at the same time,

343
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:35,550
we don't want a government or a society 
or a church or a community forcing down.

344
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,500
It's universal perception of values on 
us and so therefore are our happy medium

345
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,750
is going to be you define your own,
your own freedom.

346
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,400
You define your own,
your own rights,

347
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,440
and you define your own view of the 
universe.

348
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:51,650
Well,
that is always going to just devolve 

349
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,741
into this pathetic sort of solipsism 
that can never be escaped from and it 

350
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:59,291
doesn't provide happiness anyway.
I mean the people who quote unquote 

351
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,791
define their own meaning are some of the
least happy people that you will ever 

352
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,300
meet because they don't believe that 
their incontinence with anything larger.

353
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,830
If you're.
If you're looking into your self,

354
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,600
your self is not that big.
There's not that much there,

355
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,430
right?
There has to be something beyond you.

356
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Whether you find it in God or whether 
you find it in in a community or a 

357
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:13,650
nature,
there has to be something that speaks to

358
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:17,190
you beyond the guts that exist inside 
you where you're just examining your own

359
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:17,700
intestines

360
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,480
to that you can make a strong scientific
case.

361
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,390
This is something I'd never gone to in 
my discussions with Sam Harris,

362
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:29,391
is you could make a strong scientific 
case for the reality of meaning as an as

363
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,890
an for.
Let's just call it for the reality of 

364
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,451
meetings.
You might think about it as a 

365
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:40,191
psychological reality,
but you can think about it as a 

366
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:42,510
metaphysical or a biological reality too
because as far as I can tell and there's

367
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:47,511
good neurological evidence for this.
Your brain is adapted to two modes of 

368
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:51,891
being and one mode of being is that mode
that obtains when you're where you know 

369
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:54,600
what you're doing and you know what's 
going on so you could call that explored

370
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:59,601
territory that's safe and there's 
another motive being that is that which 

371
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:01,920
obtains and when you don't know what's 
going on.

372
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:03,810
When you're an unexplored territory,
you can say,

373
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,760
well,
animals since the beginning of time have

374
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:10,761
adapted to some combination of explored 
an unexplored territory and that's 

375
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:13,900
roughly a kid to known and not known,
which I think is what symbolized in knee

376
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:16,440
and Yang symbols and as far as I can 
tell,

377
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,890
the sense of meaning that people 
experience that spontaneous and deep is 

378
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:24,180
an indication that they're functioning 
well,

379
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:29,181
unexplored territory,
but simultaneously increasing their 

380
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:32,481
capacity to deal with unexplored 
territory so it's like the zone of 

381
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:36,531
proximal development or even the flow 
states that chicks at Harley is talked 

382
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:40,311
about,
but see the best thing to be is where 

383
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:43,731
things are going well for you,
but also where you're expanding the 

384
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:47,931
capacity of things to go well for you 
simultaneously and then you can add to 

385
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:51,951
that the fact that that's not going to 
be solipsistic because we live in a 

386
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:51,951
social world.

387
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:53,760
If I'm pursuing something that's deeply 
meaningful,

388
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,440
then what if?
If,

389
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,500
if things are constructed,
fortunately then I'm going to be 

390
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,380
pursuing something that's very good for 
me now and me later in knee,

391
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,480
deep into the future.
At the same time,

392
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:10,440
I'm pursuing something that's good for 
you now and you later down deep into the

393
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,830
future.
Now I believe that that sense of of deep

394
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:18,831
engagement that helps people in 
fortunate periods of their lives is 

395
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:22,221
actually a neurological signals that 
that the layers of being are stacked on 

396
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:27,861
top of one another properly and that 
you're oriented properly within the and 

397
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:29,850
that it's the,
it's a c to me,

398
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,390
I've,
I've often thought that the most real 

399
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:35,390
thing is paid and then you might say,
well,

400
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,460
if there's an antidote to pain,
that would be something that would be 

401
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,311
even more real than paint.
And it seems to me that the sense of 

402
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:44,910
meaning that I'm talking about pure 
that's associated with this,

403
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:49,911
with this sense of ultimate 
responsibility is an antidote to paint 

404
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:50,340
and therefore it's something that's 
real.

405
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,960
I don't see anything.
You can make a metaphysical claim about 

406
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,580
that and that's perfectly reasonable,
but you don't have to.

407
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,730
You can make a bloody hardcore 
scientific claims for that and I think 

408
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:01,890
it's extremely difficult to refute

409
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,730
why you have it.
I tend to agree with that and I think 

410
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:07,730
that you know,
you,

411
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,551
you referencing the the flow state and 
that's something that where we are 

412
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:15,691
happiest right from scientific research 
isn't that flow state and that flow 

413
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:16,360
state is exactly what we're talking 
about now.

414
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:21,361
This,
this feeling that you have mastery over 

415
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:23,941
your capacity to explore the unexplored 
and that the unexplored is worth is 

416
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:23,941
worth exploring.
Right?

417
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:28,491
I mean that's the other thing is that 
what drives you to to explore the 

418
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:32,101
unexplored.
It's not just that you get up in the 

419
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:32,101
morning and you feel like laundering 
outside into the forest.

420
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,200
There's some of that,
but I think some of it is that you feel 

421
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,200
like there's a natural necessity for you
as a human being to do that.

422
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,401
There's a moral duty for you to try and 
conquer new worlds and adding the moral 

423
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:41,401
layer.

424
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:44,840
More of the moral impetus on top of.
I just have a decision to,

425
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:50,090
to,
to go out and explore territory is what 

426
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,940
I think allows civilization to,
to create rather than destroy,

427
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,870
and I've talked a lot on my show about a
male male toxicity.

428
00:20:55,871 --> 00:21:00,871
You know what people have to the toxic 
masculinity and all this knowledge and 

429
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,110
and what what and what not.
The binary nature,

430
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:03,970
I think of human beings particularly 
men,

431
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,260
is that men have a little boy who's a 
year and a half old and he's either.

432
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,320
He's either building a stack of blocks 
where he's destroying the stack of 

433
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,361
blocks.
There is no in between and so if you 

434
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,671
are.
If you're exploring unexplored 

435
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:19,321
territory,
there are only two ways to deal with 

436
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,581
that.
One is to actually take a fire and set 

437
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,381
it in the unexplored territory or the 
other is to cultivate that unexplored 

438
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,921
territory and adding that moral layer of
it's your job to forge out into the 

439
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:27,310
universe and make that cultivated toward
towards.

440
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,320
You.
Bring that into the known that a adding 

441
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,071
that moral dimension is I think what 
both the Greeks and Judeo Christian 

442
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:37,540
tradition are about and I think it's 
more frequent Judeo Christian,

443
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:42,541
but the idea that there is a god worth 
exploring and that God has reached down 

444
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,991
demand and uplifted him is is I think 
relevant to jail Christian religion and 

445
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:47,260
is really the essence of Judaeo 
Christian religion.

446
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:50,410
If you look at polytheism,
that notion that you're out there to try

447
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:51,700
and understand God,
it doesn't.

448
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,350
It doesn't exist in polytheistic 
religion.

449
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,680
The notion that you're supposed to look 
beyond your.

450
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,730
You're supposed to look beyond yourself 
to a broader understanding of the 

451
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,141
universe.
Know you were subject to forces in the 

452
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:04,141
universe.
Right,

453
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:04,141
and those were represented by the 
different Gods,

454
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:08,310
not this idea that there's a universal 
system that's that's at least partially 

455
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,551
knowable that if you spend your life 
trying to investigate and live in 

456
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:13,000
continents with you will be happier.
That's a lot closer to the Greek system,

457
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,180
which is why you ended up with this 
common idea of the logos that you talk 

458
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,061
about being in the book of John,
but also really springing from from 

459
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:21,061
Greek thought.
I mean that's,

460
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:21,061
that's,
that's the idea there,

461
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:21,061
right?
Right,

462
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:21,690
right,
right,

463
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:22,200
right.
Yes.

464
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:24,150
It's an unbelievably brilliant 
synthesis.

465
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:24,900
No,
you,

466
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,450
you,
you touched on the idea of cultivation,

467
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:32,451
so I wanted to ask you both dot.
I'm going to Amsterdam to talk to this 

468
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,960
event at this event sponsored by a group
called the Dutch law and,

469
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,970
and that's going to happen to seven 
January 19th and go got about 2000 

470
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,151
people attending this event and it's 
scoring to be a national discussion 

471
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,470
about a Datsun European identity and 
immigration.

472
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,950
And so in principle it can be a big deal
and one of the things I've been 

473
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,410
meditating on is what it is that Western
civilization got right.

474
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,580
And so the first thing I think is that 
we got the idea of the logos,

475
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:04,610
right?
That's a big deal to sovereignty of the 

476
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,450
individual and the sovereignty and the 
necessity for respect of the capacity of

477
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:11,250
the exploring individual to conquer new 
territory and make it habitable.

478
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,640
We got that right and so and and I mean 
fundamentally.

479
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:19,641
Right?
But then that seems also to me to tie 

480
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:22,551
interestingly into the idea of property 
rights because the fundamental Marx's 

481
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:23,220
claim,
there's a number of them,

482
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:28,221
but one of the most fundamental claims 
is that property is in some sense fast 

483
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:32,990
and so that might even mean the property
that you accrued as a consequence of 

484
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,670
being successful and I think it might be
worth giving the devil his due and say,

485
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:40,671
well,
are there conditions under which my 

486
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:44,070
occupation of a space to the exclusion 
of you isn't merely theft?

487
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,500
And the idea cultivation I think is 
exactly the right answer to that is that

488
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,860
the point is for each of us to allow the
other to occupy a particular place in 

489
00:23:55,521 --> 00:24:00,521
time,
in the hopes that we'll each take care 

490
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:00,770
of it for our own benefit and for the 
benefit of others.

491
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,110
And then what happens is that everyone 
wins.

492
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Yeah,
and this is a very obviously lockean 

493
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,160
idea,
right?

494
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,730
This idea of what makes property 
worthwhile and property rights 

495
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,410
worthwhile as you mix your labor with 
the land and you cultivated it,

496
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,130
which is why lot specifically talks 
about the notion of adverse possession,

497
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:21,131
right?
If I own a piece of property and I just 

498
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:22,040
decided to leave it trashed somewhere 
and then someone comes in and cultivates

499
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,810
the property,
even though I own the property,

500
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,510
I should have a good legal case to 
actually make against that owner because

501
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:31,511
I'm not cultivating the property.
The idea being that cultivation and use 

502
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,390
of the land is actually your individual 
duty.

503
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:34,340
It's your individual duty and it's also 
your communal duty.

504
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:39,341
So yeah,
I think that the moral legitimacy of 

505
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:39,341
property rights is it,
you know,

506
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:43,820
in,
in locks thought particularly is very 

507
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,020
much tied to cultivation and your 
personal stake in what you've done with,

508
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,170
with the property that you own.
Again,

509
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:50,570
it's exactly your point that there's a 
mix of rights and duties.

510
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:53,160
Property rights are linked to duties.
It's not just property own.

511
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,800
Okay.
So maybe we can close with this.

512
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:56,320
You know,
the,

513
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:01,670
the idea of a garden was very 
interesting to me and of course the 

514
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,750
natural environment of the human being 
is the garden according to Genesis,

515
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:08,751
right?
It's the garden of Eden and I thought 

516
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:08,751
for a long time,
well,

517
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:11,361
why is it a garden?
And the answer to that is that a garden 

518
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:13,320
is the optimal juxtaposition of nature 
and culture,

519
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,440
right?
So a garden is nature blooming of its 

520
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,261
own accord,
but tended very carefully and so then 

521
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:22,260
the rule would be something like you're 
allowed to,

522
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,340
you're allowed to own something,
you have the right to own something,

523
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:31,370
you have the privilege to own something 
if what you're doing is transforming 

524
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:31,370
into a bountiful garden.

525
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,460
That's exactly right.
I think that's true and I think that's 

526
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,460
true in every area of,
of a successful life.

527
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,580
It's true how you raise your children.
Yeah,

528
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,800
you lose the right to raise your 
children properly if you're raising your

529
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:42,840
children improperly.
I think it's true of marriage.

530
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,370
Marriages break down when you don't call
today,

531
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,920
and cultivation is the,
the,

532
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:49,470
the ultimate human need is cultivation.
And when we cultivate,

533
00:25:49,471 --> 00:25:54,471
whether it's in the realm of knowledge 
or science or whether it's in the realm 

534
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,230
of religion and relationships than we 
are happier and when we don't cultivate 

535
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,230
and we,
uh,

536
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:01,540
when we deprive ourselves of the 
capacity and both the capacity and the 

537
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,380
purpose of cultivation,
then everything falls into anarchy then.

538
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,360
Then just through entropy,
everything will fall apart I think.

539
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,820
Okay.
So the right objection to privileges 

540
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,040
cultivation.
So like I'm not privileged on 

541
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,040
cultivating.

542
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,140
I liked that.
I liked that a lot.

543
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Yeah.
What's necessary to get to grip these 

544
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,200
things by the neck,
you know.

545
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,570
And so.
Okay.

546
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,650
That's good.
Well look,

547
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:25,651
thanks very much for talking to me.
I hope we get a chance to talk again in 

548
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:26,260
the relatively near future because 
there's some things we could really sort

549
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:26,860
out.
I think

550
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,630
that'd be great.
I'd really appreciate it.

551
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,220
I'm big fan of your work,
obviously.

552
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,580
Yeah.
Phoenix mutual.

553
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,740
Thanks so much.
Good talking to you.

554
00:26:34,741 --> 00:26:35,580
Happy New Year.
Right?

555
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,280
You too.
Bye.

556
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:38,580
Bye.
