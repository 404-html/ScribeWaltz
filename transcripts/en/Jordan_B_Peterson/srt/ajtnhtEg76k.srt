1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,000
I talked a little bit last time about 
what we were going to cover,

2
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,460
but I didn't get quite through.
So I'm going to finish that.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,650
For those of you who weren't here last 
time,

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,450
you can watch the lecture because it's 
online.

5
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:13,710
So,
um,

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,090
we,
we stopped at the depths.

7
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:16,924
Psychologists.
Really those are the psychoanalysts and 

8
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:22,590
psychoanalysts are people who are 
concerned with,

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,760
okay,

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,550
well for a psychoanalyst,
roughly speaking,

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,700
you're a collection of loosely 
integrated spirits.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,680
That's one way of thinking about it.
Or sub personalities.

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,623
You're not a unity and no sub 
personalities have their basis in while 

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,620
in all sorts of things.
They might have their basis in past,

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,513
especially traumatic experience or in 
patterns of socialization that 

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,493
characterized your family.
But they might also have their basis in 

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,810
fundamental biological motivational 
systems.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,020
So for example,
a psychoanalyst would conceptualize it,

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,003
anger or,
or perhaps sexual attraction as a sub 

20
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:03,310
personality.
And the reason for that is that,

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,473
well,
you know what it's like when you get 

22
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:05,704
angry,
you get angry at someone you love and 

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,700
you know,
first of all,

24
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:10,534
you,
you know,

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,803
it's some level you're wishing harm.
Now that might only be that you want to 

26
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,620
win the argument and you want them to be
nicely crushed while you do it.

27
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,663
But so,
so there's a desire that comes along 

28
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,184
with the anger,
but,

29
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,050
but there's a lot of other things that 
happen to,

30
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:25,570
so for example,
if someone's annoying you,

31
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,404
even if you love them,
the profitability that at that moment 

32
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:29,464
you're going to be able to easily access
all the memories you have about how 

33
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:33,514
annoying they are and have difficult 
time accessing the memories about how 

34
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,430
wonderful they mean he was quite high.
You know,

35
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:40,264
and you know that because sometimes you 
get angry with someone who had an 

36
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:42,994
argument with them and you sort of clue 
in later you'll snap out of you're more 

37
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:48,490
or less possessed state and you think,
yeah,

38
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:49,324
well,
you know,

39
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,810
I really wasn't taking the context into 
mind and I was kind of harsh,

40
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,340
so,
well,

41
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,780
so and so.
Then you think,

42
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:56,614
well who's in control?
And that's the question the 

43
00:01:58,871 --> 00:01:59,704
psychoanalysts are really interested in.
And their answer is it's not generally 

44
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:03,874
you.
And so it's very terrifying reading in 

45
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:06,934
some sense because you know,
people like to think of themselves as 

46
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:12,010
masters of their own house so to speak.
And it's just,

47
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,990
it's only vaguely true.
And you know people,

48
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,460
you know that too,
cause you make

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,280
maybe new years eve,
uh,

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,390
what do you call those resolutions?
How you're going to be a better person.

51
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,180
I think one of the most common ones is,
man,

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,870
you're going to hit the gym three times 
a week.

53
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:29,411
It's like,
no,

54
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:32,650
you're not actually.
And so very few people do.

55
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:34,480
And that's partly because,
well,

56
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:37,310
it's hard and so you don't want to do 
hard things and what they aren't.

57
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,160
The reason for that is because they're 
hard.

58
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:39,994
So it doesn't take much explanation.
But it's also because you can't just 

59
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:43,324
tell yourself what to do.
And that's annoying too because life 

60
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,590
would be a lot easier if you could just 
say,

61
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:48,424
okay,
well you don't sit down study for two 

62
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,124
hours,
don't watch cats on youtube or whatever 

63
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,520
it is that you're watching.
And No,

64
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:54,971
no,
no,

65
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:55,804
that isn't what happens.
You sit there and you study for a while 

66
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,144
and then you know,
you're thinking about cats and next 

67
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:03,250
thing you know you're watching haunted 
mansion's in London or some damn thing,

68
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,533
you know,
so,

69
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,123
so,
and it's a scary idea in some sense 

70
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,450
because if you think,
well,

71
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,580
if you're not really master of your own 
house,

72
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,414
you know,
if you don't have yourself under full 

73
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,720
voluntary control and you certainly 
don't,

74
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,030
then what does,
and you know,

75
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:19,864
Freud is interesting in that regard 
because he really talked about the 

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,033
motive,
power of fundamental motivational 

77
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,960
systems mostly for Freud it was 
aggression in sexuality,

78
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:29,621
you know,
and those are,

79
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,820
those are big motivators.

80
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,810
Let's make no mistake about it.
And so he thought of you as,

81
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,853
as,
uh,

82
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,330
that the conscious part of your 
personality may be as the,

83
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,000
it's like the captain of a ship with a 
very unruly crew.

84
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,450
It's a nice metaphor because of course 
the ships on the ocean and the ocean can

85
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:47,284
be very stormy.
And so you can only sort of plot your 

86
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,300
course and you have to work with what's 
thrown at you.

87
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:56,360
And then the unruly crew is,
well it's all your drives.

88
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,390
It drives is the wrong way of thinking 
about it.

89
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,783
That I liked the psychoanalytic notion 
of subpersonality because a 

90
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,360
subpersonality has a viewpoint,
there's things it wants and it plants.

91
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,450
So it's,
it's,

92
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,250
it's,
it's an,

93
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,220
it's a living entity.
It's not some dead cognitive system.

94
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,390
So Freud was interested in some sense 
more about,

95
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,710
I would say the biological underpinnings
of the subpersonalities,

96
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,890
you know,
because he was,

97
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,753
he was,
he was quite biologically oriented and 

98
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,780
he realized that sexuality and 
aggression,

99
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:30,550
we're very fundamental sub personalities
and then there's young and young is much

100
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,384
more terrifying than Freud,
which is really saying a lot because 

101
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,630
Freud's quite terrified.

102
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,050
But Young,
he,

103
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,710
he's just terrified beyond belief.
And you know,

104
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,813
for you the sub personalities that make 
you up are thousands and thousands of 

105
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,484
years old.
They're cultural constructions that are 

106
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:50,710
thousands and thousands of years old and
they have you in their grip.

107
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,540
So for union,
for example,

108
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,880
one of the things he said,
and I don't remember where it was,

109
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,100
I love this phrase,
it's so true.

110
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,450
And you can think about this for like 
five years and,

111
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,620
and you can still think about it after 
that.

112
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,650
One of the things young said was that 
people don't have ideas,

113
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,573
ideas have people.
And that's really something to think 

114
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,790
about because you know,
just think about your own situation.

115
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,720
So no doubt you have political views and
you think I have political views.

116
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,420
It's like,
well no you don't because you share them

117
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:22,810
with a lot of other people.
So there are certainly not yours.

118
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,063
And not only that,
they've had a very lengthy historical 

119
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,400
development far before you ever showed 
up,

120
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:33,460
you know,
so they're rooted in rooted right at the

121
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:34,294
depths of your culture.
But then of course they'd been 

122
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:36,874
elaborated by one philosopher or another
extensively over the last two or 300 

123
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,180
years.
And there's this whole system of thought

124
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,770
and Poof,
it had habits.

125
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:45,820
Your brain,
and then you think,

126
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:47,740
well,
I've got political views.

127
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,810
It's like,
no,

128
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,483
the political views have you.
And that's a very salutary thought 

129
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,493
because it's one of the ways to stop 
yourself from being possessed because 

130
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,780
people get possessed all the time by 
ideas.

131
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,730
Right.
That's what happened in Nazi Germany.

132
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,620
That's what happened in the Soviet 
Union.

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,280
It happens everywhere all the time.
And you might think,

134
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:13,160
well possessed is a little strong but,
but no,

135
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,110
it's not actually,
it's a very nice,

136
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:15,944
it's a metaphor obviously,
but it's the right kind of metaphor 

137
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,100
because a body of ideas,
like political ideas,

138
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,050
there are living thing,
you know,

139
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,123
they're not,
they're not some dead dusty words on a 

140
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,430
bookshelf somewhere.

141
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,340
They're an integral part of a dynamic 
society and,

142
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,270
and the motive force,
those ideas have motivates you.

143
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,104
You're in their grip.
And so you can tell when you're talking 

144
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:41,150
to someone who's completely possessed by
it,

145
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,460
by an idea system or in India logical 
system,

146
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:47,600
cause they'll just bore you to death 
unless you happen to believe exactly the

147
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:48,434
same thing.
So they will spout out a few of their 

148
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,534
fundamental belief axioms and then you 
can identify which system they're part 

149
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:58,190
of and then they just speak in cliches 
from that point onward.

150
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,024
And you can predict everything you're,
they're going to say if you know the 

151
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,160
axioms of the system.
So it's very,

152
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,690
it's very non authentic speech.
And that would be a way that,

153
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,120
say someone like Rogers or,
or,

154
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:11,954
or Abraham Maslow who were humanists of 
the 1960s might talk about it because 

155
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,273
the person isn't speaking from the 
depths of their own experience or from 

156
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:20,990
even their embodied knowledge,
you know,

157
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,390
they're just mouthpieces for abstract 
ideas.

158
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,703
And so it's very frightening to realize 
the extent to which you can be the 

159
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:31,400
mouthpiece for abstract ideas,
you know?

160
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,100
And it's actually one of the dangers of 
becoming educated,

161
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,500
especially in a mass system like the 
university system.

162
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:37,334
Because a lot of what happens to you 
when you come to university is that 

163
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:44,381
you're fed a set of
pre digested ideas.

164
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,880
I suppose that's one way of thinking 
about it,

165
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,950
you know,
and it's very easy for you to think,

166
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:49,250
well,
it,

167
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,800
those are now your ideas.
They're not,

168
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,520
they're not lots of ideas that you have 
to earn.

169
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,163
And if it's a great idea,
then you really have to earn it because 

170
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:03,230
why should you just be able to come 
along and like pluck up a great idea.

171
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,023
That's not how things work.
You have to earn things that are 

172
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,690
valuable.
So anyways,

173
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:10,790
the depth psychologist man,
they're so good at that.

174
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,970
It's lovely to read them.
And the problem too is with a lot of the

175
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:14,804
people we're going to talk about,
it's very difficult to summarize their 

176
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:18,440
work.
You know,

177
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:21,320
cause often the devil's in the details.
So you know,

178
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,750
you might look at someone like piaget is
a good example.

179
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,670
The constructivists that we talked about
briefly,

180
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,770
man,
the guy wrote dozens of books.

181
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:28,604
He can't just summarize those suckers.
It's not one coherent theory that you 

182
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:33,640
can boil down to,
you know,

183
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,513
10 axioms and then you can read it while
you're flying from Toronto to Montreal 

184
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:38,780
and Poof,
you're appears.

185
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,330
Yet even psychologists,
like it doesn't work like that.

186
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,673
The people who may,
who formulated these theories were 

187
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:46,910
extremely intelligent and um,
and,

188
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,003
and there are often great writers.
And so a lot of the knowledge is 

189
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,404
actually in the writing itself and not 
in what you can extract out from the 

190
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,124
just,
you know,

191
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,600
and most of the theorists,
Freud Young,

192
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,770
it's harder,
but freud,

193
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,250
Rogers,
people like that you can extract out the

194
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,650
gist of their theories and then you can,
uh,

195
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,293
what would you say?

196
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,360
You can,
you can stereotype it or you can correct

197
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:11,160
it.
Sure it.

198
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,993
And then you can point out how your 
caricatures observed and then you can 

199
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,620
feel like you're even smarter than 
Freud.

200
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
You know,
you're not.

201
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,773
So it's not a good idea.
And so these people should also be 

202
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:24,390
approached with respect cause man,
they have so much to tell you.

203
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,520
It's so useful.
Okay.

204
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,070
So we talked about the depth 
psychologist,

205
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:32,640
we talked about the constructivists,
we didn't talk about the humanists,

206
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,923
the existentialists and the 
phenomenologists and a mouthful of 

207
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:36,901
words,
you know.

208
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:40,560
So let's put a little bit of foundation 
under those.

209
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,394
So if you're a humanist,
to be a humanist means really to be a 

210
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:50,220
creature of the enlightenment.
And a human is thought in some sense,

211
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,810
at least this is what the humanist 
thing,

212
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,703
they think of it as post religious.
They think of a humanistic thought as 

213
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:03,051
putting the value of the human being at 
the center of the cosmos in some sense,

214
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,223
valuing the person as they are and then 
also valuing the person that they could 

215
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,124
be and and promoting the pathways of 
development that would allow people to 

216
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:19,440
become what they could be as creatures 
that are valuable in their own right.

217
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,680
So a humanist for example,
would be very skeptical of claims.

218
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,200
So let's say standard Christian claims,
and I use that example because the realm

219
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:36,480
of ideas that these thinkers emerged out
of was almost always Judeo Christian.

220
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,410
And so,
you know,

221
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:39,810
they're,
the roots of their thinking are in those

222
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:42,990
systems and you can't understand their 
thinking without understanding that.

223
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,970
And so part of humanism was a rebellion 
against the idea that life on earth,

224
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:48,804
so to speak,
was of limited value because everything 

225
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:53,280
of any importance was going to happen in
the afterlife after you die.

226
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,620
So it's like,
no,

227
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,570
it's here and now it's right now that 
matters.

228
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,853
And you know,
life in the present is what's important 

229
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:01,764
and you don't need some kind of 
afterlife for some kind of belief in a 

230
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:07,890
transcendent reality in order to find 
value right here and now.

231
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,330
So you know,
fight,

232
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,070
there's a lot of good things about that 
idea,

233
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,101
you know,
and,

234
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:12,934
and the whole idea that you can improve 
yourself in some sense is that 

235
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,460
humanistic idea.

236
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,330
And most of you,
I mean,

237
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:20,910
how many of you believe that you can 
improve yourself?

238
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,530
So is there anybody who doesn't believe 
that it's,

239
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,543
that's willing to admit it.
So usually people only don't believe 

240
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,920
that if they're very depressed or 
hopeless,

241
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,390
but it's,
it's not self evident,

242
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:34,224
you know,
I mean,

243
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,153
and,
and in many cultures you can think of 

244
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:37,830
medieval culture,
for example,

245
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,040
in Europe where you know,
you were sort of stuck in your position.

246
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,500
There was no real idea of self 
improvement.

247
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,453
You could try not to sin,
but you aren't going to get like 

248
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:49,950
radically better in some way.
You were just who you are.

249
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:51,810
And that was that.
But not,

250
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,644
that's not the case for the no.
Existentialists there are kind of a 

251
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,244
different kettle of fish.
So you know when Fred talks about 

252
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:01,654
psychopathology,
because a lot of personality is about 

253
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,750
pathology,
right?

254
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,583
How personal this can go wrong.
Freud kind of thinks of the normal 

255
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:12,100
person roughly speaking as healthy in 
their normality,

256
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,143
but perhaps transformed into a 
pathological version of themselves by 

257
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,224
some sort of past trauma.
And that might often be an abusive 

258
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:20,950
childhood,
you know,

259
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:21,784
or,
or maybe a sexually abusive childhood 

260
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:24,304
because you know,
Freud talked a lot about that and it 

261
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,930
happens fairly frequently.
So for Freud,

262
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,710
all things considered,
if you weren't healthy,

263
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,630
there was a reason for it.
You know,

264
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:35,464
something terrible that happened to you 
and you needed to come to terms with 

265
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:38,554
that terrible thing.
However you might do that and put 

266
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:41,524
yourself back together and then you 
could wander along being a healthy 

267
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:45,440
person.
But the existentialists,

268
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:46,274
that's not how they think at all.
They think that standard human being is 

269
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:50,464
pathological.
And the reason they think that is 

270
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:55,810
because they think that self conscious 
existence,

271
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:56,644
so life,
the life of a creature that knows it's 

272
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,330
bounded in time and space,
right?

273
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,510
Knows it's vulnerable to disease and 
illness and death and the loss of things

274
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:08,500
that,
that they love.

275
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,030
And the disintegration of all things in 
some sense is that's enough of a problem

276
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,620
to give you problems without having to 
have been abused by it.

277
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:18,454
And so the existentialists view life 
itself as a problem of sufficient 

278
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,901
magnitude that it can destabilize you 
mentally merely by being aware of it.

279
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,973
And so they also believe that often what
people do as a consequence of that is 

280
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:35,290
flee from their own awareness,
you know?

281
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,050
So how do you deal with the fact that 
life is suffering?

282
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,280
Well,
you don't think about it.

283
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,680
Well,
for an existentialist,

284
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:45,040
that's not a very good answer.
And I would also say generally speaking,

285
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:45,874
for clinical psychologists,
that's also not a very good answer 

286
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:48,634
because the literature suggests pretty 
damn strongly that the harder you run 

287
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:54,424
from something you're afraid of,
the larger it becomes and the faster it 

288
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,294
chases you.

289
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,750
So avoidance of avoidance is generally a
very bad strategy.

290
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,073
Now,
it's not always the case because 

291
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,250
sometimes if you can't do anything about
something really,

292
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:10,210
you can,
well,

293
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,123
there's not a lot of sense spending a 
lot of time planning and struggling 

294
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:15,941
against it.
You know,

295
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:19,210
when sometimes people are in generally 
genuinely hopeless situations,

296
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:20,470
but,
but often did not.

297
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,830
So I really liked the [inaudible] man.
I think they're,

298
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,500
well,
I,

299
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,090
all the people that we're going to talk 
about there,

300
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,400
you're thinking is extraordinarily 
valuable.

301
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,100
You know,
it helps situate you in your own life.

302
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,963
It helps clarify the nature of your 
relationship to other people in the 

303
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:37,414
world.
It helps you lay out what your future 

304
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:43,600
could be if you were the creatures that 
you could be really wonderful.

305
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,210
Phenomenologists there are tricky bunch.
Um,

306
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,340
fundamental phenomenologist was Martin 
Heidegger,

307
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,790
who was also somewhat also somewhat 
tangled up with the Nazis.

308
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,690
Um,
you know,

309
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,700
which was clearly not a good thing.
And you know,

310
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,534
people debate about whether or not you 
can separate out his philosophy from 

311
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,990
what tangled them up with the Nazis.
And I think you can,

312
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,140
you know.
So anyways,

313
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:12,974
heidegger,
heidegger learned to take a fresh look 

314
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,780
at the nature of reality.
And so heidegger,

315
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,693
his idea was that we,
we made a fundamental philosophical era 

316
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:27,950
way back when when we were Greek,
ancient Greek,

317
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,010
roughly speaking,
and that we started concentrating on the

318
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:33,460
wrong elements of he didn't read,
he doesn't recall it.

319
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,303
Reality calls it being so a 
phenomenologist is someone who's 

320
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,130
concerned with Ba and you,
you might think,

321
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,470
well what's the difference between being
in reality?

322
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,304
And the answer to that is it depends.
It depends on how you define being and 

323
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:51,371
it depends on how you define reality.
So heidegger's observation was that for,

324
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,110
for,
for modern people,

325
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,090
roughly speaking,
reality is sort of a d animated material

326
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
objective.

327
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,260
Substrata it's,
it's dead in its essence,

328
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,183
roughly speaking.
And the things that are most real are 

329
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:07,184
precisely those things.
You can think about that it's all 

330
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:10,640
objective reality for all intents and 
purposes.

331
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,773
But what,
what heidegger tried to point out is 

332
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,600
that there's,
it's a choice in some sense because your

333
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:21,830
knowledge is finite because you're 
fundamentally ignorant about all things.

334
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:26,480
You have to decide that certain things 
are true and then act from that point.

335
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:28,100
And you know,
heidegger's point was,

336
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,203
there's a lot of things that you can 
decide about at the very fundamental 

337
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,950
level of,
of axiom.

338
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,260
And so one of the things you can decide 
for example,

339
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,094
is whether or not the objective world is
what's more real or whether or not your 

340
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:45,230
lived experience is what's more real.
Now you might think,

341
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:46,064
well what's the distinction there?
And I would say the distinction is 

342
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:49,934
probably something like watching someone
in pain on a video and being in pain 

343
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:56,240
yourself,
you know,

344
00:16:56,241 --> 00:17:00,140
so is a good example of,
of an element of being,

345
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:05,060
because it's obviously,
it's obviously you experienced it within

346
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:05,894
your own.

347
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,870
It's hard to talk about this because he 
uses different terminology.

348
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,760
Pain is an element of your big,
and it's,

349
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,320
it's not something,
it's,

350
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:19,154
the pain itself is not something that 
you can even conceptualize in objective 

351
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,420
terms.
Like you can measure it,

352
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:24,254
you know,
maybe your heart rate goes up when 

353
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:28,280
you're in pain or something like that,
or your facial expressions change,

354
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,170
you know,
so you can index it.

355
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,090
But the indexes are not the phenomena 
that's hence phenomenology.

356
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,493
Right?
And so the phenomenologists have built 

357
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:42,170
up an entire system of thinking,
predicated on the initial axiom that the

358
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,004
best way to approach life is to assume 
that being is the fundamental reality 

359
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:50,700
rather than the,
as the fundamental level.

360
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,350
And then you might think,
well,

361
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,150
why do people farther with that sort of 
thing?

362
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:57,890
And part of it is one of the cool,
this is an existentialist plate.

363
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:58,883
One of the consequences of developing 
the objective theory of existence was 

364
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:06,420
obviously all of the amazing technology 
we have around us and you know,

365
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,860
great,
thank God for that.

366
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,890
Otherwise we'd be sitting outside 
freezing.

367
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,033
But one of the consequences of that is 
once people established or objective 

368
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:15,414
reality and then defined it as 
ultimately real terrible questions of 

369
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:20,910
the meaning of life,
the ropes,

370
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:22,020
you know,
like if the world,

371
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,540
the universe is made out of nothing but 
dead matter,

372
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,374
it's eternally existing.
We're nothing but a candle flash in the 

373
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,424
wind.
The idea creeps into your mind that 

374
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,690
perhaps all of the damn suffering isn't 
worth it or,

375
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,730
or can put it another way,
you know,

376
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:36,564
does your life really have any,
any real meaning or is that just an 

377
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,280
illusion?
Well,

378
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,443
heidegger would say the reason that you 
have that problem is because you're 

379
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,460
approaching the entire problem wrong.

380
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,070
Clearly things have meaning.
They just don't.

381
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,933
If you make the hypothesis that's what's
our objective is ultimately real and 

382
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:58,470
everything else is merely a secondary 
consequence of that.

383
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,110
So anyways,
it's complicated.

384
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,060
It takes a while to get your head around
it.

385
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,183
Um,
the humanists and the existentialists 

386
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:08,880
and to some degree,
the phenomenologists,

387
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,400
they all came out of,
there isn't,

388
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,590
there was a variety of sources for their
thoughts.

389
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:17,580
And I would say one of them is the clash
between religion and science or between,

390
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,490
between value and objective truth.
They're trying to,

391
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,450
to rectify the division.
And Piaget himself was trying to do some

392
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:25,830
of that as well.
So it was young,

393
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,210
I guess.
Um,

394
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,253
and the other thing is a lot of the 
existentialist and humanist work was 

395
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:33,030
post World War II.
And so,

396
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,493
you know,
after World War Two happened with its 

397
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,750
immense catastrophes of course people 
who were thinking about human nature,

398
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:43,710
we're very interested in why such a 
thing could happen and existentialism at

399
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:44,544
least as a psychological school arose in
part as a reaction to the horrors of 

400
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:48,864
World War II.

401
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,883
It's a very serious,
it's a very serious branch of 

402
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,853
psychology.
And it would mostly characterize 

403
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:58,980
thinking in the 1950s before the hippies
came along and made everything sweetness

404
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,510
and light.
So,

405
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,510
which is more where Roger's in a maslow 
outfit.

406
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,150
So,
so we're going to talk about them a fair

407
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:06,984
bit that the three different categories.
So it's a kind of a strange approach in 

408
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:11,364
some sense that this class takes,
because I talked to you about some 

409
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:16,110
psychologists in that,
in that period.

410
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:16,944
But the other,
the people I talked to you mostly about 

411
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:21,300
aren't sec,
they're not technically psychologists.

412
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,580
Depends on what you mean by 
psychologist.

413
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,863
After all,
I talk a lot about Nietzsche and 

414
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,700
Dostoevsky and also a lot about a 
Russian literary figure.

415
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,110
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who wrote a book 
called the Gulag archipelago,

416
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:34,944
which was one of the,
there's a few cataclysmic events that 

417
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:43,500
brought the totalitarian system of the 
Soviet Union to a halt.

418
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,813
And you can argue about what they were,
but one of them for sure with social 

419
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:50,920
nuts as published publication of the 
Gulag Archipelago,

420
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:55,630
which is a 2,700 word book,
2,700 page book.

421
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,693
Can I get that right?
That describes what it was like to be 

422
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:04,540
there and how many people died.
And it's a,

423
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,960
it's a searing book.
He won a Nobel prize and he deserved it.

424
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:12,040
I mean,
soldier had some remarkable person.

425
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,680
He's like the Dostoyevsky of the 20th 
century.

426
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:15,514
And that's really saying something.
And Dostoyevsky is another person I use 

427
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:22,660
a lot in that section.
And both Dostoyevsky and nature regarded

428
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:25,450
themselves as psychologists 
fundamentally.

429
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,284
And you know,
it's funny because when you think about 

430
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:28,600
scientists,
you know,

431
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,060
usually think about people who are 
conducting experiments,

432
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:33,380
right?
But then one of the things,

433
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:35,260
and you'll notice this,
if you think about it,

434
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,463
it's a lot of you have taken a fair 
number of science courses or one of one 

435
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:39,934
form or another.

436
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,893
And you know a lot of what you're taught
when you're taught how to do sides is 

437
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:45,420
how to generate,
you know,

438
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,150
how to lay out that experiment property,
how to get the methodology right,

439
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,000
how to do the analysis property,
maybe how to structure the,

440
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,850
the,
the revealing of your findings in proper

441
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:56,450
scientific format.
You know,

442
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:57,284
and how to test a hypothesis.
But one of the things that you're never 

443
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,484
really told about as well,
how the hell do you generate the 

444
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:04,210
hypotheses to begin with?
Because you know,

445
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,700
really that's at least half of the 
problem.

446
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,210
And it's probably a lot more than half 
the problem.

447
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:15,211
And so part of being a scientist is the 
ability to be a hypothesis generator,

448
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,780
not just a hypothesis test or maybe you 
need to be both to be a true scientist,

449
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,560
but,
but maybe not.

450
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:26,080
Maybe you can just generate 
extraordinary hypothesis.

451
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:26,914
And it's certainly the case that people 
like dusty Sdn Nietzsche were 

452
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,710
unbelievably good hypotheses generators.

453
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,761
And so,
you know,

454
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:38,080
they're thinking in many ways underlies 
the entire development of thought,

455
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,183
that sort of thought that you guys are 
going to encounter in university 

456
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:41,704
anyways.
They're thinking underlies the entire 

457
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:43,744
development of the edifice of,
I would say both scientific and 

458
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,990
nonscientific thought across the entire 
entire 20th century.

459
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,400
And so it's quite entertaining to,
to go down there and you know,

460
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,263
uh,
wander around the roots of these sorts 

461
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:57,574
of things because you find out how 
things are linked together and why 

462
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:03,460
they're linked together and how they 
developed and what that means.

463
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:04,294
And also what it means for you to have 
those ideas and why you have them and 

464
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,910
what role they play in your life.
So,

465
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,790
okay,
so after that,

466
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,624
that's pretty much in some sense you 
might think that's where the clinical 

467
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,760
and philosophical part of the course 
ends.

468
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,623
Now I'm a clinical psychologist and most
of the people who are great personality 

469
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,510
theorists were clinical psychologists.

470
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,770
And that explains to some degree why the
first part of the courses philosophical,

471
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:33,604
because the thing about clinical 
psychologists and psychiatrists and 

472
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:41,131
medical doctors for that matter is that 
they're not exactly scientists.

473
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,680
They're more like engineers.
So what an engineer wants to do,

474
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,514
they might,
an engineer might use scientific 

475
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,220
knowledge and you know,
good for them.

476
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,054
They should,
but really what they want to do is make 

477
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:54,140
something change.
They want to build something,

478
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,370
they want to transform something.
They want to act on the world in,

479
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,440
in a beneficial,
generally in a beneficial way.

480
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,580
While the same thing as the case with 
the health domains,

481
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,790
it's like someone comes to you with a 
psychological problem.

482
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,630
What you want to do is you want to make 
it better and better.

483
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:12,464
It's not a scientific category.
So to the degree that you're a 

484
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:16,820
practical,
like you can say,

485
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:17,654
well,
it's scientific because worst means 

486
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:19,430
abnormal.

487
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,690
It's like,
that's not right.

488
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,110
You can make that case,
but it's shallow because there's lots of

489
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:26,420
times when you don't consider normal 
healthy,

490
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,180
you know,
you can send her exceptional,

491
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:31,000
healthy,
right or,

492
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:34,760
or maybe you consider exceptional,
desirable and desirable.

493
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:36,890
It might even be better than healthy,
right?

494
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:37,724
So you can't get out of the value domain
when you're trying to interact with 

495
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:44,030
people and sort out their lives.
Because partly what you're,

496
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:46,760
what you're always asking is what's 
wrong?

497
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,520
What's the matter?
Why are you dissatisfied?

498
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,100
Why are you suffering?
Why aren't you productive?

499
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:54,470
Why do you fight with everyone?
You know,

500
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,830
why can't you sleep at night?
Why do you wake up screaming,

501
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,263
you know,
why can't you pursue anything that's to 

502
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:04,970
your own benefit?
Why do you hurt everyone that you know,

503
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,070
you know,
those are moral questions.

504
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,050
And then the next problem is,
okay,

505
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,250
well what are we going to do about it?

506
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,113
What do you want?
How would you like your life to look if 

507
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:13,754
it could look the way you wanted it to?
And then how are we going to get from 

508
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:16,963
where you are to that?
And those are all their engineering 

509
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,384
questions in a sense,
but above all their ethical questions 

510
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,300
because they deal with how to act.
So I'm not,

511
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,000
you know,
I don't want to just slide over that big

512
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,843
because that's generally what happens 
because physicians and clinical 

513
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,730
psychologists and psychiatrists,
even though their physicians,

514
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:37,850
they like to think that what they're 
doing is science and that's not right.

515
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,170
It's informed by science.
But that's not the same thing.

516
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:43,004
It's particularly true with doctors 
because they're not even trained to be 

517
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:46,730
scientists.
So,

518
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,250
okay,
so that's that.

519
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:52,070
So then the next part of the course,
the last half,

520
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:53,120
it's,
it's pretty,

521
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,033
it's,
it concentrates on two elements of 

522
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:58,070
personality theory,
more modern elements I would say,

523
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:01,190
although not more valuable necessarily 
because of that.

524
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,533
Um,
partly very neurobiological because we 

525
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:11,810
made a lot of strides in the last 5,000 
years,

526
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:15,200
let's say in understanding the,
the,

527
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,890
the structure and the function of the 
brain.

528
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,840
Like the things we don't know about the 
brain,

529
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:22,430
man,
it's,

530
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,200
there are lots of things we don't 
understand about the brain.

531
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,890
We have no idea,
for example,

532
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,620
what its relationship is to 
consciousness,

533
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:33,080
except that more or less it seems 
necessary.

534
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,940
You know,
so all,

535
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:35,774
even even that you can dispute to some 
degree because they're great case 

536
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,420
histories of people who were born with 
hydrocephalus.

537
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,180
And so that means that your skull 
basically fills with water.

538
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:49,380
And the most famous case of that was a 
French guy who,

539
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:50,214
uh,
went for an Mri for God only knows what 

540
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,580
reason.
It had nothing to do with,

541
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,650
with uh,
what was eventually discovered,

542
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:59,370
but he only had 5% of his cortical 
tissue is whole brain.

543
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,233
His whole head was full of cerebral 
spinal fluid and the brain was just a 

544
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,060
little skin around the side that was 
like a balloon.

545
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,340
And as far as they could tell,
there was nothing wrong with them.

546
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,280
It's like,
hmm,

547
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,523
well isn't that interesting?
What the Hell is all the risks that 

548
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:14,010
brain for,
you know,

549
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:15,420
and then you get the other issue.
Like,

550
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,360
I don't know if you ever heard of,
uh,

551
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,030
can't remember her name.
I think it's peppered.

552
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,930
She had a famous parrot and African 
gray.

553
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:29,250
You can look it up talking African gray 
parrot and that damn parrot,

554
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,113
man,
that thing could talk like a four year 

555
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:32,034
old kid.
Way better than any chimpanzee full 

556
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,180
sentences.
It seemed to know what it was doing.

557
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:38,670
It's like it's a parrot,
right?

558
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,690
It's brain is this big.
So how is that even possible?

559
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,430
So,
okay,

560
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,890
so there's lots of things we don't know 
about the brain really,

561
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,020
and he's unbelievably complicated.

562
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,260
So,
but we have learned a lot of things that

563
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:53,094
are interesting.
We kind of understand the existence and 

564
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:59,520
the location of the fundamental reward 
and pain and anxiety circuits.

565
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:00,690
That's a big deal.
Those are,

566
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:02,910
those are like discovering major 
continents,

567
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:03,744
you know,
we understand to some degree how people 

568
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:07,230
learn and under what conditions they 
learn.

569
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,603
And we understand,
I would say to some degree what the 

570
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:15,900
fundamental motivations and emotions are
now,

571
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,870
those are not scientific categories,
motivations and emotions,

572
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:21,420
their linguistic categories.
So what we're stuck with.

573
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,780
So,
but we,

574
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,040
we know a fair bit about their 
underlying neuro biological basis.

575
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:26,874
And I want to take you through that in 
some detail because for a bunch of 

576
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:30,774
reasons,
partly because it provides a nice 

577
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:33,384
scientific underpinning to a lot of the 
hypotheses and precept positions of the 

578
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,150
psychoanalysis.
You know?

579
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,050
So,
for example,

580
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,020
Freud hypothesized the existence of the 
end.

581
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,430
Now there is no way I had in your brain,
but it doesn't really matter because the

582
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:48,630
ID,
the ID of the,

583
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:51,000
it is a functional category.
It's like a tool.

584
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,090
But there are lots of Ed like structures
in your brain,

585
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,463
you know,
and one of them in particular is the 

586
00:28:56,431 --> 00:29:00,360
hypothalamus and not thing like human 
beings like to think that they're really

587
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:02,400
impressive.
Cortical cap is the thing that's,

588
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:03,690
you know,
in charge of things.

589
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,524
But your hypothalamus,
which is this little tiny thing that 

590
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:10,950
sits at the top of your spinal cord man,
that's what's running you.

591
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:16,020
And let you know as long as you're not 
hungry or not angry or not chasing after

592
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:19,500
sexual excitement and not gambling and 
not addicted.

593
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:23,940
So as long as you're completely well fed
and warm and comfortable,

594
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,750
then you can think and you're more or 
less in control.

595
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,210
But as soon as any of those things go 
astray,

596
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,190
it's subcortical all the way.

597
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,660
You know.
And you can see this,

598
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:36,360
for example,
in conditions like Anorexia,

599
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,500
you know,
because Anorexia,

600
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:41,530
you can think of Anorexia as a war 
between the cortex and the hypothalamus.

601
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,460
And I'll tell you,
man,

602
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,900
the only time the cortex wins is when 
the anorexic dies.

603
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,153
Because other than that,
it's the hypothalamus that wins all the 

604
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:50,494
time,
which is why anorexics cannot stop 

605
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:53,830
themselves from Benji.
You know?

606
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:54,664
So they'll,
they'll cut their body weight down to 

607
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:59,710
say 75% of what it should be.
And that's hard.

608
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,573
Like you really,
it's not easy to starve yourself like 

609
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:05,620
that,
but they'll still binge like mad,

610
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:07,260
you know,
and need a whole gallon of ice cream and

611
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:09,970
two bags of bread and they can't stop 
themselves.

612
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:10,804
And that's because your hypothalamus,
we would rather you didn't starve to 

613
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:14,920
death.
And if you're not paying attention,

614
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,383
if you're not on top of the game or 
maybe if you've been hurt recently and 

615
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,280
so your resources or your,
your,

616
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,593
what would you say you're,
the negative emotion has been 

617
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:26,680
interfering with your cognitive 
capacity.

618
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,960
The hypothalamus will come up and grab 
you and say,

619
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:29,830
man,
you're hungry.

620
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:32,320
And it's off to the fridge with you.
You know,

621
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:33,154
so two in the morning you're going to be
eating everything in there in a kind of 

622
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:37,900
a daze and you'll snap out of that and 
think,

623
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:39,160
wow,
what the hell was that?

624
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:41,770
It was like,
well that's the end folks.

625
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,430
And it's no trivial thing and it's a 
good thing too because if it didn't tell

626
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:49,480
you what to do all the time,
like think about how foolish you are.

627
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,820
If you had to breathe voluntarily,
how,

628
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,860
how many days do you think you'd go 
through?

629
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,803
It's like you wake up one day and an 
hour later you'd forget to breathe and 

630
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:00,100
then you'd be dead.
So like your,

631
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:00,934
your,
your brain doesn't let you do anything 

632
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:03,454
important.
It takes care of all that in the 

633
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:06,700
background,
you know,

634
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,080
cause you're just not that smart.

635
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,790
I mean,
you don't know how to digest things.

636
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:10,624
For example,
you actually don't know how you walk 

637
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,430
even though you can do it.
So there are fundamental subsystem,

638
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,110
some of them that aren't even conscious 
weirdly enough,

639
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:20,944
even though they're neurological,
they're doing all the heavy lifting and 

640
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:24,094
like your cortex is along there.
It's along for the ride and some 

641
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,630
sanction and sort of things.
It's in control.

642
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:30,050
But yeah,
no,

643
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,260
not really.
Okay.

644
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:33,094
So we're going to talk a fair bit about 
fundamental brain structures and the 

645
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:39,390
function of those structures.
Cause I liked functional neuroanatomy.

646
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,410
I like,
I don't want to know just what the brain

647
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:42,244
is made out of,
but I want to know what all the parts 

648
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:47,200
are doing.
And so there's difficult papers in their

649
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:51,100
swans and that's a hard paper.
And the grit paper by gray,

650
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,623
those are papers that were written by I 
think genius level neuropsychologists 

651
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:57,184
and you know,
they put their whole life's work into a 

652
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:01,240
paper and so you know you're going to 
pick it up,

653
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,081
you're going to think,
wow,

654
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:02,800
this is hard.

655
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,730
It's like,
yeah,

656
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,970
some genius spent 30 years writing it.
It's going to be hard.

657
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,560
But there are so informative.
They're worth the struggle if,

658
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,500
if that's the sort of thing you want to 
struggle with.

659
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,813
So that's the biological end.
And then there's the psychometric ended 

660
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,750
site,
psychometrics,

661
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,290
very unpopular field of psychology,
even among psychologists.

662
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:26,320
And the reason for that is that 
psychometric nutritions,

663
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,393
I guess have actually discovered things 
and people hate what they've discovered 

664
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,740
and no wonder.
So for example,

665
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,850
it was people who do psychometrics,
engineers actually who had,

666
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,710
who entered psychology,
who discovered intelligence,

667
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,290
technical psychometric intelligence Iq.
And people will tell you there's lots of

668
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:46,190
kinds of intelligence like,
no,

669
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,440
there aren't.
That's wrong.

670
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,663
And it's wrong in this way.
The statistics that psychologists use 

671
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,000
were invented by the people who 
discovered Iq.

672
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,733
And that means every single thing that a
psychologist has ever claimed that's 

673
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:05,480
been verified in some way using some 
statistical process has been verified,

674
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,730
verified,
the same way that Iq was verified.

675
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,013
And so you don't get to say,
well the Iq stuff's invalid without 

676
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:15,020
saying all of psychology and a lot of 
other fields is invalid too because it's

677
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:15,854
the same methods of proof.
And it's even worse than that because 

678
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:20,900
like the relationship between Iq and 
life,

679
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:21,734
success is way stronger than the 
relationship between almost any other 

680
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:28,280
psychological phenomena.
And almost anything else.

681
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,070
So for example,
for you guys even know,

682
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,623
you know you're,
you're all far above average in 

683
00:33:34,091 --> 00:33:34,924
intelligence because otherwise you 
wouldn't be here like at least 85th 

684
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:38,174
percentile.
And that's something to think about 

685
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:43,340
because a lot of that is determined by 
biological factors and also a huge chunk

686
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:45,680
of the reason that you're here is 
because you know,

687
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:46,514
you one part of the genetic lottery,
so like hurray for you and no one's 

688
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:51,830
screwed it up too badly as you were 
growing up,

689
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,050
you know,
but even among you guys,

690
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,913
that correlation between your 
intelligence and your and your grade 

691
00:33:57,951 --> 00:34:01,040
point average is quite high even though 
it's a truncated sample,

692
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:01,250
right?

693
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,083
Cause you're all pretty bright and even 
though there's a lot of error in the 

694
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:09,020
grade measurement system because it 
doesn't only index intelligence,

695
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,620
it's still very powerful.
And so the one,

696
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:13,490
the peep,
if you,

697
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,660
if you controlled for conscientious and 
other elements of personality,

698
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,360
which you can do statistically in 20 
years,

699
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:21,194
the peep,
the 10% of the people in this room who 

700
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:25,910
have the highest Iq is we'll have the 
highest income virtually.

701
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,110
Certainly,
you know,

702
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:29,180
unless some terrible thing happens to 
them,

703
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,253
you can overcome it to some degree if 
you're really hardworking cause then 

704
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:34,550
that's conscientiousness,
you know,

705
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:35,384
and that,
but that's also a trait which seems to 

706
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,560
have quite a heavy biological loading.
So well,

707
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:43,220
so that's the sort of thing that people 
hate about psychometricians because they

708
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:46,880
come up with these facts and there are 
facts that are really dismal.

709
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,160
And I can give you an example.

710
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,993
So,
so you guys all have an Iq of over 150 

711
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,703
roughly speaking a hundred makes you 
about as smart as the typical high 

712
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,420
school rapping,
you know,

713
00:34:59,421 --> 00:35:04,421
115 that's kind of the low end for,
for managing the rigors of a,

714
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,300
a fairly high end university.
You know,

715
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,430
one 15 you're still going to have a lot 
of trouble.

716
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:12,680
Are you going to have to work like mad?
So,

717
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,770
but okay so 150 now that's one standard 
deviation above the mean.

718
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,580
One standard deviation below the mean is
an Iq of 85.

719
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:23,414
Now there's just as many people out 
there in the world who have an Iq of 85 

720
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:28,730
as there are people who are able to go 
to college.

721
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,010
Okay.
So then you think,

722
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,010
what can you do if you have an Iq of 85 
and well,

723
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,123
one answer.
So the u s army has been doing 

724
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:42,150
psychometric testing for a hundred and 
some years,

725
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,650
um,
for a whole bunch of reasons.

726
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,360
But they've done a lot of the basic 
science,

727
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,800
you know,
and uh,

728
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,233
one thing about the u s army is they 
like to have recruits and you can 

729
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:52,704
understand why,
because do you really want to go off 

730
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:56,910
somewhere and get shot?
And the answer to that is generally no.

731
00:35:56,911 --> 00:36:00,390
So it's not like there were people 
lining up to get into the army.

732
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,670
Even in peace time.
It's hard to get people.

733
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,690
And also the Americans have used the u s
army as a,

734
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,190
you know,
imagine you have a,

735
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,740
an underclass of people who aren't doing
very well,

736
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,500
which is the case in every society.
And you want to boost.

737
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:14,940
Some of them up,
you know,

738
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:17,250
into something resembling the middle 
class.

739
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,233
You can do that fairly effectively by 
inducting new young men in particular 

740
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:22,980
into the army because they get some 
training,

741
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,053
you know,
when they get some discipline and maybe 

742
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:26,970
they can kinda clamber up into the 
middle class.

743
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,970
And so there's a lot of policy reasons.
A why the American army or enforces want

744
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:34,500
people and be,
you know,

745
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,170
just to be in the army,
but also for social reasons,

746
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,273
positive social reasons.
So they're not likely not to let you in 

747
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,390
the,
the consequence of a hundred years of Iq

748
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:49,200
testing was the PR was the establishment
of a law in the United States.

749
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:53,490
You cannot induct anyone into the army,
cannot accept them into the army.

750
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:58,020
If they have an Iq of less than 82 
that's 10% of the population.

751
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,933
So you think about that,
that means one person in 10 cannot do 

752
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,880
anything that is a positive value in a 
organization.

753
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:09,714
It's rather complex,
but not more complex than other 

754
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:14,730
organizations.
That's desperate for people,

755
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,910
not thing they an offer has positive 
value.

756
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,510
It's worse to have them in the army than
not to have them there at all.

757
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,003
Really.
Now you know that that's a terrible way 

758
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:25,310
of putting it.
But it's an,

759
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,163
it's a horrible,
it's a horrible statistic because it 

760
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:30,000
also means,
you know,

761
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:34,110
if you think about the army as roughly 
equivalent to the world in some sense in

762
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:34,944
terms of its complexity,
it means that there's 10% of the 

763
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:42,240
population who just cannot really exist 
well in a complex cognitive society.

764
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,371
So,
and you might say,

765
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:45,120
well,
you know,

766
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,190
something should be done about that.
It's like good luck.

767
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:49,890
People had been trying to do something 
about that for a very long time.

768
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,413
There's been billions,
if not trillions of dollars poured into 

769
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,500
attempts to do cognitive remediation in 
the United States.

770
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,363
Well,
not to mention that we actually have an 

771
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:03,990
education system and the cool is 
actually to make people smarter.

772
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,830
So we're going to talk a lot about 
psychometrics.

773
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,263
And the thing about the psychometricians
is they're basically brute force status 

774
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:14,150
Titian's in some ways they're 
atheoretical,

775
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,603
you know,
and they use computer power roughly 

776
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,294
speaking and advanced statistical 
techniques to look at large data sets 

777
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,320
and extract out patterns.

778
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,580
And you know,
I was,

779
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:25,920
I hated the big five when I first came 
on it.

780
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:26,790
I thought,
Oh God,

781
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:29,580
this is boring.
It's like there's no theory behind it.

782
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,533
It's not prescriptive.
It's not interested in any literary 

783
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:35,130
manner.
Like it doesn't have a good story.

784
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,970
Um,
it came out of,

785
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,360
it's so dry,
but you know,

786
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,760
it works and,
and that's,

787
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,160
that's how it is.
So we're going to spend a lot of time on

788
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:48,994
psychometrics and you know,
my lab two is done if they're a bit of 

789
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:54,880
work over the last 10 years elaborating 
out the big five model.

790
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:55,714
So one of the things we'll talk about is
the big 10 model and what it does 

791
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,840
roughly speaking,
is break each of the five into two,

792
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,480
we call them aspects.
And they're pretty interesting.

793
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,340
Like they predict political belief,
for example,

794
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:07,174
quite nicely.
So conservatives tend to be more 

795
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,863
orderly,
which is part of conscientiousness and 

796
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:14,410
less creative,
less open.

797
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,680
And Liberals tend to be more open and 
less conscientious,

798
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,633
which a cynic would say.
That's why they're so into income 

799
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,840
redistribution because they actually 
don't work.

800
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,213
So you know,
the conservatives work like mad and the 

801
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:26,710
liberals say,
hey,

802
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,870
how about some of that money,
you know,

803
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,060
the system's unfair and the conservative
say,

804
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:33,640
well no we worked hard and we're not 
giving you any.

805
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,540
Well you know,
they both have flaws in their theories,

806
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,000
but liberals by the way,
make very good entrepreneurs.

807
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:40,923
Like,
no,

808
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,793
let me rephrase that.
Most entrepreneurs are liberal in their 

809
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:48,370
political outlook and that's because 
they're high in openness.

810
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:49,204
So the way it really seems to work is 
that liberal minded people start 

811
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:57,220
businesses and conservatives run them.
So they're necessary for one another.

812
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,380
Yeah,
well cause the liberals being open,

813
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:00,880
they're off to the next idea,
you know?

814
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,370
And they don't want to attend to the 
damn details.

815
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,650
They get bored by that.
They're not particularly orderly,

816
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:06,484
you know?
But once you've established a process 

817
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:09,064
and it works,
you need someone to watch to make sure 

818
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,404
the process keeps working well.
That's not very interesting if you're a 

819
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:15,040
creative person.
So,

820
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,660
okay,
so

821
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,310
that's basically that.
That's the course.

822
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,400
So now at the time,
so I think what I'll do now is I'm going

823
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:33,204
to tell you a story and you're going to 
think it has absolutely nothing to do 

824
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:39,540
with what we've been talking about,
but that's okay.

825
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,010
That's okay.
So I picked this weird

826
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,640
picture.
Um,

827
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,993
it's the,
it's a picture of Jonah Biblical 

828
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:55,600
character.
So 2,500 year old story.

829
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,853
So that's a pretty old story.
And generally if a story is 2,500 years 

830
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:02,230
old,
it's a lot older than that.

831
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,243
You know,
it's just happened to be written down 

832
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:05,980
2,500 years ago.
But you know,

833
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:10,270
that long ago it wasn't like there were 
novels and books and that you could find

834
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:11,920
50 different stories,
you know,

835
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:12,880
at your fingertips.

836
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,713
There were a few stories and everyone 
knew them and God only knows how long 

837
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:17,830
they'd been around.
But it was a very,

838
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:18,581
very,
very,

839
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:19,414
very long time.
So this was written down 2,500 years 

840
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:22,924
ago,
but we don't really have any idea how 

841
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:28,960
old it is.
And in some sense it's almost infinitely

842
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:31,630
old,
at least on any human scale.

843
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,000
Now you see this picture and what you 
see is this thing that,

844
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,033
what would you call it?
Well it's a mid evil idea of a whale is 

845
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,370
what it is.
You know,

846
00:41:41,371 --> 00:41:42,204
when you might think,
well that isn't really what a way it 

847
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,830
looks like.
And that's kind of right.

848
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:48,830
But a medieval Wale wasn't the whale 
that we have.

849
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,830
Like whale in medieval times meant 
large,

850
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,070
terrifying underwater thing,
you know?

851
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:55,904
And so maybe that was maybe a giant 
squid was the whale and the whale was a 

852
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:01,190
whale in the shark was a whale.
You know,

853
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,130
the category is not the same.
So that kind of accounts for the,

854
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,153
that in pure ignorance is what accounts 
for the kind of strange mythologized 

855
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:11,954
representation.
But it's still a representation of 

856
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:15,500
something.
It's just a little generalized.

857
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,210
Now what he's doing is vomiting Jonah up
onto dry land.

858
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,430
So,
and you think that's,

859
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,040
that's pretty damn weird.
How many of you have Seen Pinocchio?

860
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,590
That's a lot.
Hey,

861
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,250
how many of you haven't really,
you haven't Seen Pinocchio?

862
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,100
What kind of parents did you have 
anyways?

863
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,090
Okay,
well you remember in Pinocchio Pinocchio

864
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:38,924
was father is stuck in a way,
La and then Pinocchio has to go down 

865
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:41,774
there and,
and,

866
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,033
and rescue him.
And one of the things you didn't notice 

867
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,960
when you were watching Pinocchio is just
how daft that is.

868
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:48,794
There you are sitting there,
you're watching a puppet go down into 

869
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:55,610
the ocean to rescue his father from a 
whale.

870
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,140
And you think,
boy,

871
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,580
that makes sense.
It's like,

872
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,370
well,
so that's interesting.

873
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,420
Right?
That's interesting.

874
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:06,530
Why does that make sense?
Why does that make sense?

875
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,280
Cause it doesn't make any sense but,
but,

876
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,970
but it's,
see that's a,

877
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,180
that's a good example of the grip of an 
architectural idea.

878
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:15,523
Cause in archetipal ideas,
a very deep and old idea that makes 

879
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:20,780
sense to you.
Even though if someone points out to you

880
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:21,614
that you believe it,
which you more or less do while you're 

881
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:25,190
watching the movie,
you think,

882
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,090
Oh yeah,
it's really weird that I believe that.

883
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:27,960
Just like,
you know,

884
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,523
that isn't a puppet going down into the 
ocean to rescue his father from a whale 

885
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:34,630
either.
Just so you know it,

886
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,593
it's a drawing of a puppet going down 
into the ocean to rescue as far from a 

887
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:41,210
whale.
So it's like divorced from reality,

888
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:45,560
my life in all sorts of ways.
But what's so interesting is you go into

889
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:47,750
the theater and watch something like 
that there.

890
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,490
If someone taps you on the shoulder and 
say,

891
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:50,900
Hey,
do you know what you're doing?

892
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,070
You say,
uh,

893
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,140
why don't you shut up and let me watch 
the movie?

894
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,760
Right?
You don't notice.

895
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:56,594
Oh yes.
I'm very peculiar and very peculiar 

896
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:01,040
thing sitting here watching this and not
noticing how strange I am,

897
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,450
you know?
And so,

898
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,553
well,
that's partly why I'm going to tell you 

899
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:08,780
this story because,
because it's true,

900
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,450
even though it isn't,
you know?

901
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,081
And,
and that's,

902
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:13,910
that's a funny thing.
I had a very,

903
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:18,500
very strange professor at the University
of Alberta.

904
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,320
He died a few years ago.
He got in a bus,

905
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,183
I think it was in Winnipeg,
and he never got off the bus and no one 

906
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:26,240
ever saw him again.
So he had,

907
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:29,360
he'd been a prison psychologist,
he worked in the maximum security prison

908
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:32,640
and University of Alberta.
So who maybe he met one of his old

909
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,070
clients,
you know,

910
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:36,900
it's possible,
but it's very strange,

911
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:38,120
very strange ending.
Anyways,

912
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,460
one time,
um,

913
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,670
we are talking about fiction,
you know,

914
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:42,930
and he said,
uh,

915
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,500
he said fiction is a lie that can tell 
you the truth.

916
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,710
And that's a very interesting way of 
thinking about it.

917
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:50,544
You know,
because you read fiction and you know 

918
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,503
it's true,
but it's not obviously because it's not 

919
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,130
really about a thing that actually 
happened,

920
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,850
but it's more than that some ways 
because if it's good fiction,

921
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,790
it's about a whole bunch of things that 
happen sort of like that.

922
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,310
Right?
It's a distillation,

923
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,250
it's like someone tells you a long story
and then you know,

924
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,060
you,
you,

925
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,530
you talked to your partner and they 
asked you what was that all about?

926
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:18,660
And then you tell them in two sentences 
what it was about.

927
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:20,970
You boil it down to the just right.
Well,

928
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:23,850
a really good story is the gist of 
something.

929
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,500
And some of the really old stories,
the really weird ones like Jonah and the

930
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:30,830
whale for example,
which as I said is,

931
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,753
is told to some degree in the story of 
Pinocchio there the gist of a lot of 

932
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:38,880
things and people have been boiling 
those damn stories down for,

933
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,500
for a very,
very,

934
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:41,281
very,
very,

935
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:44,100
very,
very long period of time.

936
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,130
Thousands of people over thousands of 
years.

937
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,830
And they come up with these weird 
stories that people remember

938
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:52,500
and then people think,
well,

939
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:53,311
they're real.
It's like,

940
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:53,911
yeah,
they are,

941
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:54,744
but they're not real.
The way a scientific story is real to 

942
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,020
different kinds of real.
So here's,

943
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,250
here's the story of Jonah.

944
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,573
So it's an old Jewish story.
There's probably a very intimate in in 

945
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,660
the Qur'an,
but I don't know that variant.

946
00:46:10,661 --> 00:46:12,120
So,
and maybe there isn't.

947
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,930
Anyways,
Jonah lives in 500 BC and uh,

948
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,980
God has a chat with them one day and he 
says,

949
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:21,240
look,
Jonah there,

950
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,620
there's this city,
Nineveh,

951
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:24,720
and the people there,
you know,

952
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,153
they're really not on the straight and 
narrow and things are going to go to 

953
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:32,940
hell in a handbasket very rapidly if 
someone doesn't do something about that.

954
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:35,730
So I think that you should go to Nineveh
and you should tell the king and all the

955
00:46:35,731 --> 00:46:37,530
people that are there that you know,
really there,

956
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:38,603
they're just not doing the right thing.
And Joan and being a perfectly 

957
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:45,240
intelligent person says,
you want me to go to a city and you want

958
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:46,074
to go meet?
We didn't tell the king like this 

959
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:50,070
authoritarian die who has absolute power
of everything,

960
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:51,750
that there's something wrong with what 
he's doing,

961
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:53,130
that all of the citizens are corrupt.

962
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,980
That's what you want me to do.
And,

963
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:58,170
and Jonah says,
there's no way I'm doing that because as

964
00:46:58,171 --> 00:46:59,310
I said,
he's a smart guy.

965
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,560
So he runs off and he goes to this town 
and as he's running off,

966
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:06,450
he,
he rents a boat more or less.

967
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:07,284
And it's a big boat and there's 
fishermen on it and they're going to 

968
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,980
like row him somewhere.
God can't find it,

969
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:15,060
which is not going to be an easy thing.
And so god of course,

970
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:15,894
can't be fooled by such relatively poor 
strategic choices because he's 

971
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,410
omniscient and all that.
And so he's out on the water,

972
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:23,700
Jonah.
And there's the fishermen there.

973
00:47:23,701 --> 00:47:24,534
And then,
so God calls up this big storm and the 

974
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:27,324
fishermen are shorting out about this 
and because they're going to swamp the 

975
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:32,290
boat and then they're all going to die 
and they're not that happy about that.

976
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:36,370
So what they decided to do is throw 
everything overboard so that the boat is

977
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:37,204
light.
But that doesn't help much because the 

978
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:40,870
storm gets worse.
And so then all of them start praying.

979
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,730
They all have different gods.
So you know,

980
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:47,080
it's like a little garden competition.
One fishermen talks to one God and other

981
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:49,630
fishermen talks to another God and 
nothing's happening.

982
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:52,900
So Jonah happens to be asleep in the 
hold of the ship.

983
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,080
Now he's already told them that he's 
been running from his God.

984
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,520
And so they think,
ha,

985
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,413
we better go wake up Jonah because maybe
he's the guy that's causing all the 

986
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:01,714
trouble.
So they'd go down there and they wake 

987
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:05,080
him up and they ask him about his,
his God.

988
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:05,914
And he says,
well my God made the heavens and the 

989
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:08,194
earth and their gods,
they were doing anything that 

990
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:10,834
magnificent.
So they're pretty freaked out about 

991
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:12,100
this.

992
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,270
And so they tell Joan,
it's like,

993
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:15,550
what the hell are you running away from 
this guy for?

994
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,740
It's not a good idea.
And Jonah says,

995
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:18,401
yeah,
yeah,

996
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:20,440
I'm sure it's my fault that this storm 
has come up.

997
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:23,050
So why you just throw me over?
And they say,

998
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:23,884
well,
we can't really do that because you 

999
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,440
know,
you shouldn't run away like that,

1000
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:29,890
but you're not a murderer or anything.
We can't just toss you over.

1001
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,990
And so they decided to try to row to 
shore,

1002
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:32,824
but God's not having any of that.
So he raises up a big storm and it's 

1003
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,930
getting worse and worse.
And finally the fishermen say,

1004
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:38,980
Oh,
you know,

1005
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:40,203
over you go.
And June is into that because he knows 

1006
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:44,770
he's a bad guy.
And so a all swallows them.

1007
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,293
Now you think that's probably not 
exactly right because first if a whale 

1008
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,950
swallowed you,
then you'd be dead.

1009
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,670
And it was probably a shark anyways.
It's not like you're going to be private

1010
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,770
down there.
It's not a big cavern.

1011
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:58,330
Like,
you know the Pinocchio Whale,

1012
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,780
it's,
it's solid and there's no oxygen.

1013
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,790
And so your dad,
but that isn't what happens.

1014
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,653
Joan is in the whale and he's Kinda 
freaked out by this cause now he's in a 

1015
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:10,390
whale and there's a storm in God's angry
at him.

1016
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:12,940
So the first thing he does is pray and 
tell God what an idiot.

1017
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:13,720
He isn't it,
you know,

1018
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,710
he'd like to be forgiven.
I mean,

1019
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,820
so the whale zips up to shore and vomits
him onto the beach,

1020
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:19,654
which is the very,
very undignified mode of arriving 

1021
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:24,730
anywhere.
So,

1022
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,760
so that's,
that's the Jonah Story.

1023
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:30,490
And then of course,
Jonah picks himself up and he thinks he,

1024
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:31,324
yeah,
yeah.

1025
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,980
You know,
that wasn't so good.

1026
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:33,814
It was a little rough.
I think maybe I'm going off to Nineveh 

1027
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:36,214
to tell the ninevites or whoever they 
were that they're just not living 

1028
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:42,160
properly because that's a lot better 
than making God angry,

1029
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:42,430
you know?

1030
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:45,640
Cause what with the storms in that 
fishermen and the whales and all that.

1031
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:46,474
So then he goes off to Nineveh and he 
tells them what's going on and it seems 

1032
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:51,780
to more or less work.
So,

1033
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,940
so that's a very interesting story.
And you think,

1034
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:58,540
well how did people believe that me?
And one question might be,

1035
00:49:58,541 --> 00:49:59,950
well,
do you believe that story?

1036
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,730
And then you think,
well no,

1037
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:04,923
but then you think,
well maybe that's more complex question 

1038
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:07,384
than you might think because it turns 
out that I believe the Pinocchio Story 

1039
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,350
and you say,
well no,

1040
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:13,660
I didn't really believe it.
And then I would say,

1041
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,950
well it kind of depends on what you mean
by bleed,

1042
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:16,803
doesn't it?
Because you watched it and while you 

1043
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:20,590
were watching it,
man,

1044
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:22,210
you are into it.
You understood it.

1045
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:24,580
You didn't want it to be disrupted.
You followed it.

1046
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,290
So it's like,
did you believe it?

1047
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,273
No.
You were like a four year old skeptics 

1048
00:50:29,381 --> 00:50:30,380
sitting there thinking,
well,

1049
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:31,430
you know,
puppet whale.

1050
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,420
No,
it doesn't bad.

1051
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:33,254
No you're not.
You're acting out your belief in it by 

1052
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:36,044
being engaged in it.
And if someone taps you on the shoulder 

1053
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:41,030
and wakes you up 30 years later,
20 years later,

1054
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:41,571
you say,
oh no,

1055
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,620
I don't believe that.
It's like,

1056
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,430
you know,
it's kind of remarkable what you believe

1057
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,320
in.
How many of you are star wars?

1058
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:51,200
Like a fist unidos?
No,

1059
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:52,330
you won't admit it,
will you?

1060
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,770
Yeah,
but there's lots of you in here.

1061
00:50:54,771 --> 00:50:56,240
I know.
You know.

1062
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:59,030
And so that's all mythologies and told 
him mythology.

1063
00:50:59,031 --> 00:51:01,070
You know that of course,
the person who,

1064
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,240
uh,
what was his name?

1065
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,220
The guy who came up with the star wars 
idea?

1066
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:07,040
Lucas Lucas was a student of Joseph 
Campbell.

1067
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:07,993
Joseph Campbell was a psychologist slash
mythologist and the star wars stories 

1068
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:16,160
are updated mythology,
just like Harry Potter and all the other

1069
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:17,990
things that capture people's 
imagination.

1070
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:22,880
So you bloody well do believe this.
And there's a reason for it to now,

1071
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,520
what time is it?
Oh,

1072
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,613
stop there.
I'll tell you the reason the next time 

1073
00:51:28,611 --> 00:51:29,444
we meet.
