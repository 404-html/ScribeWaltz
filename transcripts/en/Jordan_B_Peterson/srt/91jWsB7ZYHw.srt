1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,830
Talk about constructivism and I'm going
to primarily discuss John Piaget,

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:09,600
although the readings extend to stumped
some degree out past his thought.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,170
Um,
PSA is generally regarded as a

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:16,590
developmental psychologist,
which is not what he thought of himself.

5
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:19,410
He thought that he was at genetic
epistemologist,

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,330
which is a term that I think has ever
only been applied to him.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,770
An epistemologist is someone who studies
the manner in which knowledge,

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,830
um,
who studies knowledge itself.

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,290
And that's what Piaget thought that he
was doing.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,320
And he wanted to understand how it was
that knowledge unfolded across time.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,050
And more importantly than that,
he wanted to understand how the

12
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,600
cognitive structures that made up in the
individual developed across time.

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,830
So that's generally why he's regarded as
a developmental psychologist because of

14
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:56,220
course he also studied children.
Now

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm going to read you something that
piaget rope to begin this.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,530
Um,
he wrote an awful lot of books and a lot

17
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:08,730
of them haven't yet been translated and
some of the ones that are translated are

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,330
translated pretty badly.
And I think this is probably an example

19
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:16,980
of a fairly bad translation,
but regardless of that,

20
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:19,560
the point that's being made is both
valid and interesting.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,230
So the Garmin postulate a various
traditional epistemologies,

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,500
which are theories of valid knowledge is
that knowledge is a fact say or a set of

23
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:35,370
facts so that you would go to class and
learn a set of facts and that is what

24
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,520
would give you knowledge instead of a
process.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,320
And if our various forms of noman
drawings incomplete as we know they are,

26
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:46,010
because they're replaced sequentially,
I mean,

27
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,480
for example,
recently in the domain of physics,

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,860
physicists revealed to us that they
really didn't understand what some

29
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:55,110
massive percentage of the universe was
made up.

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,010
I think,
I can't remember,

31
00:01:56,011 --> 00:02:01,011
it's 75% or 95% made up of dark matters,
which has never been detective.

32
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,960
And we know how to think about it.
So that's a good example of how our

33
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:07,290
fundamental assumptions can be
challenged at any moment.

34
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,410
And how a fact can turn from a fact into
a clear fallacy if our various forms of

35
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,820
knowledge,
you're always in complete.

36
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:19,821
And our various sciences still imperfect
that which is acquired is acquired and

37
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:24,600
can therefore be studied statically.
So the proposition there is that you

38
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:28,080
come and you learn the facts and the
facts themselves are solid bits of

39
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,210
information and they don't change across
time.

40
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:32,380
And so that once you have them,
you have them.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,240
Now of course piaget,
obviously delts that hence the absolute

42
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,540
position of the problems.
What is knowledge or how were the

43
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:44,541
various types of knowledge possible as
an alternative under the converging

44
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,820
influence of a series of factors,
we're tending more and more today to

45
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:52,440
regard knowledge as a process more than
a state,

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
any being or object that science is
attempt to hold fast dissolves.

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,380
Once again in the current of
development,

48
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,370
it is the last analysis of this
development and the vid alone that we

49
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,500
have the right to state.
It is a fact.

50
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,930
What it means by that is the fact that
human beings learn facts is in fact a

51
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,150
fact,
right?

52
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,600
So you are capable of learning things
and he thinks that's sort of the

53
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:20,560
fundamental fact.
People assimilate information and they

54
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:25,420
transformed as a consequence of it.
And so studying that as he says what we

55
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:28,360
can and should then seek is a law of
this process.

56
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,460
We are well aware on the other hand that
the fine book by Kuhn Scientific

57
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,970
Revolutions.
Now the reason PSA throws them in at the

58
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:40,150
end.
How many of you know about Thomas Kuhn's

59
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,740
book on scientific resolutions?

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,820
No one just to three people.
Okay,

61
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,900
well that's probably not good.
Um,

62
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,330
Kuhn was one of the 20th century's
foremost philosophers of science and he

63
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,060
made a distinction between two different
modes of scientific process.

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,580
One,
he called normal science and the other

65
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:06,700
he called Revolutionary Science.
And normal science was the kind of

66
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:11,701
science then you'll do as undergraduates
unless you're incredibly lucky or

67
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,840
unbelievably brilliant.
Um,

68
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,950
or probably unbelievably really an Andy,
incredibly lucky.

69
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,870
And so normal science occurs when you
generate knowledge incrementally from

70
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:26,470
within the confines of an already
developed scientific theory.

71
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,510
So a normal science would be a say the
application of big five models of

72
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,750
personality to the prediction of some
other variable like say relationship

73
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:38,440
success.
You're going to uncover something new,

74
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:42,010
but it's not going to shake the
foundations of knowledge itself.

75
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,560
Now,
coon observed that from time to time

76
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,980
there were discoveries that were made
that shook the foundation of knowledge

77
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:48,430
itself.

78
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,560
There's some well known revolutions in
science,

79
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:55,030
so the Newtonian Revolution was a
revolution in science.

80
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,000
Uh,
Einstein's were produced another

81
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:01,210
revolution in science.
Darwin's were Mendel's work.

82
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,020
Um,
those are the revolutionary

83
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,290
transformations of thought that people
often considered.

84
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,540
Did I say Darwin?
I certainly should have said Darwin

85
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,880
because his was probably the most
revolutionary of all.

86
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,650
Um,
now the reason that I wanted to tell you

87
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,090
that,
and the reason I kept it in here,

88
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,120
even though it seems like it's funny,
little additional statement pin to the

89
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:28,330
end of Piaget's Caucasian,
is that cool,

90
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,390
observed at scientists science seem to
progress in accordance with the same

91
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:37,870
mechanisms that Piaget observed,
that the knowledge of children appeared

92
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,070
to progress.
Now,

93
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,110
one of the things that you'll learn
about piaget,

94
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,780
which is generally all you learned if
you learned about piaget,

95
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,430
is his idea that children go through
sequential stages of development and

96
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,980
usually people have you memorize those
stages.

97
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,640
I should let you know that piaget really
didn't care that much about those

98
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,200
stages.
And when they occurred and how they

99
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:01,040
could be sped up at what they were.
He was much more interested in deep

100
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:05,380
philosophical questions.
And that element of his work generally

101
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,400
goes unrecognized by the North American
psychologist who purport to understand

102
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:15,350
what he had to say now because he wrote
dozens of books,

103
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,340
some of which are not yet translated.
It's not surprising that people come

104
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,970
away with a partial view of key Jay when
you're that prolific.

105
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,790
He was so damn smart.
He was offered the curatorship of a

106
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:31,791
museum when he was 10 because he had
published a scientific paper on,

107
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:37,241
I think it was on snails and but his
parents requested that he turned it

108
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,170
down.
So you know,

109
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:42,530
piaget was a major genius and if someone
puts their mind like that puts their

110
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:45,600
mind to work for an entire lifetime and
he lived to be an old match,

111
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,620
they can produce an awful lot of
intellectual material and it's not

112
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,720
necessary,
especially if it can't be summarized

113
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,670
easily as a single,
you know,

114
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,340
coherence theory that you could memorize
in one page.

115
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,900
It's pretty hard for people to keep up.
So it's not surprising that his thought

116
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,450
gets reduced to,
you know,

117
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,600
a set of axioms is in a sense,
but the devil is often in the detail

118
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,660
with great thinkers.
And what that means is that to really

119
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,830
understand what they had to say,
you actually have to read them because a

120
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,830
lot of the information is at the
sentence level of analysis and not at

121
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:17,540
the summary Level of analysis.
You know,

122
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,210
if you're really smart,
it's not that easy to summarize what you

123
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:23,660
have to say because most of what you
have to say is in fact informative.

124
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,730
So you can't just throw it away.
It's hard to compress it.

125
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,920
So anyways,
this initial paragraph opens up the

126
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:35,150
world of Constructivism to now the
constructivists are interesting people

127
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,780
because you know,
you'll often hear people ask is it

128
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:41,120
genetic or environmental,
which is,

129
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,240
it's not a good question because it's a
false dichotomy that the genes formulate

130
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,960
structures in accordance with
environmental demand right from the

131
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,850
beginning of the organisms emergence.

132
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,420
And so there's a constant interplay
between the environment and genetics.

133
00:07:56,421 --> 00:08:00,950
But the environment isn't also just a
thing that's out there that's like made

134
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:04,000
out of lions and Tigers of Moose and
buildings and you know,

135
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,960
the sky.
It's,

136
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,080
it's an information field and the
constructivist point outrightly that

137
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,840
partly what you're doing when you're
operating in the world is interacting

138
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,250
with this field of information and
incorporating it structure into the

139
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:22,040
structure of your mind and body,
which is how you adapt.

140
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,220
So you could say in some sense that
you're built out of information and

141
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,200
matter.
That's a good way of thinking about it

142
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,490
and the constructivists or very
interesting interested in how you go

143
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:36,230
about acquiring information and how you
then transform that information into the

144
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:38,300
sort of knows that you can apply to the
world.

145
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,310
So they're also very pragmatic,
especially piaget because Piaget regards

146
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,970
knowledge as um,
like the prerequisite for adaptive

147
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:47,804
action.

148
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,310
So again,
again,

149
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,670
he's less concerned about the facts that
you know about the structure of the

150
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:57,510
world that he is about.
How is that you modify and adapt your

151
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:59,670
behavior so that you could survive in
the world.

152
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,460
So,
so that's the first pos,

153
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,580
that's constructivism.
And then the next postulate is that

154
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,590
there are revolutions in this internal
structures that you construct that

155
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,100
emerge as a consequence of you acquiring
new information.

156
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,700
Sometimes that information can already
be fit into a knowledge structure that

157
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,220
you possess,
but sometimes the information is so

158
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:25,221
anomalous or novel that it blows out
fundamental precept positions that

159
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:30,261
you've already established and forces
you to not only add some information to

160
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:34,920
your repertoire of information,
but to reconfigure the structure you use

161
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:39,630
to represent the information you don't
like that people don't like it when that

162
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:42,360
happens,
it's too dramatic and upsetting.

163
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,000
So which is often why revolutions in
science or in an APP,

164
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,940
any other field,
our first resistance,

165
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,130
I mean it's very complicated.

166
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,200
The reasons people are opposed to new
ideas are very complicated.

167
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,720
There's lots of theories about why that
occurs.

168
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:00,300
Precisely.
But I'll briefly outline and good

169
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,500
theory.
There's a bunch of them,

170
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:06,090
but a log line one.
So let's say there's already a

171
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:09,600
scientific theory and it's instantiated
in the world.

172
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,750
So people accept it.
And let's say that you are a proponent

173
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,460
of that theory.
So you might say,

174
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:16,470
well,
that theory therefore governs your

175
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:18,000
worldview.
And if I threaten it,

176
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,970
then your world view is going to fall
apart and that's going to make you fall

177
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,040
apart.
And that's not a bad theory,

178
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,920
but here's a,
here's a variant of that which is

179
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:27,420
similar,
but which I think is better.

180
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,700
So I'm a professor,
let's say I have a theory now what I'm

181
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,540
doing with my theory is buying my right
to be a professor.

182
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,170
So I would come to the University of
Toronto as a job candidate and I would

183
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,690
say,
here's my theory and here's why I think

184
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,470
the facts support it.

185
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,510
Here's what it's good for.
And they'll say,

186
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,240
okay,
it looks like you know enough about what

187
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:52,680
you're doing so that you can occupy this
position in this dominance hierarchy.

188
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,900
Okay.
And I'm pretty happy about that because

189
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,780
that position in that dominance
hierarchy is pretty permanent.

190
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,910
That's one of the advantages to an
academic job.

191
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:03,480
It's like once you have it,
as long as you're relatively confident

192
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,060
and relatively ethical,
then you can,

193
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,420
you can maintain it across time.
So,

194
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,110
so it's a big deal to be granted that
slot.

195
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:16,710
And then being in that dominance
hierarchy is not only a matter of what

196
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:18,960
you believe,
obviously the fact that I'm in the

197
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,020
donuts,
he means I get a certain salary and

198
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:24,150
that's not hypothetical that allows me
to eat.

199
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,150
So I'm happy about that.
It's not only psychological and I can

200
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,250
pay my housing payments with it and so
on.

201
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,420
So it protects me from the cold and the
offers me something to eat and it gives

202
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:37,080
me a certain public status.
And so if some others,

203
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,750
joker comes along,
say they're young and they say,

204
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,670
well,
I have a different theory and it makes

205
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:44,490
your theory looks stupid,
then I'm not going to be very happy

206
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:47,280
about that.
Partly because it upsets the way that I

207
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:49,140
could figure my understanding of the
world.

208
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,330
And that's a drag.
But I might recover from that.

209
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,540
But it also undermines my,
undermines the validity of my claim to

210
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,570
that position in the hierarchy.
And so it sorta makes me an imposter,

211
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,190
say it and say the guy turns out to be
right.

212
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,024
It's like,
poof,

213
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,790
I'm an imposter.
And I knew really no longer really have

214
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,300
the right to occupy that position.
Someone might even point that out,

215
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:11,560
although it doesn't happen very often.

216
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,440
In the case of professors,
you know what happens fairly frequently

217
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,390
in other sorts of occupations.
You know,

218
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:19,900
all of a sudden your position has made
useless because somebody figured out how

219
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:24,250
to automate you and poof you're gone.
Like that's hard on your world view but

220
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:27,580
it's a lot harder on your celery.
So a lot of the reasons that people

221
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,330
claim to the validity of their theories
is because it gives them a claim to a

222
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:32,770
certain kind of,
uh,

223
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,340
what would you call,
skillset and utility that then gives

224
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:39,460
them a claim to occupy a certain
position in the dominance hierarchy and

225
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:41,770
that protects them from,
from,

226
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,900
you know,
all the horrors of reality.

227
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,270
Not Completely,
but you know,

228
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,370
I mean I have health insurance for
example.

229
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,110
Sometimes that's really,
really helpful.

230
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,640
So I don't want some joker coming along
and pointing out that my theory is,

231
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,470
is right.
Anyway,

232
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:59,980
so far that hasn't happened.
So that's a good thing as far as I'm

233
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:00,814
concerned.

234
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,430
So psg concludes and says,
if all knowledge is always in a state of

235
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,030
development and consists in proceeding
from one state to a more complete and

236
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:12,640
efficient one,
evidently it is a question of knowing

237
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:15,940
this development and analyzing it with
the greatest possible accuracy.

238
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,770
Okay.
So Piaget fingers,

239
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,860
you're a information foraging machine so
to speak,

240
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,970
and the process that you engage in while
you're forging from information for

241
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,900
information and then figuring out what
to do with it is typical to human

242
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:34,360
beings.
And there's some constancy of structure

243
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,280
across human beings.
Okay.

244
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:37,780
So that's,
that's the first idea.

245
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,330
It isn't that we all do it in a
different way,

246
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:42,010
even though there's individual
variation,

247
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:43,440
obviously.
Um,

248
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,450
the other sort of fundamental postulate
of constructivism,

249
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,540
especially the Phn Ian version of
Constructivism,

250
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,030
is that you sort of build yourself from
the bottom up,

251
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,800
starting with your body.
So Pia,

252
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,570
this is one of the things about Piaget's
theory that's unbelievably

253
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,560
sophisticated,
I think.

254
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,580
So when people were first developing
models of artificial intelligence,

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,980
they thought they'd be able to develop
machines,

256
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,770
that sort of model of the world and then
figured out how to act.

257
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:12,670
In the world sort of abstractly and then
would after they figured out how to act

258
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,740
in the world would then act in the
world.

259
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,800
But that proved to be impossible.
And as you can tell,

260
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:19,130
because we don't have,
you know,

261
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,350
ambulatory robots that could like bus
tables at a restaurant,

262
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,690
which turns out to be,
by the way a very complex job,

263
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,390
fast mathematical operations.
Computer can handle that easily or

264
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,280
easily,
but bussing a table.

265
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,080
It's like no computer is smart enough to
do that.

266
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,130
So that's pretty peculiar.
But it turned out after like 40 years of

267
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:44,131
investigation that you couldn't build
computers that would operate as

268
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,470
independent robots by teaching them
tomorrow the world.

269
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,830
And then by having the model,
the potential action that they were

270
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:53,330
going to undertake and then implementing
it.

271
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,350
That did not work.
Partly because modeling the world is way

272
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,600
more complicated than anybody ever
suspected.

273
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:03,890
It's like infinitely more complicated.
And so some robotics engineers such as

274
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:07,370
Rodney Brooks who worked at Mit,
started building robots from the bottom

275
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,500
up.
He made these little mindless robots

276
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:14,270
that really didn't even have a sense
essential processor that we're action

277
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:16,160
oriented.
So like the first things he built where

278
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,350
he's literally the sec,
like things that could skitter away from

279
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,060
light,
that's all they could do.

280
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,770
It turn a light,
poof,

281
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:25,370
they'd go find some dark.
And it's as if,

282
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,900
so imagine the world to that roadblock
was a binary place.

283
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,960
It was either a light place where a dark
place and then you might say,

284
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,800
well what did life or dark mean to this
little robot?

285
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,280
Then you have to ask yourself,
well what does meaning mean?

286
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,990
And that,
that's a very good question.

287
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:46,190
It's one that piaget answers meaning
means to that the robot

288
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,400
move to a different place.
So light to that robot meant move to a

289
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,140
different place.
So what the,

290
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,580
what the robot in a sense was doing was
transforming one form of information,

291
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,060
light versus dark into another form,
which was skitter away.

292
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,480
And so I love that because it's not easy
to understand what meaning means until

293
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,270
you relate it to the body.
And so piaget's fundamental proposition

294
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,800
is that the,
the elements of your understanding are

295
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,810
not perceptual abstractions.
In fact,

296
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,530
there's even elements of understanding
that underlie your perceptual

297
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,480
abstractions that are more fundamental
and what those are essentially our

298
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,560
sensory motor skills.
Things you do with your body.

299
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,060
It's a lovely idea.
It's extremely profound and I think it's

300
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,140
absolutely correct.

301
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,380
It,
it does wreak havoc with the idea of

302
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,780
disembodied intelligence.
However,

303
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,730
because for Piaget and also for Rodney
Brooks who is responsible by the way,

304
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,370
just so you know,
some of you've seen big dog,

305
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,570
big dog look up Darpa,
Da Rpa.

306
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,080
How many of you have seen big dog?
How many of you are terrified by big

307
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,090
dog?
Yes.

308
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,540
Big Dog is this robot that's being
developed by the U s army that it's

309
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:07,080
about this big and it's four legged.
It's got ahead and it could run like

310
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,000
faster than you and it can run in snow
and it can run on ice and it can run up

311
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:13,420
hills.
And if you kick it,

312
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,780
if balances and stands back oxen
hypothetically it's going to be used to

313
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:22,110
transport like the heavy things that
soldiers have to carry.

314
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,040
But you know,
don't believe that that's a stupid idea.

315
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:30,110
Once these things can emulate by
themselves and they can already follow

316
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,960
each other because now they have visual
systems,

317
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,330
um,
arming that is going to be a very simple

318
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,170
matter.

319
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,700
And so the probability that we'll have
unbelievably super fast robots that can

320
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:43,970
shoot you in 10 years is like,
to me as far as I can tell from the

321
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:47,810
development is absolutely certain.
I have a friend who's a computer

322
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:49,650
engineer and he's a really good,
and he said,

323
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,040
you know how in science fiction movies
sometimes when those robot shooting at

324
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:53,874
you,
they miss.

325
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,390
You said when the robots shoot it,
you not only will they shoot at where

326
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:58,290
you are,
but they'll shoot it.

327
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:02,130
The six places that they calculate your
most likely to dark too and they will

328
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:05,370
never miss.
So that's a lovely thing to think about.

329
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,790
So
hopefully that will come to pass,

330
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,360
but it probably will.

331
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,830
So here's the sort of thing that PSA was
interested in.

332
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,320
These are very fundamental questions and
he was a very deep intellect.

333
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:26,070
So he tried to go right to the bottom of
the structures of knowledge to find out

334
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,870
what was down there
upon what does an individual basis

335
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,640
judgments.
That's a good one.

336
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,630
How do you know where they do a or b or
what the differences between right and

337
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,970
wrong.
How has that instantiated in your,

338
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,080
in your being,
what are your norms?

339
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,840
How is it that those norms are
validated?

340
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,820
What's the interest of such norms for
the philosophy of science in general,

341
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,590
which,
which is a question like,

342
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,110
well,
there's a consensual reality that we all

343
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:58,200
share to some degree,
which is why we can communicate,

344
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,290
but there's not a one to one
relationship between that consensual

345
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,070
reality and the categories of science.
So Piaget was interested in the

346
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:08,850
similarities between our consensual
viewpoint and the scientific viewpoint.

347
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,100
And the differences.
So for example,

348
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:13,800
people use to hypothetically assume that
the world was flat.

349
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,630
Um,
and you could say,

350
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,340
well,
the reason they assumed that was because

351
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,670
it looks flat when you look at it.
So it was an empirical observation,

352
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,140
but obviously there were other
observations that we managed to produce.

353
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:29,130
It indicated that the world wasn't flat
and then our scientific conceptions and

354
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:31,140
our interpersonal,
uh,

355
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,820
consensual norms
became divorced from one another.

356
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,380
And that's becoming a really serious
problem,

357
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,440
say with branches of science,
like quantum mechanics,

358
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:44,400
which you know,
there are absolutely completely

359
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,220
incomprehensible from a pragmatic
perspective,

360
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,370
even to those who formulate the
mathematically I pay a piaget would say

361
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,170
the reason for that is that,
well,

362
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,590
when we interact with objects at the
phenomenal,

363
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
phenomenal logical level,
which is the level that we can most

364
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,860
easily perceive,
they act Newtonian,

365
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,110
you know,
so can I take your pen?

366
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,420
So you know,
you can sort of predict what this

367
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:09,990
penalty,
because it acts like other objects of

368
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:14,640
about its size and shape with mass.
And so your understanding of this is

369
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:19,530
actually based upon your knowledge of
what will happen if you manipulate this

370
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:22,080
thing with your body.
You know it's solid.

371
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:25,020
You'd be very surprised if you could
like put your fingers through this pen.

372
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,080
You'd be surprised if it broke because
you expect a certain hardness.

373
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,960
You do expect it to write,
although pins off to dote,

374
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,460
you expect it to be pointy.
You know that you can take it apart into

375
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:38,880
many objects.
Even though like you can ask how many

376
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:41,610
objects is this?
Well,

377
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,040
it's one pen,
right?

378
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,410
But you could take it apart.

379
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,920
Now it's two objects.
And then you can see that there's other

380
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:53,890
objects in here and sometimes you can
put it back together and it'll still

381
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:56,740
work.
And so,

382
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,700
so Psj,
his point is that what we regard as

383
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:11,320
understanding to say that you understand
something is to indicate that you can

384
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:16,030
predict what is going to occur if you
interact with that object with your

385
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,290
bottom.
Okay.

386
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,570
And that's,
that gives you your intuitive

387
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:24,370
understanding of things.
And so because this is material other,

388
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,360
you already know something about other
things that are material right and you

389
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:31,870
can transfer it from place to place.
And that's again an embodied knowledge

390
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:36,130
because material things are those things
through which you cannot put your hand

391
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,620
right.
You'd get some weird things like smoker

392
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,120
clouds and it's like,
well are they,

393
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,770
what are they?
Are they objects?

394
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:42,940
Is a cloud and object?

395
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,040
Well No,
not really.

396
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,830
Cause an object is one of these things
that you could sort of manipulate as a

397
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:50,890
unit.
Now the categories of quantum mechanics,

398
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:54,460
of course,
which deal with these incredibly tiny

399
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,600
things that are really don't want
particles and are really not waves,

400
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,590
they're in comprehensible to us because
we never manipulate anything at that

401
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:05,080
scale.
And so because we can't play with it,

402
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,470
we have no real way of understanding it
because our understanding is based on

403
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:15,220
the mapping of objects onto our body.
So any object that we can map onto her

404
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:17,950
body is therefore fundamentally and
comprehensible.

405
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,840
It's very cool theory,
you know,

406
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:24,670
and it very body centric theory.
So how does the fact that children think

407
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:26,430
differently than we do affect our
presumption?

408
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:28,990
In fact itself?
That's a very interesting question too

409
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:31,570
is like,
so you've got three year olds and of

410
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,340
course they're pretty clueless about the
world but,

411
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,930
and,
and you know more,

412
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:38,710
but there's the three year old is alive
and everything and functioning.

413
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,720
And so then you have to ask yourself,
well,

414
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,350
if their conception of the world is
qualitatively different than your

415
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:46,870
conception,
how is it that you can both survive in

416
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:49,270
the same world?
And what does that mean about,

417
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,450
about what knowledge means and about the
limits of knowledge.

418
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,620
I mean not,
you know,

419
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,550
I could say the same thing above you
that you might say about a three year

420
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:58,061
old,
which is,

421
00:22:58,061 --> 00:23:01,030
well if I took you from this place and
dropped you in the jungle,

422
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,100
you know,
soon you'd be dead,

423
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,470
first few be visible,
then you'd be dead.

424
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,820
And so that's sort of like the three
year olds state of being.

425
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:10,601
If you,
you know,

426
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:12,610
if you were supposed to take care of
them and you disappeared.

427
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,260
So obviously even your knowledge of the
world is limited by wall.

428
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,010
It's limited in its necessary generality
by the context.

429
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,190
But that also has something interesting
to say about the validity of your

430
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:26,500
knowledge itself.
Very context dependent.

431
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,881
So,
okay,

432
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,860
so that's the sort of thing that piaget
was interested in.

433
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,040
Here's some other ones.
What do you mean by number?

434
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,420
That's an interesting one.
So you don't have,

435
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:37,660
they say you can't compare apples and
oranges,

436
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,330
but you can.
So if I said,

437
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,160
well what's two oranges plus two apples
for fruits?

438
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,620
Who just said that you sound very good.
So the way you solve that was by

439
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:49,790
generalizing,
I'm a level,

440
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,040
right?
So if I sat down,

441
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,520
um,
what's two desks plus two rocks,

442
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,610
what would you say?
Yes ma'am.

443
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,020
You're very good at this.
Pretty thing it was done.

444
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,320
That's an Iq.
That's,

445
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,940
those are their Iq questions by the way.
So if you did get them now you could

446
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:06,160
feel disappointed,
depressed.

447
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,890
If you've got the wild,
then you can pat yourself on the map.

448
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,150
So that's good.
Yeah.

449
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:15,150
So number is a funny thing because well,
as I pointed out with the Pan,

450
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,330
well one can become many very rapidly
and many can become one.

451
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,860
One of the whole idea of announcer is
extremely difficult to understand.

452
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,890
You know like what is in common between
singular entities that allows you to

453
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:35,690
represent all of them with one well
animals don't do that.

454
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,260
They can in a sense they can sort of
intuit three or four,

455
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:43,950
which is about all we can intuit to.
But once we get the nomenclature done

456
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,910
property man,
we can use numbers like crazy and then

457
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,740
they bill us to manipulate reality like
mad.

458
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:54,230
So whatever it is we're extracting from
the commonality between objects seems to

459
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,720
be something that gives us incredible
power.

460
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,900
So that's a problem.
What do you mean by space?

461
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,360
Since we know for example,
from Einstein's work that you know,

462
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,870
space spaces is not an absolute in any
sense.

463
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,530
It isn't the speeds we move.
So what do you mean by time and speed?

464
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,680
What is an object permanent and when it
isn't it,

465
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,740
and when do you learn that?
What does it mean that an object is the

466
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:20,690
same across time?
That's a good one.

467
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,860
So,
you know,

468
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,650
I don't know if there's a single
molecule in your body that was there

469
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,890
five months ago,
six months ago.

470
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,960
There's some,
I don't remember what the turnover

471
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,810
duration is,
but it's fairly,

472
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,710
it's fairly quick.
So it's weird day because there you are

473
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:39,740
and you were there two years ago,
but none of your constituent elements

474
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:42,590
are the same.
So how is it that you can be the same

475
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,750
now that physicist Schrodinger
Schrodinger of the Schrodinger's cat

476
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:51,350
fade solved that by claiming that you
were at dissipative structure.

477
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,660
It's very interesting way.
That's when you thought life was

478
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,950
dissipative structures.

479
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,371
Uh,
dissipate.

480
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:58,190
Dissipative structure is the same as a,
you know,

481
00:25:58,191 --> 00:25:59,480
when you,
when you pull up the,

482
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,583
the,
uh,

483
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,740
he pulled out at the bottom of the sink
stopper,

484
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,630
I think.
So stopper,

485
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,080
if you're a saint is full of water and
you pull up the stopper,

486
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,110
you know,
you get a whirlpool,

487
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:12,920
right?
And all the water's spins as it as it

488
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:17,500
goes down the drain hole.
And you'll notice that that whirlpool

489
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,930
look sort of the same across time,
even though obviously the water

490
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:24,770
molecules that make it up are different.
He called that a dissipated structure.

491
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,330
It was a pattern that maintained itself
in spite of the movement of matter

492
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:30,890
through it.
And that's what you are,

493
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,350
by the way.
So it requires energy to keep a

494
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:37,370
dissipative structure intact.
But,

495
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,500
uh,
you take in energy.

496
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,090
So thanks to the sun.

497
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,650
What do you mean by chance?
Huh?

498
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,580
Why do you have moral concerns and what
does it mean that you have moral

499
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:52,290
concerns?
That you have ideas about how people

500
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,510
should behave and how they shouldn't
behave.

501
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,810
And you have a very deep understanding
of that.

502
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,180
And it's characteristic of all human
beings and many,

503
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,550
many animals.
So where does that come from?

504
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,880
Is it developed form of knowledge?
What are children doing when they're

505
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:08,130
playing?
What are people doing when they're

506
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:09,540
dreaming?
And,

507
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:12,810
uh,
what's the significance of the fact that

508
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:15,390
you can imitate other people?
Now I'll,

509
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,600
I'll start with the last one briefly.
Um,

510
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,330
you know,
you might think that one of the things

511
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:24,660
that really distinguishes us from other
creatures animals is the fact that we

512
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:26,520
have a thumb.
And that's a big one.

513
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,370
We've got very good functional thumbs
and Hooray for that.

514
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,020
And we stand up on two feet.

515
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,800
So we get a chance to use our thumbs and
has to carry things round as a great

516
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:37,350
things and to take them apart and to
swing sticks and so on.

517
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:40,650
But there are other animals who can do
that to a limited degree.

518
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,800
And then there's our ability to talk.
That's a major one.

519
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,320
But one of the other things that really
differentiates people from other animals

520
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,290
is,
you know,

521
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,150
you hear monkey see monkey do,
right?

522
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:52,680
Well that's wrong,
monkey.

523
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:57,681
See that's the end of that
really can't imitate one another.

524
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:03,441
And they certainly can't imitate any
even randomly generated normal behavior

525
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:08,400
that another monkey producers think
about it this way.

526
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:10,260
You know,
we hear these claims that chimpanzees

527
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:11,520
have culture.
It's like,

528
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,383
well,
no,

529
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,010
they don't.
Not really.

530
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,710
And the reason for that,
it's easy to figure out that they don't

531
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:17,670
have culture.
I mean,

532
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,110
let's say chimps have been around
roughly speaking for 50 million years,

533
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,220
which is not a bad estimate because we
diverged from them about 7 million years

534
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:26,730
ago.

535
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,450
And the evidence is pretty clear that
the thing that we diverged from looked a

536
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:32,670
lot more like a chimp then it looked
like us.

537
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:36,180
So like we've been booting it ahead,
madly developing like mad and the chimps

538
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,640
would be laying back and eating leaves,
you know,

539
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:42,690
so.
So do they have a culture?

540
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,210
Well,
hey that 50 million years,

541
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,340
you know,
they haven't even built a hot yet.

542
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,750
And the reason I'm telling you that is
because if you're a culture generated

543
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:56,751
creature and you only magine match,
you'll only manage saying one discovery

544
00:28:57,451 --> 00:29:02,451
of a hundred years between all of you.
If you have 50 million years to get your

545
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:06,090
act together,
that's a lot of hundred year segments.

546
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,780
And so even if the chimpanzee was
building culture at the rate of 0.0,

547
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,910
zero,
zero 1% a year,

548
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:12,940
if you calm,
calm,

549
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,860
that over 50 million years,
you have the empire state building and

550
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:19,500
there are the empire state buildings
that chimpanzees are living in.

551
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,360
And so therefore they don't have
culture.

552
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:26,310
Now they might be able to recognize the,
their peers in the dominance hierarchy.

553
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,540
They can do that and they can use,
maybe they can use simple tools,

554
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,410
but the tools they use seem to be
dependent on the environment that they

555
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:35,700
inhabit.
You know,

556
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:38,100
cause some people say,
well some chips use one tool on some

557
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:39,450
chimps.
Use another button.

558
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,070
You know,
if you're going to live in a rocky

559
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,480
place,
then he might use rocks.

560
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,280
And if you're going to live in a place
that has sticks,

561
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:47,400
you might use sticks.
But that's not because you're a

562
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,820
different,
it's because the environment's

563
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:51,130
different.
So anyways,

564
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,060
chimps,
candy,

565
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,770
imitate one another very much.
Um,

566
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,980
but humans,
man were ridiculous.

567
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,210
Like we're,
we're so imitative.

568
00:29:58,211 --> 00:30:00,340
It's absolutely crazy.
You know?

569
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,960
And that's so cool because what it means
is that once you get a pattern of

570
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:05,680
behavior,
you,

571
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,170
you know,
you whip up a new pattern of behavior,

572
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,890
I can watch you and I can just
instantiate it in my own bloody,

573
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,930
you know,
maybe a bit awkwardly to begin with.

574
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,850
Although maybe sometimes better than you
can.

575
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,650
And Bang,
I've got that.

576
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,050
And so we're always looking around at
each other,

577
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,600
seeing what we're up to.
And as soon as we see someone who's up

578
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:25,330
to something interesting,
then we can do the same thing.

579
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,370
Children do that cause they imitate,
right?

580
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,840
But there are even better at it.
They generalize across instances of

581
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:33,280
imitation.
So for example,

582
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,920
you remember when you're a kid and
you're playing,

583
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,110
maybe you're playing house and you're
the mom,

584
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:38,950
or maybe,
I don't know,

585
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:42,070
maybe you're the house cat because
children will certainly do that.

586
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,360
And so let's say the child is being the
house cat.

587
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:46,240
So he or she is down on,
you know,

588
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:49,990
all forest zoom room,
like a cat maybe meowing and rubbing up

589
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:52,400
against there mother's leg and looking
for a male milk.

590
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:56,770
And the below.
They're not exactly imitating their cat

591
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,130
because if they were exactly imitating
their cat,

592
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,980
they would be moving exactly the same
way the cat move.

593
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,500
But now they're not.
What they're doing is they've observed

594
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,260
the cat across a wide variety of in of
environments.

595
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,560
They abstracted what constitutes
generalized cat behavior from all of

596
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,200
those instances.
And then they can instantiate the spirit

597
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,960
of the cap,
which is sort of the movements that make

598
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,300
up cactus.
And then you,

599
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:25,210
because you're so smart,
you can watch them zooming around on the

600
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:28,990
ground and despite the fact that they
don't have a tail or ears or refer,

601
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,250
you're going to figure it out pretty
quick.

602
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:34,480
That that is now a cat.
And children do the same thing with

603
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:36,640
their parents.
Like if they're playing house and the

604
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:38,080
imitate their father,
you know,

605
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:42,640
they may to some degree to try to
imitate the sound of his voice and maybe

606
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:44,770
even use a couple of his favorite
phrases.

607
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:49,950
But basically what they're doing is
trying to act like a father rather than

608
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,820
imitating their father.

609
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,560
So it's like imminence,
Metta,

610
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:54,600
imitation,
right?

611
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,541
It's like,
watch you,

612
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:56,680
I watch you,
I watch you,

613
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,860
I watch you.
There's commonalities across all of

614
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:01,590
those instances.
I extract the commonalities,

615
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,850
I embody it.
And then when I played that's what I'm

616
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:06,730
doing.
I'm figuring out how to embody the

617
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:09,580
commonalities across multiple exposures.
And that's,

618
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,470
that's you're doing that when you're
like three,

619
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,230
you're so smart.
And then even if you're asleep you're

620
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:19,231
doing it because you're doing it and
your dreams and so human beings do that.

621
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,970
No other animals do.
So when you're thinking about the ways

622
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:25,240
that we're weird,
you want to put invitation way up there

623
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:27,910
on the list because you can,
you know,

624
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,820
think about death.
People like congenitally deaf people

625
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,670
don't have much access to language.
You know say they don't learn sign

626
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,890
language because that used to happen in
the past.

627
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,580
It's like they can still wander around
in the world and in well why?

628
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,710
Well because they're so good at
imitating,

629
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,800
you know they get all the non verbal
stuff and that's a lot.

630
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,310
So languages,
you know,

631
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:54,311
great to all that APP which actually
enables you to imitate across space and

632
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:56,540
time.
That's what it's for.

633
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,501
Because,
you know,

634
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:01,100
maybe you whip up a new action and then
you write it down in words and then you

635
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:04,250
sent it to someone and they,
those are instructions by the way,

636
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:07,970
cause that's what instructions are you
send out to someone and then they read

637
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:10,100
your code for behavior and then they act
it out.

638
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,600
And so language enables you to move
invitation across space and time.

639
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,660
And that's a really good way of
conceptualizing and language because

640
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,160
it's a phd anyway because sometimes we
might think that language is there to

641
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:24,170
describe the world.
You know,

642
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,980
in the scientific sense,
George Kelly kind of thinks that,

643
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:29,690
that thought that,
that human beings are sort of like

644
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,010
natural scientists,
but natural scientists are much more

645
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,560
concerned with what is then with how to
act.

646
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,860
So Kelly's wrong.
What human beings are more like it's

647
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:43,520
natural engineers because we're always
zooming around and trying to figure out

648
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,550
how to fiddle with things much more than
what they are.

649
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,360
And as I mentioned to you earlier,
a pragmatist would say,

650
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,050
well it's an artificial distinction
because things are

651
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,390
what they are when you fiddle with them.
That's in fact what they are.

652
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,730
So it's,
that's pretty smart.

653
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,950
He goes,
he also says this is part of the

654
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:11,730
constructivist notion cause
constructivism is a philosophical

655
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:14,490
school.
He says no does nothing to get in the

656
00:34:14,491 --> 00:34:19,170
eye and it does not begin in the object.
It begins in the interactions.

657
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,830
There's a reciprocal and simultaneous
construction of the subject on the one

658
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:27,300
hand and the object on the other.
There is no structure apart from

659
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:29,430
construction,
either abstract or genetic.

660
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,670
I really liked that.
I showed you some of the symbolic

661
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:36,480
categories and a couple of you know,
previous lectures and I mentioned for

662
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:39,360
example that one of the symbolic
categories is the great father and a

663
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:41,850
great father kind of stamps for cultural
structure.

664
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,110
Whereas the great mother stands for
novelty and and then and,

665
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,750
and sometimes the terrifying.
Anyways,

666
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,370
back to the great father.

667
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:57,770
There's a precondition in constructivism
that there has to be three things that

668
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,780
exist.
They map right onto that symbolic

669
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:01,700
structure.
One is culture.

670
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,900
So when you look at something or really
with any creature looks at something,

671
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,640
there's an inbuilt structure that
characterizes the creatures,

672
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,910
some of which would be biological built
in,

673
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:15,260
there's some of which would be acquired
that they must have in order to

674
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:17,840
structure their perceptions of what
they're looking at.

675
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,410
So you don't come to the situation
blank.

676
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,060
You know,
for example,

677
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:24,860
you have two eyes so you can have stereo
vision.

678
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,980
Most of the time,
you know when you have five senses in

679
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:29,630
there at the same census and there's
more than that.

680
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:32,180
You have snake detection circuits for
example.

681
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:35,180
So you're sort of primed to respond to a
certain class of predators.

682
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,240
You like sweet tastes and sour taste,
but you don't really like spinner

683
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:41,040
tastes.
So on and so forth.

684
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:44,970
Like right from the beginning,
you've written how landscape of

685
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:50,030
interpreter structures in order to
frame and simplify

686
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,840
the world that you are exposed to.
Now the world itself is this sort of

687
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:01,180
amorphous thing.
It's amorphous cause it's so

688
00:36:01,181 --> 00:36:03,970
multidimensional and complex.
There's so much of it.

689
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:06,250
It's like a fog that contains
everything.

690
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,180
And so unless you can frame that and
simplify it and narrow it,

691
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:14,650
it's very difficult for you to
understand and interact with it at all.

692
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:15,340
I mean,
you,

693
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,990
you know,
you just can't deal with everything at

694
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:19,210
once.
It's hard enough to deal with one little

695
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,190
thing at a time.
And you know,

696
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:24,600
this internal structure is partly what
enables you to deal with one little

697
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:28,300
thing at a time.
And then so there's you and there's the,

698
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,780
the source of all information.
There's the structure of you and the

699
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:33,380
source of all information.
And then,

700
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:37,060
then there's the process that's you in
the process that's you,

701
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,390
is you using your appendages
fundamentally and your census to

702
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:46,480
interact with things and to make the
manifest new properties.

703
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,670
Right?
And so those are properties that they

704
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:52,600
might not manifest without you there.
And it's very difficult for you to tell

705
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:55,630
when you're interacting with the world,
even at a perceptual level,

706
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,130
how much of what you observe wouldn't be
there if you weren't there.

707
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,190
No.
So because one of the big philosophical

708
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:04,270
questions is,
well,

709
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:05,830
what's there?
And when you're not there.

710
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,150
And that is a much more complicated
question than you might imagine.

711
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,240
Um,
the,

712
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,710
the Dallas would say,
well,

713
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:17,170
what's,
there is so much an amalgam of

714
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:20,620
everything at once that it might as well
be nothing at all.

715
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,890
And it's sort of a,
I can give you a way of understanding

716
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:25,450
that.
So let's say you took every symphony

717
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,230
that was ever written,
recorded,

718
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,190
hey,
and then you took all those recordings

719
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:33,940
together and you laid one on top of the
other and you'd say,

720
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:37,960
well no,
I've got like every symphony at once on

721
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:39,400
a tape.
And then you played the tape.

722
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,360
What would it sound like?
It sound like white noise.

723
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,230
So it sounds like,

724
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:52,130
so you could say white noise is
functionally equivalent to every single

725
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:54,710
symphony that's ever been written.
Every piece of music that's ever been

726
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:56,510
written,
all being played at once.

727
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,430
So what,
you know,

728
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,050
so when the Dallas would also say,
you have to remember that what something

729
00:38:03,051 --> 00:38:05,990
is,
is just as dependent on what it isn't as

730
00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:09,860
it is dependent on what it is.
So that's a tough one,

731
00:38:09,861 --> 00:38:10,940
but it's very,
very smart.

732
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,760
So the constructor,
this would certainly agree with that.

733
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,660
No.
Bruner who was a constructivist of

734
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:20,840
sorts,
put a little twist on Piaget's idea,

735
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,050
which I'm going to borrow because I
think it makes explaining piaget easier.

736
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,630
At least it makes it easier for me.
And since I'm explaining it,

737
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:28,820
that's that's what we're going to have
to go for it.

738
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,300
Bruner said,
we seem to have no other way of

739
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:35,500
describing live time.
Save in a form of narrative.

740
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,780
Now the reason I think this is a Ph in
constructivist claim is because piaget

741
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:44,860
is concerned with knowledge as it
emerges from action.

742
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,530
And action is clearly represented
narratives,

743
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:49,180
right?
Because the narrative is about what the

744
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:51,820
characters are doing.
So narrative is the way that we

745
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:56,821
represent the information about doing so
and knowledge for Piaget is about doing.

746
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,980
So I just put the two together and that
and that.

747
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:02,740
There's other reasons for it too.
And that makes it simpler to explain.

748
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:06,460
So here's,
here's a way of thinking about how we

749
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,070
put a structure on the world.
So I'm not mentioned,

750
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,170
I kind of introduced you to this idea
before.

751
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,910
So you're headed somewhere wherever that
happens to be because you're an active

752
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:17,860
organism and so you're,
you know,

753
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:20,710
even if you're don't have any immediate
needs,

754
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,170
you're going to poke about things just
because you're curious.

755
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,540
It turns out that your dopaminergic
system,

756
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,460
which is the system that drives
curiosity,

757
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,750
fires at a certain constant rate,
even if you're not hungry or tired or

758
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:35,560
thirsty or you know,
even if no primary needs are clamoring

759
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:37,150
for your attention.
So your,

760
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,930
your default comfortable status,
mildly curious about everything.

761
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,960
And so that's part of what makes you an
information for a jury.

762
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:47,140
Because when you have nothing better to
do so to speak,

763
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,160
you'll just poke around and see what
happens because you never know that no

764
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,520
itch might come in useful in the future.
So anyways,

765
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,210
you're always going from point a to
point b because you're active and in the

766
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:02,170
way you get from point a to point B,
even if point b is an abstraction

767
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,880
because it often is,
you know,

768
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:07,930
I am going towards a better future.
Well that's kind of a weird abstraction.

769
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,520
How are you going to get there?
Well,

770
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:12,730
you can be sure that at the base it's
going to involve movement,

771
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,830
right?
Because you get to that future,

772
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,570
there's,
there's movements you're going to have

773
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:18,370
to bake.
So

774
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,320
see
structured this

775
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,660
going to go ahead to something
sick.

776
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,820
Okay.
So we're going to look at this.

777
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,340
We're do look at this diagram,
then we're gonna go back.

778
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,350
So,
um,

779
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,460
let's start with an abstract
philosophical concepts.

780
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,370
I want to be a good person.
While you might debate forever about

781
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,010
what the good beans,
right?

782
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,270
It's the sort of philosophical conundrum
that you can fall into because you take

783
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:36,830
an abstractions and then you might think
of it as a property if the world,

784
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,990
and it's something that's subject to put
in the bait,

785
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,120
which is exactly what's happening in the
history of mankind.

786
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,700
But there's another way of looking at it
that's actually probably more accurate.

787
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,150
And I would say almost more useful.
And this is the way,

788
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,840
so you're going to try to be a good
person.

789
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,460
Well,
the Phn and view,

790
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:56,930
it would be being a good person.
It's not a state of mind.

791
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,920
What it is,
is it abstraction that represents all

792
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:04,130
first other associated abstractions.

793
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,960
Because we could say,
well,

794
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:08,420
being a good person,
it's a multidimensional problems,

795
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:09,320
right?
You can't,

796
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,360
you can't just be good and then it's
done.

797
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,780
It's like being a good person might be
being good at.

798
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,570
Well what?
Well good at being a friend.

799
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,830
Good at being a lover,
good at being a parent,

800
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,390
good at being a child,
good at being an employee.

801
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,520
You can know,
you could say what good is,

802
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:30,050
what's the same across all those things.
And PSJ would call that a scheme just so

803
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:32,090
you know,
because the scheme is what's the same

804
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,390
across multiple different things.
So,

805
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,090
and the scheme is the basis of
abstraction for Psa.

806
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,300
So good person is the sum total or the
or the commonalities between being a

807
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:47,150
good
teacher,

808
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,000
student,
employee,

809
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,040
etc. Okay.
So then we'll say,

810
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:53,630
okay,
so now we can move the problem with

811
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:56,270
analysis one level down and we can say,
okay,

812
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,910
well what does it mean to be a good
parent?

813
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,081
And then you'd say,
well,

814
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:02,180
maybe you have to have a good job
because you know,

815
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:05,570
otherwise you and your child starved.
But we'll forget about that one for a

816
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:07,100
moment.
And then you might say,

817
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:08,870
well,
you have to do a good job of taking care

818
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:10,280
of your family.
Okay,

819
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:15,281
so you notice we're zeroing in on an
element of the good here and it's still

820
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:19,640
an abstraction care for your family.
That's an extraction.

821
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,340
So then they might say,
well one of the things you would do if

822
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:24,800
you care through your family is playing
with the baby.

823
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:28,790
And another might be complete a meal.
So we'll take the play with the baby

824
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,130
example,
and then there's three things you can do

825
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:33,630
with your baby peek at it.
They liked that.

826
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,220
So optic permanent.
Say there's nothing more thrilling to a

827
00:43:37,221 --> 00:43:40,340
baby.
Then discovering that you're still there

828
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:44,180
when you disappear like a baby,
you can amuse her baby for hours with

829
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:47,030
that discovery because it's by no means
self evident to the baby.

830
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,150
That's a Piagetian notion.
They lack off object permanence.

831
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,690
So as far as they're concerned,
it's a hell of a shock when you

832
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:56,810
disappear because they were just
appreciate it and you'd be there and

833
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:58,910
then they're just a shark when you
reappear and you can,

834
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:02,570
it's so interesting to watch them
because when a baby gets startled,

835
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,100
like when you get started with,
you know,

836
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:07,310
you might go like that if you're really
starting a baby,

837
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,730
it's like it's whole body is starting,
right?

838
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,700
Like it makes a weird face and it moves
its arms and its legs and then it takes

839
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:15,890
me like five seconds to recover.
You know,

840
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:18,020
they really have a startle reflex,
so,

841
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,440
and they'll often laugh.
I'm sure you've seen the laughing babies

842
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:25,430
on youtube because of course there's
like a 2 billion views of laughing

843
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:26,930
babies,
which is a good thing.

844
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:28,190
It shows that we like babies.

845
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,010
I think there's one that's very famous
where a baby is reacting to his mother

846
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,580
either sneezing or coughing
caught.

847
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,250
It's absolutely hilarious.
This baby just has a fit.

848
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,980
And what's basically happening is it's
mother costs,

849
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:43,560
I think it's coughs or sneezes.
He knows.

850
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:44,830
Oh,
okay.

851
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:45,840
Oh yeah.
She blows her nose.

852
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:50,460
So she makes this weird elephant like
noise and the baby's mother could do

853
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:53,880
this and then get surprised at its own
startle.

854
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,660
And that makes it,
that's a really interesting phenomena

855
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:01,590
from a Piagetian perspective because one
of the things that Piaget noticed the

856
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:04,890
children did because they could imitate,
was imitate themselves.

857
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,810
That's how they got to know who they
were.

858
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:10,850
So for example,
if a child would say chub would actually

859
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,170
up north that off,
but the reading,

860
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,690
well that's a hell of a thing to
discover.

861
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,840
You know,
if you move your arm just a little bit,

862
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,240
that will fall off.

863
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,070
That's cool.
So then maybe you can do that 60 70

864
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:28,260
times while you're supposed to be
eating.

865
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,500
And the other thing that's really cool
about doing that as that mom,

866
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,300
Lou immediately rushed over and picked
it up and put it back.

867
00:45:33,301 --> 00:45:37,410
And this is an excellent game.
You can entertain yourself with that for

868
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:39,870
like a month.
And basically what you're discovering is

869
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:42,060
the relationship between your movements
and gravity,

870
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,710
right?
It's like this is a major leak

871
00:45:43,711 --> 00:45:45,690
discovery.
It's no wonder you're obsessed with it.

872
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,810
So.
So anyways,

873
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,920
the point with regards to the invitation
is maybe the baby does this accidentally

874
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:57,750
to begin with.
That startles them and then it's put up

875
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:00,390
again and then they think,
well that was cool.

876
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,280
Wonder if we can do that again.
And then they're pretty happy with that.

877
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,540
And then they'll keep practicing that
until they get like expert at doing

878
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:10,020
that.

879
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,780
So instead of using like gross body
movements to do it,

880
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,230
which is how they'd start,
they get developed finer and finer and

881
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:21,210
finer body movements until they've got
the whole narky light thing off a table

882
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,120
down.
And it can even be fascinating as an

883
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:24,721
adult.
Some of them,

884
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:27,450
you've probably played table hockey,
you know with the quarter,

885
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,520
you know how to do that.
Put a quarter on a table.

886
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,140
It's not very complicated.
You make little goals.

887
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,490
Your,
your job is to flip the thing so that it

888
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:40,730
just sits that far over the table and so
that the appointment can flip it up.

889
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,380
That's,
that's like your opportunity to score a

890
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:46,440
goal.
My point is playing with how things move

891
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:49,980
in relationship to friction and gravity
is so engrossing to human beings that

892
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:52,140
you can even make a game out of it if
you're,

893
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,240
you know,
a relatively board and stupid adult.

894
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,130
I played that game all the time with my
son by the way.

895
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:01,560
So I put myself in that category as
well.

896
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,860
Now what the child is doing is they will
accidentally in some ways bumble into

897
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:11,630
something interesting and then it
recognizes that it's interesting in

898
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,040
because that's a reflex action on his
part.

899
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,220
And then once it recognizes that it's
had that reflex action,

900
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:20,040
which is kind of,
it's pleasurable,

901
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:22,950
is as long as it's not too intense,
it's at least interesting.

902
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,080
Then they'll try to imitate what they
just did.

903
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,100
So part of the way you master yourself
is by imitating yourself after you've

904
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:31,080
asked.
Definitely do dot.

905
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,160
It's something interesting.
It's so smart.

906
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:35,350
So that's a phd had no shit.
So anyways,

907
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,350
you're playing with the baby and you can
play piece with the baby.

908
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,720
That's a good one.
You're teaching it that you're still

909
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:43,630
there even though you went away and you
can take all the baby,

910
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:48,380
which is best done in moderation because
it's not exactly clear that babies enjoy

911
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,790
that.

912
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,040
They just laugh when you do that so that
you like them.

913
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:55,000
Don't throw them out the window when
they're being annoying and then you can

914
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,480
clean the baby to say tho those are
elements of the care of a baby.

915
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:00,490
I know that's not very sophisticated,
but you know,

916
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,250
those are some of the basics.
Now the thing that's different about

917
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:08,340
playing with baby and tickled baby is
that play with baby is an abstraction.

918
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,920
Whereas tickle baby is an action,
right?

919
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,350
And so when you're trying to solve the
mind body problem,

920
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,650
this is how you solve it.
The mind is those abstractions,

921
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,930
the ball,
and he's the actions that those

922
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:24,310
abstractions ground themselves in.
So it sounded like the mind is attached

923
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:26,590
to the body.
It's the mind is a sequence of

924
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:30,730
hierarchically arranged abstractions,
the bottom level of which are not

925
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:32,080
abstractions,
their actions.

926
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:35,460
There's a qualitative transformation at
the bottom of the higher,

927
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:38,560
the highest resolution level of the
hierarchy.

928
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,790
It's action.
Now you can understand piaget very,

929
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:47,791
very easily if you understand that the
way a baby develops as far as piaget is,

930
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:51,970
concern is from the bottom up.
So the baby starts with,

931
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:55,540
it's laying in his crib,
it's a useless thing.

932
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,450
It's laying there.
It can't even focus its eyes,

933
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,490
you know,
it's just barely getting going.

934
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:04,480
So it's sort of floating in space trying
to figure out what's going on,

935
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:08,540
you know and it doesn't even know that
it has arms really just sort of detects

936
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:13,190
texts these things off to the side and
loft it bomb itself in the face with its

937
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,260
arms or scratch itself cause you have to
cut baby's nails really short.

938
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,200
It's otherwise they scratched themselves
because their arms are just,

939
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:23,000
you know,
wandering around randomly and the baby

940
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,180
sorts.
From a Piagetian perspective,

941
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:30,181
the baby starts to learn that,
learn what his body is capable of doing

942
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:32,710
and some of that it just discovers by
accident.

943
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:37,510
Now there's no doubt some natural
neurological progression that's going

944
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:40,240
on.
So the baby is learning along the past

945
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:44,320
that babies can learn.
But still my piaget's perspective,

946
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:48,580
the baby is doing quite a bit of
exploring to facilitate its neurological

947
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:52,030
development and more complex animals may
be doing that in the womb,

948
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,680
you know,
trying out their legs and so on,

949
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,720
so,
so that they can run it as soon as they,

950
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,010
you know,
as soon as they get up.

951
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,660
So it's not even obvious that all that
sort of thing is reflexive and automatic

952
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,950
in an animal that is more active when
exported.

953
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:10,540
So the baby is begins by basically it
sort of develops from the middle

954
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:13,750
outward.
So what's the baby got when it first

955
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:16,760
pops into the world?
Well I can't see very well,

956
00:50:16,761 --> 00:50:18,670
although it can focus on about 12
inches,

957
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:22,300
which conveniently is about the distance
that his head is from its mother's eyes

958
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:23,170
if it's breastfeeding.

959
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,010
So that's good for social communication.
So the mother can gaze at the baby and

960
00:50:28,011 --> 00:50:30,800
the baby can gaze at the mother and for
some reason they both find that

961
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:35,180
fascinating.
So babies also very well wired up around

962
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:38,840
the mouth so it can use its mouth quite
a lot and it can use its Tom,

963
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,090
those,
those come pre wired.

964
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,090
So,
and this is kind of a frightening

965
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,680
observation.
So at the beginning the baby really is

966
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:50,180
oral because that's all it works.
Like it could smell too,

967
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:51,980
you know.
But,

968
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,881
but it's,
it's,

969
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:56,480
it's,
it's voluntary capacity for action is

970
00:50:56,481 --> 00:51:00,390
really centered around its mouth.
And you'll notice that babies infant are

971
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,020
toddlers even love to put things in
their mouth.

972
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,430
My son,
when he was a kid,

973
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:06,650
he used to go in the backyard.
We did feed them.

974
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,880
So that is the reason he goes to the
backyard and pick up acorns and stuff.

975
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,680
His cheeks with them,
just like a chipmunk.

976
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,230
And so,
you know,

977
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,020
then we take them up to the bath and
we'd have to like dig all the acorns out

978
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:20,630
of his cheeks.
And he did that for oh God.

979
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,550
Way longer than you'd expect any same
child to do it.

980
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,390
So,
but the reason that he would put things

981
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:29,660
in his mouth and you think about this is
there's nothing that's a better

982
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:32,720
exploratory Oregon.
Then your tongue,

983
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,060
I mean,
check out one of your teeth.

984
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,860
Bloody thing feels like it's about this
big to your tongue.

985
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,180
As you'll notice if you ever get a two,
three boom,

986
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,390
it's like the Grand Canyon was just
extension inside your mouth.

987
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:49,040
And then of course your tongue will work
like mad of its own accord to

988
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:54,041
investigate every tiny little crevice in
that new hole because your brain wants

989
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:56,180
to know what's your mouth and what
isn't.

990
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,660
So that if there's something in your
mouth that either should or shouldn't be

991
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,940
a,
it can tell it from you and B,

992
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:03,830
it can tell whether or not it's supposed
to be there.

993
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:05,630
It turns out to be very important,
right?

994
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:07,880
Because while there's tooth decay,
that's a problem.

995
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,070
But you know there's also insects and
poison and all sorts of other things

996
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:16,670
that you shouldn't put in your mouth.
So don't underestimate the degree to

997
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:20,990
which you can zoom around the world like
a know hoover vacuum cleaner and pick up

998
00:52:20,991 --> 00:52:24,500
our god awful amount of information.
And of course you're also seemed that

999
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:27,590
way obviously.
And so you know,

1000
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,680
you're checking out your mother with
your mouth and your tongue and a very

1001
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,480
meaningful way to,
and well,

1002
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:35,810
you're feeding at the breast,
you're establishing the basis of social

1003
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:38,390
relationships.
Now this puts a bit of a warp into the

1004
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:40,160
piaget,
the hypothesis,

1005
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:44,590
because piaget sort of assumed if the
baby built,

1006
00:52:44,591 --> 00:52:46,820
he builds himself from the bottom up,
right?

1007
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,900
But one of the things you have to
understand is that the baby is always

1008
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,600
picking up how to behave and see in a
very,

1009
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:55,160
very,
very social context.

1010
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,000
Even when it's so young.
That phd would regard it as primarily

1011
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:01,860
egocentric because what the hell does a
baby knew about you?

1012
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:06,320
You know?
But the mother is teaching the child how

1013
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:08,840
to act right from the time.
It's a little tiny thing.

1014
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:11,480
Like if it's going to breastfeed,
it has to do it in a relatively

1015
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:15,620
civilized manner because if it bites his
mother or her mother,

1016
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,380
which are baby can do,
they can really chump you a good one.

1017
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:22,970
If their minds are made up to do that,
it's like unpleasant consequences are

1018
00:53:22,971 --> 00:53:26,000
going to ensue.
At minimum the mother is going to start

1019
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,090
[inaudible],
you know,

1020
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,420
stop feeding the baby and maybe she'll
put the baby down or,

1021
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,220
or God only knows.

1022
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,080
One time when my son was very young,
I guess he was about 13 months,

1023
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:41,190
he had just learned to walk and he
walked up to my wife who was wearing

1024
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:45,450
shorts and he bit her right here and a
good chunk.

1025
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:50,451
He was just teasing and she reflex
reflex and he like,

1026
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:57,110
he must have flown six feet.
It's like that's how you socialize

1027
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:02,150
children against the sudden bias.
So even the smallest alterations of

1028
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:06,690
their behavior take place within an
intensely social context.

1029
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:09,690
So even at this level,
this society is,

1030
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,040
is helping guide and restrict the
development of the child's motor

1031
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:18,270
activities.
Now children tend to develop,

1032
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,300
as I said,
they develop gross body movements first.

1033
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,180
So they kind of learn to fling their
arms.

1034
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:28,080
So maybe you put a mobile in the crib
for your baby,

1035
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:29,520
look at,
by the way,

1036
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:32,460
most mobiles you'll notice maybe their
fish.

1037
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,700
So you're a parent,
you're standing here and this is the

1038
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:40,701
side of the fish and this is the bottom
of the fish and that's what the baby is

1039
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:44,310
looking at.
It's like the baby is looking at lines

1040
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,770
because the fish in here for the adults,
it's like that's a stupid mobile.

1041
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:53,090
You get that fish turned over so that
baby can see the fish and then you make

1042
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:56,250
them out of like black and white because
babies are very good at picking up high

1043
00:54:56,251 --> 00:55:00,030
contrast and that's a baby mobile rather
than a mother and mobile.

1044
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:03,000
So you got to decide whether the mobile
is for you or for your baby.

1045
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:06,390
So anyways,
you put the mobile above the baby and he

1046
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:10,470
kind of want to put it within limb
length and then the baby will watch this

1047
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:11,700
thing.
Who knows?

1048
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:13,470
Maybe tonight to Devin.
By this,

1049
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:14,180
the,
we know,

1050
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,460
it's like,
you know,

1051
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,320
and then it'll will sort of flail boat.
Like it does not very well controlled

1052
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:24,590
better.
And maybe it will flail an arm or leg

1053
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:27,840
and now I'm to get lucky and it'll nail
one of those fish.

1054
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:33,200
And now starbucks.
And so usually that it might try that

1055
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,700
because that might have just,
if it's a neurotic baby,

1056
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,190
it'll cry.
It's like that's too much for today.

1057
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:43,830
But if it's a kind of a outgoing,
exploratory maybe,

1058
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,400
then the next thing it's really good to
want to do is to figure out how to make

1059
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:50,520
that fish move again.
And then it'll sit there and practice

1060
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:53,060
flailing its leg.
It's like it's throwing its leg at the

1061
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:55,860
fish and if it gets lucky it will nail
it a good one.

1062
00:55:55,861 --> 00:55:57,960
And then that'll make it laugh.
And then,

1063
00:55:57,961 --> 00:55:59,910
you know,
the practice doing that over a sequence

1064
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:03,510
of babies are persistent manner.
So when my daughter was little,

1065
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:07,680
she was about 18 months old.
We bought her this little cardboard box

1066
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:10,050
that had little cardboard,
Disney books in it,

1067
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,470
you know,
and she didn't care what the Disney

1068
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,360
books where,
what she was really interested in is

1069
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,260
getting those three books out of the
Disney blocks and then trying to get the

1070
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:21,390
back end.
Cause it turned out that was quite

1071
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:24,520
difficult because they fit tightly.
So this was a great puzzle for her.

1072
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,050
Cause you know,
she was still getting the whole

1073
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:31,051
coordination thing going and she'd sip
for like three hours getting those

1074
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:36,640
bother those books in that box.
And that was like a toy for,

1075
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,720
for a week until she figured it out.
And then she was on to bigger and better

1076
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:41,554
things.

1077
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:44,950
But that's a big deal,
right?

1078
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:46,780
You can imagine what you're doing.
You're logically,

1079
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:49,510
when you're doing that,
it's like first of all,

1080
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,430
you've got to grip that book property
second you go to oriented precisely

1081
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,420
third as you add the additional books to
the box,

1082
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,150
the shape changes because the book's
flop over,

1083
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,100
you know,
cause they'll flop over diagonally.

1084
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:05,350
So the shape changes.
Who's going to figure out how to adjust

1085
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:09,790
that and then the book itself will open
and that will get in the way.

1086
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,730
So you're going to keep the book closed
and you know the tolerances that are

1087
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:15,340
like an 18th of an inch.
So,

1088
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,970
so you want to master that.
And like some people don't.

1089
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:22,660
I had a client once who had a very low
fluid intelligence,

1090
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,720
probably 75 80 you would have known it
by looking at him but he couldn't find

1091
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:29,494
employment.

1092
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,000
Surprise,
surprise.

1093
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,040
There's,
there's no jobs in our society for

1094
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:35,940
people who are at that end of the
cognitive distribution.

1095
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,160
I got to the volunteer job at one point
and his job was to put paper in

1096
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:44,230
envelopes,
had to fold it up in three cause that's

1097
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:47,050
how you fold up a piece of paper and
then you have to put an envelope.

1098
00:57:47,051 --> 00:57:49,630
But that actually turns out to be hyper
complex.

1099
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:54,310
I probably trained him for 28 to 30
hours to do that.

1100
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,960
And because
when you do it next time or you could do

1101
00:57:58,961 --> 00:58:00,580
it now,
you just think about what you're doing

1102
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,850
is first of all,
merely by observing the piece of paper,

1103
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:07,660
you'd have to figure out how to make the
first full and it better be damn close

1104
00:58:07,661 --> 00:58:09,430
to one third.
Because if it isn't,

1105
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:12,220
when you make the second fold,
you're going to compound your error and

1106
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:15,330
then you're going to find,
to your chagrin than a piece of paper

1107
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:19,090
does not fit in the envelopes because
the envelope is exactly the same size as

1108
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:19,924
the piece of paper.

1109
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,680
So if you're out by your estimate,
say a quarter of an inch in your first

1110
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:25,870
full of road by half inch of your second
fold,

1111
00:58:25,871 --> 00:58:28,060
it's like it's not going in there.
Or if,

1112
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,750
if you don't fold it completely at 90
degrees,

1113
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:33,160
you know,
so the edges line up,

1114
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,640
say you're out by a 16th of an inch and
then you do that again.

1115
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:39,160
So now you're out by eight,
it won't fit in sideways.

1116
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,840
So then you have to mangle the envelope
to,

1117
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,820
to get the paper in there.
And then by the time you've done

1118
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,230
mangling the envelope,
not only does it look ugly,

1119
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,810
but he will not go through an automatic
sorting machine.

1120
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,750
So,
and then added to that was the problem

1121
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:56,140
that on these pieces of paper,
there were often photograph staple

1122
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:58,150
because he was working for a charity.
So then,

1123
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,840
but the photographs weren't always
stapled at exactly the same place on the

1124
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:02,674
piece of paper.

1125
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,710
So then you'd have to look at the piece
of paper and he'd have to figure out

1126
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:08,620
where the photograph is and then you'd
have to figure out how to fold a piece

1127
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:12,070
of paper so that he didn't bend the
photographs so that it would still fit

1128
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:14,330
in the envelope.
And that just used to,

1129
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,830
he just sweat himself to death trying to
solve that problem because there was

1130
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:20,080
time pressure too.
So,

1131
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,600
and there's an added level of complexity
on top of that.

1132
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:27,020
And the reason I'm telling you this,
because you'll give it some sense of how

1133
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,590
you know,
simple actions are aggregated into

1134
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,250
increasingly complex operations.
Some of the envelopes were French and

1135
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:36,440
some of them are English because it was
Canada.

1136
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,950
And so you couldn't put a French letter
in an English envelope if the French

1137
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:43,250
ones had to go in a separate pile.
And then there was a huge stack say of

1138
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:46,760
English letters and a huge stack of
English envelopes,

1139
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:51,050
all of which hypothetically had been
stacked so that each one on to the

1140
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:53,720
other,
but now and then one of them would be

1141
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:54,554
out of alignment.

1142
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,650
So then you had to figure out whether it
was the letters that were out of the

1143
00:59:57,651 --> 01:00:00,350
alignment or the envelopes.
Well that's a,

1144
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,640
that's a high complexity working memory
problem that just bring him to a

1145
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:07,640
standstill.
So anyways,

1146
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,550
you know,
during typical development you develop

1147
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:13,370
those incredibly fine motor skills,
easy early,

1148
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,040
which is part of the reason why it's
kind of Nice to have your baby,

1149
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,420
toddler,
infant do something by itself,

1150
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,850
you know,
like sit there with a box until it gets

1151
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:25,730
a little bored and then it'll start to
figure out what to do with the box.

1152
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:29,000
And that's part of play.
And that's part of the development of

1153
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:33,020
its in boarding conceptual structure.
So,

1154
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:34,310
okay.
So,

1155
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:37,130
so you basically the chain these things
together.

1156
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,800
Now the way that piaget,
he thought,

1157
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:41,810
well what's the motivation for doing
this?

1158
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,090
So the motivation is essentially is
that,

1159
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:02,280
well sometimes it can be sort of random.
You accidentally do something

1160
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:05,820
interesting and then try to repeat it.
But as you sort of develop the number of

1161
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:09,270
times that you do something accidentally
that results in something interesting

1162
01:01:09,271 --> 01:01:12,810
starts to decline.
Now what part on what happens to you as

1163
01:01:12,811 --> 01:01:17,700
you mature is that the opportunities
that are provided for you by your body

1164
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,490
as you exercise and then develop it,
start,

1165
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,121
continue,
you know,

1166
01:01:21,121 --> 01:01:24,600
start to really ramp up and develop so
that you can do a lot more interesting

1167
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:27,630
things with your body by the time you're
two then you can,

1168
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,390
when you're nine months old for example,
you can zoom around,

1169
01:01:30,391 --> 01:01:33,690
which just opens up a whole universe of
things to pull over and dump over and

1170
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:38,370
pull off tables and you know,
and there's things lying around that you

1171
01:01:38,371 --> 01:01:41,160
can write on walls with and you can pull
out cupboards and it's like,

1172
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,511
it's,
it's,

1173
01:01:42,511 --> 01:01:43,440
it's,
you know,

1174
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,450
paradise for an exploratory date.

1175
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,100
Maybe.
So,

1176
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:51,810
but what happens is that as the child
puts himself or herself together

1177
01:01:51,811 --> 01:01:54,480
physically and develops additional
skills,

1178
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,340
then they can elicit additional
manifestations of novelty from the

1179
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,080
world.
So for example,

1180
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:01,770
right?
Well,

1181
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:05,070
here's a good example.
So the child finally manages to get

1182
01:02:05,071 --> 01:02:08,130
itself upright,
which is like a colossal,

1183
01:02:08,131 --> 01:02:11,550
colossal,
an amazing accomplishment.

1184
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,750
You know what I mean?
First of all,

1185
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,650
that's hard to do.
Like no,

1186
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,500
there are two legged creatures in the
world except for us,

1187
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:21,570
you know,
and we're so good at this.

1188
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,340
You can even,
isn't that wonderful?

1189
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:26,190
I learned that when I was two.
So you know,

1190
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,140
you can do these amazing things with
your body,

1191
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:31,650
but the child is like trying to put
itself together neurologically and it's

1192
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:35,040
a hell of an operation to get this call
them of bone.

1193
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,250
It's like jellyfish on a bone,
you know,

1194
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,380
or,
or stack bones and you got to get the

1195
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,790
thing to stand up upright.

1196
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,750
God ridiculously difficult.
So the child manages that.

1197
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:48,070
There's a lot of pain and anguish
associated with that,

1198
01:02:48,071 --> 01:02:49,290
right?
Because those little creatures,

1199
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:53,460
they just fall down and you know,
and they got these little short arms.

1200
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:56,100
So they're not much good at protecting
themselves from impact.

1201
01:02:56,101 --> 01:03:00,060
They're just bouncing off the walls like
mad and the floor up and they're trying

1202
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:02,370
to learn to walk.
Then they finally get themselves up

1203
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:04,500
right and tartar along and followed and
so on.

1204
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,830
But then you know,
then the world turns into a different

1205
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:11,910
place because all of a sudden now you
can stand up underneath the table.

1206
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:14,400
That's the fun.
That's a fun thing to do for the first

1207
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:15,690
time.
It's like lack.

1208
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:21,030
So now your new body has taught you
something about the world that you did

1209
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:24,000
not know.
So what piaget would say is,

1210
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,590
well,
you've got the scheme worked out,

1211
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:27,210
which is the standing up scheme.

1212
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,480
And it turns out that at works pretty
well if you're in an empty space.

1213
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,270
But if you're in a close space with a
low ceiling,

1214
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:39,480
the whole standing rock thing,
it's just not going to produce,

1215
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:43,410
produce the results intended.
So he had stand up and whack yourself

1216
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,730
and that's a sign that it's time to
update your representational structures.

1217
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:52,950
And so you can think of that technically
as the emergence of the normally into

1218
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,790
what would have otherwise been a
conceptually protected space.

1219
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,500
PSA has this idea of acrylic ration.
So let's say your baby crawls

1220
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,930
and let's say it's a Nyquil upgraded
crawler,

1221
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,560
which means it's kind of an expert in
babies get pretty expert crawlers by

1222
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:12,120
about,
I'd say 1213 months,

1223
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:17,670
hey can zoom around and they know how
luck I bumped into things and you know

1224
01:04:17,671 --> 01:04:20,070
how to crawl around without hurting
themselves.

1225
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:23,850
So when they crawl around only the
things that they want to have happen

1226
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:27,840
half most of the time,
and there are cooperating at that point

1227
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:33,290
because their actions and their
conceptions of the consequence of those

1228
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:34,920
actions match.

1229
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:39,240
They've got no problem.
What they expect or want to have happen

1230
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:44,230
when they crawl is what happens.
That babies APP has mastered a

1231
01:04:44,231 --> 01:04:47,820
developmental stage.
So that's the stage idea and that's the

1232
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,580
calibrated stage idea.
Corroboration is a brilliant idea and

1233
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:53,190
I'll tell you why in a minute.
But then all of a sudden the baby learns

1234
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:55,140
to stand up.
It's like,

1235
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:58,170
oh,
I did advance.

1236
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:01,860
But it's like a revolutionary advance,
right?

1237
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,900
It's equivalent to a revolution in
science,

1238
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,180
which is why psg mentioned coon.
It's like,

1239
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,880
well,
now I'm a standing creature.

1240
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:13,440
The whole crawling expertise is hardly
worth it at all.

1241
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,570
You know,
there's some transfer of knowledge,

1242
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:20,650
but the you new universe that's made
accessible to the baby by it's now

1243
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:25,680
daunting ability to stand forces it to
revolutionize its entire cognitive

1244
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:30,460
structure.
Now I'll give you want to tell you a

1245
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:32,140
very quick story because it's a very
good one.

1246
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:37,240
So this is a good indication of the
function of dream in place.

1247
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:41,440
So when my daughter was three,
she couldn't talk very well.

1248
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:44,860
She,
she learned to speak late and we lived

1249
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:46,430
in Boston and when she learned to speak,
cheat,

1250
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,140
developed a Boston accent,
which we were completely flabbergasted

1251
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:53,740
by because we didn't have a Boston
accent and neither did any of our

1252
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,470
neighbors.
It turns out there's a speech impediment

1253
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:59,590
that sounds just like a Boston accent.
But anyway,

1254
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:04,690
she was
usually goes away except in Boston.

1255
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,230
So anyway,
she,

1256
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:12,370
she was,
she was three and when her brother was

1257
01:06:12,371 --> 01:06:13,720
born,
there's always the possibility of

1258
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:14,830
sibling rivalry,
right?

1259
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:16,090
Because,
and for good reason,

1260
01:06:16,091 --> 01:06:17,080
it's like,
okay,

1261
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:20,680
time to get rid of that thing.
All it's doing is taking a hold of mum's

1262
01:06:20,681 --> 01:06:21,431
attention.
You know,

1263
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:26,170
like that's a hard reality for a child
who's under three to manage because

1264
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:27,880
they're still pretty dependent and it's
like,

1265
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,850
well why should they be liking this
horrible,

1266
01:06:30,851 --> 01:06:35,530
noisy attention grabbing interloper?
So we tried to,

1267
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:38,560
we tried to teach her right from the
time he came home,

1268
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:39,320
her,
her,

1269
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,300
her brother,
that the idea where she was going to

1270
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:45,610
lose something,
which was some parental attention,

1271
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:48,640
especially from her mother,
but she was potentially going to gain

1272
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:52,870
something which was maturity,
independence and the possibility of a

1273
01:06:52,871 --> 01:06:54,730
new relationship.
Now we couldn't tell her that.

1274
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:58,150
Some parents will tell their three year
olds that it's like in your three year

1275
01:06:58,151 --> 01:06:58,810
old is learning.

1276
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:01,960
But look at you when you talk.
But they're actually hearing,

1277
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,390
you know how dogs in cartoons here,
people talk.

1278
01:07:04,391 --> 01:07:06,120
It's like one on one on one,
one on a walk.

1279
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,580
Why don't want to walk.
That's how children hear you talk when

1280
01:07:09,581 --> 01:07:11,370
you're talking to them about something
like independence.

1281
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:13,060
Like what the hell did they know about
that?

1282
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:17,830
That's way up there on the hierarchy.
But we tried to teach her to interact

1283
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:21,940
with the baby in such a way that she
would elicit positive feedback from him

1284
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,640
and so that they can be friends.
And then we also taught her that she

1285
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,620
should take care of the baby and that
gives her something to do.

1286
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,170
So that worked.
We also didn't let them tease each

1287
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:30,580
other.
Not much.

1288
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,590
You know,
they're going to tease each other a bit

1289
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,620
because it,
siblings often bloody hate each other

1290
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:36,910
when they're,
when they're young.

1291
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,880
And sometimes that just destroys the
relationship for their whole life.

1292
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,790
It's like you don't want that because
you're stuck with your dad and brother

1293
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:44,500
until he dies,
hopefully,

1294
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:47,500
or until you do.
So.

1295
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,620
Anyway,
so my daughter was taking care of this

1296
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:53,410
little guy and you know,
she used to watch them on the stamps and

1297
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:56,050
sort of shepherd him around and she was,
she was pretty good at it.

1298
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,260
And then,
um,

1299
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:03,510
one day he started to walk and she kept
talking about her baby and we told her

1300
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:04,450
that,
well,

1301
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:08,350
he wasn't reading a baby anymore and we
didn't realize that this was setting off

1302
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:12,580
a cognitive revolution of the Piagetian
cert because of course she'd Kinda grown

1303
01:08:12,581 --> 01:08:15,710
attached to this baby,
just like mothers and my do sometimes

1304
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:18,500
get so attached to their babies that
they really don't want them to stop

1305
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:20,540
being babies.
And so they end up living in their house

1306
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:21,680
till they're 55,
you know,

1307
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,660
wanting to destruction of the world.

1308
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,720
So you don't want to have that happen.
So,

1309
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:28,970
but it was happening in the microwave
with her.

1310
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,670
It's like,
well there's this baby and I spent a lot

1311
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:34,340
of time getting used to it and figuring
out what to do with it.

1312
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,340
Now it's not a baby anymore.
What the hell is it?

1313
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,240
So she had this amazing dream and it
ties back to the [inaudible] stuff that

1314
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:43,550
I caught you guys about earlier.
So this is the dream.

1315
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:48,200
She dreamed that the baby crawl into a
hole in the backyard.

1316
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:50,030
Now,
the way the whole got there was that a

1317
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:55,031
tree from the park beside us had moved
into our backyard and then hit burned

1318
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:58,040
down and left this hole and then the
whole was full of water.

1319
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:01,880
And so the baby crawl into the water and
it reduced them to a skeleton.

1320
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:04,490
And then there was a bug in the water
and the bug pulled him out.

1321
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,700
And when he came out he was a new
creature.

1322
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,710
So it was,
it was perfect.

1323
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:11,180
Like she came and told me that,
I don't know,

1324
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:14,110
like two in the morning in her little
three year old voice and they go into

1325
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:16,790
all type down.
It was absolutely spectacular because it

1326
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,550
wasn't straight shamonic tree,
like the tree burned down.

1327
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:23,330
And so that's a transformation motif.
And then water is the place of rebirth

1328
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:25,820
and you know,
the kid was dissolved into a skeleton

1329
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,450
and the little bug that pulled them out,
it's like a representation of the

1330
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:32,120
underlying process that guides
transformation.

1331
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,820
Your own brain was working like mad and
trying to figure out

1332
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:41,240
continuity over change.
That's a tough one,

1333
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:42,700
right?
Because it's almost like a butterfly

1334
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,660
urging from a cocoon.
It's a big deal,

1335
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,940
baby to toddler.
That's a big difference.

1336
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,560
You know,
she's supposed to figure out,

1337
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,950
well that's the same thing.
Well no it's not.

1338
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,550
So underneath her unconscious mind,
you know,

1339
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:57,980
three year olds are not stupid.
Even though they can't talk,

1340
01:09:57,981 --> 01:10:01,160
they've got this brain that's like 3.5
billion years old.

1341
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:02,930
It's not stupid.
So,

1342
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,740
so anyways,
no,

1343
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,800
why was I telling you that?

1344
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:14,450
Oh well then it's another indication of
how,

1345
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:18,860
so the transformations of cognitive
structure are forced upon a child,

1346
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,850
at least in part by the development of
increasing physical ability,

1347
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,850
right?
Because as you increase its physical

1348
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:28,250
ability and capacity,
then the world transforms and then your

1349
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:31,130
cognitive processes have to transform to
keep up with them.

1350
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:33,470
And sometimes that's a radical
transformation.

1351
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:39,020
So Piaget's fundamental hypothesis is
that part of the reason that people are

1352
01:10:39,021 --> 01:10:42,710
motivated to undergo cognitive
transformations and learning per se is

1353
01:10:42,711 --> 01:10:47,711
because as they mature,
they re they automatically come into

1354
01:10:47,841 --> 01:10:51,860
contact with anomalous information,
information that they cannot process

1355
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,110
from within the confines of the current
world model.

1356
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:57,530
And because they kind of process it,
it interferes with them getting what

1357
01:10:57,531 --> 01:10:59,780
they want.
And so they're motivated to keep their

1358
01:10:59,781 --> 01:11:01,940
cognitive structures updated.
So in,

1359
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:06,080
sometimes the revolutions occur at a
micro level and that might be like when

1360
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:09,470
you're learning the difference between
this and this,

1361
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,230
you know,
it's like it's a major difference but it

1362
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:16,770
doesn't disrupt the whole fabric of your
conceptual universe.

1363
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:18,960
Whereas a divorce,
Mike,

1364
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:21,570
the baby transformed me into a toddler
might.

1365
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:24,720
Puberty does.
It's just like you just find the gun

1366
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,670
used to your body.
You're 12 years old,

1367
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:29,640
so you're sort of at the pinnacle of
childhood.

1368
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:32,550
You're like an adult child,
you know what you're doing.

1369
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,060
And 11 and 12 year olds are often lovely
creatures because they're pretty mature

1370
01:11:36,061 --> 01:11:40,080
and they've got their act together and
then all of a sudden bang sex hormones

1371
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:42,780
kick in.
It's like you are no longer the same

1372
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:45,630
thing and neither is anyone you interact
with.

1373
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:50,631
And so it's like turbulence for three,
four or five 2030 years until you sort

1374
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:53,820
of sort that out,
which she never really do.

1375
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,040
And so you can see how

1376
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:01,760
the physiological transformations that
are attended on development,

1377
01:12:01,761 --> 01:12:05,970
some biologically predicated and some
and emergent consequence of learning

1378
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,190
disrupt the cognitive structures that
people use to orient themselves in the

1379
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:13,650
world.
And that some of those disruptions are

1380
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:18,710
sort of low key equivalent to normal
science now to be assimilation and some

1381
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:23,280
of them much broader.
And that's equivalent to accommodation.

1382
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,880
Assimilation means you learn something
new that you can already handle using

1383
01:12:27,881 --> 01:12:30,600
the constructs and scheme is that you
have at hand.

1384
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,410
You know,
so maybe you have to pick the thing up

1385
01:12:34,411 --> 01:12:38,120
like this instead of like this,
but you already know this and you know

1386
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,090
that.
So who cares?

1387
01:12:39,091 --> 01:12:41,700
It's like a little minor alteration and
sometimes,

1388
01:12:41,701 --> 01:12:45,300
well no,
you have to readapt your whole body in

1389
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:48,780
order to handle the next level of
complex problem solving.

1390
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:51,810
Learning to drive is like that.
Learning to ride a bicycle is like that.

1391
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:56,310
And you can see that there's sort of a,
there's not really normal versus

1392
01:12:56,311 --> 01:13:00,550
revolutionary transformation.
There's sort of a continuum that Mac

1393
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,640
themselves onto that hierarchy I showed
you.

1394
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,190
You know?
So if at the very highest levels of

1395
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:06,900
resolution,
it's minor transformations,

1396
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:08,880
send up the higher levels of
abstraction,

1397
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:12,060
you can blow out whole huge chunks of
yourself.

1398
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:16,080
So it's a continuum.
But Piaget and coon sort of

1399
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,060
conceptualized it hasn't.

1400
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:21,300
All right.
Let's see.

1401
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,750
That's a map of that which you can look
up.

1402
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:30,010
Um,

1403
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,560
Oh yes,
this is the,

1404
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,101
this,
this,

1405
01:13:33,101 --> 01:13:35,720
this is the thing I really want to get
out to this is,

1406
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:39,950
it's so brilliant.
And so psa was concerned about morality

1407
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,050
and he's one of the few psychologists I
think,

1408
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:43,310
who like,
he nailed it.

1409
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,330
It's this is like the most important
thing piaget discovered and maybe it's

1410
01:13:47,331 --> 01:13:50,000
one of the most important things that a
psychologist has ever discovered.

1411
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:53,000
It's like how do you become moral?
Well,

1412
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,060
we've already mentioned that when you
acquire a behavior,

1413
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:58,610
you inevitably acquire in a social
context.

1414
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:01,760
So what that means is that right from
the time you're little and learning

1415
01:14:01,761 --> 01:14:04,850
things,
the demands of society are encoded in

1416
01:14:04,851 --> 01:14:06,650
the behaviors that you're allowed to
manifest.

1417
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,580
And so science to some degree,
by the time you behave the way you do

1418
01:14:10,581 --> 01:14:11,920
behave,
you're three.

1419
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,280
If you've been properly socialized,
you already act out the embodied moral

1420
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:20,950
structure of your entire community.

1421
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,560
So you know when you talk about law,
as you say,

1422
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:27,220
there's a body of laws and the body of
law is used to be the cake.

1423
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:30,730
So you have to do with the king set up.
But now the body of laws is an abstract

1424
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:34,390
conceptual representation.
But those representations are actually

1425
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:39,640
semantic representations of allowable
and not allowable behavior.

1426
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:43,720
And so by the time you're three and
you're a law abiding three year old,

1427
01:14:43,721 --> 01:14:47,320
which means you're well socialized,
you're already acting in accordance with

1428
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:50,020
the law,
the patterns that characterize your

1429
01:14:50,021 --> 01:14:51,370
beating,
the behavioral patterns that

1430
01:14:51,371 --> 01:14:54,400
characterize your Ba have already been
molded into the patterns that you

1431
01:14:54,401 --> 01:14:56,950
manifest.
And so what that means in some sense is

1432
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,450
you're already,
as Nietzsche would say,

1433
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:02,980
an unconscious advocate of your culture
because you're acting it out.

1434
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,740
Now here's an example.
Here's an example of how that can be

1435
01:15:05,741 --> 01:15:07,480
transformed into actual moral knowledge.

1436
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,700
So he has,
he goes to the studies kids playing a

1437
01:15:09,701 --> 01:15:12,040
game.
So here's an example.

1438
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:14,530
So there's a bunch of kids and they're
standing around in the playground and

1439
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:17,350
they're all playing helicopter.
Maybe they've just got sticks and

1440
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,940
they're always,
you know,

1441
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:21,610
when they're flying in helicopters
around and they're all doing this and

1442
01:15:21,611 --> 01:15:25,180
maybe they're diving in each other.
So what's happened is each kid wants to

1443
01:15:25,181 --> 01:15:28,540
have a helicopter and each kid wants to
be a good helicopter pilot.

1444
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:32,260
But each kid wants to be a good
helicopter pilot in the way that other

1445
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,340
kids appreciate.
Well,

1446
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:37,080
they're being good helicopter pilots.
That's tough phase.

1447
01:15:37,081 --> 01:15:39,940
So not only do you have to figure out
how to coordinate your behavior,

1448
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:43,120
you have to figure out how to coordinate
your behavior with other people,

1449
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:47,170
coordinating,
coordinating their behavior in such a

1450
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:51,100
way that the shared activity not only
does not come to a stop,

1451
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:53,920
but precedes an enjoyable way.

1452
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,450
Jesus,
that's really tough.

1453
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,210
Now if your kid can play well with other
kids,

1454
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,800
that's what they've managed.
Okay,

1455
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:02,560
so you've got four kids doing this and
there's rules.

1456
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:05,470
Actually there's not,
there's rituals that the children are

1457
01:16:05,471 --> 01:16:07,120
embodying that they've agreed upon.
Well,

1458
01:16:07,121 --> 01:16:11,200
they set up the game and they've just
sort of bash the ideas up against each

1459
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:14,260
other and they came up with a solution.
And you can tell that because the game

1460
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:16,450
is continuing and everyone is having
fun.

1461
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,580
It's like,
is everyone playing nice?

1462
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:20,830
Yes,
that's an equivalent rated place state.

1463
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:24,040
And it's a moral organization because
all the children are participating

1464
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:27,490
voluntarily towards a shared end.
And as for piaget,

1465
01:16:27,491 --> 01:16:29,500
that was the model of a functional
society.

1466
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:33,940
That's so smart.
So now imagine that a kid comes along

1467
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,120
and maybe he's a popular kid,
so he has a reasonable chance of getting

1468
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:38,230
into this playgroup.

1469
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,870
You'll still be robust like 50% of the
time.

1470
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:43,780
Whereas if he's not blocking her kid,
it's like forget,

1471
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,180
they're just not going to let him into
the little helicopters circle.

1472
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:50,410
And there's probably because he's
developmentally delayed or an in some

1473
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:53,260
other way,
he doesn't understand how we asked to

1474
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:56,620
configure his behavior so that he can
enter this complex,

1475
01:16:56,621 --> 01:16:59,950
dramatic scene without disrupting it.
Or maybe he's one of those kids who

1476
01:16:59,951 --> 01:17:01,690
says,
I don't want to bring helicopter,

1477
01:17:01,691 --> 01:17:03,250
we should play something else.
It's like,

1478
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:09,530
no,
unless you're a creative genius.

1479
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:12,470
That's a pretty bad idea.
So what the popular kids do,

1480
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:16,070
if they sort of side loft to the group,
maybe they find a stick cause they watch

1481
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:18,410
what they're doing,
maybe they find a stick and they sort of

1482
01:17:18,411 --> 01:17:22,820
started going cause this is sick and
they're sort of looking at to see if

1483
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:27,140
that stick helicopter behavior is
acceptable to the peers.

1484
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:28,183
And maybe,
you know,

1485
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:31,130
one of the friends sort of notices that
they're playing helicopters and they

1486
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:34,310
open up the circle of Maca and gets to
come in and play helicopters.

1487
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:36,560
But he might fail it out even if he's
popular.

1488
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,510
Because once in the little play thing is
going,

1489
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:40,040
it's like a plague,
right?

1490
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:42,920
It's got a dramatic structure.
You can't just come in there and you

1491
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:45,050
know,
start playing basketball or something.

1492
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,500
So now what Piaget noticed was that when
children were playing your game,

1493
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:54,290
maybe they were playing,
Barbara's not so rough game and you

1494
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:56,270
because you can win and lose it.
Marvelous.

1495
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:57,801
And you might say,
well,

1496
01:17:57,801 --> 01:17:59,510
children shouldn't play competitive
games.

1497
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:02,300
But if you say that,
that's a sure sign that you don't know

1498
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:06,020
what the hell you're talking about
because all games are competitive and

1499
01:18:06,021 --> 01:18:10,340
cooperative at the same time.
If they share a single goal and it's

1500
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:12,200
really not a game unless there's a goal.

1501
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,720
Cause goal games have goals.
And so what the children do is they,

1502
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:18,890
they organize themselves.
So they all decide what constitutes an

1503
01:18:18,891 --> 01:18:21,860
acceptable goal.
And the goal with marvel says when some

1504
01:18:21,861 --> 01:18:24,660
marbles and lose the marbles without
whining about it,

1505
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,170
that's another goal.
And that's an important thing to learn.

1506
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:28,940
So the children say,
well,

1507
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:31,790
here's the foundation of our local moral
universe.

1508
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,950
Here's the rules that we're going to
abide.

1509
01:18:33,951 --> 01:18:35,630
By and large,
those are ritualistic.

1510
01:18:35,631 --> 01:18:37,070
They might've learned them from other
kids.

1511
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:40,490
So they play marbles.
You extract out a kid and you say,

1512
01:18:40,491 --> 01:18:43,220
what are the rules for marbles?
And if it gets like seven,

1513
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:45,500
they don't know.
They can't tell you.

1514
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,810
But if you put them in with a bunch of
other seven year olds,

1515
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:51,500
they can play marbles perfectly well.
So what that means is the morality is

1516
01:18:51,501 --> 01:18:54,680
coated in their behavior or in the
behavior of the group,

1517
01:18:54,681 --> 01:18:56,090
like a bunch of feeds,
you know,

1518
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:58,970
cause there's knowledge in a hive of
bees or making it a school of fish.

1519
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:04,240
So it's embedded in the child's behavior
and in their patterns of action across

1520
01:19:04,251 --> 01:19:06,560
time.
And then if you pull them out,

1521
01:19:06,561 --> 01:19:09,080
they can only give like a partial of the
counter,

1522
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:10,970
but they're not conscious of the
morality.

1523
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:13,160
It's like it pulled a war fighter of a
wolf pack and say,

1524
01:19:13,161 --> 01:19:16,280
well you know what's up with the wolf
pack and the wall,

1525
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,890
you know,
bites you because that's just,

1526
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,840
that's how it answers questions.
It's not going to tell you about the

1527
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:23,270
rules.
It's only later in development that the

1528
01:19:23,271 --> 01:19:27,110
children become conscious of the rules
and then they become very irritated that

1529
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:29,900
people break them and they don't much
later do.

1530
01:19:29,901 --> 01:19:34,901
They start to understand that the rules
can be adjusted by mutual agreement and

1531
01:19:35,241 --> 01:19:38,990
that is associated with the Phn and
development of higher order of morality.

1532
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:41,690
It's brilliant.
You learn your actions,

1533
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:44,360
your actions are conditioned by other
people.

1534
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:48,410
The actions are integrated into a
voluntary game.

1535
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:52,370
Then the actions are integrated into a
series of voluntary games.

1536
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:55,520
That social interaction,
then you learn the descriptions.

1537
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,700
Then you learn how to manipulate the
descriptions.

1538
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:01,010
Brilliant.
Moving up the hierarchy,

1539
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:03,940
snatch a Piagetian theory.
In a nutshell constructed,

1540
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,890
this is a nutshell.
See you on Thursday.
