1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,420
So I want to continue talking about this
basic story or subpersonality or game or

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,613
map.

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,220
So what I've discussed with you so far 
is that there are

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,980
different ways that you can construe the
objects and territories that you inhabit

5
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,163
and that modern people generally think 
that the world they inhabit is the one 

6
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:45,750
that's defined by science.
But

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,830
I would say
I would say actually it depends on which

8
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:53,664
scientist you mean because I don't 
believe that the worldview that emerges 

9
00:00:59,071 --> 00:00:59,904
as a logical consequence of Darwinism is
the same worldview that emerges as a 

10
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,340
logical consequence of Newtonian 
presuppositions.

11
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,213
And
the reason I'm bringing Newton into it 

12
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:13,320
is because we still think a newtonian 
terms.

13
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:16,860
I mean it's been more than 100 years or 
100 years,

14
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:20,970
I guess since Newton's models expanded 
by quantum physics,

15
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:23,580
but no one thinks that way because you 
can't think that way.

16
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,443
And besides that,
the reason you don't think that way is 

17
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:30,030
because at the level of resolution that 
you exist,

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,060
things behave in a newtonian manner.
So it's in accordance with our natural,

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
with some of our natural perceptions.

20
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,663
Now

21
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,300
I started thinking this way for a 
variety of reasons,

22
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:48,290
but I was influenced later by a guy 
named Gibson,

23
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,400
Jj Gibson who wrote a book called an 
ecological approach to visual perception

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,993
and he made the case quite strongly that
what you directly perceive is the 

25
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:01,370
implication of of situations and 
objects.

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,413
So for example,
I suppose you've all seen the famous 

27
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:10,571
visual cliff experiment with babies 
where if you put a piece of glass across

28
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:16,271
the open space and space is evidently 
deep,

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,953
the baby won't cross the glass and so 
there's some evidence there for 

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,300
relatively innate,
not only depth processing.

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,310
It's not just depth process,
right?

32
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:30,110
Because in order to not crawl off that,
you also have to perceive that,

33
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,630
well,
Gibson would say that it's a falling off

34
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:33,464
place and he would say that's actually 
what you perceive is a falling off 

35
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:37,814
place,
and then maybe you could abstract out 

36
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:39,794
the idea of cliff,
but that isn't what you perceive and 

37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,173
know
the sense you have that when a bear is 

38
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:50,030
chasing you,
that that's dangerous.

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,793
That doesn't seem to be merely 
psychological in a sense like it's not 

40
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,660
merely in a sense,
it's not.

41
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,450
It's not less real than perceiving the 
bearer as an object,

42
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,330
an object that eats you.
It's not the same object

43
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,010
as an object that remains neutral to you
or positive and it seems quite clear.

44
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,880
And this is where the Darwinian issue I 
think arises that

45
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,023
you have to evaluate with your 
perception because otherwise you're too 

46
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:28,240
slow.
So anyways,

47
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,183
I developed this diagram as a 
consequence of thinking about these 

48
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,054
things for a long time and the diagram 
is predicated on the idea that when you 

49
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,780
begin to act in the world,
you're inside of motivational frame,

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,440
let's say,
and that motivational frame can have,

51
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,573
can be,

52
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,933
oh,

53
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,570
instantiated or,
or,

54
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,773
or put into practice by or put into 
place by any number of underlying 

55
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,830
motivational system.
Some of them,

56
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,703
the more basic motivational systems that
we share with animals going far back 

57
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:07,014
down the evolutionary chain and some of 
the more complex mixtures of emotional 

58
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,380
or a motivational drives that had been 
organized across

59
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,710
lengthy periods of time and in social 
circumstances.

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,250
So
for example,

61
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:29,460
if you're at a bar and you're looking 
for someone,

62
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,550
it's not really reasonable to say,
we'll we'll take a simple case.

63
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:37,584
It's not really reasonable to say that 
your behavior is motivated by sex 

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,680
because that's what happens only if 
you're actually in a sexual act.

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,633
Before that the motivations are multiple
and they have to be because otherwise 

66
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:59,670
you wouldn't have this sophistication.
Do you begin a conversation with anyone?

67
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,530
And so to think of that as as driven in 
some sense,

68
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,423
bisexuality means either to consider a 
much more expanded notion of sexuality 

69
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,380
or to not consider it driven in that 
manner.

70
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,443
Now I think it's reasonable to make the 
presumption that you're motivated to 

71
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:25,770
move ahead and we know that for a 
variety of reasons.

72
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:28,630
Partly that's because if you look at the
brain,

73
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,630
at the level of the Hypothalamus,
which is a very,

74
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:35,631
very are,
are archaic and Primordial sub system in

75
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:41,091
the brain.
Then it's roughly divided into two parts

76
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,474
and one part is responsible for a lot of
the things that we consider basic 

77
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:47,490
motivations.

78
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,080
And the other part is responsible for 
exploration.

79
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,173
And that's so the.
The dopaminergic tracts that WHO's 

80
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:00,494
operation underlies movement forward and
incentive reward and what you generally 

81
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,434
experience as the sorts of positive 
emotions associated with hope and 

82
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:09,794
excitement and curiosity.
That system is instantiated in the 

83
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,950
hypothalamus and a lot of the 
hypothalamus,

84
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,951
this is donut is devoted to it,
so it was a very primordial system who's

85
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:28,871
operation appears to
be a default.

86
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,493
It's a default operation if none of the 
other motivational systems need current 

87
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:38,900
attention.
Well the other default,

88
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:39,734
I suppose it's sleep or rest and you can
certainly see that in animals because 

89
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,870
you know if you have a cat,
you'll notice that they sleep.

90
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,763
Of course they're nocturnal,
but they sleep up a large part of the 

91
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,590
day and so the dogs,
so you know if you.

92
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,830
If you're not looking for a partner,
if you don't want to play,

93
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,480
if you're not hungry,
not thirsty,

94
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,703
and so on,
not under the grip of any direct 

95
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,060
biological necessity,
let's say.

96
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,050
Then your default position is to rest or
sleep or to explore.

97
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,620
And the thing about the exploratory 
circuit is it's really old.

98
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,760
It's as old as pain.
It's as old as lust.

99
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,520
It's as old as anger,
it's as old as hunger.

100
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,410
It's as old as thirst,
like it's a really,

101
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,000
really old system.
It's a very,

102
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:28,001
very primordial system and human beings 
are quite hyper exploratory,

103
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,660
at least collectively as you can tell,
because we keep inventing new things and

104
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,344
exchanging new modes of being and so so 
you can say it in some sense that you 

105
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:43,784
have a drive to engage with the world 
and to expand your domain of knowledge 

106
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,593
and the reason that you have that is 
because the human race has has gambled 

107
00:07:55,641 --> 00:08:00,641
on that as a sufficient means of 
ensuring our reputation into the future.

108
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,450
And it's a strange one,
a because most animals are very,

109
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,380
very conservative.

110
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,530
In fact,
most human societies are very,

111
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,364
very conservative,
so it's certainly possible for even 

112
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,304
relatively modern human society.
So let's say those that have arisen in 

113
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:17,234
the last 50,000 years to remain 
relatively unchanged for for periods 

114
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:25,370
during that time of up to 10,000 years.
That seems to be what happened,

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,540
for example,
with regards to the original inhabitants

116
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:33,350
of Australia and so it stays this.
That's the norm,

117
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:34,184
not transformation and no,
even societies that we feel we're very 

118
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:40,880
dynamic like let's say ancient Egypt 
still there are,

119
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,523
there are indications in the 
archaeological record of relatively 

120
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:45,944
unchanged customs and practices for 
periods of periods that you would count 

121
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:50,804
in the thousands.
So most animals and many societies that 

122
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,970
just doing the same thing over and over.
It's gonna.

123
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,650
It's gonna do the trick,
you know,

124
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,040
and human beings.
Well that isn't what we're like

125
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,583
and

126
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,190
God only knows how that originally came 
about.

127
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,770
You know,
what was the conjunction of many,

128
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:17,771
many processes enforces and,
and it would be very,

129
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,990
very difficult to tell a complete causal
story.

130
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:24,710
But anyways,
here we are now.

131
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,683
It's reasonable
to think of us as motivated to move 

132
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:33,110
forward and motivated to explore.
And so

133
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,970
that's the fundamental motivation for 
engaging with the world.

134
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:42,020
Apart from anything that's let's say 
strictly lower level biological.

135
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,123
And while we're doing that,
it's also customary for us to look at 

136
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:51,230
the world in terms of its utility.
And I would say with human beings,

137
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:52,064
it's,
it's,

138
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,030
it's a very tool based utility because 
you know,

139
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:59,900
our brain is part of our body,
our brain is adapted to our body and our

140
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:00,734
body is adapted to our brain.
Obviously they call evolved and so the 

141
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:04,244
kind of brain we have is the sort of 
brain that a creature that stands 

142
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,860
upright and can manipulate the world 
has,

143
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,530
and we'll see some evidence of that 
later.

144
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,143
But because we're so handy,
we can speak with our hands and we can 

145
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:19,634
manipulate things with our hands and we 
can transform things with our hands and 

146
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,070
we can tear things apart and we can 
haunt and there's like,

147
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,040
there's a.
and we can plant and there's,

148
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,500
there's an endless number of 
possibilities for hand utilization.

149
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,660
The world appears to us a rate out as 
tools,

150
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,050
roughly speaking.
And a tool would be something.

151
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,323
It,
it's hard to get the word exactly right 

152
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:46,811
because I like tool because tool implies
something that you can use.

153
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,800
Um,
whereas Gibson would have talked about,

154
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,560
um,
what did he call it?

155
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,230
I can't remember.
It'll come to me in a minute.

156
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,753
It the word reflects the fact that the 
world is presenting itself to you as 

157
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:12,130
something that you can use.
Let me just look that up for a second.

158
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:16,330
That's very annoying.
No,

159
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,460
that's not right.
It's not facilitators.

160
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:18,850
Oh,
well,

161
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,380
whatever.
So naturally when you lay out the world,

162
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:26,110
if it lays itself out into things that 
are going to be useful for you,

163
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,383
things that you're going to get in your 
way and then things that have neither 

164
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:33,604
property and under most circumstances,
the things that have neither proper 

165
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,183
property are the overwhelming majority 
and that's partly how you managed to 

166
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,490
process the world and all of its 
complexity with

167
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,240
your relatively narrow processing 
capacity.

168
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,643
Most things have no significance and 
they have no significance within this 

169
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,200
very,
very focal frame which is,

170
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,660
you know,
if you remember the hierarchy diagram,

171
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,200
it's like in that hierarchy diagram,
most of the time you're operating at the

172
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,090
level of motor interaction with the 
world.

173
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,450
You're actually engaged with the world 
either through articulation,

174
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,284
but forget about that for now or you're 
actually in engaged moving in the world 

175
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:20,000
and moving it around and interacting 
with it.

176
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,263
So it's,
it's as if you're viewing the world 

177
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,034
through a series of concentric lenses 
and the all of those concentric lenses 

178
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,350
exclude,
and then the very,

179
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,833
the highest resolution lens,
the one that enables you to focus 

180
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:36,964
closest is the one that helps you 
highlight those few things in the vast 

181
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,893
perceptual world of nothingness that 
seemed to be critical for that 

182
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:49,264
particular operation.
So now you can see that mean the most 

183
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,054
dramatic example of that.
I was really personally thrilled about 

184
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,990
Dan Simons grill experiments because I'd
been thinking about this for a long time

185
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,713
before that experiment came out and it 
was the clearest demonstration I'd ever 

186
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:10,841
seen.
I mean,

187
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:12,520
there's a lot of demonstrations like 
that now,

188
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,354
but it was the clearest demonstration 
I'd ever seen that indeed most of most 

189
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:20,560
of what your perceptual systems do is 
exclude.

190
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,300
So now what that means,
this is the tricky thing,

191
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,134
is that what that means is that wrapped 
up in what you exclude is the entire is 

192
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:35,821
all of being virtually.
And that's a very tricky problem because

193
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,210
when,
when you're excluding all of being,

194
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:42,880
in some sense,
you're setting its value to zero.

195
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,733
You say,
well,

196
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,220
except for those few things that I'm 
concentrating on now,

197
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,090
everything else is zero and zero and 
unchanging.

198
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,460
And the problem with that is that lots 
of times that's not right now.

199
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,780
It's,
it's right enough.

200
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,250
Luckily enough,
and I,

201
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:03,370
I suppose this is a consequence of 
evolution to

202
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,093
were fast enough or slow enough 
depending on how you look at it so that 

203
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,810
we can assume constancy across some 
spans of time under some conditions.

204
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,463
Now,
from a philosophical perspective that's 

205
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,233
inadequate.
Some of you might have heard of the 

206
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:27,490
phrase the scandal of induction.

207
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,800
Well,
it's a,

208
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,100
it's a,
it's a,

209
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,300
it's a pointer to a very profound 
philosophical problem.

210
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,134
And the philosophical problem is how do 
you know that the same thing is that 

211
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,300
happened before it's going to happen 
next.

212
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,750
And the answer to that is generally you 
don't know.

213
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,483
So,
and it's a very tricky issue to come to 

214
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:48,610
terms with,
you know,

215
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,740
um,
I think you can,

216
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,633
you can think of things as you know,
if you think about a hierarchy of 

217
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,710
resolution,
again,

218
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,053
I think you can think of things as 
varying rather predictably in their 

219
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,060
unpredictability.
So for example,

220
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,910
there's some indication that protons 
decay,

221
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,463
but they decay over such a long 
timeframe that the probability that 

222
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,030
that's going to affect us is virtually 
zero.

223
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:14,570
And then,
you know,

224
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,540
there's other things that we interact 
with quite regularly,

225
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,723
like the sun that are stable across 
timeframes that make it virtually 

226
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,073
ignorable.

227
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,370
But
well,

228
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,204
I'll tell you a story about that and 
this is a good story to indicate how 

229
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,930
everything is nested in what you ignore.
So part of this story is fictional,

230
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:38,924
but part of it isn't.
So one time when I was in graduate 

231
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,570
school in Quebec,
in Montreal,

232
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I always typing on my hard drive 
computer and it stopped and you know,

233
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,193
computers do that.
And so what happens when your computer 

234
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,550
stops?
Well,

235
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,610
the first thing that happens is it 
depends on what you're working on.

236
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,350
That's the critical issue,
right?

237
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,633
I mean,
and so what happens is you have a 

238
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,513
reaction that's proportionate to the 
deemed importance of what it was that 

239
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,644
you're working on and that there's going
to be an association between that and 

240
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:16,094
deadlines.
And there's going to be an association 

241
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:21,200
between that and amount written that you
think he might have lost.

242
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,810
And then there's so,
so there's,

243
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,070
there's because what you're doing is 
nested in a hierarchy,

244
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,173
you know,
I'm writing a sentence to write a 

245
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,243
paragraph to write an essay to handy 
essay in to fulfill a requirement of 

246
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,004
class to graduate,
etc. All the way up the nested 

247
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,513
hierarchy.
You're going to be upset in 

248
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,670
proportionAte in proportion to the upset
that or to the,

249
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,110
to the cost of this failure in terms of 
that entire structure.

250
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:51,944
And so you do a rough estimate a because
you don't really know and generally you 

251
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:57,760
don't assume the worst,
although you might immediately cause you

252
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:58,594
know,
that's the sort of situation where 

253
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:00,350
someone will go,
they'll,

254
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,333
they'll get angry or I will anyways,
I'll pound my fist on the on and then 

255
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:05,744
I'll curse microsoft usually or,
or whoever happened to make the 

256
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,780
computer.
And then all remember that I can usually

257
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,790
fix computers if there's something wrong
with them.

258
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,910
and that probably all it needs to do is 
be rebooted and so forth.

259
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:21,770
And so what happens to begin with is a 
burst of emotion and the reason for that

260
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:25,730
is that you,
the significance of the unexpected event

261
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:26,564
cannot be easily constrained.
And that's because there's so manY 

262
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,930
things that might've gone wrong now,
you know,

263
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,390
because the worst case scenario is,
well maybe,

264
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,283
maybe your computer's dead.
And then that's a problem for all sorts 

265
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:44,000
of reasons we don't have to go into.
And it's not just a technical problem,

266
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:44,834
right?
It's also a political and social and 

267
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:47,264
economic problem,
weirdly enough because then when you go 

268
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:50,724
buy a computer you have to figure out 
well who's the manufacturer and where's 

269
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,560
the manufacturing done and what's a high
quality computer?

270
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:57,600
And it's like,
good luck figuring that out because they

271
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:00,210
change every month so you just can't 
keep track of it.

272
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,043
So.
So it opens up a whole rat's nest of or 

273
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:05,520
hornet's nest of problems where a pit of
snakes,

274
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:06,960
which is a better way of thinking about 
it.

275
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,850
Okay.
So fine.

276
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,400
So my computer's dead.
So I tried to reboot.

277
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,290
It doesn't reboot.
And so I think,

278
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,011
well,
I don't know,

279
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,480
maybe it's burned out or maybe there's 
something wrong with the plug.

280
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,314
So I plug a lamp in into the same outlet
and I tried to turn on the lamp and the 

281
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:22,800
lamp doesn't go on.
And so then I think,

282
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,380
aha,
I blew a fuse.

283
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,460
This place had fuses so fine.
So I go to the fusebox and it's daytime,

284
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,294
so it's not a problem.
And I look at the fuses and there's 

285
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,600
nothing wrong with the fuses.
and so I think,

286
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:36,600
well,
I'll go down to the corner store and get

287
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,520
a cigarette because I smoked at that 
time.

288
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,780
Then,
um,

289
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,183
I'll think about it on the way.
And so I go outside and all the street 

290
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:43,734
lights are off.
And so the whole city has come to a 

291
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:46,740
halt,
I think,

292
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:47,970
oh,
there's a power outage.

293
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,571
It's like,
yeah,

294
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:50,520
there was a power outage.
And here's what happened.

295
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,950
A solar flare emerged from the sun 
surface and it was a whopping big one.

296
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,233
And a solar flare like that sends out a,
a wind essentially have charged charged 

297
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:02,544
particles.
It comes zooming towards the earth and 

298
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,110
there were protected from them for a 
variety of reasons,

299
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:15,111
including the fact that the earth has an
the earth's magnetic and for complicated

300
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:19,410
reasons that helps protect us from from 
cosmic rays,

301
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,660
which is really a good thing as far as 
I'm concerned,

302
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,830
but now and then those things are so 
powerful that they'll.

303
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,240
Well,
here's an example,

304
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,130
if you have a hydrogen bomb,
a big one,

305
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:29,964
and you,
you detonated in the middle of north 

306
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,670
America,
in the atmosphere,

307
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,533
say high up,
you wipe out all the electronics in the 

308
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:36,204
entire continent permanently because 
what happens is that when the bomb goes 

309
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:40,494
off,
there's an electromagnetic pulse and 

310
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:42,864
that produces electrical electrical 
current that runs through the wire and 

311
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:47,064
that'll be it in very brief obviously,
but of sufficient intensity to fry the 

312
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,223
electronics.

313
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,260
So well,
thAt's what the sun is.

314
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,094
The sun is of massive hydrogen bomb and 
so now and then it goes off with the 

315
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,294
force of,
you know,

316
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,133
millions of hydrogen bombs and then we 
get the pulse and radiating towards us 

317
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:09,690
and then it sets up current in the power
grid,

318
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:12,510
which is what happened here and takes 
out the whole power grid.

319
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,050
That's what happened that at that point 
the quebec power grid was down for quite

320
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:16,884
a while and it was because this.
So that's why my computer crashed just 

321
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:22,230
because the sun wasn't as stable as I 
thought it was,

322
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,960
you know,
and that,

323
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:24,794
that gives you an example of just how 
interconnected things are and how much 

324
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,693
what's in,
how much you're taking for granted when 

325
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,950
you make anything invisible.
No,

326
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,500
and I,
I would say that part of what happens in

327
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:42,150
a civilized society will say a civilized
and productive society is that there are

328
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:42,984
rules of conduct in place and there are 
effective processes in place so that 

329
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:51,670
most of the time you can rely on things 
being like they were yesterday.

330
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,900
So for example,
our power supplies unbelievably reliable

331
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,490
given that you know,
it's so,

332
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,623
it's so intrinsically unstable.
People have to beetle around nonstop 

333
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,030
just to keep the power on,
but they do.

334
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,220
And so we can sit here and ignore it and
you know,

335
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,780
when we can concentrate on something 
more arcane and much more focused,

336
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,303
but it's also because we're,
it's a relatively peaceful society and 

337
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,780
we have relatively free speech and so on
and so forth.

338
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:20,614
And you can predict with a high degree 
of certainty that if you come to class 

339
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,780
then what's going to happen in the 
class?

340
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:29,270
The worst that's gonna happen in the 
class likely is that you're either going

341
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:32,860
to get bored or hot.
So that's not so bad,

342
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:34,000
you know?
So.

343
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,033
all right,
so you're going from point a to point b 

344
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,860
and you see your tools.

345
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,300
I still haven't remembered that damn 
word.

346
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,530
Oh,
what the hell is that word?

347
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:51,130
That's so annoying.
Nope,

348
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,610
whatever you go along,
you see these tools,

349
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:56,580
these are things that are going to help 
get you to your goal.

350
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,893
And whenever you see those,
then you get a burst of positive 

351
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:04,260
emotion.
And basically that means two things,

352
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:05,094
that positive emotion,
think about it as a little dopa mean 

353
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:07,464
care.
And this is where this story 

354
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:12,210
differentiates a little bit from classic
behaviors.

355
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,123
So the behaviors would say you get a 
little dopamine kick and that increases 

356
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:16,254
the probability that the action that you
just took will be taken again in the 

357
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:20,610
future.
And so,

358
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,300
so it's partly because the dopa mean 
kick has a positive emotional,

359
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,113
uh,
it provides a positive emotional 

360
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:31,554
experience,
but it's also because the dopamine 

361
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,893
facilitates neural growth.
And so if you're battling along and 

362
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:37,554
something good happens to you,
then your brain makes the things you 

363
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,514
were doing,
the circuits that underlie the things 

364
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,480
you were doing just before the good 
thing happened a little bit stronger.

365
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,293
But,
but the other thing that happens when 

366
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:54,771
you're battling along and doing your 
positive thing is that you give a little

367
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:59,940
dope is that the fact that it's working 
also validates your frame of reference.

368
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,560
Because,
you know,

369
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,490
you might say,
well,

370
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,510
if what you're doing is working and 
you're getting what you want,

371
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,920
how is it that your right.
And the answer to that is,

372
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,660
while in some ways you're right enough 
up the entire hierarchy,

373
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,123
and so what that means is that every 
time you proceed along the path that 

374
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:22,944
you've chosen and that's working,
that that entire structure gets 

375
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:28,650
stabilized a bit more and that's how it 
should be.

376
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,053
Now,
I've tried to work out exactly how this 

377
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:33,684
happens and,
and I think I can give you the best 

378
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:37,170
example by telling you about cocaine 
addict.

379
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,233
So

380
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,903
addicts used to have this phrase monkey 
my back and that phrase referred to the 

381
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:50,474
compulsion,
the compulsive subpersonality that 

382
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,034
develops.
It's interested nothing but more of the 

383
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:58,154
substance.
Now you know what you think about that 

384
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:01,934
as being hurt and you might think about 
it as a motivational drive or a 

385
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,930
biological drive.
But the thing is,

386
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:07,150
it's not like that.
It's,

387
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,810
we're just not that deterministic.
I'm an addicted person,

388
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:16,811
has grown and addictive subpersonality 
and I mean grown.

389
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,530
It's not psychological,
it's psychophysiological.

390
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,930
And so,
so imagine this.

391
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,550
Imagine this is how it works.
Okay?

392
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:26,610
So,
and I'll.

393
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,613
Okay,
I'll first tell you what happens to 

394
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,174
cocaine addicts.
If you take them out into a treatment 

395
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:32,900
center,
heroin addicts is the same thing roughly

396
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:33,734
speaking,
so you take this person who's dependent 

397
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,653
out to a treatment center and with 
heroin and say you have to let them go 

398
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:47,090
through withdrawal and that takes about 
48 hours,

399
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:50,660
something like that,
and you've seen movie representations of

400
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:51,494
it,
but it's been compared by reasonable 

401
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:58,751
observers to having a very bad flu,
so alcohol withdrawal by the way,

402
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:00,140
that kills you.

403
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,610
Often you have a seizure and you die,
and so if you're an alcoholic and you go

404
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:06,530
to the hospital and you need to 
detoxify,

405
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,573
they'll give you valium or something 
like that so that you don't seize 

406
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,170
yourself to death while you're 
withdrawn.

407
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,553
You know when you have a hangover.
Part of that is part of what's happened 

408
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:18,650
is you've actually lowered your seizure 
threshold,

409
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,570
so something to think about if you're.
you know,

410
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,860
if you're prone to seizures,
it's a bad idea to have a hangover.

411
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,770
In fact,
they bred mice to study hangovers.

412
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:28,604
They bred mice that could drink alcohol 
and then they'd get a very bad hangover 

413
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:33,410
and if you showed them a cat,
they'd have a seizure,

414
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,840
so because the fear was enough to 
trIgger seizures here,

415
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,803
so you've got to get seizures,
go somehow if you're going to study 

416
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,260
them,
and that's so in,

417
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,490
that can be bred so.

418
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,830
So anyways,
you take your,

419
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,330
your heroin addict,
let's say,

420
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,210
and they get over their,
their,

421
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,083
their withdrawal,
and so that means that technically 

422
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:58,910
they're no longer physiologically 
dependent on the drug.

423
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:03,911
Now that doesn't mean that their work is
over by by no means,

424
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,563
but frequently In a treatment center,
as long as the person is nowhere near 

425
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:11,510
where they usually are.
Once they've gone through withdrawal,

426
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,080
they can stay away from the drug quite 
effectively,

427
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,423
but the problem is as soon as you put 
them back in the situation that they 

428
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:21,074
came from,
they end there around the things that 

429
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:25,094
have been associated with heroin.
Let's say they get a craving and the 

430
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:29,714
cravings haven't gone away.
That's a different system than the 

431
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:37,211
system that went through withdrawal and 
so they always relapsed.

432
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,493
So now
you think about how this craving works 

433
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:48,570
and I've seen this probably most 
seriously I guess with cocaine addicts,

434
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:53,160
but also with alcoholics,
so imagine that.

435
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,610
Imagine what you have to do in order to 
become an addict.

436
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,603
You know,
the first thing is you have to start 

437
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:01,650
using the drug.
okay,

438
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,663
but that,
but,

439
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,230
and,
and fair enough,

440
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:06,570
so people experiment with all sorts of 
drugs and so,

441
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,220
you know,
that's part of human nature.

442
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,370
So you know,
It's risky and dangerous,

443
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,440
but it's not yet catastrophic.
Okay?

444
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:15,900
But then let's say you start using it 
enough so that you,

445
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,870
you can't not use it.
You have to use it everyday or something

446
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:19,704
like that.
And then the next thing that happens is 

447
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:22,524
that gets a little bit expensive and so 
then your life is starting to go 

448
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:26,454
downhill because you're spending all 
your tiMe trying to gather resources to 

449
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:29,334
get some more of the drug.
Now what you might ask yourself is what 

450
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:33,774
do you have like exactly what's the 
chain of behaviors that's being 

451
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:39,390
reinforced by the drug?

452
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,300
Well,
somewhere along the way,

453
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,673
you know,
maybe when you're just starting to 

454
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,630
misuse it,
there's part of you that saying,

455
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,390
you know,
really this is probably not a good idea,

456
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,170
and then there's another part of you 
that has a different thought which might

457
00:27:58,171 --> 00:27:58,891
be,
oh,

458
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:00,360
to hell with it.
It's only once.

459
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,713
It's only tonight,
and so then you take the drug and then 

460
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,000
there's a chain leading from the thought
to the drug behavior,

461
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,200
but the drug reinforces all the way back
along that chain.

462
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,560
So what happens is that little system 
that's thinks,

463
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,371
oh,
to hell with it,

464
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:20,280
it's only one night gets a little 
stronger.

465
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,630
Now.
It doesn't get as strong as this systems

466
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:29,160
that are being reinforced that are 
activated directly before the drug

467
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,563
drug hit.
But the thing is is that maybe you take 

468
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:39,720
heroin in 50 different situations and so
you're conditioning yourself to cues and

469
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:42,720
all those different situations use 
slightly different behaviors and so on.

470
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
So there's different things being 
shaped.

471
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,610
But one of the things that's always 
being reinforced,

472
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,820
even though not that much is this 
thought pattern.

473
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,800
And the thought pattern is something 
like,

474
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:53,843
well,
to hell with it doesn't matter anyways 

475
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,900
because he has to think that in order 
to,

476
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,780
especially at the beginning of a nice 
downhill trip,

477
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,943
you have to think that.
And so what happens is you build this 

478
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,124
monster in your head.
It's full of lies and rationalizations 

479
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,620
and their whatever lies and 
rationalizations allowed you to continue

480
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:14,454
the behavior to begin with,
but you're making them more and more 

481
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,820
potent.
And so you build a subpersonality inside

482
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:24,090
of you that is,
it's a one eyed monster.

483
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,223
Fundamentally all it wants is the drug 
and its armed with any number of 

484
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:33,840
perfectly depends on how smart you are.
You know like you can.

485
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:38,670
You can come up with a very
powerful nihilistic,

486
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:39,630
rational argument.

487
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,463
Why about life is futile and your 
future's dad and there's nothing better 

488
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,084
to do anyways and you'd be a fool to be 
engaged in such a destructive society 

489
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:50,770
and et cetera,
et cetera.

490
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:52,840
Like you cAn.
You can conjure up a very,

491
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,710
an argument that's virtually impermeable
to rational

492
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,590
to rational argument,
rational counter argument.

493
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,020
Because you know there's some things 
that you just can't prove.

494
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,430
You can't prove that life is 
intrinsically worthwhile,

495
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,323
you know,
because,

496
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,083
well for obviously for obvious reasons,
so now the reason I told you that is 

497
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:18,484
because I think it's a good example of 
how things are nested inside of each 

498
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:22,331
other,
you know,

499
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:23,164
and also the relationship between this,
this very large nesting of concentric 

500
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:30,100
lenses,
let's say,

501
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:33,130
and the way that those things are shaped
and reinforced across time.

502
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,623
Whenever you're acting locally and 
something goes the way you wanted to 

503
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,003
let's say,
and not the way you expect because 

504
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:44,110
that's what soaked in vinegar deliver 
and Jeffrey Gray and the people who were

505
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:44,944
looking at the orIenting response first 
presumed they presumed that you wanted 

506
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:53,290
things to go the way you expect,
but that's not exactly right and it's an

507
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,190
important distinction.

508
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,470
You want things to go the way you want 
them to go and if it's just expectation,

509
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:02,020
then it's a cold cognitive model of the 
world,

510
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,060
right?
It's like robotic,

511
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,530
okay,
happened now,

512
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,170
be should happen now.
See should happen.

513
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,860
It's like,
that isn't how you think at all.

514
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,903
You're always inside of motivational 
frame and it isn't only that you expect 

515
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,850
the next thing to happen,
but if the next thing happens,

516
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,330
it matters whether it's what you want or
not.

517
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,433
If it's what you want,
then that little system is reinforced 

518
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:25,540
you.
It's pleasurable for you,

519
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,374
and then the whole hierarchy grows a 
little bit stronger and if it is not 

520
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:32,254
what you want,
well then you have a problem and that's 

521
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:37,810
where things get weird and interesting.
So okay,

522
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,093
so you're going along from point a to 
point b and you can see tools and you 

523
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:47,380
can see obstacles and obstacles or 
anything that get in your path.

524
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,950
And what that means in some sense is 
that what a tool is and what an obstacle

525
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:55,930
is switches very rapidly as you change 
focus and as your intended changes.

526
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,510
So it's a dynamic system.
All right?

527
00:31:58,511 --> 00:31:59,344
And so the way emotion motion works in 
this regard is that if things are going 

528
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:04,204
the way you want them to,
then you feel positive emotion and that 

529
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:08,140
keeps you moving forward towards your 
goal.

530
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,350
And if you run into an obstacle,
then you feel negative emotions.

531
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,490
Okay?
So the next issue might be,

532
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,833
well,
just exactly what should you experience 

533
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:22,180
when you experience negative emotion?
Well then you might say,

534
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:23,014
well that's a tricky question because if
you encounter an obstacle that means 

535
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:32,560
that something about your model is 
wrong,

536
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,440
because if it was right,
then you wouldn't have been counted that

537
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,060
obstacle.
And so this is,

538
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,040
this is a very interesting way of 
thinking.

539
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,640
It's a pragmatic way of thinking because
what it illustrates is that whenever you

540
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,390
do something,
you're acting out a theory of truth,

541
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,913
and the theory of truth is
the actions that I'm undertaking at the 

542
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:56,600
moment are sufficient to reach the goal 
that I'm aiming at.

543
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,250
And so you set up a theory of truth with
each act.

544
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,470
You know,
so

545
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,970
so you're,
you're,

546
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,710
you're always struck with the reality of
truth and error or correct and incorrect

547
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,490
because
you cared,

548
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,333
posit that the goal is worth having,
and if there's a path to it that might 

549
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,133
be clear or,
or obstructed without also saying it 

550
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:23,420
matters whether you know what you're 
doing.

551
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,140
Okay?
so you hit an obstacle

552
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,190
and that produces negative emotion.
Now,

553
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,300
the problem you have here is that in 
principle,

554
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,063
the reason you hit that obstacle could 
be that there's an error in your nested 

555
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:44,330
model at any level of the model.

556
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,330
So that's why I told you the little 
story about the sun.

557
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,583
It's like normAlly you just turn your 
computer on and off because something 

558
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:56,180
has happened that's local,
but now and then your problem is the sun

559
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:57,014
isn't as reliable as you might like it 
to be and so you're faced with is 

560
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:04,910
insanely complex problem,
not when things go right,

561
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:05,744
because when things go right,
you can just continue ignoring 

562
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:10,220
everything that you were ignoring,
but when they go wrong,

563
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,690
the search space that opens up before 
you is just about infinite.

564
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,560
Now that that has real world 
consequences,

565
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,820
I mean one of the things that happens 
when people develop panic disorder,

566
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,683
what seems to happen is that I can tell 
you the typical story about how you 

567
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:27,824
would develop panic disorder with 
agoraphobia because the two things are 

568
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,740
somewhat separate.
So generally this happens to.

569
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,190
It generally happens to women.
It generally happens in their forties.

570
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,233
Women are more susceptible to anxiety 
and depression and men just so you two 

571
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,260
were more susceptible to substance abuse
and antisocial behavior

572
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,120
figures that something would go wrong 
right now.

573
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,730
Okay,
so now what do I ask myself?

574
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,940
Well,
if this is going to disrupt the class,

575
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,920
does it mean that there's something 
wrong with my computer?

576
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:07,921
Should I call these help people?
And they'll say,

577
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:09,394
well no,
we'll ignore it on the assumption that 

578
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:14,110
it will continue working and until that 
had martha says fails,

579
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,520
then we can ignore it.
Okay,

580
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,803
so,
so something goes wrong in the search 

581
00:35:20,591 --> 00:35:22,490
space opens up in front of you now.
Okay.

582
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,343
So back to the agoraphobic.
so what happens to her usually is 

583
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,063
generally these are people who've had 
dependent relationships and so perhaps 

584
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:31,624
they,
they had a relatively over predictive 

585
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:39,961
family or let's just say protective 
family and then they had a,

586
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,183
an intimate relationship early in their 
life and maybe that lasted for quite a 

587
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,050
long time or maybe they're still married
to the same guy,

588
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:47,220
but the,
the,

589
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,150
and,
and inside that relationship,

590
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,343
she's relatively dependent,
which means probably she doesn't go 

591
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:56,430
anywhere without her husband.
And she doesn't,

592
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,160
she doesn't do a lot of things 
autonomously,

593
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,690
let's say.
Okay,

594
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,183
so then

595
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,980
she gets my menopause and you know,
she's getting some strange physiological

596
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:11,724
symptoms from that of various sorts.
And then maybe at the same time she 

597
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,210
maybe she talks to her husband about a 
divorce or maybe he talks to her about a

598
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:22,044
divorce or maybe her sister gets 
divorced or maybe a close friend dies 

599
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,060
or,
or maybe her.

600
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Maybe she starts to experience heart 
palpitations because of the menopause.

601
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,200
And then she thinks,
oh my god,

602
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,593
that could happen to me.
It's like my whole world could fall 

603
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,234
apart.
And so that's one fear my whole world 

604
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:45,354
could fall apart.
So that's sorta the fear of societal 

605
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:50,310
catastrophe that the collapse of the 
structure.

606
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:52,980
And then the other fear is often,
oh my god,

607
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:54,750
I,
I couldn't be dying of a heart attack.

608
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:55,584
And so what happens to people who start 
to develop panic disorder is that they 

609
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:00,144
ended up going to the emergency room all
the time to be checked out by 

610
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:03,444
cardiologists.
And the cardiologists are used to this 

611
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,920
and they generally check people up quite
extensively.

612
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:10,770
But most of the time if there's 
something up with your heart,

613
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,020
there's nothing wrong,
but there could be.

614
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:18,000
And so then the sort of.
So what happens is

615
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,310
the

616
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,860
the person who has is developing a 
phobia,

617
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,173
starts thinking perhaps about what would
happen if her husband died or if they 

618
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:30,794
got divorced and then she starts 
thinking about the fact that while she 

619
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:34,124
doesn't really know what she do and she 
doesn't really know how to take care of 

620
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:37,274
a bunch of things and how,
how she might take care of the finances 

621
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:44,510
and so forth and so she has no real 
place to turn.

622
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,750
And so then then she makes the fatal 
mistake.

623
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,310
She goes out and she starts to panic and
then she goes home.

624
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:57,500
That's not good.
So if you ever develop severe anxiety,

625
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,040
one thing you don't want to do is avoid 
because of it.

626
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,170
Because as soon as you avoid because of 
it,

627
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,273
it gets worse.
and the reason for that is imagine her 

628
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:10,250
anxiety systems are trying to figure out
how afraid she should be.

629
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,490
And it ranged from panic stricken to 
none.

630
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,133
Well,
the anxiety systems have all sorts of 

631
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:22,520
sources of input because they're trying 
to calculate a very difficult problem.

632
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:25,070
Like if you know,
when this thing flickered,

633
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,870
one of the things that everyone does is 
look around and the reason you do that,

634
00:38:29,871 --> 00:38:33,230
it's called a referencing social 
referencing.

635
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:35,650
It's like how upset should I be about 
what's going on?

636
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,523
You look at everyone's face and you see,
well they're upset or not upset and 

637
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:40,414
everybody kind of comes to an average 
agreement about how upsetting this 

638
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:43,630
isn't.
We do that very,

639
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,430
very rapidly,
you know,

640
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,030
and we estimate how anxious we should be
by our default neuroticism,

641
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,120
you know,
so I would say generally speaking,

642
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,163
if you're,
if you have higher levels of negative 

643
00:38:57,371 --> 00:39:00,940
emotion rather than lower levels,
what happens is that you,

644
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:07,020
the severity that you estimate have 
given uncertain event to exist to,

645
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,630
to,
to have is higher than the severity.

646
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,170
Someone else might estimate if they were
more emotionally stable.

647
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,300
And then there's another input,
which is,

648
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,883
well,
how roughly how competent do people 

649
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:20,044
around you and you think you are,
because you know how afraid you should 

650
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:26,650
be is actually somewhat proportionate to
how competent you are,

651
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,080
right?
I mean if you're.

652
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,253
If you're a well practiced hunter and 
you're out in the forest and a bear 

653
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:33,310
charges you,
it's like,

654
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,203
well maybe you've seen 100 bears and you
know what to do and it's like it's a 

655
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:39,220
bear and all that,
but you're not going to run.

656
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,453
And so then the bear probably won't 
think you're prey because the bear 

657
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,600
thinks that if you run that,
your edible.

658
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,730
Now the thing that's really interesting 
is that if you watch yourself run,

659
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,860
then your brain thinks you're edible 
too.

660
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,010
So that's another input.
So because.

661
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,910
So the anxiety system is doing this 
terribly difficult calibration job,

662
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:02,170
which is okay,
something happened.

663
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,820
How upset should I be?
Well,

664
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,210
how upset or other people,
you know,

665
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,520
what's my physiological response?
How does it compare to other times I was

666
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:11,290
upset.
What are my options?

667
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,124
That's a good one because one of the 
things the anxiety system really wants 

668
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:19,140
is it wants you to come up with a plan.
He doesn't really care what the plan is,

669
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,133
although you have to believe it because 
it's not really a sophisticated 

670
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:25,450
cognitive system.
It's an alarm bell and it says,

671
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:26,590
look,
some things up here,

672
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,670
you have to knit up your world again and
put it to rest.

673
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,580
We need to be able to ignore everything 
again.

674
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,410
If you can't do that,
that thing will just go off forever,

675
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,273
but that's what happens.
At least in part to people that have 

676
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:40,270
post traumatic stress disorder.
There are soldiers,

677
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,550
you know,
and maybe they've gone out in battle and

678
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:43,384
they've watched themselves do terrible 
things because that's actually one of 

679
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:47,914
the most common precedents of 
posttraumatic stress disorder and they 

680
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:55,321
have no idea how to represent that in 
their hierarchical world model.

681
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,930
You know,
because part of your world model,

682
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:00,700
a huge part of it,
the what is part,

683
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,290
you know,
it's who you are.

684
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,990
It's like you might find out that you're
not who you are,

685
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,630
who you think you are.
You're not even who you think you are,

686
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,464
a little tiny bit like there's corners 
and nooks and whole unexplored rooms 

687
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:16,890
inside of you that contain things that 
if they ever come out like you,

688
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,210
you,
you're,

689
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,530
you're done.
You don't know what to do with it.

690
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,700
You know,
and if you're,

691
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,430
if you've dealt with someone who has 
post traumatic stress disorder,

692
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:27,130
it's very frequently the case that you 
have to,

693
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,000
they have to learn a philosophy of good 
and evil in order to recover.

694
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,323
and it has to be sophisticated because 
seen these terrible destructive forces 

695
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:37,310
at work and their old world model is 
just,

696
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:39,390
it's just not handling it,
you know?

697
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,303
So.

698
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,453
All right,
so what happens is the agoraphobic 

699
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,020
person runs and then their anxiety 
system says,

700
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,150
oh,
well what's chasing and ms dot obviously

701
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,410
a flesh eating predator and you know,
it isn't exactly that.

702
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:57,660
It thinks that they might have dreams 
like that.

703
00:41:57,661 --> 00:41:58,494
You know,
they could easily have dreams of being 

704
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:03,550
pursued,
but it's the same system like the,

705
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,190
the system that we use to run away from 
things that aid us when we were 30 pound

706
00:42:08,191 --> 00:42:09,024
mammals is the same system that we now 
use to process relatively abstract 

707
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,680
threat and why wouldn't it be ready to 
look as far as I'm concerned.

708
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:17,514
This isn't even a hypothesis.
It's like we know evolution is 

709
00:42:20,101 --> 00:42:20,934
conservative.
Everything builds on what was there 

710
00:42:22,651 --> 00:42:23,484
before.
So what else are you going to use when 

711
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:26,724
you're threatened by some abstract 
threat except the system that you used 

712
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,100
to use when you were threatened by a 
crocodile.

713
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,470
So it's,
it's only,

714
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,250
it's exactly that.
It's exactly the way it works.

715
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,390
So then,
you know,

716
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,830
she ends up question

717
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,773
both effect of exercise on anxiety.
Like in mean some people go for a jog 

718
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:49,484
and they feel better like stress relief,
but if you're saying if you run in that 

719
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:56,174
trigger zero,

720
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:56,791
oh no,
no,

721
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:59,970
you have to run from something just 
running.

722
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,420
That's irrelevant.
You like.

723
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,423
It's a huge difference if you're running
toward something that's way different 

724
00:43:05,101 --> 00:43:05,934
than if you're running away from trying 
to say you're like anxious about 

725
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,360
assignment and you go for a run and then
come back,

726
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,263
more clearheaded to work on it.
You're not running from the Assignment 

727
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,300
or you know you're just going out for a 
run.

728
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,940
That's okay.
Like,

729
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:18,390
look,
let me give you an example.

730
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:20,250
It's a good question.
Let me give you an example.

731
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,260
You take a stressor of a certain 
magnitude and you and you are interested

732
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:28,614
in the response of two groups.
If you let one group handled the 

733
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:32,814
stressor voluntarily and you forced the 
other group to handle the stressor in 

734
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,243
voluntarily,
the second group will produce much more 

735
00:43:40,321 --> 00:43:41,154
cortisol,
which is the primary stress hormone and 

736
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:46,080
so voluntary approach.

737
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,303
You use different psychophysiological 
systems for voluntary approach than you 

738
00:43:51,091 --> 00:43:51,924
do for retreat and you know part of what
you're doing when you're training 

739
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,710
someone or when you're doing using 
exposure,

740
00:43:56,711 --> 00:43:57,544
say with someone who has a phobia,
is that you're teaching them that the 

741
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,190
voluntary approach system.
If you activate that,

742
00:44:05,191 --> 00:44:07,500
that's a very good way of coping with 
anxiety.

743
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,650
Now they they don't know that this 
situation that we're describing,

744
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,493
because they're not autonomous,
they haven't ever moved to rely on that 

745
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:16,920
system.
So you know if you're,

746
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:20,700
if you're faced with a threat,
there's friday things you can do.

747
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,620
You can just panic,
but panic is usually distress.

748
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,550
You know,
maybe a child sort of does that.

749
00:44:26,551 --> 00:44:27,384
When it starts crying,
what happens when the child starts 

750
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:31,770
crying?
When someone comes its rescue,

751
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,633
right?
So one of the things you can do is 

752
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:36,510
admit,
distress cries and social resources will

753
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:39,150
come and be gathered around you and 
maybe that'll solve the problem,

754
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,433
but that doesn't work when your heart is
palpitating because who's going to fix 

755
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:45,510
that?

756
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,190
Well,
often these people,

757
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,433
If you look deeply into their thoughts,
maybe they're afraid to ride a subway 

758
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,350
and actual reason they're afraid to ride
the subway is because they think,

759
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:56,184
well,
what if the subway gets stopped between 

760
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,453
stations and I'm trapped on here and I 
have a heart attack and I can't get to 

761
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:06,630
the hospital.
So that hospital thing is running around

762
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:11,310
in their head all the time because their
default strategy for dealing with threat

763
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:12,144
is to seek authority.
And one of the things that often sets 

764
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,953
people up for development,
a negative or a phobia is that the 

765
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:19,524
authority that they rely on suddenly 
becomes uncertain for one reason or 

766
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:23,394
another.
Maybe the person is going to leave and 

767
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:25,134
then they're isolated.
Or maybe the person like if it's a 

768
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:28,464
husband,
say the person is what good is that if 

769
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:32,100
your heart's palpitating you're going to
have a heart attack.

770
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,650
It's,
it's a problem that can't be solved that

771
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:35,880
way.
And then you're faced,

772
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:37,530
you know,
people might think about that as a whole

773
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:40,530
existential crisis and it is an 
existential crisis.

774
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:43,530
It's like you're coming face to face 
with your own mortality.

775
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,380
And that's certainly the case.
Say that if,

776
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,740
if you're,
if you,

777
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,633
if you're going through menopause at the
same time because that's another 

778
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,293
profound life shift that indicates that 
you're sort of halfway done or two 

779
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:57,630
thirds of the way done,
something like that.

780
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,460
And that's of course,
you know,

781
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,220
you can think about that in terms of 
terror management as well.

782
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,850
So it is an existential crisis and the 
question is how do you deal with it?

783
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,530
And the answer to that generally is by 
becoming a lot tougher than you are.

784
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,060
And the way that you help people do that
is you teach them that there are certain

785
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:20,010
dangerous situations they can approach 
and they can approach them,

786
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,213
you know,
and generally people learn this quite 

787
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,370
quickly,
you know,

788
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,700
and so the psychoanalysts believed that 
if you just,

789
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,610
this was the early criticisms of 
behavioral exposure was that,

790
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,623
you know,
if you expose someone who's afraid to 

791
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:36,714
say just to an elevator that that will 
help the other fears or maybe the fear 

792
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:43,800
will be substituted somewhere else 
because it's just symptomatic.

793
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,380
But that'd be cool work.
It's not right.

794
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,400
And it's because when you expose someone
to an elevator,

795
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:54,150
you're not exposing them to an elevator.
If they're afraid of that elevator,

796
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:58,200
you're exposing them to their own death.
So the elevator,

797
00:46:58,201 --> 00:46:59,034
you could say,
well the reason that behavior exposure 

798
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:01,854
works and it generalizes is because
it's not easy to specify what the 

799
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:10,130
stimulus is.
I mean,

800
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,930
when I'm in front of an elevator,
it's an elevator.

801
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,040
When someone with agora phobia is in 
front of an elevator,

802
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,410
it's not an elevator,
that's the problem.

803
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,290
If it was just an elevator,
they just get on it and away they go.

804
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,153
So you know,
I had one client who was afraid of 

805
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:28,110
elevators and the elevator opened up and
she said that's a two,

806
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,340
and it was just an immediate response,
you know.

807
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,263
But you could say,
well that was the symbolic 

808
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:37,240
representation that came to mind.
But you could also say that,

809
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,193
well,
there are similarities between an 

810
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:41,074
elevator in it to when you can get 
trapped and started an elevator and you 

811
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:45,430
could get trapped inside an elevator and
die,

812
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,413
in which case it would be a two.
And the logical conclusion from that is 

813
00:47:49,121 --> 00:47:52,180
that everything could be a two.
And so you might think,

814
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:54,610
well the stimulus isn't too.
It's like,

815
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:55,360
yeah,
yeah,

816
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,520
wrong.
It can be too.

817
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,700
It's unlikely.
But then you might ask also ask yourself

818
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:01,534
this

819
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,200
if the chance that you're going to die 
somewhere as 100,000 to one,

820
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,190
should you be upset?
Well no answer to that as well.

821
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:17,370
Dying is of infinite magnitude and if 
you multiply one in 100,000 byte,

822
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,080
infinite magnitude,
you get a very,

823
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:20,914
very large number.
And so one of the things that makes you 

824
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:23,944
wonder is why the hell are people 
terrified out of their skin all the 

825
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:29,530
time?
And that is a very good question because

826
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:33,340
by no means obvious why people aren't.
And I actually think,

827
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:34,174
I often think that the mystery with a 
condition like agra phobia isn't that 

828
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:38,764
some people have agoraphobic.
It's that everyone doesn't have it all 

829
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:44,500
the time.
So because you know,

830
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:46,660
when the terror management people talk 
about this too,

831
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:47,494
is that because we're always confronting
our own mortality and in a world of 

832
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:51,724
infinite complexity,
why aren't we constantly in a state of 

833
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,130
panic and you know now and then you 
realize that you think,

834
00:48:57,131 --> 00:48:57,880
jeez,
you know,

835
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,530
why aren't we in a state of panic?
It's a very unsettling realization.

836
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:08,010
And why it isn't more common.
That's a very,

837
00:49:09,961 --> 00:49:11,310
very complicated question.

838
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:20,450
I think a lot of it is because we 
imitate other people and so a lot of our

839
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:21,294
faith,
let's say in the stability of our lives 

840
00:49:24,271 --> 00:49:25,104
and the utility and meaning of our lives
is actually instantiated at an embodied 

841
00:49:29,221 --> 00:49:31,770
level where it's not subject to 
criticism.

842
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,060
So.
So for example,

843
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,183
I'll give you an example.
There's a child two years old and 

844
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:43,470
there's a mother and they're together in
the kitchen and the most runs across the

845
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,180
floor.
Okay.

846
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,283
The child orients towards the mouse,
watches it zip across and then looks at 

847
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:52,020
his mother or her mother.
Why?

848
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,113
Well,
because something anomalous has 

849
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,494
occurred,
the significance of which is unstated 

850
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,380
and it's arousing.
It's like,

851
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:02,160
whoa,
look at that.

852
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,600
You know,
you can be startled by that.

853
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:04,200
Okay.
Wow.

854
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,120
Could that sip?
Well then you think,

855
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,990
what does mom think of that?
And mom is thinking,

856
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:10,530
oh,
that's him.

857
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,363
I was having.
Maybe she'll tell you about mice or 

858
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,150
maybe she'll send a trap or something,
but she's calm.

859
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:19,020
And so the child imitates that and then 
you know,

860
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,123
they've got a sense in their body that 
human beings can deal with mice and 

861
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:24,570
that's no problem,
but you know,

862
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:27,890
the alternative is that the most comes 
up and mother on the table,

863
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,420
he starts screaming.
It's like,

864
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,703
well you could be sure what the child's 
going to do in a situation like that is 

865
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,470
burst into tears and be extraordinarily 
upset,

866
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,983
you know?
So a lot of what we're doing when we're 

867
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:40,664
little and we watch people around this,
they modeled being calm and so we just 

868
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:50,201
adopt the implicit assumption.
It's an embodied assumption that you can

869
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,094
be calm in these circumstances.
And luckily enough we generally don't 

870
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,890
have,
generally doesn't come unglued.

871
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,380
But you can unglue it even by deep 
thought.

872
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,900
And I mean that,
that happens to people quite frequently.

873
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:05,450
That would be an existential 
catastrophe.

874
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,770
All right,
so let me show you something else here.

875
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:10,963
So

876
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,420
same idea.
Now this has changed a little bit.

877
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,273
She's going from point a to point b.
And what can happen while you can 

878
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:34,700
encounter tools and you cannot encounter
obstacles and use zero almost everything

879
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:37,310
out.
But you can look at it this way too.

880
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:38,683
When you're moving forward,
you can encounter what you predict that 

881
00:51:41,151 --> 00:51:43,970
should really be desired rather than 
predicted.

882
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,853
It's an old diagram or you can encounter
something that you didn't predict or 

883
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:49,094
desire and if you in,
if you encounter something that you 

884
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:55,540
predict and desire,
then you have positive emotion.

885
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,413
We know why that is.
You're getting to where you want to go 

886
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:58,214
and it validates the whole structure.
But then you run into something 

887
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:02,564
unpredicted.
Well then you get that's a threat and 

888
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,190
you get anxious.
Well,

889
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,850
you also get exploratory and so then you
might say,

890
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:15,920
well,
how anxious do you get?

891
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,930
And how exploratory do you get?
And I would say,

892
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:19,850
well,
it's proportional.

893
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,440
imagine the hierarchy.
Again,

894
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:28,660
if you feel that it's just
a inconvenience that you can make a mild

895
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:31,034
alteration in direct action and go over,
you'll be mildly inconvenienced and 

896
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:35,594
maybe you'll be a bit curious.
But what happens is that as your 

897
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:39,794
suspicion that the error is occurring at
higher and higher and broader and 

898
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:44,504
broader levels in the hierarchy,
the probability that you're going to be 

899
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,590
anxious and quite anxious compared to 
exploratory,

900
00:52:51,591 --> 00:52:54,680
at least initially starts to mound.
So,

901
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,353
and then all those other factors that I 
talked about also play a role like you 

902
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:00,500
know,
your social status,

903
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:03,140
your neuroticism,
your sense of self competence,

904
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,420
how much you've explored,
all of those other things.

905
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,390
It's very complicated thing to,
to,

906
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:09,380
uh,
address.

907
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:12,740
And so,
all right.

908
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:13,574
And so then we're going to concentrate 
on what happens if you experience an 

909
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,940
unpredicted outcome.
because here's the complicated question.

910
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,030
If you experienced an unpredicted 
outcome,

911
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,580
can you have a weird problem?
The problem is,

912
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:27,414
is that you have to figure out what to 
do about something that you don't know 

913
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:31,974
what to do about.

914
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:37,370
And that's
a big problem.

915
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:43,510
So
let's start with this one.

916
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,823
Alright?
So

917
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,640
you're going,
you're in the top left hand corner,

918
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:56,474
you're in this little frame and you're 
going from point a to point b and you 

919
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:03,380
encounter,
I'm calling it now and uh,

920
00:54:03,381 --> 00:54:04,214
normally and normally it's something 
that shouldn't be according to your 

921
00:54:07,851 --> 00:54:08,900
model of the world.

922
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,103
Now

923
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,190
what that does is it destabilizes that 
model at some level of resolution.

924
00:54:16,191 --> 00:54:19,760
Now,
what we're assuming here is that this is

925
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:23,390
a relatively high order disruption.
Okay?

926
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:24,224
So I can give you some examples of that 
are the heart palpitation example is a 

927
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:30,260
good one because that kind of,
that will kind of unglue you.

928
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,573
Maybe you take your child to the 
hospital because they have a minor 

929
00:54:33,711 --> 00:54:35,990
illness and you find out that they don't
have a minor illness,

930
00:54:35,991 --> 00:54:39,350
they have a major illness or you find 
that out about yourself or you find that

931
00:54:39,351 --> 00:54:40,184
out about your partner or maybe the 
stock market crashes or you have a car 

932
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:47,840
accident or you write the cat and you 
end up in the 25th percentile,

933
00:54:47,841 --> 00:54:50,000
like a quarter of the people who take it
do.

934
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,310
And then all of a sudden,
bang.

935
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,413
You're not where you thought you were 
and you're not going to where you 

936
00:54:55,761 --> 00:54:58,550
thought you were going and you don't 
know what the hell's going on,

937
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,340
and that can be,
as we said,

938
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:02,900
a small revolution.

939
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,793
Yeah,
just have to make a detour around it or 

940
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:10,121
it can just sucker punch you and that's 
as far as I've been able to determine.

941
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:11,384
That's alice down the rabbit hole.
That's a descent to the underworld and 

942
00:55:15,651 --> 00:55:17,180
what's down in the underworld.
Well,

943
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,043
partly what's don't everything is down 
there in the underworld and the the 

944
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:25,250
reason for that,
it's very complicated,

945
00:55:25,251 --> 00:55:29,000
but part of the reason is is that when,
when things fall apart,

946
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:34,540
you don't get to ignore things anymore 
because you had this model that told you

947
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:36,770
what was relevant in the world and what 
wasn't.

948
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:37,903
And the real important part of that 
model was that it told you what wasn't 

949
00:55:40,191 --> 00:55:42,920
relevant and then all of a sudden you 
know,

950
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:48,050
something pops up and takes you down.
It's like everything's relevant.

951
00:55:48,051 --> 00:55:48,884
Everything is potentially relevant and 
that's terribly stressful because 

952
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,170
everything is.
Should I be angry?

953
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,150
Should I be upset?
Should I cry?

954
00:55:56,151 --> 00:55:57,830
Should I get divorced?
Should I run away?

955
00:55:57,831 --> 00:55:59,870
Should I commit suicide?
It's like,

956
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,760
how am I going to come up with a new 
plan?

957
00:56:01,761 --> 00:56:03,920
Where am I going to get money?
Who's going to help me?

958
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,460
What's my future going to look like?
What is my past look like?

959
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:09,590
What am I going to do today?
What am I going to do tomorrow?

960
00:56:09,591 --> 00:56:10,424
It's like all of these things come up in
some of that weirdness in the external 

961
00:56:13,731 --> 00:56:14,564
world,
right?

962
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,920
And that would be,
well,

963
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:16,754
let's say that you decide to discover 
that your child's sick and let's say 

964
00:56:19,551 --> 00:56:21,710
that the doctors really don't know what 
to do about it.

965
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:22,873
Okay,
So you've just handed a problem of 

966
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:27,420
infinite complexity and a problem of 
infinite,

967
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,560
infinite complexity is like a journey 
through a maze that has no end.

968
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,280
It'S a branching maize,
and so what you'll find yourself doing,

969
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:37,114
for example,
is going on the internet and spending 

970
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:39,730
hundreds of hours.

971
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,563
If you've got a research oriented mind,
hundreds of hours looking up every 

972
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:46,780
single research article you can possibly
find on this condition,

973
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:47,763
and that'll range from like the farthest
out new age ideas to the most cutting 

974
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:53,050
edge science.
If you can handle that,

975
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,360
you know,
so good luck with that.

976
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:56,403
That's,
that's an infinite search and then 

977
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:03,400
that's not the only problem because.
So the fact that it's an infinite search

978
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:04,234
is very bad for you because there's no 
way you can calculate how much time and 

979
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:08,530
energy it's going to take before you 
solve tHe problem.

980
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,830
So,
so that's,

981
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,870
that's stressful.
Why?

982
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,090
Well,
obviously it's stressful.

983
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:16,924
It means that you have an infinite 
journey towards an uncertain goal and 

984
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,560
you can't even handle that.
You know what I mean?

985
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,280
Your journeys have to be such that 
they're self sustaining,

986
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:28,090
right?
I mean,

987
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,660
generally speaking,
when you're on a journey of some sort,

988
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:32,793
you have to obtain as much matter and 
energy as the journey costs and maybe a 

989
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:41,200
bit more because then you're storing 
some,

990
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:41,770
some,
uh,

991
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:42,370
for the future.

992
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:47,020
But if you've got this path of infinite 
complexity laying out in front of you,

993
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,370
it's like
your body can't calibrate that.

994
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,580
And so what it does is it throws you 
into emergency reaction mode.

995
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,350
And emergency reaction mode is prepare 
for everything.

996
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,660
And that's not good.
And so down there in the underworld,

997
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:09,670
the world itself turns into a maze of 
infinite complexity,

998
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:14,940
but you turn into a mass of competing 
models and a lot of them are based in,

999
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,070
in very low level motivation.
I mean,

1000
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,020
you're going to be angry.
That's for sure.

1001
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:22,470
You might be angry.
God only knows for how long you know,

1002
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,313
if it's a particularly nasty disease,
you might be angry for the rest of your 

1003
00:58:26,681 --> 00:58:31,681
life and you know you could be angry in 
a small way and accept fate or you could

1004
00:58:32,681 --> 00:58:36,120
be so angry that it completely consumes 
you and you're.

1005
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:39,010
You're out for revenge against being 
itself mean.

1006
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:39,883
And that happens to people.
And that's the only one of the emotions 

1007
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:47,650
and motivational states that are going 
to be hyper activated by the response.

1008
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:49,143
And so what happens is that your system 
collapses into the underlying basic 

1009
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:56,104
motivational states.
And so you're anxious and afraid and 

1010
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:03,931
angry and exploratory and upset and all 
of these things all at the same time.

1011
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,120
And that is your reaction to the 
unknown.

1012
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:12,760
Your reaction to the unknown is stop 
because you aren't where you thought you

1013
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:13,594
were.
and then the next thing is prepare for 

1014
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:16,684
anything and the way you prepare for 
anything is by getting ready to do 

1015
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:25,040
whatever it is that you can do.
So I kind of think about it as you're in

1016
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:30,041
a car and you've got the gas pedal 
pushed right to the metal and you've got

1017
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:31,520
the brake on at the same time.

1018
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:34,250
SO the car is roaring away.
But,

1019
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,740
and you know,
if you take your foot off the brake man,

1020
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:37,574
it's going to move,
but your foot off the brake because you 

1021
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:42,260
don't know where to go,
but you're still running at full tilt.

1022
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:46,130
And that'S not psychological.
Exactly right.

1023
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:46,964
It's psychophysiological cause you.
You're on energy and material burning 

1024
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:54,410
system and when you crack yourself up 
into high gear,

1025
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,620
then you're going to be burning a lot 
more energy and material.

1026
00:59:57,621 --> 01:00:00,290
And what happenS to people is that,
well,

1027
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:01,124
one of the things that happens is that 
you'll shut your immune system off 

1028
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,620
because if you're being.
Because it's costly.

1029
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,050
If you're being chased by a tiger,
who the hell cares?

1030
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:11,960
If you get flu in two weeks?
It's like shut that thing off.

1031
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,750
Everything that has to do with longterm 
survival,

1032
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:19,370
even your ability to think into the 
longterm is going to be shut off because

1033
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:21,883
your ability to think in the longterm 
failed and so you default back down to 

1034
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,980
instantaneous,
impulsive modes of action and it's,

1035
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,570
it's the right thing to do.

1036
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,433
You know,
you might take all of this is a hell of 

1037
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:35,870
a time.
You have a cloudy mind,

1038
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:37,200
but,
and,

1039
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:39,600
and sometimes that's the case,
but you're,

1040
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,523
you're wired up,
you're trying to solve this impossible 

1041
01:00:43,311 --> 01:00:44,144
problem,
which is what the hell do you do when 

1042
01:00:45,051 --> 01:00:45,884
you don't know what to do?
And the only answer to that is prepare 

1043
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:51,464
for everything because you're going to 
gather some more information and that 

1044
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,580
might tell you what needs to be done 
next,

1045
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:58,100
but you have no idea how fast it's going
to have to be done.

1046
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,000
It might be like,
you need to do thiS right now or,

1047
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,830
or you don't get It done at all.
So.

1048
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,950
So then you're down there in the 
underworld where all the,

1049
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,410
you know,
the great motivational beasts,

1050
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:12,170
lurk and where there's an infinite pop 
in front of you.

1051
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:14,510
And It's.
And maybe you don't get out.

1052
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,420
And that's the thing too,
is that that's the thing is,

1053
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:18,254
is that this isn't psychological and one
of the real problems with modern 

1054
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:27,860
clinical psychology and modern 
psychiatry just conceptually is that

1055
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:32,720
people automatically assume that if you 
have a problem,

1056
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:35,360
like if you're depressed and unhappy and
anxious,

1057
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,810
well then that's a,
that's a mental problem.

1058
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:39,644
It's A psychological problem.
It's like it's a problem in so far as 

1059
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:44,294
it's not pleasant.
But what if you're in a horrible 

1060
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:49,130
situation?
Well,

1061
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:50,510
you know,
the cognitive people would say,

1062
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:51,021
well,
you know,

1063
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:52,700
you just have to reconstruct It.
It's like,

1064
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:54,420
yeah,
if you can reconstruct it,

1065
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,420
man,
you're not in a horrible situation.

1066
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,763
You know,
and one of the things you see with the 

1067
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:02,390
cognitive behaviors for example,
is when they assess depression,

1068
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:03,224
they use the beck depression inventory 
and I'd given the beck depression 

1069
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:10,691
inventory to hundreds of people and 
their criteria for when you should be an

1070
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,423
outpatient in a psychiatric ward is 
probably the level of depression that 

1071
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,800
one third.
Have you experienced the first year that

1072
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:20,634
you were in university?
Because I've given this instrument to 

1073
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:25,590
lots of university students in one slash
third of them,

1074
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:30,240
at least In the first year meet criteria
for hospitalization with the back.

1075
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:32,580
So the way the cognitive behavior is 
people,

1076
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,463
what do you call,

1077
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,733
evade this issue is they just set their 
diagnostic instruments so low that the 

1078
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:43,680
people that they described as depressed 
actually don't have a problem.

1079
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,780
You know?
So I think the cutoff for,

1080
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,600
for outpatient is 15.
You know,

1081
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:51,630
you're not happy when you're,
when you get up 15 on the back.

1082
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,460
But if you are depressed,
you get a 60,

1083
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,533
it's like your depressed.
And then you talk to someone like that 

1084
01:02:57,061 --> 01:02:59,280
and you find out,
well maybe you're depressed,

1085
01:02:59,281 --> 01:03:00,114
but maybe you just have a terrible life 
and the terrible life is and good luck 

1086
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:09,591
reconstructing that man.
So you're not very bright for,

1087
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,460
for example.
And that's a big problem.

1088
01:03:11,461 --> 01:03:14,610
So maybe you have an iq of 85 or maybe 
you have an iq of 80.

1089
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,220
It's like good luck finding a job.
And if you do find one,

1090
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:18,900
it's not going to pay.
So.

1091
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:21,990
And it's not going to be stable and 
you're not going to get good hours.

1092
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,910
And so then,
well,

1093
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:26,010
you know,
your only friend is crazy.

1094
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:30,690
And then your family is like distorted 
and twisted up beyond belief.

1095
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:31,524
You know.
So maybe your mother is a chronic 

1096
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:34,390
alcoholic with dementia.
That'd be,

1097
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:37,380
that'd be a nice touch.
And you know,

1098
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:41,070
maybe your friends are only not very 
good for you.

1099
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:43,110
They're actively bad for you because 
you've,

1100
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,033
you know,
you've fallen in with some bloody 

1101
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:47,850
psychopaths and because you're not 
particularly bright,

1102
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:50,760
they can get your money every time you 
get your support,

1103
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:52,890
check your unemployment check or 
something like that.

1104
01:03:52,891 --> 01:03:55,300
And you know,
well,

1105
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:56,143
you know,
you get someone like that in your 

1106
01:03:56,821 --> 01:03:58,380
practice and you think,
well,

1107
01:03:58,381 --> 01:03:59,470
they're unhappy.
It's like,

1108
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,170
are they depressed?
Well,

1109
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,453
no,
they're in the underworld and it's not 

1110
01:04:05,901 --> 01:04:08,660
the same thing.
Here's depressed,

1111
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:12,740
depressed is someone comes in,
they're reasonably well educated,

1112
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,410
they have a job.
And when you ask them about the job,

1113
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:16,081
they say,
well,

1114
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:16,440
I,
you know,

1115
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,680
I,
I used to like my job or maybe I even do

1116
01:04:18,681 --> 01:04:21,050
like my job,
but I just don't find that I'm motivated

1117
01:04:21,051 --> 01:04:21,884
right now and I can't understand why.
Then he asked them about their marriage 

1118
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:25,760
and they say,
well,

1119
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,500
you know,
I have a good marriage.

1120
01:04:27,501 --> 01:04:29,030
And then you ask them about their family
and they say,

1121
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:29,864
well,
I've got the average number of family 

1122
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:31,610
problems,
but it's,

1123
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:32,750
you know,
all things considered,

1124
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:34,760
it's not too bad.
And So,

1125
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,130
and then they don't have a drug or 
alcohol problem,

1126
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,710
but they score lIke 30 on the back.
You think,

1127
01:04:39,711 --> 01:04:41,750
hey,
you could take some antidepressants.

1128
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:44,540
You're depressed,
you don't have a terrible life,

1129
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,700
you know,
and they know that they often don't have

1130
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:48,320
any real cognitive symptoms either.

1131
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,153
although they might be reacting 
negatively to some of the negative 

1132
01:04:51,981 --> 01:04:55,400
things are happening with those people.
Something's gone astray,

1133
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,230
you know,
maybe their sleep is upset.

1134
01:04:57,231 --> 01:05:00,710
That's often the case.
So when what they're suffering from is a

1135
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,160
disequilibrium of,
oh,

1136
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:04,550
fall,
sleep,

1137
01:05:04,551 --> 01:05:05,790
wake rhythms.
And so it's,

1138
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:06,703
it's got out of whack.
And so you straighten up your sleep in 

1139
01:05:08,091 --> 01:05:10,190
their better or sometimes they need 
antidepressants,

1140
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:11,383
but for the fIrst person like 
antidepressants might take the edge off 

1141
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:15,980
and maybe not too.
But.

1142
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,693
And what are you going to do?
You're going to get the person to 

1143
01:05:18,641 --> 01:05:21,760
reconstru that assumes they have 
options.

1144
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,073
You know.
And the problem with educated smart 

1145
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,470
people is they think everybody has 
options because they do.

1146
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,280
It's like,
no,

1147
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,050
that's not right.
Some people have,

1148
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:33,220
some people have no options there,
like trapped in a corner.

1149
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,450
And no matter how hard you try,
you cannot get them out of the corner.

1150
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,533
You know,
sometimes it takes a virtual miracle 

1151
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:40,594
before that can happen.
So the thing about the underworld is 

1152
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:44,380
the,
it's a real place.

1153
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:45,214
It's a real place.
And depending of course on how you 

1154
01:05:48,101 --> 01:05:51,430
define place,
but that's exactly the issue.

1155
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:54,580
How should you define plAce?
Well,

1156
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:56,123
no,
I would say for the sake of argument 

1157
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,980
that you mIght as well define it two 
ways.

1158
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:04,490
You might as well use the standard 
newtonian view that you know the world's

1159
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:05,343
made out of inanimate material entities 
arrayed in a certain manner because 

1160
01:06:09,311 --> 01:06:11,590
that's a very useful approach for many 
problems.

1161
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,490
But then there's another perspective 
which is no,

1162
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:14,831
no,
no.

1163
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:17,650
The meAnings that are arrayed themselves
in front of you in the world.

1164
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:22,651
Those are real,
and I would also say just mentioned this

1165
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:23,674
very briefly,
it's something that idea I've been 

1166
01:06:25,871 --> 01:06:27,670
working on for a long time.
Is it,

1167
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:38,570
there is an implication of darwinian 
theory and the implication is that

1168
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:41,503
we talked about this a little bit,
environments very complex and it's 

1169
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:48,470
transforming unpredictably and so what 
that means is

1170
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,130
you cannot ever be right about the 
environment.

1171
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:54,080
So righT.
Correct.

1172
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:59,340
Is out to reach.
The best you can do is come to partial.

1173
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,570
You can partially accommodated and so 
you'd say,

1174
01:07:02,571 --> 01:07:04,520
okay,
well how have we partially accommodated?

1175
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,480
Well,
here we are.

1176
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,090
We've been evolving through three and a 
half billion years,

1177
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:12,890
given it our best shot and here we have 
these bodies and there are a solution to

1178
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:15,440
the problems posed by the transforming 
environment.

1179
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,611
And you might Say,
well,

1180
01:07:16,611 --> 01:07:18,500
how good a solutIon are those?
Well,

1181
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:19,783
you got 70 years.
It's the best we've been able to manage 

1182
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:22,933
him.
Managing three and a half billion years 

1183
01:07:24,001 --> 01:07:24,834
is to generate up a biological platform 
that has enough flexibility to keep up 

1184
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:30,200
with the environment for about 75 years.

1185
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:34,370
So then you think so there's no final 
answer to the problem.

1186
01:07:34,371 --> 01:07:35,204
The environment presents.
There isn't an it's because it actually 

1187
01:07:38,451 --> 01:07:43,010
changes unpredictably.
So there's no way of being right now.

1188
01:07:43,011 --> 01:07:43,850
Well then you might say,
well,

1189
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,350
what does right mean?
Well,

1190
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,173
from the darwinian perspective,
in some sense there's no other right 

1191
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:54,380
then that you're alive and that you're 
likely to reproduce.

1192
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,480
That's the best you ever get.
Okay?

1193
01:07:56,481 --> 01:07:59,570
So let's say,
well that's your pragmatic definition of

1194
01:07:59,571 --> 01:08:00,404
right?
Well then what that means is that if 

1195
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:04,243
that is right as far as right can be 
determined as far as being human is 

1196
01:08:07,971 --> 01:08:08,804
concerned,
then when you are reacting by fleeing 

1197
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,063
freezing,
when something terrible is chasing you 

1198
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:22,040
because you perceive it as a threat,
the fact that it's a threat is right.

1199
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:23,983
It's not an overlay on reality.
It's like if you didn't perceive a 

1200
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:29,150
predator as a threat,
then you would get eaten.

1201
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:33,400
And so I think,
you know,

1202
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:37,550
you could think of the darwinian world 
as nested inside the newtonian world,

1203
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:40,010
which is how most scientists think,
but I don't believe that.

1204
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,873
I think it's the other way around.
I think the darwinian world is the 

1205
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:44,983
ultimate world in a sense.
And the newtonian world is just a tiny 

1206
01:08:48,141 --> 01:08:50,120
subset of that and it's,
it's useful.

1207
01:08:50,121 --> 01:08:51,170
Subsidized,
it's a tool.

1208
01:08:51,171 --> 01:08:53,840
It's a useful subset,
but the real world,

1209
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:57,980
the darwinian darwinian takes precedence
over all knowledge structures.

1210
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:58,933
That's how it looks to me.
And I don't see a way out of that 

1211
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:04,410
argument.
So I mean,

1212
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:05,900
it,
it depends to a large.

1213
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:06,780
Yep.

1214
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,060
So are you saying,
I'm

1215
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:14,190
trying to understand saying,
are you saying that

1216
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:17,810
our,
our

1217
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,950
estimations of the deterministic 
material,

1218
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:32,640
like a missionary,
a ride to find truth so that we can make

1219
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,690
assumptions about our.
Yeah.

1220
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:39,841
So,
well here,

1221
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:40,674
here's another example.
You guys can think about this for a 

1222
01:09:42,421 --> 01:09:44,820
minute if you like.
So

1223
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:47,453
let's say that one of the logical 
consequences of pursuing science from a 

1224
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:51,663
newtonian perspective is that you learn 
how to create cross ebola with small 

1225
01:09:55,031 --> 01:09:55,864
pox,
which is what the kgb was trying to do 

1226
01:09:57,661 --> 01:09:58,680
it in the 19 eighties.
Okay.

1227
01:09:58,681 --> 01:10:01,500
So you manage that and everyone dots.
It's like,

1228
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:05,880
how's that for a validation of science?
No,

1229
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:08,160
it's like,
because this could happen,

1230
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:09,023
right?
Our,

1231
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,043
our technological capability which is 
fostered by this particular model could 

1232
01:10:13,741 --> 01:10:17,610
easily enable us to produce something 
that will wipe all of this out.

1233
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:19,170
And then.
Well are you going to say,

1234
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:22,050
well yeah.
Apart from that it was right.

1235
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:23,611
And,
and then I think,

1236
01:10:23,611 --> 01:10:25,770
well it's a tricky argument because 
okay.

1237
01:10:25,771 --> 01:10:28,440
So let's say
here's,

1238
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:29,363
here's part of the problem.
And I also thought the same thing about 

1239
01:10:31,141 --> 01:10:32,070
hydrogen bonds.

1240
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:32,903
It's like,
well obviously the quantum view let's 

1241
01:10:35,311 --> 01:10:37,530
say is accurate because if you follow 
it,

1242
01:10:37,531 --> 01:10:41,480
you can make a hydrogen bomb,
but then you can step back from that and

1243
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:42,121
you can say,
yeah,

1244
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:44,070
yeah.
but the thing is to make a hydrogen bomb

1245
01:10:44,071 --> 01:10:48,750
or to cross ebola with smallpox,
you have to treat the matter that you're

1246
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:52,890
interacting with as if it's actually 
separate from everything else.

1247
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,580
And the thIng is it's not actually 
separate from everything else.

1248
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,800
It's actually connected to everything 
else.

1249
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,390
Now you can say,
well,

1250
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:01,224
if you treat it as if it's separate,
here's some operations you can 

1251
01:11:03,961 --> 01:11:06,390
undertake.
You can cross ebola with smallpox,

1252
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:07,343
but then you've ignored a bunch of 
things like maybe that's not a good 

1253
01:11:09,091 --> 01:11:11,010
idea.
And then everyone dies.

1254
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,143
And so the reduction is in the model 
which helps it specify its target and 

1255
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:16,914
increase its accuracy.
has the corresponding negative 

1256
01:11:19,411 --> 01:11:20,244
consequence of pretending that the 
context within which these enterprises 

1257
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:28,440
are being conducted can be ignored and 
that that's actually appropriate.

1258
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:31,350
And that's a big problem.
It's a big problem

1259
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:33,683
framework.

1260
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:37,780
Well,
it's it.

1261
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:38,613
It's not only,
it's not only because of what it 

1262
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:42,970
provides us.
I think the reason that the evolutionary

1263
01:11:42,971 --> 01:11:43,804
perspective has to be the one that 
supersedes is because you cannot model 

1264
01:11:50,321 --> 01:11:52,690
the environment.
It's not possible.

1265
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:56,680
All you can do is keep up with it.
And the only way you can keep up with it

1266
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,380
is through darwinian processes.
Random.

1267
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,110
I mean,
I know it's not a complete theory,

1268
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:02,944
but for the sake of argument,
you have to generate random alterations 

1269
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,081
and you know,
you say,

1270
01:12:08,081 --> 01:12:08,914
well,
in principle we could understand 

1271
01:12:10,361 --> 01:12:11,650
everything scientifically.
It's like,

1272
01:12:11,651 --> 01:12:13,630
no,
in principle we can't.

1273
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,030
Everything's too complex to understand

1274
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:24,760
that's right.
Confined

1275
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,720
that it's,
it's,

1276
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,750
it's more in line with reality.

1277
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:32,713
Yeah.

1278
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,240
Well,
and and you,

1279
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:43,173
when john was talking about the origin 
of the scientific mindset and he traced 

1280
01:12:48,291 --> 01:12:52,640
its development back to alchemy,
here's another reason why the scientific

1281
01:12:52,641 --> 01:12:55,760
mindset is necessarily nested in the 
mythological mindset.

1282
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:01,360
So whAt the outcome is we're trying to 
do was to mess around wIth matter and to

1283
01:13:02,301 --> 01:13:07,301
produce something they argued for 
centuries over what this thing was,

1284
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:08,803
this philosopher's stone and what the 
philosophers stone would enable the 

1285
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:18,010
holder of it to do would be to transmute
elements into gold.

1286
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:21,290
So that would make you rich and it would
provide

1287
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:28,760
immortality and perfect health for the,
for the person who discovered it.

1288
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,710
Okay?
Now what young said,

1289
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,570
it's,
we'll talk about this.

1290
01:13:32,571 --> 01:13:33,404
If I have enough energy,
we'll talk about thIs two thirds of the 

1291
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:38,300
way through the class because it's so 
damn complicated that some years I can't

1292
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,460
muster up enough energy to to discuss 
it,

1293
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:45,960
but
you don't believe that,

1294
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:47,563
you know,
people have always been trying to cope 

1295
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:50,670
with their mortality rate and their 
vulnerability.

1296
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:51,300
okay,
fine.

1297
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,133
That makes perfect sense.
And so he did an analysis of western 

1298
01:13:54,961 --> 01:13:56,670
history,
roughly speaking and said,

1299
01:13:56,671 --> 01:13:58,440
well,
what happened?

1300
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,993
There was a christian app poc maybe that
lasted about 1600 years roughly 

1301
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:03,804
speaking.
And there was an idea at the base of it 

1302
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:05,610
and the,
the,

1303
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:10,080
the idea was that through spiritual 
discipline,

1304
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,060
man could transcend suffering,

1305
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,010
but there was a problem with that was 
that all this suffering kept happening,

1306
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:18,850
you know,
and,

1307
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,630
and there was some warps in the idea 
because as nature pointed out,

1308
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,633
while this

1309
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:29,310
seizing of suffering was only going to 
happen after you die and okay,

1310
01:14:29,311 --> 01:14:30,060
fine,
that's,

1311
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,650
then you're,
you live forever in blast.

1312
01:14:31,651 --> 01:14:32,484
But still there's like black plague and 
babies dying and crops failing and he 

1313
01:14:36,601 --> 01:14:38,940
just doesn't seem that you can just 
Ignore that.

1314
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:41,160
And so you've got 15,
16,

1315
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:43,650
hundred years of christianity,
you know,

1316
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:45,960
and the whole history of christianity 
behind that,

1317
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:50,700
grinding away on this problem,
trying to produce a system of redemption

1318
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:55,550
and it and it doesn't work or it works 
partially and,

1319
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,070
and it also ignores certain things.
So partly what it ignores,

1320
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,050
you know,
one of the presuppositions of say,

1321
01:15:01,051 --> 01:15:04,800
medieval christianity,
is that the world roughly speaking,

1322
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,720
is an evil place and that matter is 
corrupt and unworthy of attention.

1323
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,570
Well,
one of young's hypoThesis is that if you

1324
01:15:12,571 --> 01:15:16,290
ignore something long enough,
then it starts to demand your attention,

1325
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:20,490
you know,
it's like a re repression and then,

1326
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,683
and that's especially the case if 
there's a problem that you're trying to 

1327
01:15:23,581 --> 01:15:26,130
solve,
that your current worldvIew really isn't

1328
01:15:26,131 --> 01:15:26,700
solving.

1329
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:31,440
It's like your attention is going to be 
drawn unconsciously to that which you've

1330
01:15:31,441 --> 01:15:32,274
ignored and put down.
And so yom saw the development of 

1331
01:15:36,511 --> 01:15:39,420
alchemy as a parallel to the development
of christianity.

1332
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,840
But alchemy studied matter,
which was for being in a sense,

1333
01:15:44,911 --> 01:15:46,950
it was damned from the christian 
perspective,

1334
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:50,400
the alchemists we're studying,
the transmutation of matter.

1335
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:55,800
They had an intuition that there was 
information locked in that in matter and

1336
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,410
that if you could just figure out how to
interact with it property,

1337
01:15:58,411 --> 01:15:59,244
then you could free up the information 
and they symbolize that in a dream like 

1338
01:16:02,401 --> 01:16:03,234
manner that dreamlike manner was you 
could discover the philosopher's stone 

1339
01:16:06,391 --> 01:16:08,190
and that would give you,
you know,

1340
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:10,530
wealth,
health and eternal life.

1341
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:12,390
Well,
as far as human was concerned,

1342
01:16:12,391 --> 01:16:15,570
that was a century's long dream and it 
was,

1343
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,120
it was like an artistic production.
It wAs like the.

1344
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:19,003
It was the scaffolding of the scientific
perspective because it doesn't like 

1345
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:22,584
people went from medIeval christianity 
to full fledged scientists and like 

1346
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:29,910
overnight it took hundreds of years for 
this to occur and there were,

1347
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:33,630
there were changes in the substrata of 
thought that were occurring.

1348
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:37,890
As this was happening,
you trace that back more than 1600 years

1349
01:16:37,891 --> 01:16:42,000
in the development of alchemy.
And so the dream of alchemy was that you

1350
01:16:42,001 --> 01:16:42,834
could discover,
you could master the transmutation of 

1351
01:16:44,911 --> 01:16:45,744
matter such that there'd be no disease,
that no one would die and everyone was 

1352
01:16:48,241 --> 01:16:49,470
wealthy.
Well,

1353
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:53,010
okay.
That as far as young was concerned,

1354
01:16:53,011 --> 01:16:53,844
that provided the motivation for science
because one of the things you might ask 

1355
01:16:56,911 --> 01:16:57,600
is,
well,

1356
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,030
why do people do science?
I mean,

1357
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:02,160
most people never have,
right?

1358
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:04,200
It's not very old,
600 years.

1359
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,780
It only emerged in one place.
Roughly speaking.

1360
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:08,740
It's very fragile and not.

1361
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:13,220
And plus just think of what you have to 
do if you're a scientist,

1362
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:14,054
you know,
if you're a scientist and use a 

1363
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:18,080
microscope,
a high powered microscope,

1364
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:18,943
you have to spend 10,000 hours looking 
through that damn thing before you can 

1365
01:17:21,891 --> 01:17:22,724
see what's there.
And so you think that's a weird thing 

1366
01:17:25,221 --> 01:17:28,100
for a tree dwelling ape to be doing,
you know,

1367
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:29,780
you know what I mean?
It's such a war pub.

1368
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,810
our natural of our natural instincts and
our,

1369
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:33,441
our,
you know,

1370
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:34,274
our desire to make contact with other 
people and to be doing something 

1371
01:17:36,771 --> 01:17:39,590
exciting and you're looking through this
damn too,

1372
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,030
you know,
and it's even painful.

1373
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:44,600
What the hell is motivating you?
And the answer would be,

1374
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:47,420
well you think you're doing something 
good.

1375
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:50,180
You think that science is going to 
benefit mankind.

1376
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:53,180
So it's nested necessarily in a 
motivational system.

1377
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,750
It isn't that you do science because you
want to discover facts,

1378
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:02,230
it's that you do science to discover 
facts so that things improve isn't it,

1379
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:03,763
and you just,
you just kind of ignore the fact that 

1380
01:18:06,141 --> 01:18:08,450
you're doing it in the hopes that thing 
will,

1381
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,680
things will improve.

1382
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,110
You can't just take that out of the 
equation and say,

1383
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,910
no,
I'm purely objective.

1384
01:18:13,911 --> 01:18:14,960
It's like,
hey,

1385
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:17,480
you're not and you better not be,
you know,

1386
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:18,343
because a purely objective person 
wouldn't be a person you couldn't even 

1387
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,070
communicate with someone like that.
Plus they wouldn't be able to.

1388
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:27,860
Someone like that wouldn't be able to 
determine what was relevant.

1389
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,800
Just distinguish what was relevant from 
what wasn't relevant.

1390
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,470
If you need motivational systems to do 
that,

1391
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,660
and I can tell you when you're looking 
at a data set,

1392
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:38,270
there's an infinite number of things 
that you can,

1393
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:41,030
that you can look at in that data set.
Literally.

1394
01:18:41,031 --> 01:18:44,420
I mean there's no end to the statistical
procedures that you can,

1395
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:47,060
that you can implement.
It's like fiddling,

1396
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,000
fiddling with a photo in photoshop.
It's like,

1397
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:50,834
man,
you can fiddle with that damn thing for 

1398
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:53,150
the rest of your life.

1399
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,433
And so what that means is that the 
complexity that's there can't be dealt 

1400
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,120
with objectively because if you deal 
with it objectively,

1401
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:07,121
there is no way of separating the one 
path through the data from all the other

1402
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:08,234
millions of paths through the data.
It's not like when you're doing 

1403
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:10,940
statistics,
man,

1404
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:11,983
it's not like you take a bunch of 
numbers and you feed it through a meat 

1405
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:14,354
grinder.
Outcome results like it is absolutely 

1406
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:16,874
nothing like that.
You're making ethical choices at every 

1407
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:22,040
single level of the decision.
And you know,

1408
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:24,350
if you're,
am I teach my students this too,

1409
01:19:24,351 --> 01:19:28,510
so I want them to be straight scientists
and there's lots of things that can work

1410
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:31,070
you as a scientist and one can be.
You want to have a career.

1411
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:34,020
And then the other is that you want to 
climb up the dough,

1412
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,720
the primate,
the scientists,

1413
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:37,820
primate dominance hierarchy and you 
know,

1414
01:19:37,821 --> 01:19:38,654
fair enough,
you need to have a career and maybe the 

1415
01:19:41,031 --> 01:19:42,140
ambition,
it's worth it.

1416
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:42,973
But the problem with that is that that 
can make you do things that violate the 

1417
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:49,340
principles of the entire enterprise.
And that's happening.

1418
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:50,503
I mean it's been scandalous particularly
in social psychology because people do 

1419
01:19:53,301 --> 01:19:56,960
what's called data mining and they just 
keep doing their analysis till something

1420
01:19:56,961 --> 01:20:00,530
significant pops up and then they write 
a story about why that's important.

1421
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,630
And like,
I'm not cynical about that.

1422
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,960
I understand why it happens.
I think it's inevitable that it happened

1423
01:20:05,961 --> 01:20:09,030
some because lots of people who are 
publishing,

1424
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:11,700
it's like the first bloody finger,
second thing they've ever published.

1425
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,680
They don't know whAt they're doing,
you know?

1426
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:16,440
so there's going to be error like map.
But I,

1427
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:17,910
what I tell my students,
look,

1428
01:20:17,911 --> 01:20:20,310
if you're going to do statistical 
analysis properly,

1429
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,000
you have to get yourself oriented.
What the hell are you do it?

1430
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:26,040
What is it that you're really doing?

1431
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:27,990
And you think,
well,

1432
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:28,824
I'm trying to discover something solid.
And the reason I'm trying to do that is 

1433
01:20:31,141 --> 01:20:32,880
because there should be benefits from 
that.

1434
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:34,013
Otherwise the whole enterprise is 
foolish and you might as well be a 

1435
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:36,834
bloody.
You might as well go work in finance if 

1436
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:39,930
you're not interested in that because 
you really,

1437
01:20:39,931 --> 01:20:43,440
you're not going to make any money as a 
scientist and you can make lots of money

1438
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:46,320
in finance and you're smart enough to go
into finance.

1439
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:49,620
So if that's what you want,
if you want power and money,

1440
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,040
and I'm not complaining about that,
it's like goal where it is,

1441
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:56,760
but science isn't it?
If you want to discover facts maybe,

1442
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:59,970
and that may be of some benefit at some 
point,

1443
01:20:59,971 --> 01:21:01,920
then you become a scientist.
Okay?

1444
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:02,754
So that you've got to keep your eye on 
the ball and then you have to decide if 

1445
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,593
pursuing that line of truth and benefit 
supersedes whatever you might do to 

1446
01:21:10,651 --> 01:21:11,580
build your career.

1447
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,890
Okay?
Because you're always playing that game.

1448
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,120
Oh,
it's your whole life.

1449
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,983
And that's actually why so much of 
scientific research is wrong if there's 

1450
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:20,604
an error too,
and there's all sorts of other reasons 

1451
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:22,584
and you can't expect the system to do 
much better than produced five percent 

1452
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:27,780
of useful output anyways.
So.

1453
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,453
Okay,
and then the other thing is you have to 

1454
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:34,020
also be afraid and here's what you 
should be afraid of.

1455
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:36,930
Let's say you discover something that 
isn't there.

1456
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,243
Okay,
then you're going to spend your next 15 

1457
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:40,644
years studying it.
So if you want to spend your next 15 

1458
01:21:43,051 --> 01:21:46,140
years studying this thing that you've 
conjured out of nothing,

1459
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:48,600
then go right ahead.
But if you don't want to do that,

1460
01:21:48,601 --> 01:21:49,434
then you better be properly oriented 
when you do your statistical analysis 

1461
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:53,213
and that's because statistical analysis 
is an ethical process and so it's 

1462
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:58,350
science because it's,
it has to be.

1463
01:21:58,890 --> 01:21:59,723
If it isn't nested inside ethics,
fundamentally then it who god only 

1464
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:07,410
knows.
it could be completely destructive.

1465
01:22:07,411 --> 01:22:09,990
It could be counterproductive.
Like so.

1466
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,690
Oh.
so then there's a variety of reasons why

1467
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:17,280
that darwinian bucket is sort of the 
outside.

1468
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:18,183
It's the outside.
You don't get any farther out than that 

1469
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:22,950
as far as I can tell.
So.

1470
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,790
And it's the darwinian world too,
which were adaptive,

1471
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:27,263
you know,
that's why we perceive things as 

1472
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:28,944
threats.
That's why we perceive things as 

1473
01:22:30,031 --> 01:22:30,864
positive.
That's why we perceive things as 

1474
01:22:31,921 --> 01:22:32,970
negative,
you know,

1475
01:22:32,971 --> 01:22:36,450
when we tend to think that those are 
overlays on a deeper reality,

1476
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:40,260
it's like that is not so clear and you 
know,

1477
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,040
I didn't know this,
but when I was working out these ideas,

1478
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:44,933
I'd never,
I'd never read anything that heidegger 

1479
01:22:46,351 --> 01:22:47,610
had written.
Although you know,

1480
01:22:47,611 --> 01:22:48,444
his influences wormed its way into many 
fields and I undoubtedly picked up some 

1481
01:22:52,321 --> 01:22:55,320
of his ideas because they get embedded 
in other places,

1482
01:22:55,321 --> 01:22:56,154
but certainly one of heidegger's claims 
was the western philosophy got off on 

1483
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:04,860
the wrong foot right at the beginning 
because he didn't study being it started

1484
01:23:04,861 --> 01:23:05,694
to think about thought and what's the 
real issue is being and what is being 

1485
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:14,400
well being is what you experience and 
for the high to ian's.

1486
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:16,390
That's,
that's realIty.

1487
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:20,500
There isn't a reality underneath that.
Now requires a real shift in perspective

1488
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:21,363
to start to try to think that way.
And I think the easiest way to do it is 

1489
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:25,840
to think both ways.
You know,

1490
01:23:25,841 --> 01:23:26,674
sometimes you think like a newtonian,
fair enough and then other times you 

1491
01:23:29,531 --> 01:23:31,390
don't.
And you need to know when to think.

1492
01:23:31,391 --> 01:23:32,224
Like an antonio and when to think like 
someone who understands that the 

1493
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,473
phenomena of meaning that surround us 
are legitimate and it's a very 

1494
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:43,084
interesting thing and this is one of the
things that's really driven me through 

1495
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:46,654
this material is okay,
so we can make a case that like lord or 

1496
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:52,504
meanings are real.
Like if you perceive a bear or a cliff 

1497
01:23:55,751 --> 01:24:00,400
as a threat,
then that's so you don't die.

1498
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:01,234
And it's worked really well for things 
that have been chased by bears for ever 

1499
01:24:03,641 --> 01:24:06,940
since there's been bears and,
and wavy before that.

1500
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:08,403
So,
but then there's another question that 

1501
01:24:11,951 --> 01:24:12,671
emerges.
Okay,

1502
01:24:12,671 --> 01:24:13,504
so here's the question.
So you've got all these underlying 

1503
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:17,343
motivational systems that are built into
you as a consequence of evolutionary 

1504
01:24:21,161 --> 01:24:21,994
processes.
So let's say it's your body and the 

1505
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:27,700
manifestation of your body in your,
in your brain and your mind,

1506
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:28,990
your,
it's your,

1507
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:31,600
it's your basic mammalian wiring.
And it's been.

1508
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:34,720
You'd been working on that ever since.
We've had nervous system's a very,

1509
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:37,420
very long period of time.
So that sets you up.

1510
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,960
Now you have to add complexity to that,
right?

1511
01:24:40,961 --> 01:24:41,794
Because when you're trying to.
Or because those systems only have a 

1512
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:49,120
finite time range,
so when you're angry,

1513
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:52,300
for example,
you're angry right now and in fact,

1514
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:53,134
part of the utility of angry is that 
it's right now because it's a problem 

1515
01:24:55,931 --> 01:24:56,764
solving mechanism for dealing with some 
obstacle that you can't get rid of any 

1516
01:24:59,771 --> 01:25:02,140
other way than to say to hell with the 
future,

1517
01:25:02,141 --> 01:25:04,420
roughly speaking and deal with it right 
now.

1518
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,313
Now it's dangerous obviously,
but it's also necessary because 

1519
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:08,974
otherwise you get.
Maybe you get locked into an argument 

1520
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,330
and you just stand there arguing for the
rest of your life.

1521
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:14,680
You know,
at some point you say,

1522
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:15,873
I'm not talking to you anymore,
and the anger does that makes you 

1523
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:19,930
impulsive and you can walk away,
you know,

1524
01:25:19,931 --> 01:25:22,600
and sometimes that's the right 
conclusion to an argument.

1525
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:25,120
You don't get a when you don't want to 
keep arguing.

1526
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:27,820
So why do you stop?
You get annoyed.

1527
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:28,953
It's a solution.
They got all these basic biological 

1528
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:32,284
systems.
Now obviously no one of them has that 

1529
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:36,880
answer and you know that because if it 
did,

1530
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:39,670
you wouldn't need a bunch of them and 
you have a whole bunch of them.

1531
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:40,773
You have pain and anxiety and 
exploration and play and sexuality and 

1532
01:25:44,351 --> 01:25:49,300
hunger and thirst and you know you can 
come up with probably 12 basic emotional

1533
01:25:49,301 --> 01:25:50,590
and motivational systems.

1534
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:52,593
Okay,
so you need all 12 of those in order to 

1535
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:57,610
orient yourself properly in the world,
just like you need your five senses,

1536
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:01,780
but then another problem starts to 
emerge in that problem is okay,

1537
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:05,420
those things have to be regulated 
properly,

1538
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:06,254
but they have to be regulated across 
multiple spans of time and then they 

1539
01:26:10,551 --> 01:26:11,384
have to be regulated across multiple 
different complexities of social 

1540
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:17,720
environment.
So you don't just have one system of 12.

1541
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:21,420
Now you have a very large number of 
cyst,

1542
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,370
so 12 for very long spans of time and so
then you think,

1543
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:26,204
well out of that emerges a solution.
We talked about that already with the 

1544
01:26:29,871 --> 01:26:32,210
evolution of games.
Out of that emerges a solution.

1545
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:35,150
You might think about those as higher 
order meanings.

1546
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:36,643
So when you're,
you know that and you do it and you 

1547
01:26:38,241 --> 01:26:39,920
believe it.
That's the thing.

1548
01:26:39,921 --> 01:26:40,490
That's cool.

1549
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:41,323
So here you are in university.
While you ask yourself why you might 

1550
01:26:44,571 --> 01:26:44,901
think,
well,

1551
01:26:44,901 --> 01:26:47,870
what do you have to believe in order to 
be in university?

1552
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:49,573
Well,
at some point your beliefs run out and 

1553
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:55,430
you're just here because you've made 
that decision.

1554
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,720
But I could ask you,
you know,

1555
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,613
why are you were in university and most 
people have about five reasons and then 

1556
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:02,030
they,
then they don't know what to say.

1557
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:03,523
So what,
what that means is they have reason a 

1558
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,513
and reasonably and reasons see and 
reasonably and then they're just acting 

1559
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:11,930
it out after that.
And if you keep questioning them,

1560
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,570
they get perturbed and they'll get 
annoyed.

1561
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:16,790
Sometimes they'll cry,
sometimes they'll get angry.

1562
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:18,590
Like if you're ready to go in after 
someone's like,

1563
01:27:18,591 --> 01:27:20,900
what the hell are you up to and why?
You know,

1564
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:23,870
sometimes you have to do that to 
untangle something very complex.

1565
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:28,520
At some point people just get angry or 
they cry and that means to hell with you

1566
01:27:28,521 --> 01:27:30,620
or you're bullying me,
leave me alone.

1567
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:32,240
And that's supposed to get rid of you.
You know,

1568
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,600
but it doesn't work if you really want 
to get down to the answer.

1569
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:36,493
Well,
partly what we're trying to figure out 

1570
01:27:37,701 --> 01:27:39,830
is why the hell are you in university?
You know,

1571
01:27:39,831 --> 01:27:40,551
you might say,
well,

1572
01:27:40,551 --> 01:27:42,350
to get a job,
but I might say,

1573
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:43,184
well,
why in the world would that make you 

1574
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:45,520
satisfied with life?
What?

1575
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:47,840
Why do you think that would make you 
satisfied with life?

1576
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,011
And you might say,
well,

1577
01:27:49,011 --> 01:27:50,750
it's better than not having a job.
It's like,

1578
01:27:50,751 --> 01:27:51,111
yeah,
yeah,

1579
01:27:51,111 --> 01:27:52,760
fair enough.
All right,

1580
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:56,630
let's not forget the practical,
but it isn't the solution.

1581
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:00,680
It's part of asp solution and then the 
question is,

1582
01:28:00,681 --> 01:28:04,790
do you really believe that there's a 
solution while you might ask because you

1583
01:28:04,791 --> 01:28:05,624
believe it enough so that you're here 
and then you believe that has something 

1584
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:10,820
to do with the ability to think and you 
have.

1585
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:11,713
You believe that that has something to 
do with the necessity of understanding 

1586
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:16,780
your history and you believe that it has
something to do with the,

1587
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:20,660
with the,
with the utility of exposing yourself to

1588
01:28:20,661 --> 01:28:24,260
what in principle are great rate.
Historical and literary works.

1589
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:28,670
You assume that that's all valid because
even if it's implicitly,

1590
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:29,733
if it's implicitly,
it just means you're imitating someone 

1591
01:28:31,251 --> 01:28:33,770
who assumes all that,
but either way,

1592
01:28:33,771 --> 01:28:35,240
here you are,
you're doing something.

1593
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,440
And the question is,
and maybe this is the credit,

1594
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:39,980
I think this was the critical question 
of the 20th century.

1595
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:44,870
Is there any reality to what you're 
doing or is it just arbitrary?

1596
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:47,630
If it's arbitrary,
well,

1597
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:48,943
you know that's,
that's a path denialism because who 

1598
01:28:51,351 --> 01:28:52,970
cares what you do.
You're your,

1599
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:54,223
whatever you do,
you're rude and you can make a strong 

1600
01:28:55,911 --> 01:28:56,870
case for that,
you know,

1601
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:00,080
but the problem with that seems to be 
that nihilism.

1602
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,310
Try it for awhile.
You know,

1603
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:03,323
it's what it produces is misery and 
people generally believe in misery and 

1604
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:11,670
they genuinely believed that it's not a 
good thing to have.

1605
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:14,370
And so I would say nihilism is a self 
defeating proposition.

1606
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:15,323
If you assume that misery is actually a 
source of valid information and you all 

1607
01:29:19,111 --> 01:29:20,520
do because you know if,
uh,

1608
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:21,423
if someone's jabbing you with the pen,
you're going to move your arm because 

1609
01:29:24,241 --> 01:29:26,790
you feel that if you can avoid some 
misery,

1610
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:27,833
that's a good thing.
So you have faith in your experience at 

1611
01:29:30,481 --> 01:29:32,340
that level.
Well then you might say,

1612
01:29:32,341 --> 01:29:33,810
well,
you know,

1613
01:29:33,811 --> 01:29:34,644
if you can,
if you can really make a solid case for 

1614
01:29:36,301 --> 01:29:39,570
the believability of certain kinds of 
experiences that they're real,

1615
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:40,613
why can't you make a case for their 
believability of higher forms of 

1616
01:29:42,571 --> 01:29:44,730
meaning?
Maybe they're not arbitrary,

1617
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:47,880
we don't know,
but I tell you,

1618
01:29:47,881 --> 01:29:50,070
if you act like they're arbitrary,
you get into trouble very,

1619
01:29:50,071 --> 01:29:53,730
very rapid because you either become 
nihilistic or halfway down the trip,

1620
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:54,960
denial this nihilism.

1621
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:59,310
You adopt some horrible etiology and 
then you know you're possessed by it and

1622
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,250
then you're,
well then you're,

1623
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:03,863
you're not going to live your own life 
because you'll live the life of the 

1624
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:06,864
ideology and you're going to be 
dangerous to everyone around you and 

1625
01:30:09,181 --> 01:30:12,150
also impervious to any sort of 
reasonable communication.

1626
01:30:12,151 --> 01:30:12,984
So if those are the two consequences of 
making the presumption of arbitrary 

1627
01:30:16,861 --> 01:30:17,694
meaning at a higher order level,
then to me they've invalidated 

1628
01:30:20,071 --> 01:30:22,590
themselves already.
We've already had that experiment,

1629
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,560
it didn't work.
And so then the question is,

1630
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:26,550
well,
what's next?

1631
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:27,563
Well,
that's partly what we're trying to 

1632
01:30:28,051 --> 01:30:32,730
figure out right now.
So let's take a break until 3:15.
