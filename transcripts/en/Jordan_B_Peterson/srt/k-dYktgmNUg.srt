1
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,343
Creative people are getting a really 
rough or they're not getting a break at 

2
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:46,724
all and there are probably more creative
people doing non creative work in the 

3
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:52,580
workforce than the other way around.
Oh definitely,

4
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,190
definitely,
and the thing is,

5
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,790
I don't want to paint too dismal a 
picture about being creative because one

6
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,624
of the things that pays off big for 
creative people is that they get to be 

7
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:02,481
creative,
right?

8
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:05,090
There's great aesthetic joy in that in 
depth,

9
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,313
and I've been privileged because I've 
worked with more creative people than 

10
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,320
than,
than would fall to the law,

11
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,213
let's say,
of the typical psychotherapist because 

12
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:15,284
people often come and see me because 
they've watched my videos online and 

13
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,883
they deal with people who are interested
in those subjects tend to be creative 

14
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,430
and one of the things I've really been 
struck by,

15
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,593
first of all,
I've learned that for those of you who 

16
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:31,910
are interested in such things that the 
reason human psychology works is because

17
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:33,170
it works for creative people.

18
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,120
It doesn't work at all for non creative 
people.

19
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,660
It's just false and slot for them.
They're not interested in it.

20
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:39,770
No,
it isn't how they think.

21
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,270
You mean as therapy?
Yeah,

22
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:44,150
there that it doesn't match.
It doesn't match their personalities.

23
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,560
Whereas creative people,
man,

24
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:47,330
they dream market typical dreams all the
time.

25
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,820
It's really interesting and also they 
die if they're,

26
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,310
if they're not being creative,
they wither on the vine.

27
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,130
I had one client,
I really liked him.

28
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:55,964
He was,
he was a brilliant architect and his 

29
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:02,090
rational mind was his worst enemy 
because it just criticized everything.

30
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:02,924
He was hyper rational,
criticized everything and really in a 

31
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,460
dark way and effectively,
you know,

32
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,370
is that if I could get him to not think 
and just create,

33
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,950
he was a complete genius.
He could.

34
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,530
That's where all of the vitality in his 
life was.

35
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:16,364
You know,
that's where the sap rose up inside the 

36
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:18,734
dead tree that was sort of embedded 
inside of him and it's very common with 

37
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:26,060
creative people is that it's their life 
blood and it really is from a biological

38
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:28,100
perspective.
This isn't some EPA phenomena.

39
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:28,671
It's,
it's,

40
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:30,560
it's built right into people in deeply.
