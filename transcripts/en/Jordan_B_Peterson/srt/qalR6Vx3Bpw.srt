1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,550
So this is the last lecture.
So what I thought I'd do is

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,630
I try to tell you what sense I've made 
over the course of

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,910
20 how long have I been thinking about 
this?

4
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:21,744
30 years,
30 years of thinking about the sorts of 

5
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,270
things that I've been teaching you.
I'm going to

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,603
try to integrate the things that we 
talked about over the semester and tell 

7
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,194
you what I think they add up to.
It's obviously it's very difficult to 

8
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:38,334
make them add up to to one comprehensive
thing because we talked a lot about a 

9
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:46,590
lot of different things and they weren't
necessarily

10
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,140
non contradictory,
which doesn't bother me that much,

11
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:52,974
you know,
because I like to think of theories as 

12
00:00:56,701 --> 00:01:01,701
tools rather than as final statements 
about the nature of objective reality.

13
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:05,400
And you can have tools of different 
shapes and

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,373
just because they don't all fit together
in some kind of gigantic metta tool 

15
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:16,050
doesn't mean that they're not useful 
piece by piece.

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,120
And that's a good way of thinking.
I especially,

17
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:23,010
I think about the different personality 
theories that we've discussed because as

18
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:23,844
far as I can tell,
each of them has a valuable place in 

19
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:32,310
trying to understand all the things that
happened to people.

20
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,590
Not only all the things that happen to 
people in their lives,

21
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:38,250
but really also what life is and what it
can be.

22
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,223
So,
but I'm going to tell you how I've 

23
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:44,130
integrated this.
Um,

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,553
I think the first thing that's worth 
thinking about is what is it that we're 

25
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,350
thinking about?
And I think that those are the,

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,233
you know,
two of the two words that signify this 

27
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,770
sort of greatest of philosophical 
mysteries,

28
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:02,550
right?
It's like what's the nature of being an,

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,473
and I liked the phenomenological 
approach to that because for me being 

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,513
this is,
this is the same sort of tack that 

31
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,130
Heidegger took,
is that being,

32
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,850
is what you experience at certainly your
being.

33
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,803
And that's,
that's really what your primary 

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,553
primarily unnecessarily concerned about.
And that includes the subjective and 

35
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,124
psychology has to take account of that.
It's sort of unique among the sciences 

36
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:31,884
in a sense,
is that psychology cannot ignore 

37
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:38,000
subjectivity.
Biology can ignore subjectivity and soak

38
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,470
in physics.
Well mostly,

39
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,963
but psychology stuck right in the middle
of the objective and the subjective and 

40
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:49,230
it has to take both into consideration.
And that's especially true when you also

41
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:54,231
consider that psychology is an applied 
science or art depending on how you look

42
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:58,890
at it.
And it also has to deal with issues of,

43
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,123
because it has to deal with issues of 
optimal being in suboptimal being or or 

44
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,190
suffering and health,
something like that.

45
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,840
So it has to be very comprehensive.
And roughly speaking,

46
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:11,674
I suppose you could think about being as
what is currently and becoming as how 

47
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,614
that's going to transform,
but it's more than how it's going to 

48
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:22,570
transform to because it's also how it 
should transform.

49
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,490
And it seems to me that when you're 
wrestling with the fundamental questions

50
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,324
of your life,
you have to wrestle with both of those 

51
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:33,670
propositions.
You have to figure out what it is that's

52
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,610
here and now and where you are and what 
you are.

53
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,900
And then you have to figure out what 
you're going to do about that.

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,370
And hypothetically,
at least in principle,

55
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:49,780
it seems like people are generally 
motivated to attempt to make it better.

56
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:52,510
And so then you have to figure out what 
constitutes better.

57
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:57,511
And now not also means that you are 
instantly into the domain of values.

58
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,570
And not only is there an impetus to make
it better,

59
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,180
but there's also the fact that while 
you're trying to make things better,

60
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,320
you're also fighting against entropy 
itself.

61
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,183
The tendency of complicated things to 
fall apart or complex things to fall 

62
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:18,550
apart.
And so it requires energy to make things

63
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,180
better.

64
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,810
It even requires energy just to keep 
things the way they are.

65
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,763
So in some sense life is an uphill 
battle because you're pushing against 

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,333
great forces that,
that act in opposition to your 

67
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,400
existence.
And I suppose in some sense,

68
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,760
that's the fundamental basis of 
existential thinking,

69
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,090
which is a form of thinking that I'm 
also fond of because the existentialists

70
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,290
make the claim that existence itself is 
a problem.

71
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,124
And so that means that in some sense,
psychopathology is built right into the 

72
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:54,604
nature of human existence.
And it's partly because we're limited 

73
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,470
and we suffer because of that.
And the flip side of that as well,

74
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,304
we're limited and we're working against 
forces that are in many ways greater 

75
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,340
than we are and that are pushing in the 
opposite direction.

76
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,174
So life is being and becoming and it's 
also the problem of being and becoming 

77
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,153
and that's what you're stuck with and 
it's kind of useful to know what you're 

78
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,234
stuck with I think because it stops you 
from being isolated because everybody's 

79
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,370
also stuck with that.

80
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,653
It also makes you understand that if you
have a problem that doesn't necessarily 

81
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:32,110
mean there's something wrong with you,
it's just that you're alive,

82
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,640
then that's a problem.
And you know,

83
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:36,340
of course that can get so complicated 
that it's unbearable.

84
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:39,460
But the central like,
you know,

85
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:42,250
people think in some sense are people 
are inclined to think that

86
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,230
if life was operating optimally you'd be
happy or something like that.

87
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:48,064
And I think that that's an unreasonable 
hope in some ways because it's life 

88
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:58,771
itself is so complicated because of its 
of its fundamental essence that the idea

89
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:04,520
that you can exist in some optimized 
state on a constant basis is,

90
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,620
well it's,
it's just,

91
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,000
that's just not how it is.
So you have to,

92
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,390
when you mature and when you become 
wiser,

93
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,870
you have to take into account what the 
actual limitations are and then you have

94
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:20,510
to figure out a way that you can exist.

95
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,040
Not so much despite that,
but well,

96
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:30,990
taking that into account and it seems to
me that it's possible to do that.

97
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,810
And one idea is that you can hide from 
that.

98
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,780
I think the idea of positive illusions 
is like that,

99
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:37,614
that you know,
you need to construct defenses against 

100
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:40,764
the nature of the world.
Terror management theory posits that as 

101
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:44,611
well.
You know,

102
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,710
the,
the sort of ideas that life itself is so

103
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:48,930
terrible that you have to build defenses
against it.

104
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:52,140
And some of those defenses have the 
nature of positive illusions.

105
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,310
But I don't buy that.
I think that people are tough.

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,193
They're a lot tougher than they think.
And so I think that people are capable 

107
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:01,794
of facing up to reality.
Even though reality as it's experienced 

108
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,584
is fundamentally tragic.
That's tragic because people are 

109
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:12,600
limited.
So that's sort of the domain that you're

110
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:13,080
in.

111
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,913
And I think that like if psych for 
psychology to be something that's 

112
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,640
profound,
I can't skirt those issues,

113
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:24,390
it has to address them directly.
And that's difficult because they're not

114
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,560
merely objective problems,
they're also subjective problems.

115
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,890
And it isn't all that obvious how 
science can deal with,

116
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,443
with subjective problems.
But we're not dealing with science in 

117
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:37,944
psychology.
We're dealing with human being in the 

118
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,163
phenomenal logical sense.
And so at least that's how it looks to 

119
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,984
me.
And so

120
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,203
I've found the sorts of things that I've
taught you extremely useful in 

121
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:52,284
addressing some of these partially 
addressing at least some of these 

122
00:07:55,591 --> 00:08:00,591
fundamental problems.
So here's a couple of ways of looking at

123
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,580
domains of knowledge in relationship to 
those problems.

124
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:05,414
So the problem of being and becoming is 
also the problem of what is and what 

125
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,460
should be.
And Science,

126
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,323
it seems to me concentrates primarily on
a subset of what is unknown because 

127
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:18,020
it's,
it's concerned with the structure of the

128
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:22,850
world as it presents itself,
but not to subjectivity precisely but to

129
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:26,710
the collective mind.
And so the rule with sciences,

130
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,140
well if more than one person can detect 
it at the same time,

131
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,140
then it might actually be real.
Or at least it's real scientifically.

132
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,540
And that's a pretty,
that's a pretty useful tool.

133
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,374
And I think it's partly useful because 
it helps us differentiate our knowledge 

134
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,920
in a way that makes it more and more 
practically useful.

135
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,173
We need to know the difference between 
what we can both experience and what 

136
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:52,250
only you can experience and what only I 
can experience.

137
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,413
And and by,
by continually continually clarifying 

138
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:57,264
that what's happened is we've built a 
much better and much more delineated 

139
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,720
understanding of the ground,
of our shared experience.

140
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,850
And that's also allowed us to develop 
all sorts of tools and technologies that

141
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:13,080
have also that we've also chosen in most
cases to put,

142
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:17,100
to work increasing our general quality 
of life and wellbeing.

143
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,203
So,
so the science end of things has worked 

144
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,104
pretty well.
It's become hyper developed over the 

145
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,110
last 500 years and knots.

146
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,460
That's good thing.
But it's left some things in the lurch,

147
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:30,294
I believe,
and no one we talked about when we 

148
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,400
talked about Nietzsche,
Nietzsche,

149
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:35,234
and his idea of the death of God.
We talked about one of the consequences 

150
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:42,660
of the rise of this,
of science has knowledge.

151
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:43,494
And because science can say that the 
reality it deals with is the shared ix 

152
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,943
is the reality of shared experience.
But it also tends to go farther than 

153
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,191
that.
And it's,

154
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:56,100
and to say that there is no other real 
reality,

155
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,970
but what shared experience presents to 
us,

156
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,240
and that's where things get troublesome.
Because first of all,

157
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,870
from from a subjective perspective,
that just doesn't seem to be true.

158
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,330
I mean,
you can't,

159
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,433
it isn't obvious how you can understand 
the relationship between the fact that 

160
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:19,440
you have your subjective experience and,
and,

161
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,480
and the fact of the objective world.

162
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,313
We don't know how to put those two 
things together and merely ignoring the 

163
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,810
subjective while that that causes 
problems.

164
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:28,644
Because of course,
that's what you're primarily stuck with 

165
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,170
and it's the primary problem.
You know,

166
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,043
how do you deal with your isolated 
individual existence and what do you 

167
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:41,730
make of it?
And Science in some senses,

168
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,950
it can't answer those questions,
but it shouldn't.

169
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,533
That shouldn't necessarily lead us to 
the conclusion that such and such 

170
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:55,380
questions shouldn't be posed or that 
they don't have to be answered.

171
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,923
I they do have to be answered because 
they're still part of the domain of 

172
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:00,444
problems that beset human beings.
So it seems to me that for a 

173
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:09,030
comprehensive picture of experience or 
of being,

174
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:14,031
you have to use two domains of analysis 
and one is the scientific domain and the

175
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,474
other is fundamentally the moral domain.
And the moral domain for me isn't I not 

176
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:21,084
really saying precisely that the moral 
domain is the difference between right 

177
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:25,710
and wrong.

178
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,543
Although I think that that's part of it.
The moral domain is actually a broader 

179
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,350
domain of questions,
which is,

180
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,300
well,
how should yakked?

181
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,760
Because knowing what is is from a 
scientific perspective does not give you

182
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:42,720
a clear understanding of how you should 
progress through life.

183
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,554
And because we're embodied creatures and
because we move and because we're 

184
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:51,090
capable of transforming the world,
both with our consciousness and our,

185
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,490
like with our consciousness and our 
communication and our actions,

186
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,090
there's no escaping the problem of how 
you should act.

187
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,283
And then it's an even more complicated 
problem because it's not only how you 

188
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,330
should act because of your limitations 
and your skills,

189
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,164
but how you should,
you should act given that there's all 

190
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:08,104
these other creatures wandering around 
that are asking the same questions and 

191
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:14,290
trying to act just like you are.
So other human beings.

192
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,050
And then of course the fact of the,
the world,

193
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,140
the nonhuman,
the living nonhuman world as well,

194
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:22,210
which is something that you have to have
a relationship with.

195
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:23,044
And you can't just ignore those 
questions because they don't because 

196
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:31,000
they're not easily answered by the 
mechanisms of empirical science.

197
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,430
It leaves people bereft.
And when,

198
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,520
when Nisha talked about the death of 
God,

199
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,354
I mean what he meant in some sense was 
that the claims of science are 

200
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:45,001
sufficiently radical so that it's easy 
to take them to mean that the um,

201
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,623
the sort of landscape of stories that 
constitute our archaic cultures are 

202
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,190
invalid.
Now

203
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,683
it's a complicated problem because it 
isn't at all clear to me that the 

204
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:02,254
landscape of stories that make up our 
cultural past are in fact scientific 

205
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,340
descriptions and I don't think they ever
were,

206
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,213
were.
And the fact that the manner in which 

207
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:12,304
they described the world seems to 
contradict what we understand safe from 

208
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:16,354
cosmology.
To me it's basically irrelevant because 

209
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,740
they're not dealing with the same 
problem but,

210
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,120
but you can see how it would,
it has be been easy for people to become

211
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:29,560
philosophically confused because it's 
not self evident that you meet need more

212
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:33,640
than one kind of truth to live.
It's not even self evident that there is

213
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:36,070
more than one kind of truth,
you know?

214
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,300
But why we assumed that there would only
be one kind of truth is a mystery in and

215
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:41,050
of itself.
It's,

216
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,110
it seems to me that it's related somehow
to,

217
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,410
to the push in humanity for a form of 
monotheism in or total a totality of one

218
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,184
theory governs all.
Well maybe that's true in some ultimate 

219
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,624
sense,
but it certainly isn't the case that 

220
00:13:56,951 --> 00:14:00,160
we're at that point yet.
So we might say,

221
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:00,994
well,
maybe we need all the kinds of truth we 

222
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:06,100
can get our hands on and all the tools 
that we have in order to live properly.

223
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:10,660
And we can sort out the fact that some 
of them seem to coexist paradoxically.

224
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,823
Well we can just live with that for now 
and accepted as a necessity that might 

225
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,150
become,
you know,

226
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:19,090
the reason for which might become more 
clear across time.

227
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,793
So,

228
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,900
so it seems to me that for psychology to
be a psychologist,

229
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,640
you have to take both of these domains 
very seriously.

230
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:36,230
You have to learn everything you can 
about what science has to tell you about

231
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,780
what it is that you're like and what the
world is like.

232
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:39,614
And then you have to learn everything 
you can about what history and culture 

233
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,880
and,
and also shared the shared communication

234
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:51,881
between people tells us about what the 
appropriate ways are to ourselves and to

235
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:53,864
what ends we should be working.
And those are all valid questions and 

236
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:58,850
they,
and if you ignore any of them,

237
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,930
you ignore them at your peril because 
you have to know them in order to,

238
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,423
in order to minimize the degree to which
you're going to suffer unnecessarily or 

239
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:09,740
that other people are going to suffer 
unnecessarily.

240
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,480
So it's not optional.

241
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,150
You see that this is sort of dichotomous
truth.

242
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,313
The problem of this dichotomous truth 
shows up in all sorts of binary 

243
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,350
oppositions in terms of forms of 
knowledge.

244
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,370
You know,
so there's the,

245
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,013
well there's the objective reality,
which no one reading lives in because 

246
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:31,910
it's a third person perspective,
right?

247
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,013
So it's a hypothetical kind of reality,
but conceptualizing it seems to be very 

248
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:37,064
useful.
And then there's the phenomenological 

249
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:38,804
perspective,
which is your experience is actually 

250
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:44,240
reality and that's what counts.
And those two things aren't the same.

251
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,690
And that's sort of like the difference 
between objective and subjective.

252
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:48,524
And it's sort of like the difference 
between scientific and moral and it's 

253
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:54,560
sort of like the difference between 
materialistic and mythological.

254
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,873
And so those are all dichotomies are 
paradoxical juxtapositions of forms of 

255
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,480
conception that seemed to be hitting at 
the,

256
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,960
this paradoxical relationship between 
being and becoming.

257
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,880
So we considered both sides of these 
paradoxical,

258
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,393
uh,
conceptual schemes as we walked through 

259
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:14,684
the class material.
I read you this at the beginning of the 

260
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,160
class.
This is from Einstein.

261
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,230
He's trying to clarify what it is that 
we're doing.

262
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:26,120
When we practice science and Einstein 
said by the aid of language,

263
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:29,960
different individuals can to some extent
compare their experiences.

264
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,933
Then it turns out that certain sense 
perceptions of different individuals 

265
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:37,250
correspond to each other.
Well for other sense perceptions,

266
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:39,680
no such correspondence can be 
established.

267
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,850
We are accustomed to regard as real 
those sense perceptions which are common

268
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:48,140
to different individuals and which 
therefore are in a measure impersonal.

269
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,610
The natural sciences and in particular 
the most fundamental of them.

270
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,490
Physics deals with such sense 
perceptions.

271
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,380
It's not a,
it's,

272
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,560
it's Einstein and obviously Einstein was
a great thinker.

273
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,753
There are,
there are things missing about this 

274
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,000
description of what constitutes science.

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,833
Because the other thing that constitutes
science is a description of the 

276
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:12,050
procedures that led to the emergence of 
the sentence perception,

277
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,943
right?
You think about how a scientific paper 

278
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,940
is written,
it's not only results,

279
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,643
it's method and results.
And the method is how I constituted my 

280
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:26,780
body and time and space to produce these
particular sense perceptions.

281
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,943
And so it's,
it's a way of formalizing behavior and 

282
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:32,024
then pairing it with the consequences of
behavior and then communicating in a 

283
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,804
way,
in a way that someone else could 

284
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:37,244
hypothetically duplicate that.
So Einstein's pure focus on sense 

285
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:45,920
perception is not,
it's not complete.

286
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,490
You can't forget about the 
systematization of procedures in science

287
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:53,190
and it's easy to forget that.
But apart from that it's,

288
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,720
you know,
it's a pretty good summary.

289
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,303
And then Shakespeare,
he takes another tack at the whole 

290
00:17:58,801 --> 00:17:59,634
problem.
And this is where the rubber hits the 

291
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:02,484
road as far as I'm concerned,
in terms of how you constitute your 

292
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,440
individual,
your individual being.

293
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,950
And Shakespeare says,
and it's not a metaphor in many ways,

294
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:14,640
this all the world's a stage.
And all the men and women,

295
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:15,474
merely players,
they have their exits and their 

296
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:21,000
entrances and one man in his time plays 
many parts.

297
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,890
And so from,
from the Shakespearian pers perspective,

298
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,210
you're,
you're being is more like a play than it

299
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:31,620
is like,
uh,

300
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,650
like a collection of objective 
phenomena.

301
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,730
And then what happens is the play 
itself,

302
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:39,564
like a shakespearian play becomes a more
accurate representation of being than a 

303
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:48,370
scientific description does.
And it's because it plays out it because

304
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,253
it's because it accounts for behavior 
and because it plays out the 

305
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:56,010
consequences of behavior from the 
subjective perspective.

306
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:56,844
Because a good play elicits the sort of 
passions and emotions and motivations 

307
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:04,680
that are subjectively experienced that 
actually character your eyes,

308
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:09,681
your life as you live it.
So what that means is the play a novel,

309
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:13,890
a book,
a story is an abstract representation of

310
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:14,724
reality that's subject to just as much 
rigor in terms of conception as a 

311
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:24,540
scientific description of a given thing.
And it's also real,

312
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,110
well,
it depends on what you mean by real,

313
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,003
right?
Because we already found out what the 

314
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:33,930
scientists think of as real.
But there's lots of arguments about that

315
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:35,040
because I might say,
well

316
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,493
you,

317
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,230
I would judge what you consider real by 
watching how you behave,

318
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,560
not by listening to what you say about 
the structure of the world.

319
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,530
And that's an existential perspective as
well.

320
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,663
And so then I would note that dis,
regardless of what all of you might say 

321
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:57,210
about what you believe about the nature 
of reality,

322
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,890
it's certainly the case that you're 
going to act as if your own perceptions,

323
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:05,520
you're your own subjectivity is real.
So for example,

324
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:06,354
if something hurts you,
you can think all you want about how 

325
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:10,104
pain is not objective,
but that's not going to get you out of 

326
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:17,160
the painful situation and you're still 
going to configure your behavior so that

327
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,323
you're going to do everything you can 
even in voluntarily so that you will 

328
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,553
work to avoid that pain.
And so you're stuck with acting as if 

329
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,770
your subjectivity is real.
And that happens.

330
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,520
That happens at such a deep level that 
it supersedes your consciousness,

331
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,900
right?
Like if you,

332
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,913
if you put your arm on a burning stove,
you're going to take your arm away from 

333
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:38,994
that before you even think about it.
So the reality of reality in some sense 

334
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:44,274
of your subjectivity is so deep that you
don't even necessarily have a choice 

335
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:48,340
about it.
So

336
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,913
yeah.

337
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,243
So one of the things that I've,
I've wondered for a long time is what 

338
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:58,660
happens if you take this sort of idea 
seriously?

339
00:20:58,661 --> 00:20:59,494
You know that,
that you need the knowledge that is 

340
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,804
constituted in stories because it tells 
you how to behave and because you need 

341
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:10,114
to know how to behave,
because that's actually one of the 

342
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:12,484
fundamental problems of life.
It might even be the most fundamental 

343
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,580
problem of life if you know from a 
scientific perspective,

344
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:21,760
the most fundamental problem is what are
things made of?

345
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,070
It's something like that.
How do they interrelate?

346
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,323
But just because that's a very well 
stated problem and just because we've 

347
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:30,694
been able to produce profound in 
differentiated answers to it does not 

348
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:37,690
necessarily mean that that is the 
problem that almost everyone faces.

349
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:40,420
And it seems to me it's especially the 
case with people.

350
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,530
At your age,
it's like,

351
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,570
well,
what am I going to do?

352
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,590
Seems to me to be the fundamental 
problem and soul.

353
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,330
And if the answer to that is,
well,

354
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:50,164
there's no real guidance for that.
It's just something you have to figure 

355
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:54,700
out for yourself.
Then you know,

356
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:55,534
that's the sort of thing that makes you 
question the utility of knowledge per 

357
00:21:58,631 --> 00:21:59,464
se.
And I think it's a weak answer and I 

358
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,790
also think it's a wrong answer.
There's lots of,

359
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,470
there are lots of,
there are,

360
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,333
there is no shortage of information 
about how to behave and there's no 

361
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:10,324
shortage of information about what 
happens if you break the rules of 

362
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:15,604
behavior.
Now there's arguments about what those 

363
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:18,424
rules are and there's no,
it's no doubt that they differ 

364
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:21,394
contextually,
but just something can differ at one 

365
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:26,590
level of analysis and be the same at 
another.

366
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:28,120
Languages are like that,
right?

367
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,470
I mean we all speak a language.
The languages are different,

368
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,513
but they're all languages,
which means they differ at one level of 

369
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:37,660
analysis and there are common had 
another.

370
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,823
And how it act is like that too.
And I think piaget is particularly 

371
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:42,604
useful for thinking about that because 
piaget is the thinker who I think has 

372
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:48,334
done the most work and trying to 
understand how it is that there might 

373
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:53,194
be,

374
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,060
yeah.

375
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,670
A basis for what constitutes morality,
you know,

376
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,500
and Piaget starts with,
with the shakespearian conception,

377
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:05,490
fundamentally he believes that how to 
act is the problem.

378
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,383
And you know,
we're embodied creatures and we're very 

379
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:09,930
mobile and we're very good at 
manipulating the world.

380
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,033
We're very good at communicating.
And so any psychology that doesn't take 

381
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:17,850
into account the nature of our 
embodiment is a very weak psychology.

382
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,980
And Piaget basically says,
well look,

383
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,814
you know,
you come into the world with some 

384
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,780
potential for auction.
It's kind of minimal,

385
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:26,970
but it's enough to get you going,
right?

386
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,010
It's enough to kick start you in a 
sense.

387
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:33,480
And then as you organize your body and 
you're doing this neurologically sort of

388
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:35,520
from the spine up,
as we discussed,

389
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,270
the,
the manner in which you organize your,

390
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,193
your capability for action and 
perception is continually modified by 

391
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:45,090
your social interaction with other.

392
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,970
So,
so it's,

393
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,313
so you're,
you're socialized being is built right 

394
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:51,980
into your motor circuitry.
It's,

395
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,320
it's a pattern.
It's not even a conception.

396
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:56,510
It's a pattern.
So for example,

397
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,003
when you're breastfeeding,
you have to do it in a manner that 

398
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,680
allows your mother to tolerate you.
And so something,

399
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:07,700
even something as simple as,
as the first ways that you use your lips

400
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:08,534
and your mouth and,
and the way that you express your 

401
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:11,984
emotions is,
is immediately going to be modified by 

402
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,454
the necessity of social interaction and 
social interaction can't just proceed 

403
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:22,640
any old way,
right?

404
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:27,641
So if we have a relationship and it 
becomes seriously nonreciprocal,

405
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,400
you're a fool.
If it's nonreciprocal in your direction,

406
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,860
you're a fool to stay with it.
You know,

407
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:38,830
there's something that's roughly like 
the expectation of 50 50 and that's well

408
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,620
that's well established empirically 
with,

409
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:42,454
with experiments that wouldn't,
you wouldn't expect to turn out that 

410
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:47,360
way.
So those are the trading experiments.

411
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,010
And I told you about them,
I think,

412
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:51,560
if I remember correctly.
So the deal is we'll play,

413
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:54,440
the three of us will play.
So I'm going to,

414
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,260
I have $100 and you can have as much of 
it as you want,

415
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,190
but you have to give him some and he has
to accept your offer.

416
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,980
So I've got a hundred how much are you 
going to give him?

417
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,360
30 would you take that?
Okay.

418
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,350
Okay.
Now,

419
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:13,190
so,
so what,

420
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,033
what's been found everywhere is that 
people roughly center around 50 50 and 

421
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:24,980
so even if the amounts are quite high,
and even if the people to whom the money

422
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:28,370
is being offered are very poor,
in fact,

423
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:31,640
the poor the people are to whom the 
money is being offered,

424
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,330
the more likely they are to tell you to 
go to hell if you're not being fair.

425
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,270
And so that's and that,
and they see and that's built in and you

426
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,700
think about that,
like it doesn't take much more than that

427
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,090
for morality as,
as a system to get going.

428
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,630
So if the rough expectation is 
reciprocity,

429
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:48,464
where that's possible,
then deviations from that reciprocity 

430
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:53,114
are going to be punished very harshly.
And so right there you have the grounds 

431
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:01,160
for the emergence of a complex system of
human interactions.

432
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,520
That's by no means arbitrary.
Now it might be,

433
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,043
you know,
altered to some degree by the 

434
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,030
particularities of the local 
environment.

435
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,133
There's no doubt about that.
But something can have a fundamental 

436
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:18,920
pattern and still be capable of,
you know,

437
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:21,960
a large number of variants.
So,

438
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,083
so what that essentially means,
and this is exactly what piaget 

439
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:29,330
observed,
is that when you put people together,

440
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,960
which you do because people can't live 
by themselves,

441
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:36,020
were highly social creatures.
We have a long period of dependence,

442
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,650
we have to make our way and you know,
the nuclear family unit,

443
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:40,484
whatever it happens to be,
then we have to adjust to the broader 

444
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,003
group.
We have to be acceptable to the broader 

445
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:46,584
group.
And then we have to learn to maintain 

446
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:51,270
the broader group and to contributed,
contribute to it.

447
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,583
Because if we don't,
the quality of our experience will 

448
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,520
suffer dramatically.

449
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,653
So you ended up outcast or punished or 
frustrated or disappointed or alone or 

450
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:02,484
all the things that happen if you don't 
at least uphold a fair bit of your 

451
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:09,144
social responsibility.
And so what that means right away is 

452
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:12,804
that the patterns that constitute 
appropriate behavior are not just 

453
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,280
arbitrary.
Now what exactly they are.

454
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:21,660
Well that's complicated.
You know,

455
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:26,661
it's just as complicated as Jane Goodall
going out into the habitat of the chimps

456
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:28,614
and watching them and trying to figure 
out just exactly what those chimps are 

457
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:33,900
up to and we kind of know what they're 
up to.

458
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,123
They organize themselves and dominance 
hierarchies because almost every animal 

459
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:38,844
does that.
And then along with that go certain 

460
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:41,574
kinds of rules of interaction.
Except they're not rules because chimps 

461
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:48,660
don't have rules because chimps don't 
have abstract conception.

462
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,930
What they have is rituals of behavior 
and shared expectations.

463
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,340
But that's the beginning of rules,
right?

464
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,173
It's like Piaget says,
well to put children together when 

465
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,120
there's seven or eight and they play 
marbles,

466
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,640
they can all play.
But if you take them away from the group

467
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:08,850
and you ask them what the rules are,
they really don't know.

468
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,840
And all that means is they can dance and
they can dance with other kids,

469
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,853
but they can't tell you how to dance.
But that doesn't mean they don't know 

470
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:19,590
how to do it.
And like we're all like that,

471
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:21,240
right?
Because we're living in these very,

472
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,074
very complex hierarchical environments 
where we inhabit multiple hierarchies 

473
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,313
and they're very,
very complicated and row is wandering 

474
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:31,404
around trying to figure out,
well what the hell is it that we're up 

475
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:34,434
to?
And we don't exactly know which is why 

476
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:36,654
we need the psychology.
But just because we don't know what 

477
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:40,680
we're up to doesn't mean we're not up to
something.

478
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,900
And it also doesn't mean that there 
isn't something that we should be up to.

479
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,183
And I think the social interaction list 
idea is even deeper than that because 

480
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,960
almost all the time when you're 
interacting with people,

481
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,640
they're broadcasting their desire for 
you to be some sort of person,

482
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,133
right?
And it might be kind of like the person 

483
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:03,024
you are,
but their expectations are higher than 

484
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:05,994
that because they would rather in all,
especially when they're seriously 

485
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:09,924
involved with you,
they would rather that you were a good 

486
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:15,450
sort of person.
And that's what they demand from you.

487
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:19,110
They want you to listen to them.
They want you to treat them properly.

488
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,200
They want you to engage in reciprocal 
trade.

489
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,340
They,
you know,

490
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,173
they want you to take care of yourself.
I'm assuming they're not all resentful 

491
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:28,500
and full of hate and all that,
you know,

492
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:32,040
they're not just saying,
be yourself there saying no,

493
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:32,874
no,
no.

494
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,710
Be what everyone needs.
And that's what everyone is broadcasting

495
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:41,070
to everyone else all the time is like,
be what I need be.

496
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,690
I need be what I need,
be what they need.

497
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,520
And so you're,
you're,

498
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:46,354
you're,
you're always being told the message 

499
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:48,394
from people,
even if they're just raising their 

500
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:50,194
eyebrows at you are smiling or not 
smiling or calling you on the phone or 

501
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:58,420
texting you or not doing that.
You're just being informed about who you

502
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,254
should be all the time.
And there's no reason to assume that's 

503
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:02,974
arbitrary either.
Given that we share a common biological 

504
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,490
ground and we have the same emotions,
roughly speaking,

505
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,700
and we have the same motivations,
roughly speaking.

506
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,060
So given that pattern that you know,
ground of commonality and expectation,

507
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,260
well why should we assume anything other
than a pattern,

508
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,620
a pattern,
emergence of agreement out of that.

509
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,233
So,

510
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,520
so the moral relativists theory assumes 
that morality is relative.

511
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,683
And I think that's a naive theory.
It seems to me that it's relative and 

512
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:40,854
non relative,
which means there are elements of it 

513
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:46,890
that are fixed and necessarily so.
And then there are other things that can

514
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:48,180
vary without,
you know,

515
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,880
without a problem as long as people 
agreed to it.

516
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:55,860
But I think that societies,
and this is also a Piagetian notion,

517
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:56,963
that societies that violate the 
principle of reciprocity are not very 

518
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:05,040
stable because no one's pleased by those
circumstances.

519
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:08,400
Some people are slaves and some people 
are tyrants and you know,

520
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:10,530
that'll work for a while,
but it's unstable.

521
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,780
And even within a family,
it's the same thing.

522
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:14,780
If your father is a complete bloody 
tyrant,

523
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,780
what you're going to do is either be 
crushed and useless or get the hell away

524
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:20,190
from there as fast as you can.

525
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,400
It's not a stable solution.
So,

526
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,730
and you know,
nonreciprocal relations at any level of,

527
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,060
of interaction are not,
they're not tenable.

528
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:32,160
And they also,
they shouldn't be tenable,

529
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,760
you know,
so when you see people in psychotherapy,

530
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,540
especially if they tend to be on the 
agreeable side,

531
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,853
one of the things that you teach them is
how to speak more about their own needs 

532
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:47,094
so to speak,
or that or their own desires of their 

533
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:49,344
own values so that the probability that 
they'll engage in a prop in a truly 

534
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,650
reciprocal relationship starts to 
increase.

535
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,780
They won't be taken advantage of so 
much.

536
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,093
And that seems to be a necessary 
precondition for their satisfactory 

537
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:03,714
embeddedness in a social context,
satisfactory being something that you 

538
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:10,950
are doing and that you can maintain and 
are willing to maintain.

539
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:11,784
Right.
Because a real relationship is a game 

540
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:14,574
you play over and over and over and over
and you're not going to want to play 

541
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:18,384
with someone who doesn't play fair.
So even little kids know that and they 

542
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:24,790
know it deeply.
So the,

543
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,630
the moral relativism theory is a foolish
and,

544
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:28,610
and it's,
it's,

545
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:32,280
it's,
it's foolish and ill researched.

546
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,673
Yeah.

547
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,933
At the bottom of the being and becoming 
question is something else and this is 

548
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:41,804
something that they existential 
philosophers and the young Ian's and 

549
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:48,920
most religious systems concentrate on,
which is sort of what,

550
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:51,940
what's the core nature of being and 
when,

551
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,783
when,
when systems have that sort of 

552
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:55,034
discussing the coordinator of being one 
of the immediate objects of 

553
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:02,510
contemplation is the fact that human 
beings are limited,

554
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,970
right?
There's lots of things we can't do.

555
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,520
For example,
you're there and you're not there.

556
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,743
You know,
you're then that's thrown this from a 

557
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:12,110
fund.
From a phenomenological perspective,

558
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,470
you're just stuck with what you are,
you know,

559
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:16,490
we are a certain height,
you have certain eye color,

560
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:19,040
your certain amount of attractive or or 
not,

561
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,260
you know,
you're verbally fluent,

562
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:23,660
you're smart or you're not,
or you're conscientious like,

563
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,703
and it's just sort of those are the 
cards that you've been dealt and really 

564
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:29,570
is worth thinking about it that way.

565
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:34,460
Because who you are in some sense is a 
consequence of a lot of processes,

566
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,443
genetic processes that are in some ways 
random and you've been dealt in 

567
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:40,520
particular hand and then you have to 
play it.

568
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,833
And that hand has limitations.
And so people in some sense are there 

569
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,860
offered opportunities by the nature of,
of their,

570
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,950
of,
of how they're constituted.

571
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:54,380
But there's also a tragic element to 
that,

572
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,780
which is well,
as you move in life,

573
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:59,900
you bump up against limitations that you
cannot transcend.

574
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,200
You know,
and those are the typical limitations.

575
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,140
You bumped up against the demands of the
social group,

576
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:06,974
which has a tyrannical element.
You bump up against nature itself 

577
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:14,150
because you're susceptible to illness 
and to degeneration and to,

578
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,910
and eventually to death.
And so are the people around you.

579
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:17,744
And so there's this,
there's this issue at the bottom of 

580
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:22,760
being that also presents you with a 
problem.

581
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,623
So life is problematic.
You're trying to solve it and that's 

582
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:27,254
what you're stuck with.
So that's sort of the parameters of 

583
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,774
being.
And so I think in in most mythological 

584
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:35,720
language,
I like to think of mythology,

585
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,673
philosophy and then mythology as like 
forms of conceptualization that are 

586
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,640
examining the grammatical structure of 
being.

587
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,600
It's like what's common among sets of 
people,

588
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:51,171
what,
what,

589
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:54,200
what's common to the experience of sets 
of people.

590
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,190
And the fact that you are is one of 
them.

591
00:34:58,191 --> 00:35:02,090
And the fact that the fact that you are 
has problems is another.

592
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,103
And then a third one is while you're 
motivated at least to some degree to do 

593
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,770
something about those things.
And so that's what makes people human.

594
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:12,920
And in many regards it's something 
fundamental that makes them human.

595
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,110
So you can think about that as tragic 
self consciousness.

596
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,600
It's self conscious because you know who
you are and it's tragic because you also

597
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:23,510
know where your limitations are and 
their fundamental.

598
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,180
And that also sets up another set of 
motivations,

599
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:27,170
which is,
well,

600
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:30,170
is there something we can do about this?
Can we limit our vulnerability?

601
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,004
Can we extend our scope of power?
And how do we do that without causing 

602
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:35,504
more trouble than we're solving?
So with that kind of common problem at 

603
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:42,354
the basis of our being,
that's also what enables us to 

604
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:44,634
communicate because we understand each 
other because we're in the same states 

605
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:48,534
of being.
So you can talk to someone about your 

606
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:50,994
problems without having to explain what 
problems are because you can't 

607
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:56,334
communicate with people unless there's 
some things you don't have to 

608
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:00,930
communicate about.
It need a shared set of assumptions.

609
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,090
And one of them is,
for example,

610
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:06,570
that you have problems and now is that 
maybe you're looking for solutions.

611
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,840
Another is that may be communication 
about that is helpful.

612
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,883
You know,
none of those things have to be 

613
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:15,330
established before you start 
communicating because everyone's already

614
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:16,164
got that.

615
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,560
Those presuppositions built right into 
their understanding.

616
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,223
So I've modeled this,
you've seen this lots of times now and 

617
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:24,744
I've sort of modeled this like this and 
this is a cybernetic model in many ways 

618
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,573
and it's based,
although I didn't know it when I 

619
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:31,914
developed it,
I was based on the thinking of Norbert 

620
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,093
Wiener who was an artificial 
intelligence genius and it basically 

621
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:43,260
presumes that it's a modified version.
It presumes that wherever you are,

622
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:45,210
you have some conception of where you 
are.

623
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,520
That's your current understanding of the
world.

624
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,593
It's flawed.
Just because you're here doesn't mean 

625
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:53,460
you understand everything about being 
here.

626
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,370
Hopefully because you have low 
resolution conceptions,

627
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,500
you don't know anything about the people
around you.

628
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,200
As long as they sit down and shut up and
act normally,

629
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:04,050
that's no problem because you can easily
ignore them,

630
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,213
but they're full of weird potential and 
God only knows when that's going to 

631
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:08,670
emerge from one of them.

632
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,500
But,
so I'm saying,

633
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:11,334
you know where you are,
you have a model of what you are but 

634
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:14,424
it's shallow and potentially flawed.
And part of the reason that you can get 

635
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,560
away with that is because there's all 
this,

636
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:20,394
there's this implicit agreement among 
all of us not to do anything that 

637
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:26,334
violates general social expectation.
And so that's partly how you can get 

638
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:32,190
away with the fact that you don't know 
anything about anyone.

639
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,480
It's like,
yeah,

640
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:34,314
there peculiar like rhinoceroses and 
ostriches and God only knows what 

641
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:38,274
they're up to,
but hopefully they're socialized enough 

642
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:45,540
so they don't show you how peculiar they
are when you're walking past them on the

643
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,980
street in Po,
in public.

644
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,620
And so you can get away with your 
shallow knowledge.

645
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,903
So,
and then you have some sense of where 

646
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:56,940
you're going and you know,
maybe that's vague part of it.

647
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,390
It's going to be there whether you have 
thought it through or not.

648
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,540
And the reason for that is,
as we've discussed,

649
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,530
the biologists are pretty good at 
informing us on this part is that,

650
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,650
you know,
at the base of your cognitive,

651
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:12,210
emotional,
motivational,

652
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,044
perceptual structure that gives rise to 
your being are the systems that are 

653
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:21,900
going to push you in some direction as a
motivation systems or emotion system.

654
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:22,734
So if you don't drink water long enough,
pretty much that's all you're going to 

655
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:29,250
be able to think about and value.
And not only that,

656
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,323
see the world through.
Cause when you see the world as a 

657
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:35,500
thirsty person,
you're not seeing the world the same way

658
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:39,880
that someone who has had plenty to drink
sees it.

659
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,280
So,
and also you have this,

660
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,413
this space that defines where you are 
and this conception about where you're 

661
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:49,180
going and you think where you're going 
is better.

662
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,193
And you have a theory about how you're 
going to transform the present into the 

663
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:55,840
more desirable future.

664
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,980
But you can make an error at any level 
of that conceptualization.

665
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,890
And that sort of a modification of 
Jeffrey Gray's theory,

666
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:03,724
the cybernetic theorist,
because what they believed was that you 

667
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:11,650
see the world,
you expect certain things to happen when

668
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:16,180
you act and now and then when you act,
that expectation has violated.

669
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,553
And so then you have to reconfigure your
behavior or your conception of the 

670
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:20,674
future.
But that's not quite right because you 

671
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:24,670
don't see the world,
right?

672
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,360
You perceive the world through a fog of,
of preconceptions and in a manner that's

673
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,603
um,
impaired because of your tremendous 

674
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:35,914
cognitive limitations.
And what that means is that when you're 

675
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:43,690
wrong,
you can be wrong anywhere in that model.

676
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,570
You can be wrong because you don't know 
where you are.

677
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:50,410
You can be wrong because you picked the 
wrong behaviors to manifest.

678
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,543
Or you can be wrong because your 
conception of where you're going is 

679
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:57,460
flawed in that you're not going to be 
happy when you get there.

680
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,293
Or maybe it doesn't even exist.
And I think you see this most painfully 

681
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,370
when you're in a relationship and you're
be trade.

682
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,510
Because if you're in a relationship and 
you're betrayed by someone,

683
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,270
then it's pretty damn clear that you 
didn't know where you were.

684
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,343
Now it's also then clear.
You don't know where you're going and 

685
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,160
also that you probably don't know what 
you're doing.

686
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:18,994
So that's very painful.
But it's in human relationships in 

687
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:22,414
particular.
I think that you find out how fragile 

688
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:29,260
your conceptions of the present actually
are and that you're not dealing with the

689
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,094
world.
You're dealing with a very 

690
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,250
oversimplified and presupposition based 
conception of the world.

691
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,070
You know?
Cause maybe you think your partner loves

692
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:43,450
you and is trustworthy and maybe you 
think all people are trustworthy,

693
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,333
you know,
because you're naive and then you find 

694
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:46,204
out,
well if that's love you don't want any 

695
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:51,040
of it and they're not trustworthy.

696
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,560
And then then what the hell?
It's like,

697
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,940
well you don't know where you are.
You don't know where you're going.

698
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,950
You probably don't know who you are 
anymore.

699
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,410
You certainly don't know who the hell 
that person is.

700
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,230
And because you don't know who they are 
or you are,

701
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,400
then maybe you don't know who anyone is.
And that puts you in a place too.

702
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,080
And so one of the things that I've 
thought for a substantial amount of time

703
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:17,140
is that you can think about that.
I'll go back like this.

704
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,590
When you're thinking about the structure
of the world,

705
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:24,190
and one element of the structure is that
there's the place.

706
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,900
Those are two serpents,
by the way,

707
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:28,090
I just found out about that recently 
too.

708
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:30,460
Snakes,
very common mythological motif.

709
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,650
They represent.
This is Dow,

710
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:34,420
right from the Taoists,
from from,

711
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,130
from Taoism,
and from the Dow is thinkers.

712
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,840
And Dow basically means something like 
being or something like the way,

713
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,980
which is like the path of life and it's 
more a phenomenological than scientific.

714
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,840
What it's basically saying is that your 
experience is composed of two domains,

715
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:55,370
always necessarily.
One domain is the orderly domain and the

716
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:58,550
orderly domain is the place where when 
you act,

717
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:00,290
what you expect,
habits or,

718
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:04,370
or more precisely.
It's the place where when you act,

719
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,233
what you want happens,
and that's orderly because you 

720
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:13,340
understand it well enough so that,
so that the snakes don't escape.

721
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:15,620
When you walk forward,
you know,

722
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:16,790
you're,
you're,

723
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,720
you're,
you're,

724
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,080
you're
limited.

725
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:21,914
Preconceptions are sufficient so that 
they map onto the environment as it 

726
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:27,230
emerges,
as you act.

727
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,680
That's an orderly place and fine,
that's not a bad place.

728
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,514
You know,
it's like most of you want most of your 

729
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:34,844
experience to be that kind of place 
because otherwise it's just too 

730
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:38,060
overwhelming.

731
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,893
Right?
But the problem with order is that you 

732
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:42,974
can have too much order and,
and all the variability of your 

733
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:48,590
experience can be pushed out and then 
you get bored.

734
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:53,270
So the answer isn't total order.
And we've also talked about what happens

735
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,910
when the answer becomes total order,
right?

736
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:56,744
Cause that's the totalitarian solution.
And we kind of think that maybe it's 

737
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:04,601
grounded in not only in fear but also in
discussed or maybe mostly in disgust.

738
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,350
And so the,
the,

739
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:11,030
the opposite of the ordered low lead 
domain seems to be the chaotic domain.

740
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,280
And the chaotic domain is where you are 
when you don't know where you are.

741
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,550
And that's not a geographical place,
although it can be,

742
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:22,850
because you can get last say in the city
and then you're in chaos.

743
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:23,684
But it's more like a,
it's more often I think in an 

744
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:27,770
interpersonal place.

745
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:28,843
No,
I think people encounter chaos most 

746
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:31,064
often and it's deep sense within their 
relationships with other people go 

747
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:35,744
seriously wrong.
And so that's when you're confronted 

748
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:41,660
with all the things you don't know.
It's also,

749
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:42,643
it also happens to you a lot when you 
were interacting with complex 

750
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:49,040
technological machinery and it fails on 
you because as soon as it fails,

751
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,100
it's like,
well at one second it's,

752
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,420
it's your little gray box with keys that
you could push.

753
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:55,790
And if the next second it's God only 
knows what,

754
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,990
and you are certainly not capable of 
generally speaking of dealing with that.

755
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,360
So the Dow is say,
well,

756
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:04,700
the world is made up of Yin and Yang.
That's how they,

757
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,400
that's the terms that they use to 
conceptualize it.

758
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:09,830
And that's often translated.
As you know,

759
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,060
Yang is masculine and Yin is feminine,
but that doesn't mean male and female.

760
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,163
It means something deeper,
which is human beings have a social 

761
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:22,190
cognitive architecture.
And so you know,

762
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:23,024
we're,
we're from from time in memorial where 

763
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:25,714
we're used to mapping the world as 
masculine and feminine because most of 

764
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:30,794
our interactions throughout our 
evolutionary history have been social 

765
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:37,350
and interpersonal interactions.
That's the primary reality.

766
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,610
And when we developed our,
you know,

767
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:42,600
greater cognitive capacity and our 
ability to abstract,

768
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:43,434
we had to use the conceptual structures 
that we'd already evolved in order to 

769
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:47,364
start mapping out the world abstractly.
And so we seem to use masculine and 

770
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:54,690
feminine,
which is sort of like the primary binary

771
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:55,524
opposition to represent things that are 
primarily opposed at the deepest of 

772
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:01,920
levels.
There's other reasons as well.

773
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,760
I mean chaos is the place from which new
things emerge.

774
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:08,790
So if your computer crashes and you have
to learn to fix it,

775
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,833
then you've learned,
you've extracted a whole bunch of 

776
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:15,240
information from what was otherwise just
a black box so to speak.

777
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,240
And that makes you more skillful and it 
makes your understanding of the world,

778
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:23,550
your detailed representation of the 
world more differentiated.

779
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,420
So chaos is the place that new 
information comes out of.

780
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,880
And that's partly also why it's 
feminine,

781
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:33,780
because the feminine is that from which 
new things emerge.

782
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:37,830
And of course the orderly element is 
masculine,

783
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:38,664
at least in part because we tend to 
conceive of dominance hierarchies as 

784
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:45,180
something like a patriarchal structure.
And they are something like that.

785
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,570
They're like that among human beings.
And they also seem to be like that among

786
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:51,440
chimpanzees,
although not so much with the barnacles.

787
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,810
So,
so that's an interesting way of thinking

788
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:55,644
about things.
And the taoists would say those are 

789
00:45:57,511 --> 00:46:01,050
universal elements of being,
no matter where you are,

790
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,660
there's things you know and there's 
things you don't know.

791
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,150
And so that's the fundamental problem in
your life.

792
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,523
How to deal with the things you know and
can predict and want and how to deal 

793
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:13,140
with the things that you can't.
And then the Dallas would also say,

794
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:15,000
well,
you should walk the line between them.

795
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:17,370
That's the right place to be.
And that's a very,

796
00:46:17,371 --> 00:46:18,151
very,
very,

797
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:18,984
very smart way of thinking about it.
Because if you're only ever where you 

798
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:27,360
know what's going to happen to,
you've got two problems.

799
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,403
One is you're not learning anything 
because of what you already know is 

800
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,750
already working.
So why bother changing it?

801
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:39,350
The second is worse because order tends 
to deteriorate of its own accord,

802
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:41,154
right?
Because the world itself continues to 

803
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:44,370
change.
Just entropy will make a change.

804
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,760
And so if all you do is stick yourself 
inside the order,

805
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,270
the order itself over time is going to 
get less and less stable.

806
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:52,104
And then at some point it's not going to
be there at all and you'll fall right 

807
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:55,470
into chaos.

808
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,663
So you can't just hide over where 
everything is predictable and where you 

809
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:01,860
get what you want.
On the other hand,

810
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,860
if you're in chaos all the time and you 
never know what's going on,

811
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:05,903
then you can't tolerate that 
physiologically because the closer you 

812
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:10,614
are to serious chaos,
the more your body is preparing for the 

813
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:15,294
worst.
And that's because at the bottom of 

814
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:20,070
chaos is the worst,
right?

815
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:22,320
So you see in mythological 
representations,

816
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,363
chaos is the underworld.
And in underworld there's hell and hell 

817
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:26,904
is like the worst place in chaos.
And when you think about conceptions 

818
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:32,080
like this,
when people say,

819
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:33,790
well,
do those places exist?

820
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:34,624
And the answer to that is,
well it depends on what you mean by 

821
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:40,300
exist.
Does the domain of chaos exist?

822
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,433
Well,
how many of you have been there as soon 

823
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,370
as you know the language,
you think,

824
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:46,450
oh yeah,
that exists.

825
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,553
I've been where chaos is Lourdes maybe 
more than I want to be and now and then 

826
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:54,010
I've even been in that part of chaos 
that's best described as hell.

827
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,143
So that's the sort of chaos that you 
visit where everything you do makes it 

828
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:00,130
worse.
And you know,

829
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:00,964
I'm sure that people,
at least some of you have been in that 

830
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:05,830
situation,
you know where things went wrong.

831
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:06,843
And then because of your own foolishness
or because of the malevolence of other 

832
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:10,930
people,
you know,

833
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,483
the situation develops so that it went 
from bad to horrible with each success 

834
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:18,970
of decision.
That's a place that people can go.

835
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,300
It's very,
it's a very real place,

836
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,810
might be more real than anything else.
So the Dow is say,

837
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:28,750
well,
you know the chaos issue while you,

838
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,790
you just can't tolerate too much of 
that.

839
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:35,020
What your body does when it doesn't know
what's going on is basically prepare you

840
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:37,180
for anything that might happen.
You know,

841
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,014
and that's uh,
that's the generalized stress response 

842
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:43,420
and that's associated with massive 
release of cortisol and that puts you on

843
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,210
alert and that's great.
You're awake and ready,

844
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:48,910
but you know,
couple of years of that,

845
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:49,744
then you're old.
Your body just cannot tolerate that 

846
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:57,550
level of energy expenditure on a 
constant basis.

847
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:59,710
It wears you out,
it makes you old fundamentally,

848
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,040
so bored or terrified.
Those are sort of the,

849
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,860
the extremes of chaos in order.
Let's say if you're on the line down the

850
00:49:08,861 --> 00:49:09,970
middle,
well then it's,

851
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,060
you're secure enough so you're not

852
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,990
experiencing a level of negative emotion
that's intolerable.

853
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:22,080
A little apprehension.
That might be a good thing.

854
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,273
You know,
imagine that you're preparing to meet 

855
00:49:24,181 --> 00:49:25,530
someone that you're interested in.

856
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,123
Well,

857
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,860
is the apprehension a good part of that 
or bad part?

858
00:49:31,861 --> 00:49:33,960
Like would you do without that?
Well,

859
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:36,540
you might,
if it's like paralyzing you to the point

860
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,640
where you can hardly even go through 
with talking to them.

861
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,780
But if it's just part of expectation,
that's part of excitement,

862
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,183
you know?
So

863
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,470
when you're on that border between chaos
and order,

864
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:51,930
you don't want to be so orderly that 
you're entirely comfortable.

865
00:49:51,931 --> 00:49:54,150
And that's partly because you're asleep.
Then like,

866
00:49:54,151 --> 00:49:57,180
why the hell do you have to be awake if 
everything's going your way,

867
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,583
you know?
And if you're driving home in your car 

868
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:03,090
and nothing is going on,
you're kind of not even there.

869
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,073
You know,
maybe you're thinking about things in 

870
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:05,754
the future,
but you're certainly not attending in 

871
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:09,180
any real deep sense to what's going on 
around you.

872
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,730
And that's because you don't have to,
well,

873
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:14,040
when you're a little apprehensive,
well then your call,

874
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:15,270
you're more conscious,
you know?

875
00:50:15,271 --> 00:50:16,104
And then you're more engaged in reality.
And then there's the positive emotions 

876
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:19,703
that are associated with that too,
which is excitement and enthusiasm and 

877
00:50:22,411 --> 00:50:25,890
curiosity and hope and all those things 
are in some sense,

878
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:27,680
all those things are worth living for.

879
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,293
And part of the reason that the taoists 
believed that you should walk the line 

880
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:32,324
between chaos and order is because it's 
at that place where the quality of your 

881
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:40,580
existence is high enough.
So that the problems that we discussed,

882
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:45,320
the existential problems we discussed 
are no longer particularly relevant.

883
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,150
And you know,
you might say,

884
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:49,880
well what's the meaning of life?
And I might say,

885
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:50,714
well,
you can't really ask that question 

886
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:54,734
linguistically cause there isn't a 
linguistic answer just as the problem 

887
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:00,680
itself isn't linguistic,
right?

888
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,920
Suffering is not the word.
Suffering.

889
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,810
Suffering is something that you embody 
and meaning is not the word,

890
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:11,510
meaning it's something that happens to 
you.

891
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,670
And so the Dallas would say,
well,

892
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,250
stand on the line between order and 
chaos.

893
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:17,084
You can tell when you're there because 
you're awake and alert and excited and 

894
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:25,091
enthusiastic and deep into the moment.
And that's a good place to be.

895
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,300
And I think the reason that your nervous
system does that to you,

896
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,313
and this is an evolved issue,
is that your brain wants you to be on 

897
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:35,924
the line between order and chaos because
that's where dynamic stability is best 

898
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,120
to tate,
right?

899
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:44,630
Because your problem is how do you 
maintain yourself,

900
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:45,853
right?
Then the problem is how do you maintain 

901
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,104
yourself optimally?
And then the problem is how do you 

902
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:51,044
maintain yourself optimally in a world 
that continues to transform and answer 

903
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:59,060
to that isn't while you stand still,
the answer to that is you,

904
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,193
you transform yourself at the rate that 
keeps you in sync with the transforming 

905
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:06,824
environment.
And since we're adapted to transforming 

906
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:11,114
environments,
there's no reason to assume that when 

907
00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:15,830
you feel the best about what you're 
doing,

908
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:16,933
so to speak,
there's no reason to assume that that's 

909
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:20,600
not exactly where you should be.

910
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:21,883
Why else would you feel like that 
engaged and interested and not plagued 

911
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:30,590
by a surf bite of say,
existential problems.

912
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:31,783
And so then meaning becomes something 
you discover an attempt to inhabit 

913
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,980
rather than some conceptual answer to a 
conceptual problem.

914
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,413
So it's a very interesting idea.
And I think the psychophysiological 

915
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:48,860
evidence for its validity is quite 
strong.

916
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:49,694
You know,
we talked about how the hypothalamus is 

917
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:52,130
constructed.
For example,

918
00:52:52,131 --> 00:52:53,810
we know that it,
you know,

919
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,673
the hypothalamus is concerned with a lot
of the basic things that you need to do 

920
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:58,754
to survive.
So it's always throwing up these little 

921
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:03,380
motivated schemes through which you have
to view the world,

922
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,960
fine,
you have to deal with those.

923
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:06,794
But when you have dealt with them
it defaults to mild exploration and 

924
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:14,204
that's governed by you know,
by pain and by fear and by disgust 

925
00:53:18,741 --> 00:53:22,040
because you can't have your exploration 
be entirely unbridled.

926
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:27,490
But the optimal state of existence looks
like something like,

927
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:29,930
yeah,

928
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:34,930
engaged interest with what's going on 
without too much apprehension now,

929
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,500
not with the zero apprehension because 
the apprehension also wakes you up a bit

930
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,190
and that's the place where information 
flow is maximized.

931
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,640
That's the place where you become more 
than you currently are.

932
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,713
And that's the place where your,
your description of the world becomes 

933
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:53,660
deeper and deeper than the one you 
already have.

934
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:54,494
So that's the place where you get to 
have your cake and eat it too 

935
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:57,883
sufficiently secure,
but also engaged in a game that ensures 

936
00:54:00,891 --> 00:54:03,380
that that security maintains itself 
across time.

937
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,870
So,
so you know,

938
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:06,704
if your life is composed of order and 
chaos in a sense and an that's part of 

939
00:54:10,731 --> 00:54:14,150
your fundamental existential problem,
how to deal with chaos,

940
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,850
how to deal with too much order.
In some sense,

941
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,400
your nervous system already sets you up 
for that now.

942
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:21,234
And that's associated with some of the 
deeper ideas that have been put forward 

943
00:54:24,421 --> 00:54:25,254
by people like young and then to a 
lesser degree by people like Rogers and 

944
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,333
Maslow who believed in something like 
human potential or human self 

945
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:33,264
actualization and unions idea was a 
deeper idea that matt was that when 

946
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:44,421
you're operating on the border between 
order and chaos and you're interested in

947
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:47,160
something,
that's where,

948
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:50,580
that's when you're where you are.
That's when you're there,

949
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,620
you're interested in something and 
you're captivated by it.

950
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,070
You would then say if you try to stay 
there,

951
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:56,933
which means you follow that,
it will take you to all the places that 

952
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:02,820
you don't want to go.
It'll take you to all the places in your

953
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:05,220
past that you haven't made complete use 
of,

954
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,383
and it'll take you to all those places 
that you're avoiding in the future and 

955
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:09,684
the present.

956
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,613
That's what that mechanism is for.
And the reason it will do that is 

957
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:14,304
because with all those experiences that 
you've had in the past that you've 

958
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:20,550
avoided or you haven't made thorough use
of,

959
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,450
there's still sort of latent world left 
there.

960
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,763
So you know,
you see this with people in their 

961
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:28,854
relationships.
It's like say say a woman is going out 

962
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,494
with an abusive guy.
She finally dropped some and it's like 

963
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,310
boom,
next relationship.

964
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,830
Oh look,
it's another abusive guy.

965
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,010
And then she drops him and then the next
relationship it's like,

966
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,590
hmm,
it's another abusive guy.

967
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:46,260
And Freud called that the repetition 
compulsion.

968
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,150
But you might think,
well,

969
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:54,140
what is missing in her world view that 
makes it such that when she acts,

970
00:55:55,701 --> 00:55:58,080
she keeps running into the same 
obstacle.

971
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,530
It's like her map isn't correct.
And so then you might say,

972
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:02,364
well if she went back to the first 
relationship and really dug around in 

973
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:06,504
the carcass so to speak,
she might find out what the hell she's 

974
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:10,830
missing.

975
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,480
One thing might be,
well,

976
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:15,570
when exactly do you say no and how do 
you say it?

977
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:18,270
You know,
because abuse for example usually starts

978
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:19,104
out like it rarely starts out that the 
person is calm and then you end up 

979
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:23,643
pounded flat.
It's like the person who's prone to 

980
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:27,484
abuse as disagreeable.
And so they'll push you and then what 

981
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:31,804
happens next?
Depends on how you respond and if you 

982
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:38,200
step back and you step back and you step
back and you keep doing that,

983
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,273
the probability that the aggression,
the person can't control the aggression 

984
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:44,560
say,
cause they're not well socialized unless

985
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:46,370
you put a limit on it,
it's,

986
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,453
it's just going to chase you.
It's going to get bigger and bigger as 

987
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:52,720
you step backwards and like very many 
things are like that in life.

988
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:53,913
So then you think,
well you have to make enough use of 

989
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:57,754
what's around you of what you haven't 
explored to repair yourself in some 

990
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:02,824
sense.
Or to flesh yourself out so that you're 

991
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:08,500
capable of saying no,
that's not going to happen in a way that

992
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:11,920
actually increases the probability that 
it's not going to happen.

993
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,960
Now I'm certainly not saying that you 
know,

994
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:14,794
everybody's in a,
in an abusive relationship deserves to 

995
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:18,154
be in what I'm talking about,
a very specific set of circumstances 

996
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:25,630
where the same damn thing happens over 
and over because then you have to ask,

997
00:57:25,631 --> 00:57:26,464
well is this random or is there 
something going on that increases the 

998
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,070
probability of that outcome.

999
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,053
Now he owns ideas.
There are very strange ideas cause they 

1000
00:57:37,951 --> 00:57:41,610
take you deep into mythology and we can,
we can look back at that a little.

1001
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,563
Yeah.

1002
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,460
All right.
So the idea,

1003
00:57:55,461 --> 00:57:56,294
well you've got this little framework 
that you have to look at the world 

1004
00:57:58,011 --> 00:57:58,844
through.
It tells you approximately where you 

1005
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:01,550
are,
approximately,

1006
00:58:01,551 --> 00:58:04,790
where you need to go and approximately 
what you should do to get there.

1007
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:06,830
But it can be wrong in any level of 
analysis.

1008
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,851
So then you ask,
well,

1009
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,580
what produces those little worlds and 
what answers?

1010
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,400
One answer is basic biological 
necessity,

1011
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,270
right?
So the basic motivational systems,

1012
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:18,104
emotional systems,
the lines are blurry partly to keep you 

1013
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:22,160
on track,
right?

1014
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:23,870
You're hungry when your blood sugar 
falls,

1015
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:27,500
you're thirsty when you haven't,
when you're not sufficiently hydrated.

1016
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:30,860
Obviously you're sleepy when you've gone
without sleep for too long,

1017
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,030
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1018
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:32,864
And there that those things have been 
problems for so long that in some sense 

1019
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:38,150
you have machinery that takes care of 
that.

1020
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,910
Okay,
so that's,

1021
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:42,403
that's model there.
I started roughly broke the fundamental 

1022
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:46,124
motivations into those that keep you 
going and those that help you propagate 

1023
00:58:49,521 --> 00:58:50,354
because in some sense,
those are the two Darwinian problems 

1024
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:56,660
that you have to solve in life.
But then you might think,

1025
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,213
this seems to me to be how you can start
to think about how the traits might be 

1026
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:06,740
organized into this narrative scheme.
It's like the traits seemed to me,

1027
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,700
maybe there's a hundred now,
maybe there's 30

1028
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:13,443
motivational states,
some of them are pure motivational 

1029
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:16,384
states,
maybe in some of them are just 

1030
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:18,003
combinations of motivational states,
but they're like the basic elements of 

1031
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,720
motivation and then maybe they clump 
together in five different ways.

1032
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:30,410
And out of that we get the five traits 
and then the five traits are like,

1033
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,880
they're kind of like the preconditions 
for your particular story.

1034
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,013
So if you're a conscientious person,
then the world is a little less orderly 

1035
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,360
and little less well put together then 
it should be.

1036
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,380
And your story is,
I'm the person who goes in there and fix

1037
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,600
that up and makes it orderly.
And you know,

1038
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:50,210
if you're an extroverted person then you
think,

1039
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,540
well,
um,

1040
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:56,180
there's all that social territory out 
there to occupy and exploit and,

1041
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,253
and I'm the sort of person that is 
really going to do that because that's 

1042
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:00,410
where your interests lie.

1043
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,390
And if you're an open person,
it's like,

1044
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,403
wow,
look at all these weird things that I 

1045
01:00:04,971 --> 01:00:07,760
can do and think about.
And so that's the world for you.

1046
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,833
And those are all,
you can think of those as a set of five 

1047
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:17,831
stories in some sense that have a 
reasonable probability of success.

1048
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,813
So there are five modes of being and 
they're composed of these more 

1049
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:26,090
fragmented fundamental motivations and 
something like that.

1050
01:00:26,091 --> 01:00:26,924
It's so that,
that's sort of where you can start to 

1051
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:32,210
see the concordance between the 
narrative theories of the clinicians and

1052
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,044
the trait theories of the empiricists.
And there has been work done on this 

1053
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:36,560
sort of thing.
So we know,

1054
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:38,660
for example,
that,

1055
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,423
um,
Jacob Hersch did some of this work that 

1056
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:47,650
your trade temperament does influence 
the words that you use to describe your,

1057
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,533
your spontaneous self narratives.
So if I say write about your past and 

1058
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:55,454
then I analyze your word use,
I can make an educated guess about 

1059
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,054
whether you're extroverted or 
introverted or conscientious or open or 

1060
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:02,594
agreeable.

1061
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,780
So,
and then Dan Mcadams has showed that,

1062
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:06,973
you know,
you know how the big five clump into 

1063
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:10,670
plasticity and stability.
You can,

1064
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,563
the plastic people produce more 
exploratory narratives and the stable 

1065
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:18,050
people produce narratives that are more 
associated with,

1066
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,640
you know,
security in order.

1067
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,013
So,
so there hasn't been a lot of work done 

1068
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:25,010
at the interface between traits and 
narratives,

1069
01:01:25,011 --> 01:01:25,844
but you know,
so I'm sort of pushing the limits of 

1070
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:28,340
knowledge here,
but,

1071
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:29,443
but I think that's the direction in 
which the integration will likely take 

1072
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:33,560
place.
Okay.

1073
01:01:33,561 --> 01:01:37,220
And then we talked a little bit about 
how emotion might work too.

1074
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:38,300
And so we say,
well,

1075
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,373
you're in this little motivated state so
it tells you something about where you 

1076
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:43,694
are and what that's like.
And it gives you some hints about where 

1077
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,873
you might go with that and a disinhibit 
the relevant behaviors that would be 

1078
01:01:50,901 --> 01:01:53,750
associated with that,
including perceptual behaviors.

1079
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,470
And then you walk forward,
well what happens?

1080
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,980
Well two things roughly can happen.
Things you want,

1081
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,443
which indicates a,
that you're moving towards the goal and 

1082
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:06,530
B,
that your plan is good,

1083
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,393
right?
It indicates both and that that's 

1084
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,820
positive emotion,
right?

1085
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:11,654
That's incentive reward.
That's dopaminergic be mediated and you 

1086
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:18,020
like that as long as it's not too 
intense.

1087
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,790
And then the next that can happen is

1088
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:24,990
two things.
There's,

1089
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,790
there's,
it can be divided into two,

1090
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,680
there are things you don't want to have 
happen.

1091
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:29,993
And some of those are,
well there's just an obstacle in your 

1092
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:36,330
way and with a minor deviation in terms 
of trajectory,

1093
01:02:36,331 --> 01:02:37,164
you can walk around it and then the 
other is something you completely don't 

1094
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:45,390
understand how it was and it just knocks
the bottom out of your stupid plant.

1095
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:49,680
And then it also might knock the bottom 
out of all sorts of other plans as well,

1096
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:50,514
depending on how unexpected it is.
And that seems to me to be where the 

1097
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:58,770
transition from order to chaos occurs.
So your,

1098
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,193
we use a relationship example again,
you go home to invite your girlfriend 

1099
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,730
out to have dinner and you find out that
she's in bed with someone else.

1100
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:09,960
It's like,
well,

1101
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,290
dinner's off.
Right,

1102
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,400
right.
Okay.

1103
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:16,260
But that's not all that's off.

1104
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,820
Right.
So then you might think,

1105
01:03:17,821 --> 01:03:18,654
okay,
well there's a lot of things all of a 

1106
01:03:20,101 --> 01:03:23,310
sudden that are off because that's a 
much bigger catastrophe.

1107
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:24,300
Then if she says,
well,

1108
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,134
I already made dinner and you know,
maybe you're a little irritated because 

1109
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,910
you can't take her out now and,
but,

1110
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,650
and you have to eat something else.
It's like,

1111
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,540
oh,
well that's not such a catastrophe.

1112
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:34,763
But it's not easy to figure out exactly 
why those catastrophes differ because 

1113
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:43,620
they're both unexpected things.
And so then you have to think,

1114
01:03:43,621 --> 01:03:44,454
well,
one of them disrupt seems to disrupt a 

1115
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:49,260
lot more than the other.
And then you have to think,

1116
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,090
well,
disrupt what?

1117
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,550
And then that's why I talked to you guys
about this is because I,

1118
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,453
and this is p a jetty.
And in some sense I think this is the 

1119
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:01,410
way to understand why you get upset when
you get upset.

1120
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:02,071
It's like,
okay,

1121
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,540
well,
you know,

1122
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:06,930
you wanted to take your girlfriend out 
for dinner and you know how to do that.

1123
01:04:06,931 --> 01:04:09,390
You'd go into the elevator,
you take the elevator down,

1124
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:10,740
you eat,
you pay,

1125
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:11,603
you know it's,
it's behaviorally plotted out quite 

1126
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:13,644
well.
And so there's a bunch of behaviors at 

1127
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:16,470
the bottom.
And then there's the,

1128
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:17,420
you know,
the,

1129
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,253
the label go out for dinner and it's a 
little thing down at the bottom and it 

1130
01:04:22,351 --> 01:04:23,184
gets disrupted.
And so you're sort of upset in 

1131
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:29,571
proportion to that little bit of 
territory that's been bent a stray.

1132
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:34,320
And maybe if you're not too emotionally 
unstable or neurotic,

1133
01:04:34,321 --> 01:04:38,160
maybe it's a pretty seamless transition,
you know?

1134
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,980
Whereas if you're say emotionally stable
and extroverted,

1135
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:41,910
you think,
oh good,

1136
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,140
something new,
you know,

1137
01:04:43,141 --> 01:04:43,974
so,
and both of those responses are 

1138
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,030
understandable.
All right,

1139
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:50,580
but when it's,
you know,

1140
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:52,260
your partner is in bed with someone 
else,

1141
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:53,094
it's sort of more like at the top,
which is well your say your conception 

1142
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:01,110
of your,
the quality of your life for the overall

1143
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:02,430
quality of you,
Ethan.

1144
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:05,100
And when something major happens,
it's like,

1145
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:06,683
it blows apart,
potentially blows apart your entire 

1146
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,530
structure.
Partly your conceptual structure.

1147
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:14,400
Because like,
Whoa,

1148
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:18,430
what the hell did you know?
Like how stupid could you possibly be?

1149
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:20,890
And that tells you exactly how stupid 
you can be.

1150
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,040
But then you start to wonder about why 
it happened to you.

1151
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:27,490
And partly that's because you're stupid.
Or at least that's what you think.

1152
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:28,503
But then it's also because,
well maybe there's a whole bunch of 

1153
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:32,710
skills that you don't have.
Like,

1154
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:34,150
you know,
if you were a better person,

1155
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,280
if you were more interesting,
if you went,

1156
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,620
you know more places,
if you were more caring,

1157
01:05:38,621 --> 01:05:41,680
if you weren't quite as selfish,
if you were more conscientious,

1158
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,150
right?
Because then you start to think,

1159
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,010
well,
what do I lack?

1160
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,640
It's not only what have I missed 
perceived,

1161
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:51,400
it's what do I lack?
And when you get hit at a high level,

1162
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,323
like your partner be tracy you,
it's like you're infinitely stupid and 

1163
01:05:55,061 --> 01:05:58,210
you're infinitely worthless and that's 
chaos.

1164
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:02,410
And so then you're in chaos and well 
what then do you do?

1165
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:03,573
Well,
the best answer to that is you avoid it 

1166
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:07,143
to begin with.
You take the steps along the way that 

1167
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:11,890
decrease the probability that you're 
ever going to end up there.

1168
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,053
And that's

1169
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,380
in some sense that's what that means.

1170
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,880
So you know,
if you look at this conceptualization,

1171
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:25,583
you can kind of see you're moving from 
point a to point b and then the 

1172
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:33,150
unpredicted outcome is like a hole in 
your plan.

1173
01:06:33,151 --> 01:06:36,240
It's like that's not supposed to happen.
Because if you had a good plan,

1174
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,900
something you didn't want to have 
happened wouldn't have happened.

1175
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,093
And so it's like a hole in your plan and
then you fall through the hole and you 

1176
01:06:43,831 --> 01:06:47,820
find out how big the hole is.
And maybe it's a hole that just ate that

1177
01:06:47,821 --> 01:06:48,930
plan.
And so who cares?

1178
01:06:48,931 --> 01:06:49,764
Or maybe it's the kind of hold it just 
keeps growing until all of you falls 

1179
01:06:53,671 --> 01:06:55,230
into it.
All right,

1180
01:06:55,231 --> 01:06:56,064
so

1181
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,380
how do you deal with that as a 
possibility?

1182
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:00,214
Especially given that you have limited 
knowledge and so that's what this means 

1183
01:07:06,461 --> 01:07:09,790
and this is the same thing basically as 
the taoists representation.

1184
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:13,360
Because the dow representation Dow also 
means meaning,

1185
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:14,194
Hey,
and so being on that line between chaos 

1186
01:07:15,641 --> 01:07:19,960
and order is meaningful and the taoists 
believed that you should be where things

1187
01:07:19,961 --> 01:07:22,840
are meaningful.
That's the right place to be.

1188
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,040
And you think,
well,

1189
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:25,930
it's a good place to be if you think 
about it,

1190
01:07:25,931 --> 01:07:27,730
about you know,
your own experiences.

1191
01:07:27,731 --> 01:07:30,850
When you're doing something meaningful,
you think you don't even think about it,

1192
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,570
it's just this is a good place to be and
you can notice it.

1193
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,540
Maybe you can notice it and continue to 
do it more.

1194
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:38,374
And that's what the existentialists 
would call striving for an authentic 

1195
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:42,244
existence.
You know when you can think about that 

1196
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:45,370
as well,
it's philosophy.

1197
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:45,881
It's like,
no,

1198
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:46,720
no,
don't,

1199
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:47,554
don't,
don't,

1200
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,940
don't be thinking that.

1201
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,393
It's advice about how to structure your 
life so that it's quality is sufficient 

1202
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:57,670
so that you don't become resentful and 
full of hate.

1203
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,250
Like it's not casual.
Well,

1204
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:02,440
here's some philosophical ideas to think
about.

1205
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:06,790
It's like you got a take this seriously 
because if you don't,

1206
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:07,863
not only do you not have a good time 
because you just aren't paying any 

1207
01:08:11,531 --> 01:08:12,364
attention,
but you'll also turn into the sort of 

1208
01:08:13,961 --> 01:08:14,794
person who's highly motivated to make 
sure that no one else ever has a good 

1209
01:08:17,391 --> 01:08:18,224
time as well.
And so you go from just kind of being 

1210
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:24,830
useless and miserable on your own.
When that becomes sufficient,

1211
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,860
Lee,
useful and meaningless and painful,

1212
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:28,813
then you're undoubtedly going to start 
to dream about taking it out on all the 

1213
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:36,500
other people whose fault it is that 
you're unfulfilled and miserable.

1214
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:37,663
And so it doesn't,
if you don't stay in that meaningful 

1215
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:40,934
place.

1216
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,700
So to speak so that your life is 
acceptable to you.

1217
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,400
You don't think that you're the only one
who will suffer.

1218
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:48,770
It's you're just the beginning of the 
suffering.

1219
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,960
Now with this,
this is a great,

1220
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,080
this is a great image.
It's really old.

1221
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:56,060
You know the oldest story we have,
which is called the Enuma elish.

1222
01:08:56,061 --> 01:08:56,894
I told you a little bit about it.
The Sumerian creation myth is the myth 

1223
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:00,404
about a hero basically going out to 
conquer some vaguely reptilian dragon 

1224
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:10,280
ish,
chaos beast.

1225
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,550
And
that's really,

1226
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:14,384
as far as I can tell,
that's really the story of humanity 

1227
01:09:16,161 --> 01:09:20,360
there and the story of humanity is you 
look on the,

1228
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,560
on the right,
there's a,

1229
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:25,460
there's a whole,
that's the whole that your plans,

1230
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:29,720
that's the whole that you fall into when
your plans don't work.

1231
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:33,530
So that hole is always there and at the 
bottom of the hole is something terrible

1232
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,910
and that's what the dragon is.

1233
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:37,790
And then the little castle at the 
background,

1234
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:39,620
well that's order,
that's where you live.

1235
01:09:39,621 --> 01:09:40,454
And this thing that crawls out of the 
hole to face you is always threatening 

1236
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:47,360
order and answer is well then what you 
do about it.

1237
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:49,850
And one answer is man,
get those walls up,

1238
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:53,090
you know,
800 stories tall and 500 feet thick.

1239
01:09:53,091 --> 01:09:53,924
And the problem is,
well you can't get out of a castle 

1240
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:58,610
that's that thick.
So maybe that's not so good.

1241
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,833
You know?
And the other thing is just to throw 

1242
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:01,514
your hands up in despair and say,
well what the hell is the use of having 

1243
01:10:04,011 --> 01:10:06,770
a castle anyways if there's just going 
to be dragons around it.

1244
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,173
And then the other one is,
well maybe we should take care of it 

1245
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:14,030
when it's relatively small.
And so,

1246
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:15,980
you know,
when you're in a relationship,

1247
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:19,100
for example,
if you don't want it to fall down a pet,

1248
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,670
then you have to notice when the little 
dragons are popping up.

1249
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:23,753
You know?
And those are things that disturb your 

1250
01:10:25,551 --> 01:10:27,800
equilibrium that produced some negative 
emotion.

1251
01:10:27,801 --> 01:10:31,040
But that also sort of call out to you,
this isn't acceptable.

1252
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:34,850
I should do something about it.
And the most important ones to not avoid

1253
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:38,900
are the ones that call out to you.
This isn't good.

1254
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:43,910
I should do something about it.
I know what to do and I could do it.

1255
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:45,343
And if you step back from that,
well then all that'll happen is those 

1256
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:48,734
things will multiply and multiply and 
multiply and multiply until they're so 

1257
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:56,390
big that you're no match for them 
whatsoever.

1258
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,610
You'll trip over it,
fall down that hole.

1259
01:10:58,611 --> 01:11:01,490
And that'll be that.
And so that's a bad outcome.

1260
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:03,403
So that's part of the moral obligation.
Say that the existentialists lay on 

1261
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:10,220
people in the unions as well.
It's like wake up,

1262
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,530
pay attention.
You know,

1263
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:13,364
if things going the way that you want 
them to then do what you can as fast as 

1264
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:20,880
you can to stay something about it and 
fix it,

1265
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,140
fix it,
fix it.

1266
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:26,730
Do the things you can to repair the 
things around you that are producing low

1267
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:29,400
quality experience.
And then what happens?

1268
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:31,980
Well,
you get tougher,

1269
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:33,503
and the reason you get tougher is 
because you're engaged in all these 

1270
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:36,084
little micro battles,
and the more you engage in those micro 

1271
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:41,610
battles,
the better you get at battling.

1272
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:45,870
And so then you become someone who can 
say no when you have to say no,

1273
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,630
and that's a really useful thing to be 
able to say.

1274
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,380
Then also,
the other thing you're doing is that,

1275
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:53,693
well,
everything around you is trying to turn 

1276
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:57,810
into chaos and the chaos is popping up.
You're just like,

1277
01:11:57,870 --> 01:12:01,590
it's like whackable,
you know that foolish arcade game parks,

1278
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,410
the little weasel,
and you hit it with the stick.

1279
01:12:04,411 --> 01:12:05,310
It's like,
well,

1280
01:12:05,311 --> 01:12:08,670
that's what it's like.
Little problems pop up.

1281
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:13,530
Fix them as soon as they pop up because 
then they can't grow.

1282
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:15,600
Well,
maybe they still will,

1283
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:16,434
but at least you'll have the best 
probability that they won't grow 

1284
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:20,010
unnecessarily.

1285
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,003
All right,

1286
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,790
so that's what I've derived from what 
I've

1287
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,550
taught to you.
People.

1288
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,780
You know that,
that

1289
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:36,030
the fundamental problems of life are 
existential.

1290
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:37,223
It's what to do.
The solutions to those problems are not 

1291
01:12:41,251 --> 01:12:45,030
arbitrary.
The wisdom traditions of mankind and the

1292
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:49,470
profound psychological theories that 
we've collected over the last 200 years.

1293
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,540
They converge.
You know,

1294
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:52,374
one of,
one of the things they say is get your 

1295
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:54,414
story straight.
And other thing they say is if you're 

1296
01:12:57,721 --> 01:13:01,650
avoiding something that you need to do 
in order to get to where you're going,

1297
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:05,730
quit avoiding it because the avoidance 
will cause you trouble.

1298
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:06,564
It'll,
it'll weaken you and it'll make the 

1299
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:10,580
world into a more terrible place.
And then the,

1300
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:14,340
the broader sociological,
psychological studies,

1301
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:16,820
like the ones that were done by people 
like soldier Hanson,

1302
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,693
who as you know,
isn't generally utilized in a 

1303
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:22,950
personality class,
but he's sort of like a metta,

1304
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:24,630
Viktor Frankl,
Viktor Frankl,

1305
01:13:24,631 --> 01:13:26,290
as far as I'm concerned,
you know,

1306
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:27,360
a soldier and instant lays out.

1307
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,190
Another problem with all of this,
which is,

1308
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,460
well,
if you don't do this,

1309
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,300
if you don't get your story straight and
you don't stop avoiding,

1310
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,100
well then,
well,

1311
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:38,934
what's the consequence in one 
consequences while you're a miserable 

1312
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:42,114
thing with a very low quality life.
And so you're just going to be tortured 

1313
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:49,410
by existence and it's perfectly capable 
of torturing you beyond your endurance.

1314
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:53,430
And that sort of sucks for you.
But the next step beyond that is why you

1315
01:13:53,431 --> 01:13:54,264
become the sort of person who isn't 
really all that positively predisposed 

1316
01:13:57,301 --> 01:14:00,810
to existence.
And once you're that sort of person than

1317
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:01,644
anybody who comes along to offer you the
opportunity to live inside something 

1318
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:08,130
rigid and hurt,
anyone who comes near,

1319
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,640
you're going to jump on that partly 
because you're afraid and they offer you

1320
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:13,474
security.
And partly because you're resentful and 

1321
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:16,540
bitter and full of hatred.

1322
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,373
And so you're just waiting for the 
bloody opportunity to take that out on 

1323
01:14:20,351 --> 01:14:21,184
someone,
especially if you can act morally and 

1324
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:24,790
superior.
Well,

1325
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:26,230
you're doing it,
you know,

1326
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:27,100
and you think,
well,

1327
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:29,530
that's basically what Hitler offered the
Germans.

1328
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:32,890
And that's basically what Stalin offered
the communists.

1329
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:33,724
It was an inversion of the order.
And anybody who is pathologically 

1330
01:14:36,521 --> 01:14:40,780
resentful had the opportunity to be just
as murderous as they wanted to be.

1331
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:43,300
And so,
you know,

1332
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:48,070
the 20th century put towards this a 
whole variety of problems.

1333
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:50,050
One problem was the problem of meaning.
You know,

1334
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:50,913
Nicha sort of announced that at the end 
of the 19th century and then the 20th 

1335
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:55,420
century was,
well,

1336
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:56,254
what do we do about that?
And a lot of it was nihilistic and lot 

1337
01:14:58,691 --> 01:14:59,524
of it was totalitarian.
And both of those seem to be not so 

1338
01:15:02,171 --> 01:15:03,280
good.
You know?

1339
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:04,270
And,
and for me,

1340
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:06,940
especially in the universities,
denialism hasn't ended.

1341
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:10,060
It's still infested most of the 
humanities.

1342
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:15,750
But the nihilism in the totalitarianism,
they are not the only opportunities.

1343
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:19,360
They're not the only options.
And you know,

1344
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:20,194
it is possible for people to pay 
attention to their lives in such a way 

1345
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:27,190
that they straightened out.
And if you straighten out,

1346
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:30,610
man,
you'd get tough and you get useful.

1347
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,640
And if you're tough and useful than life
isn't so horrible,

1348
01:15:33,641 --> 01:15:35,050
or if it,
even if it is,

1349
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:36,640
you can hack it,
you know,

1350
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:39,300
because make in life not horrible.
Mm.

1351
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:44,320
You'll have limited success with that,
but making yourself tough enough so that

1352
01:15:44,321 --> 01:15:47,230
won't corrupt you.
That's a possibility.

1353
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:50,050
And then the upside to that is,
well,

1354
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:52,900
you're not going to be a totalitarian 
then.

1355
01:15:52,901 --> 01:15:53,734
You're not going to be nihilistic and 
you're not going to be like a primary 

1356
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:59,110
danger to the structure of the social 
unit around you.

1357
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,990
And who knows?
Maybe it's even better than that.

1358
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:04,690
You'll be good for you.
That'd be good.

1359
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,360
You be good for your family.
That'd be good.

1360
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:10,330
You'd be good for your community.
That would be good.

1361
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:13,360
That's an equivalent rated state from 
the [inaudible] perspective,

1362
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:15,550
right?
You're living so it works for you.

1363
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:18,100
It works for your family,
works for your community.

1364
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,070
God only knows,
maybe it even works for the planet.

1365
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:22,810
I mean,
that would be the hope.

1366
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:25,090
Well,
that's a pretty good thing to aim at.

1367
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:30,480
And the other thing to think about in 
that regard is life is hard enough.

1368
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:35,680
So you need an adventure.
You need an adventure to justify it.

1369
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:37,900
Like it has to be worth it.
You know,

1370
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:41,290
and one adventure,
one real adventure is see if you can get

1371
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:43,660
your act together.
That's hard.

1372
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,673
And it's an adventure and it's partly an
adventure because if you make that your 

1373
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:49,000
primary goal,
say,

1374
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,500
do not avoid things to tell the truth to
aim at the highest value,

1375
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,530
things start to happen to you.

1376
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:59,110
They're not things that you're 
manipulating the world to get.

1377
01:16:59,111 --> 01:17:02,710
There just doors that start to open and 
you just,

1378
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:06,160
God only knows how many doors will open 
to you if you do that.

1379
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:08,770
And that makes things extraordinarily 
interesting.

1380
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:11,330
And once things are extraordinarily 
interesting,

1381
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:15,860
the fact that life has its limitations 
and that it's full of suffering,

1382
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:16,401
you think,
yeah,

1383
01:17:16,401 --> 01:17:18,740
well you know,
all things considered,

1384
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,180
it's not such a bad bargain one.
And so to close,

1385
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:27,320
one of the things you might ask yourself
is if you're in a situation,

1386
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:33,550
if you're in a situation where
your life isn't of a sufficient quality,

1387
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:36,943
then you might ask yourself,
are you doing absolutely everything you 

1388
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:43,010
can to fix it?
And then you might say,

1389
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:43,844
well,
let's not draw any final conclusions 

1390
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:50,000
about the utility of existence and its 
value until we're sure we've got our act

1391
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:53,540
together and are seeing things straight 
and that's worth pursuing.

1392
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,640
That's what you should be learning in 
university.

1393
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:57,620
You know?
Cause that's the,

1394
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:58,663
that's the proper path of a citizen.
It's the proper path of someone who's 

1395
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:06,230
attempting to put the world's straight.
And that's the best thing you can do.

1396
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:09,680
And it's not only because it's right,
it's because

1397
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,450
it's because what's right is actually 
what's best for you.

1398
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,530
So that's what I've learned from the 
stuff I've been teaching you.

1399
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,790
So thank you.

1400
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:24,930
[inaudible].
