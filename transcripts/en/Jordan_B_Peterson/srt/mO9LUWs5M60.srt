1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,673
Okay,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,713
I want to talk to you a little bit about
theories of truth and there's a reason 

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,343
for that and the reason is that I want 
to make a distinction between two kinds 

4
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:17,714
of knowledge and before I do that,
I want to talk about the multiple ways 

5
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:23,504
that you can determine whether or not 
something is true and for whether 

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,053
something is factual.
It's much more difficult task than you 

7
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:31,544
might think because it's easy to think 
that there's only one way of defining 

8
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:35,264
true,
but that's not the case as far as I can 

9
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:39,884
tell.
So the first thing I'm going to do is 

10
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:48,071
talk to you about how things might be 
true from a Darwinian perspective.

11
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:51,230
And if you think you can knock any holes
in this argument,

12
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,064
go right ahead.
Because I'd been hacking away at it for 

13
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:57,380
awhile and I haven't been able to.
So you know,

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,700
Darwin had had this theory back in the 
late 18 hundreds,

15
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,290
which you're nobody I would all aware 
of.

16
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,660
And it was basically predicated on two 
fundamental axioms.

17
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:09,494
And the first axiom was that there's 
natural variability in a population and 

18
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:16,274
that was later discovered to be 
associated with genetic variability and 

19
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:22,640
that that genetic variability could 
transform.

20
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,570
That's mutations do that.
And that was in some sense,

21
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:27,404
a later addition to Darwin's theory.
And then the natural environment select 

22
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,820
the most,
the organism that's most suitable to the

23
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:42,854
current environment,
all things considered so that it can 

24
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:46,634
propagate right?
And then whatever propagates moves to 

25
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,540
the next generation and the same process
occurs again.

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,913
Okay?
Now there's a variety of complications 

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,110
about that theory that I'm going to lay 
out a little bit.

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,493
Um,
when the victorians first got ahold of 

29
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:05,444
this theory that kind of thought that it
meant that there was a natural 

30
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:08,510
hierarchy,
right?

31
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,373
That as evolution progressed,
it progressed and that higher organisms 

32
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,450
followed in the trail of lower 
organisms.

33
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,283
And so in some sense,
even though it wasn't a natural or 

34
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:27,311
necessary presumption for those who 
adopted Darwinian theory,

35
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,603
the idea of a hierarchy of value in some
sense was still part of Darwinian 

36
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:34,730
theory.
So we could say,

37
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:35,990
well,
human beings are,

38
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,120
you know,
evolution has led to over.

39
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,983
It's billions of years to us and we're 
far more complicated than simple 

40
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:43,424
creatures.
So it seems like there's a process at 

41
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:49,160
least of increasing complexification 
going on and maybe that has something to

42
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:52,940
do with increased value.
We're more fit now.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,550
Modern,
dark,

44
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,783
modern evolutionary biologists take 
issue with this because they don't 

45
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,800
really think that there is any 
directionality in evolution.

46
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,634
And after all,
there are still plenty of one celled 

47
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:07,210
organisms around it.
Fact,

48
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,044
there are more one celled organisms in 
your body than there are your own cells 

49
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,810
by a huge margin.
So,

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,100
so the idea that there's a necessary 
direction in evolution,

51
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,083
rain going from simple to more complex 
is not formally true except that 

52
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,693
obviously there are much more complex 
organisms then there were around a 

53
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:28,444
couple of billion years ago.
And so there does seem to be some 

54
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,130
directionality,
um,

55
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,560
in some cases.
And it's not exactly obvious why that is

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,083
so.
So the reason I'm telling you that is 

57
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,000
because it's not self evident that

58
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,810
creatures as they evolve,
become more fit,

59
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,560
so to speak.
And so what evolutionary themed seems to

60
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,394
be about evolutionary theory seems to be
about at a deeper level is something 

61
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:58,310
like a dance between the environment and
the organism.

62
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,503
So the Oregon in the environment keeps 
transforming and it does that 

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,780
unpredictably,
I wouldn't say randomly,

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,560
but it does it unpredictably or 
unpredictable,

65
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,483
unpredictable built,
does it unpredictably to an 

66
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:18,221
unpredictable degree because some things
that are true today are going to be true

67
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:19,454
tomorrow,
but other things aren't and you don't 

68
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:23,060
know which ones,
which one of those are going to shift.

69
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,493
Now,
I think if you want to get a practical 

70
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:29,480
idea of how the environment moves 
around,

71
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:30,314
one of the best ways to do that is to 
try to predict the stock market because 

72
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,890
it's pretty easy to predict the stock 
market based on past performance.

73
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,993
But it's very,
very difficult to predict the stock 

74
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:40,544
market by deriving formulas that 
predicted past performance to predict 

75
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:45,650
the future.

76
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,960
In fact,
there's no evidence that you can do it.

77
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,660
And so most money managers,
for example,

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,540
do worse than chance at picking stocks.
So and so,

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,833
you know,
I've thought for a long time about why 

80
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:03,080
anybody would ever invest their money 
with a money manager in the stock market

81
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:03,914
and the best answer I've come up with is
that people don't want to take 

82
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:07,964
responsibility for making mistakes with 
their money and so they have a lot of 

83
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:14,300
money and it makes them nervous and so 
they don't,

84
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,670
they,
they don't know anything about investing

85
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,710
and maybe you can't,
but anyways,

86
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:20,210
they don't know anything about investing
in.

87
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:23,570
So they parsed the money off to a money 
manager who's an expert.

88
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,090
And then if they lose their money,
they can say to themselves,

89
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:28,400
well at least I had an expert looking 
after it.

90
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:31,220
But if you look into it deeply,
you find that there's

91
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:33,923
the bulk of preponderance of the 
evidence suggests that you cannot get 

92
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,144
enough information to accurately predict
what the stock market is going to do at 

93
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:42,434
all.
And you can kind of see that that's 

94
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,244
true.
Because if you could get a consistent 

95
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:48,390
edge of say one 10th of one percent,
which sounds like nothing.

96
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,031
Oh,
you did.

97
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:49,864
They I'll have to do is repeat your bets
over and over and soon you'd have all 

98
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,510
the money in the world because of 
compounding,

99
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,793
so and the stock market,
a good model of the environment because 

100
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,920
it is in fact a model of the 
environment.

101
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,350
It's not a model of the entire 
environment obviously,

102
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:06,200
but all sorts of things affect stock 
market prices,

103
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,034
right?
Psychological factors and biological 

104
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,660
factors in whether and political events 
and so forth.

105
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:14,000
So as far as models of the environment 
go,

106
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,580
it's pretty good one and you can't stay.

107
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,200
You can't keep up with it fundamentally.
So.

108
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,810
So you can think of the environment that
way.

109
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:21,644
It's this thing that's dancing around 
and some elements of it are more stable 

110
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,360
than than others.
So for example,

111
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:29,020
the sun appears to be pretty stable at 
least on our timeframe.

112
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,903
So that's a good thing,
but lots of things can't be relied on 

113
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:35,300
from one moment to another and you don't
know what direction it's going to turn.

114
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,733
So the way that life deals with that is 
by producing a plethora of variance and 

115
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,790
basically letting anything that doesn't 
work die.

116
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,520
So evolution requires an awful lot of 
death,

117
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,623
you know,
and there's ideas that what we've done 

118
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,444
to some degree is we've internalized the
evolutionary process because we can 

119
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,480
invent fictional representatives of 
ourselves,

120
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,733
right?
Which would be our potential future 

121
00:06:58,821 --> 00:06:59,654
selves and we could run simulations of 
the environment and kill off all those 

122
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:06,590
potential future selves that don't look 
like they would actually survive.

123
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,200
And that's really what we think about as
thinking.

124
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,870
Okay.
So all right,

125
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,930
so then the next thing you might ask 
yourself about,

126
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,670
given that is we're going to shift basis
here a little bit,

127
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,773
is what,
how would you define reality if you had 

128
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,540
to come up with a definition of what 
constituted real,

129
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,763
how would you go about doing it?
And I would say the way the West does 

130
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:31,070
this,
it's,

131
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,260
it's,
there's a schizophrenia element to it,

132
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,393
a split element.
There was an incoherence in it and I 

133
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,320
haven't heard anyone else make this 
argument.

134
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,154
So if you think,
if you can figure out some reason why 

135
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:42,380
it's stupid,
then let me know.

136
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,214
But so think about it this way,
like our basic presumptions about the 

137
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,174
world are materialistic right now and I 
would say that those materialistic 

138
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:54,860
assumptions were basically laid down at 
the beginning of the scientific endeavor

139
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,693
and so that would be about the time of 
Bacon and descartes and so because they 

140
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:02,210
sort of laid the foundations for modern 
science and there's some,

141
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,073
there's some rules about what things are
in reality and the rules or something 

142
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:07,640
like,
well,

143
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:08,474
things are made out of littler things 
and then if you go all the way down to 

144
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:14,180
the level where the littlest thing 
possible is,

145
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,283
well that's where you find the 
fundamental constituent elements of 

146
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:18,584
reality.

147
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,270
And so it's,
it's,

148
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,193
it's an matter is detectable by the 
senses and it's Inter subjectively 

149
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,480
detectable.
So you can,

150
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,583
you can,
you can detect something with your 

151
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,610
senses fundamentally or with the 
extension of your senses.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,330
You can describe how you went about 
detecting it.

153
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,403
Other people can duplicate that and then
they can report what they detect and if 

154
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:43,010
the reports are similar,
then we assume that that thing is real.

155
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,040
So in some sense it's what our senses 
already do,

156
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:46,874
right?
Because our census triangulate in a 

157
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:48,824
sense.
So how do you figure out if something's 

158
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,490
real well,
if you can see it,

159
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,863
you know that's pretty good,
but it's better if you can see it and 

160
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,624
hear it and it's better yet if you could
see it and hear it and touch it and 

161
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,404
maybe it's better if you could see it 
and hear it and touch it and taste it 

162
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,793
and so forth.

163
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,260
And you know,
we've evolved these sensory systems that

164
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,094
are quite different from a qualitative 
perspective and if they all report the 

165
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:12,594
same thing,
then we believe we have a pretty 

166
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,010
reasonable chance of actually believing 
that that thing is there.

167
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,083
And then with science we've actually 
extended that capacity because we don't 

168
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:21,414
just use the senses of one person.
We use our senses in a rigorous and 

169
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:25,644
collective manner.
And that reports to us the nature of 

170
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,150
what we've come to call the objective 
world.

171
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:30,961
And then we say,
well,

172
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,780
accurate descriptions of the objective 
world are true.

173
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,460
It's like,
you know,

174
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,940
that's a good theory and you can also 
certainly see.

175
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,570
You can certainly see it's objective 
utility.

176
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:43,560
Sorry,
I shouldn't say that.

177
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:47,310
It's pragmatic utility because when you 
play by the rules of science,

178
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,340
it appears that your power expands,
right?

179
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,140
So that's another reason why we think 
it's true.

180
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,003
You run through these routines and then 
all of a sudden you could do things you 

181
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:58,950
couldn't do before and that's,
that's a different criteria of truth,

182
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,784
right?
That's more like a criteria of 

183
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:04,320
usefulness and a practical usefulness 
because you would think to that,

184
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,710
and this is why you thought that science
was actually embedded inside a narrative

185
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,590
in a deeper narrative.
You know,

186
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:11,424
we wouldn't be doing science if we 
didn't think it was useful for 

187
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:14,640
something.
Right?

188
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,950
And then you might think,
well useful for what?

189
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,450
And then,
well,

190
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,343
what would you say?
Maybe you suffer less because of 

191
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:24,240
science.
Maybe live longer because of science.

192
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,103
Maybe you find life more interesting.
You could do a more diverse range of 

193
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:28,764
things.
Whatever we have made the decision that 

194
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:33,990
the utility of science justifies the 
endeavor,

195
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,880
but that's a different criteria,
right?

196
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,380
That you utility of something and you 
could debate the utility of science from

197
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:42,900
a Darwinian perspective because you 
could easily say,

198
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,220
well,
here's an example.

199
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,923
There was a book written awhile ago by 
an ex KGB officer and he was talking 

200
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:54,831
about biological warfare labs in the 
Soviet Union and he claimed to have work

201
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:59,730
in a biological warfare lab where the 
goal was to cross Ebola was smallpox.

202
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,550
Now Ebola,
which you all know about,

203
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,384
isn't very contagious.
You have to really be in contact with 

204
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:09,090
someone who has ebola to catch it.
But smallpox,

205
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,193
that's contagious.
So if you get the two things working 

206
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:13,434
together,
you would have a disease that's 

207
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,730
basically 100 percent fatal and it would
be,

208
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,070
you could distribute it in aerosol 
forum,

209
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:23,130
which is sort of the dream of any 
biological weapons maker now.

210
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,170
They never really managed it,
but you know,

211
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:27,120
it's kind of an interesting idea.
Right?

212
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,253
And it had,
it turned out and there were no people 

213
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:30,684
left and we'd have to say that our 
notion about the utility of science 

214
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:37,410
turned out to be colossally wrong from a
Darwinian perspective.

215
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:38,244
And you know,
you might say the same thing about 

216
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,670
hydrogen bonds,
for example,

217
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:44,130
or maybe you might say the same thing 
about computers because,

218
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,220
you know,
it seems to me quite unlikely that human

219
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:50,610
beings in their present form are going 
to be around 200 years in the future,

220
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,883
you know,
with the rate of the growth of computer 

221
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,544
intelligence,
the probability that will become 

222
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:56,734
something biological and mechanical 
together seems to me to be virtually 

223
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,860
certain we're certainly headed in that 
direction.

224
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,250
So anyways,
the question

225
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,733
ideas.

226
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:15,940
No,
no,

227
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,960
that's,
that's a good question.

228
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,250
The question was,
do you ever think,

229
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,143
do you think that people's interest in 
science can not be not pragmatically 

230
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:22,414
oriented?
I actually don't think so because I 

231
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:24,394
don't think that you would be interested
in science if it wasn't pragmatically 

232
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:29,560
useful.
You see,

233
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:30,394
and that's,
that's exactly the point that I want to 

234
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,314
pursue in this lecture today.
It's like we are interested in things 

235
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:38,320
generally as a consequence of their 
perceived utility,

236
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,150
you know,
and now the ends,

237
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,980
the framework within which you 
determined utility is quite malleable.

238
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,110
So for example,
if you're suicidal,

239
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:51,790
you might regard it how sharp knife is 
as the primary object of interest,

240
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,710
but generally speaking,
you know,

241
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:58,300
we would assume that especially if 
you're a Darwinian thinker,

242
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,134
that your primary interests or something
like survival and reproduction and you 

243
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:03,334
know,
I don't think that's an unreasonable 

244
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:04,800
assumption.

245
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,980
I'm the terms are quite elastic,
so you can throw a lot of motivations in

246
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:10,120
them without,
you know,

247
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,190
without having to think that rigorously 
about it.

248
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,650
But as a,
as a heuristic framework,

249
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,360
it's not bad.
So,

250
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,403
and so part of the reason that you 
believe that science was embedded in a 

251
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:21,820
dream,
which was the l chemical dream,

252
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:22,654
fundamentally it was because he believed
that the people who developed the 

253
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,280
symbolic precursors to science.
And so those would be the alchemists.

254
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,690
Newton wasn't outcome by the way.
Um,

255
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,460
we're looking for something 
approximating the philosopher's stone,

256
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:39,460
which was a material object which would 
grant it's bearers,

257
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,690
eternal life and good health and wealth.
And so the,

258
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,613
the all chemists were the first people 
in some sense to posit that if you 

259
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:51,520
systematically investigated the 
transformations of the material world,

260
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:54,670
which was regarded more or less as 
damned by the Catholic Church,

261
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,803
that you could extract out information 
that would be of substantial benefit to 

262
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,180
the things I just described,
health,

263
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:02,290
wealth and longevity.

264
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,470
And so you might say,
well why are we pursuing science?

265
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:09,010
Like why are we motivated to do it?
Why would you spend 10,000

266
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:11,920
hours looking through a microscope?
It's a very weird thing to do.

267
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,120
And the,
the union ideas,

268
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,540
well,
if you go right down to the base of the,

269
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,450
of the,
of the hierarchy of motivation,

270
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:20,284
you're doing it to make the world a 
better place in some manner that's 

271
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:25,750
important to you.
So you can't.

272
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,733
Science has to be nested inside a 
motivational structure or no one would 

273
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,390
do it.
Now you know,

274
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:32,920
you can think about that,
what you want,

275
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:33,754
but,
but it's not an argument that you can 

276
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:39,190
easily dismissed because you have to 
account for why people are interested in

277
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:39,941
science.
You know?

278
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:40,691
And if you say,
well,

279
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:41,890
it's because they want to build a 
career,

280
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:44,920
that's fine because it just nests inside
the same argument anyways.

281
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,840
Okay,
so now.

282
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,220
So we kinda have a definition of reality
from a materialist perspective.

283
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,140
Now there's a few problems with that,
right?

284
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,213
One of the problems is is that when you 
get down to the fundamental elements of 

285
00:14:58,161 --> 00:14:58,994
matter,
they turn out not to be very much like 

286
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:01,694
matter at all.
They turn out to be these weird quantum 

287
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,463
processes and entities that appear to be
tangled up with consciousness in some 

288
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,874
way that no one can understand and 
certainly display all sorts of 

289
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:16,280
properties that aren't evident at the 
macro level.

290
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,520
So you know the formal job of 
reductionism,

291
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:20,354
which is you are one element of 
reductionism because there's many 

292
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:24,554
elements of reductionism is that you 
explain the complex by the simple and 

293
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,903
you know,
for a lone time as we went deeper into 

294
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:31,634
the microstructure of things,
it did appear in some sense to be 

295
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:34,580
getting simpler.

296
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,860
But then when we went down to the 
quantum level,

297
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:37,694
it all of a sudden,
God incredibly weird and no one really 

298
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,460
knows what to do about that.
Now,

299
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,760
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna introduce quantum thinking

300
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,594
into this discussion because you know 
every Weirdo with a crockpot theory 

301
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,170
immediately immediately does that and 
it's a very dangerous thing to do.

302
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,423
I'm just pointing out that we didn't 
expect for the nature of reality to 

303
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,010
qualitatively transform as we 
investigated the microstructure.

304
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,140
But that's what happened.
So all of that aside,

305
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,663
the idea that truth,
that there are facts about material 

306
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,250
reality and that those facts are true is
a very,

307
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,860
very powerful idea.
However,

308
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,113
we don't pursue it because the rationale
for pursuing that truth is based on 

309
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:25,781
truths that are different from the 
truths that the process itself reveals.

310
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,800
So you know,
and I think you know,

311
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:30,200
you,
you might well agree,

312
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,303
hypothetically,
that perhaps investigating how to 

313
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,784
combine ebola with smallpox is not 
really a good idea from a sign perfect 

314
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,750
idea from a scientific perspective.

315
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,370
But there,
it seems not unreasonable to assume that

316
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:51,371
there's a broader perspective from which
that idea probably isn't for the best,

317
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,290
you know,
now a pure scientists,

318
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,210
there isn't such a thing,
but if there was,

319
00:16:56,211 --> 00:17:00,260
might say it doesn't matter because all 
facts are equal because facts don't have

320
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:01,190
value,
you know,

321
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,480
they're,
they're not valence,

322
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,373
so all facts are equal.
But of course you can't live like all 

323
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:06,464
facts are equal because there's a 
trillion facts and if you don't have 

324
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:14,111
some mechanism to zero you in on a 
subset of relevant facts,

325
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,190
it's like you're immobilized,
you know,

326
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,233
you're just flooded by inflammation.
I think something like that probably 

327
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:22,130
happens to people in the initial stages 
of schizophrenia,

328
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,370
so they can't distinguish.
Everything becomes relevant.

329
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,220
That's a bad situation.
So,

330
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,010
so,
you know,

331
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,843
you're stuck with a subset of facts 
anyways and there are reasons that you 

332
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,900
choose the subset of facts that you 
choose and those reasons aren't grounded

333
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,270
in a materialist philosophy and they 
can't be,

334
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,950
at least not in any simple way.

335
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,500
Okay.
So maybe,

336
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,720
you know,
hopefully that's a coherent argument.

337
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:45,554
Now the next part of it is kind of 
something interesting that happened in 

338
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:51,870
the late 18 hundreds,
so in the late 18 hundreds,

339
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,500
there were a group of philosophers on 
the east coast of the United States,

340
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,623
uh,
that called themselves pragmatists and 

341
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,900
William James was one of those people 
and William James is of course,

342
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:03,300
regarded as one of the founders of 
modern psychology,

343
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,134
even though he was a,
he wouldn't be allowed on a faculty of 

344
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,080
psychology today because he,
like,

345
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,490
he was like,
he was like the first Hippie,

346
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,324
you know,
in some sense because he liked to 

347
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:17,010
experiment with things like a laughing 
gas,

348
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,920
nitrous oxide,
nitric oxide,

349
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:20,754
you know,
and,

350
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,540
and,
uh,

351
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,930
it's actually quite an intense 
hallucinogen at the appropriate doses.

352
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:25,764
And he wrote like sixties acid freak 
poetry back in 1880 when he was on 

353
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,010
nitrous oxide.

354
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,570
And,
and you know,

355
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:37,770
he was very curious about phenomena,
like religious experience and so forth.

356
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:41,260
So he was very philosophically minded,
psychologist and,

357
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,960
and had some very.
Well,

358
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:44,100
he was brave,
I would say,

359
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:44,934
you know,
which sometimes being weird and being 

360
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:48,240
braver.
The same thing.

361
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,860
He was also unbelievably intelligent and
he had a group of people around them and

362
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,783
including a guy named Charles purse,
who's one of the on one of the West's 

363
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:59,580
greatest,
relatively unknown philosophers.

364
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:00,414
Anyways,
they set up a new field of philosophy 

365
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,660
which is classically regarded as the 
only American philosophy.

366
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,530
And that philosophy was pragmatism.
You know,

367
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:12,700
and when you call someone pragmatic,
you sort of mean well,

368
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:14,330
they're willing to do what works,
you know,

369
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,173
they're concerned with what works.
And that's kind of pragmatism in a 

370
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:20,520
nutshell in some sense,
except it's a lot more sophisticated.

371
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,370
The pragmatist would say,
look,

372
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,863
you've got a problem and the problem is 
you don't know everything and what that 

373
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:33,120
means in some senses that all of your 
knowledge about anything is limited even

374
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:34,800
about the things that you think you know
about.

375
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,830
It's limited.
And so you can never be sure.

376
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,693
You can never be certain that what 
you're dealing with is what you think 

377
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:43,920
you're dealing with or that when you 
deal with it,

378
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,520
what you expect to happen will happen.
And so,

379
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,360
you know,
you might think,

380
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,560
well,
I understand my,

381
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,940
um,
you know,

382
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,400
I understand this can of coke 
sufficiently,

383
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,170
uh,
I can drink it and so on.

384
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:58,560
And so my knowledge is as close to 
absolute as it needs to be,

385
00:19:58,561 --> 00:19:59,394
but you know,
this has aspartame in it and everybody 

386
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,200
thinks aspartame is dangerous,
but it's probably not,

387
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,530
but probably it's not,
you know,

388
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:10,890
and so who knows,
if I drink 100 of these things,

389
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,140
that might be the end of me.
And wouldn't that be stupid?

390
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,333
So the point is,
is that because you're surrounded by a 

391
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,970
cloud of ignorance that you cannot get 
rid of none of your judgments about what

392
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,830
constitutes truth can be final.

393
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,933
And so one of the things that the 
pragmatists we're trying to figure out 

394
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:26,640
as well,
given that,

395
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:30,470
how can you even act because you can't 
compute well.

396
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,250
And this came up again in the 19 sixties
and is really bothered people since then

397
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:36,084
in the guise of the frame problem is you
cannot compute all the consequences of 

398
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:42,570
your actions.
So how can you act?

399
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,690
How can you feel that you have enough 
knowledge to act so well?

400
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,950
It's a very difficult problem.
It's unbelievably difficult problem.

401
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:54,910
It's actually one of the problems that 
has made developing intelligent machines

402
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,744
much more difficult than anyone thought 
it would be because it turns out that 

403
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,833
not only are there an infinite number of
things that could happen as a 

404
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,590
consequence of a given action.
There's also a virtually infinite number

405
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:08,800
of ways to look at a situation to 
perceive it.

406
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,100
We look at a situation and there it is 
and so we just think it's given,

407
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:16,810
but it turns out that that's just 
seriously wrong and the only reason that

408
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:20,350
when we look at the world that it's 
given is because our psyche,

409
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:21,184
our consciousness,
which we still think of as sort of a 

410
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:23,644
soul,
is actually something that is grounded 

411
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:26,914
deeply in the biological processes of 
our body and that all of those 

412
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:31,144
biological processes that were created 
over evolutionary time structure our 

413
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:38,200
perceptions before we even know it and 
just deliver this world to us.

414
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,970
So it looks obvious,
but you know,

415
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:40,804
it took a while.
We've been evolving for like 3 billion 

416
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:43,924
years or something like that,
so it took a lot of tinkering around to 

417
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,820
get this perceptual system to do what it
does,

418
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,163
so okay,
so they're very interested in and how 

419
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,590
you came up with ideas of truth and what
they.

420
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,483
What they settled on.
Roughly speaking is something like 

421
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,570
whenever you can,
whenever you conduct an action,

422
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,853
you set up the criteria for determining 
whether what you're doing is is 

423
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,163
reasonable or factual based on outcome 
that you want to attain and so for the 

424
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:16,054
pragmatists was more like things were 
true enough and so if my goal in 

425
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:25,501
interacting with his coke can is to have
a drink and when I do what I am going to

426
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:28,434
do and I get a drink,
then not sufficiently true and I can go 

427
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,610
onto the next thing.
So,

428
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,593
but it's still tenuous because it leaves
open other questions like should I be 

429
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:38,800
drinking this or something else or you 
know,

430
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,880
whatever.
It leaves open all sorts of questions,

431
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:44,160
but it doesn't matter as far as the 
pragmatists are concerned.

432
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,100
Now,
when Darwin

433
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,830
published his theory,
the pragmatists God on it right away,

434
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,693
they were really interested in Darwinian
theory because they regarded it as a 

435
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:59,680
version of pragmatism,
which is quite cool,

436
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:00,514
and they did this within,
I think within five years of its 

437
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:03,970
publication.
You know what caused credit,

438
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,340
quite disturbed people were sort of 
ready for the theory,

439
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,413
but the pragmatists,
we're really all over it because they 

440
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,054
thought of the mechanism that Darwin 
described to account for evolution as a 

441
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:17,350
pragmatic mechanism.
Now that's an interesting idea.

442
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,500
So think about it this way.
So how much do you need to know?

443
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,290
Well,
from a Darwinian perspective,

444
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,124
there's an answer to that.
You need to know enough so that you can 

445
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:36,560
last long enough to pass your genes to 
the next generation.

446
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,580
That's it.
And the Darwinians would also say,

447
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:41,414
well,
obviously you're knowledge is faulting 

448
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:43,664
incomplete because you know your to 
transmit your genetic material to the 

449
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:50,150
next generation is somewhat limited.
You know,

450
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:52,940
you have limited number of partners,
plus you die,

451
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,420
and the fact that you die indicates that
you as a solution to the problem of,

452
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,200
um,
of maintaining your own life.

453
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,730
And reproducing,
you're like a partial solution,

454
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:08,564
you're a good enough solution you'll do 
for the 30 years or the 35 years or the 

455
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,690
40 years that you're likely to be active
in,

456
00:24:16,691 --> 00:24:17,240
uh,
you know,

457
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,840
in a functionally reproductive sets.
So you're a good enough answer,

458
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,940
but you know,
the Darwinian send,

459
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:23,774
the pragmatists also said something else
or implied something else which is your 

460
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:27,584
good enough.

461
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,670
And also not only is that as good as it 
gets,

462
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,913
it's also as good as it can get.
So they put some really stringent 

463
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,043
restrictions on what would,
what you would regard as a sufficient 

464
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:44,474
solution to a given problem.
And the reason for that was that while 

465
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,640
that your knowledge is limited and that 
things transform unexpectedly,

466
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,150
and so the best thing you could do is 
run along and try to keep up.

467
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,343
And you'll never really do much better 
than that in some sense because things 

468
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,920
are unpredictable and because they 
change in an unpredictable way.

469
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,320
So now the final part of the argument is
this.

470
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:15,130
So then what are we to regard as truth?
Now leave the materialist claims aside.

471
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,053
I'm perfectly willing to say,
and I think it would be ridiculous not 

472
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:23,390
to that that's a form of truth that at 
least is very useful,

473
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,230
so fine.

474
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,880
It's a tool and maybe more than that,
it may.

475
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:29,690
Maybe it is saying something about the 
absolute nature of reality.

476
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,860
I don't care about that.
At least it's a useful tool for us.

477
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:34,694
It's made us more powerful,
but then we have this other problem 

478
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:38,750
which is,
well,

479
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:39,584
what about the nature of the system that
it's embedded in like how do we 

480
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:45,920
determine its utility or how do we 
determine the utility of anything or how

481
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:46,754
do we determine how to act or how do we 
determine what to value and those 

482
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:52,850
questions can be asked using this 
answer,

483
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,750
using the same methodology that science 
uses to answer his questions.

484
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:01,670
Now the consequence of that is what 
needs you described at the end of the 19

485
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:03,470
hundreds as the death of God,
right?

486
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:05,090
There's A.
There's a conflict,

487
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,940
a serious conflict between the claims of
religion,

488
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:12,350
which as far as I'm concerned,
have to do with value and moral morality

489
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,500
and the claims of science which are 
which have to do with material reality.

490
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,710
All right,
so now

491
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:33,190
the tricky part comes in realizing that 
the selection mechanisms that determined

492
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,463
what happens to you in relationship to 
the next generation say are selecting 

493
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:45,180
you on the of your action and your 
behavior.

494
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:48,720
I would say they're selecting you on the
basis of your values,

495
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,093
so because you know if you're a.
If you're an idiot saying you go 

496
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:55,320
charging after a lion and the lion eats 
you,

497
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,920
then the the nature of reality,
so to speak,

498
00:26:58,921 --> 00:26:59,754
is rendered a judgment on the value 
structure that sent you down that 

499
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:03,990
particular path.
Right,

500
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:09,290
and so you're being selected by natural 
forces as a consequence of your behavior

501
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,810
now and then we can extend that 
argument,

502
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:16,500
especially in the human case or in the 
case of any organism that's also subject

503
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,334
to sexual selection and human beings are
tremendously subject to sexual 

504
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:22,200
selection.
Now,

505
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:24,840
Darwin was a great believer in sexual 
selection.

506
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,250
You know,
it was,

507
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,083
he thought it was at least as important 
as the selection of the organism by the 

508
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:32,370
natural environment,
whatever that is.

509
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,683
But you know,
biologists really had a hard time with 

510
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:38,190
that and they kind of ignored sexual 
selection for 100 years,

511
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,024
which is quite a quite interesting.
I think it was partly because sexual 

512
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:42,834
selection implies,
especially when you're dealing with 

513
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,160
organisms that are sort of conscious,
like human beings,

514
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:52,430
that choice itself is a determinant of 
evolutionary processes.

515
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,780
But,
and you know,

516
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,703
the district deterministic materialists 
didn't really like that and they 

517
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:00,420
couldn't really come up with an argument
against it,

518
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:03,240
but they sort of shelved the whole topic
for a very long period of time.

519
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:04,074
But one of the things we know for 
example about human beings is that 

520
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,133
females are very sexually selective 
female humans as opposed to say to 

521
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,184
female chimps which aren't.
And so part of the consequence of that 

522
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:18,660
is that you have twice as many female 
ancestors as you do mail ancestors.

523
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,733
Now there'll be half of you are going to
have a hell of a time figuring out how 

524
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,940
that's possible.
But it is possible.

525
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,863
But it really means is that something 
like the average male who's in your 

526
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:33,870
ancestry had two children,
if he had any,

527
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,210
whereas the average woman had one.
And that'll do the trick right there.

528
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,103
Right now.
I'm not saying those were the exact 

529
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,054
proportions,
but those are the average proportions 

530
00:28:43,351 --> 00:28:46,860
across huge spans of time now.
So,

531
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:47,694
so anyways,
so part of what's occurred to select 

532
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:51,594
human beings for the way they are is the
choices that each gender has made with 

533
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:56,694
regards to action and belief,
but in many ways more specifically 

534
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:04,570
female choices.
So it's kind of an interesting.

535
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,480
The next time you were irritated at your
boyfriend,

536
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:07,314
let's say,
then you can just remember that you 

537
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,580
know,
untold millions of women have chosen men

538
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:13,200
so that they're exactly like he is.

539
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,250
And so,
you know,

540
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,730
you can't really blame them for that.
So all right,

541
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:18,130
so,
but,

542
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,963
but here,
here's the thing that's tricky from a 

543
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,200
scientific perspective,
a,

544
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,940
if it is your behavior and your value 
structures,

545
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,150
if your value structures determine what 
you're interested in,

546
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:35,151
how you behave and selection pressure 
occurs as a consequence of your actions,

547
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,613
then doesn't it mean that the structure 
of the value systems that your behavior 

548
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,250
have to be regarded as true or real in 
some scientific sense because the Darwin

549
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,110
is basically say,
look,

550
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,800
the best solution is the solution that 
you embodied.

551
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:58,480
There is no higher solution than that 
and there you are embodying a solution.

552
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,314
So in what way?
I don't understand in what way that 

553
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,050
can't be regarded as real,
you know,

554
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,890
because people think of things like 
value structures as EPA,

555
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:08,170
phenomenal.
You know,

556
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:11,290
they're not real like,
like material is real,

557
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,490
but I don't get that.

558
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,383
I don't see how that works with 
Darwinian thinking because you're 

559
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:17,224
interacting with each other all the time
and you're doing that on the basis of 

560
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:22,540
your capacity for action and the value 
systems that drive that.

561
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,280
And obviously those have some effect on 
whether or not you're selected by women.

562
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:30,490
Say or by men for that matter,
but also by the natural world,

563
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,743
so it looks like it looks to me at least
you can make a case that the deep value 

564
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,970
structures that drive us,
that are deep,

565
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,570
deep parts of our psyche and I'll,
I'll try to also demonstrate to you that

566
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:44,404
those exist beyond question.
I already think that question is 

567
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:48,530
answered,
but you know,

568
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,520
there's no blank slate theorists left,
right?

569
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:55,810
Everybody knows that you come into the 
world with an a priori structure.

570
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,120
It's like that a prior restructure was 
selected.

571
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,810
So in what way is it not true?

572
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,981
I could say,
well,

573
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:05,020
it's as true as it gets.
Well,

574
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:07,870
it's not true like a materialist idea,
but that's okay.

575
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:10,000
You don't have to have.
First of all,

576
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,834
I don't think the materialist ideas of 
truth are the most fundamental ideas 

577
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:17,740
because as I said,
in order for that truth to be relevant,

578
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,870
it has to be grounded in the value 
system.

579
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:23,470
And so there's a value system outside of
science that science serves.

580
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,730
Otherwise we'd be completely.
It would be insane for us to pursue it,

581
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:28,564
you know,
if we knew that science was going to 

582
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:33,490
lead to the demise of everyone on earth,
which it could,

583
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,223
you wouldn't be motivated to pursue it 
if you knew that science was just going 

584
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:40,410
to increase your suffering.
If you're a scientist.

585
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:41,244
It's like,
why don't you stop doing it if you had 

586
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,290
any sense.
So,

587
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,940
so then I would say,
well,

588
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:49,540
we pursue materialists truths for 
reasons that are known.

589
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:53,530
Materialist and those reasons are just 
as real as the materialist truth,

590
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:55,120
but there are different kinds of.
True.

591
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,070
They're a seriously different kinds of 
truth

592
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,510
changes over time.

593
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,770
Good question.
You know,

594
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,770
I would say I would say they change at 
least to some degree,

595
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,000
you know,
because you know,

596
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,853
I don't know what values you share with 
the primate who was your ancestor and 

597
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:28,160
the ancestor of chimpanzees.
But I would say there's a,

598
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,710
there's no shortage of similarities.
You know,

599
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,670
I mean,
first of all,

600
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:35,070
we can understand chimps,
you know,

601
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:37,890
more or less.
We can understand dogs,

602
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,753
we can understand cats.
My daughter had lizards and the more 

603
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:43,850
social lizards there are social lizards 
by the way,

604
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,370
you can kind of understand the social 
lizard,

605
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,340
you know,
so we certainly understand all mammals.

606
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,293
Um,
and then there are other animals that 

607
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:54,434
are,
that we have deviated from at far 

608
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:01,034
greater spans of time.
I liked the example of crustaceans 

609
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:05,744
because I happen to know a little bit 
about lobsters for reasons that were in 

610
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,670
my reading,
took me in a random direction,

611
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:11,504
but like lobsters,
lobsters organized themselves into 

612
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:14,774
dominance hierarchies and we understand 
dominance hierarchies and even more 

613
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:19,394
strangely,
the biochemical systems that the 

614
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:23,474
lobsters use to track their dominance 
hierarchies and to determine how 

615
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:28,604
confident they should be or how 
submissive are serotonergic and so are 

616
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:35,900
the systems we use to track dominance 
hierarchies.

617
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,943
And the similarity is so great that you 
can actually use antidepressants on 

618
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,334
lobsters.
So if you inject the lobster with 

619
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:44,600
Serotonin,
I don't know the precise procedure,

620
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:49,370
but generally if a lobster has lost a 
fight and he liked zooms into his little

621
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:53,420
lobster place and like pouts for at 
least 20 minutes,

622
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:56,190
he won't fight with anyone else during 
that period of time.

623
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:58,550
And when he comes out,
he's like a smaller lobster,

624
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:00,710
you know,
because he sort of determines how big to

625
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:03,590
be on the basis of the ratio of 
victories.

626
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:07,340
Two defeats and the mechanism that 
adjusts his posture,

627
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,413
the successful lobster gets,
takes up more and more space because he 

628
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:11,330
says,
I'm,

629
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,340
I'm,
I'm as big as I think I am.

630
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:14,174
And that's based on my success in battle
that Sarah to energetically mediated as 

631
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:18,700
well.
You know.

632
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,230
And so when you see a human being,
it's like this,

633
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,560
you know,
taking up as little space as possible.

634
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,393
You can think,
well there's a defeated lobster because 

635
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:27,704
it's exactly the same mechanisms and 
they're really fundamental in human 

636
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:32,990
beings and you can't really change them.
You know,

637
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,960
like the way your brain computes your 
dominance effects,

638
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:40,910
how much positive emotion you have and 
how much negative emotion.

639
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:41,744
And if you're way the hell down in the 
dominance hierarchy or you feel that 

640
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:48,380
way,
then you're going to experience way more

641
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:49,214
negative emotion because your nervous 
system has calculated that the 

642
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:54,920
environment on average is very dangerous
to you,

643
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,773
[inaudible] you're barely clinging to 
the edge of reality and you're going to 

644
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:01,640
experience very little positive emotion 
because well,

645
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,980
things don't look that good for you.
And so,

646
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,023
you know,
those aren't really systems you can 

647
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:07,420
control their,
their,

648
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,900
their like master operating systems that
sit at the base of your brain,

649
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,790
you know.
And so you say,

650
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,710
well,
do things change across time?

651
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,790
It's like,
yes,

652
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:21,791
but they change within constraints that 
don't change much across time.

653
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,863
So for example,
I think there's probably as much it's 

654
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,374
reasonable to assume that there's as 
much conservation of value as there is 

655
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:37,361
con as there is a retention of skeletal 
structure,

656
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,560
you know,
and I went at least that much.

657
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,090
There's,
I think there's actually more,

658
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:43,800
but certainly there's at least that 
much.

659
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,873
I went to the Smithsonian at one point,
I think it was the Smithsonian in 

660
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:48,450
Washington.
And they have a,

661
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,723
they have a display of a mammalian 
skeletons in there that's extremely 

662
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,014
extensive.
So it's everything from little batch to 

663
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:57,294
Wales and you know,
it's really interesting to walk through 

664
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:02,880
that because what you see is that 
everything's basically a bat,

665
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,180
you know,
the bats look exactly like us skeletally

666
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,190
except their fingers are way longer.
And you know,

667
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:13,191
there's all that's happened is that 
there are transformations of size in the

668
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:14,880
basic skeletal structure.

669
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,690
The structure itself is virtually 
identical across mammals,

670
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,033
you know,
and so in evolution is a conservative 

671
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,111
process,
right?

672
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:26,040
It just doesn't go zipping off and some 
completely random direction.

673
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,383
And so I would say also the way to think
about it is that there are levels of 

674
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:30,834
stability in the evolutionary process 
and some domains are extremely stable 

675
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:36,264
across time and one of them happens to 
be the existence of a dominance 

676
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:42,420
hierarchy.
It's at least 400 million years old.

677
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,390
And that's old.
It's older than trees.

678
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,020
So if you're trying to think about 
what's actually real,

679
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,183
you know,
you can't see a dominance hierarchy and 

680
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:55,080
you can't taste it or touch it or 
sensitive in any real way,

681
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,153
but dominance hierarchies are more real 
than almost anything that you ever come 

682
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:59,184
across there.
They're probably not quite as real as 

683
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:03,060
rocks,
but they're,

684
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:07,560
they're real enough so that both you and
lobsters organize yourself into them and

685
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:08,394
understand them.

686
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,430
And so,
so yes,

687
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:12,390
there's change,
but there's,

688
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,373
it's changed within constraints.
And I think maybe one of the ways to 

689
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:17,490
understand that it's,
it's,

690
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,030
it's something like the variation in 
languages,

691
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,180
you know,
our language is the same or different.

692
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,660
Well,
depends on your level of analysis.

693
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,763
There are levels of analysis at which 
the commonalities are what's most 

694
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,700
manifest and their levels of analysis 
where the differences are most manifest.

695
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,743
But I like to think about it as a 
hierarchy and there's fundamental 

696
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:43,560
elements at the base of the hierarchy 
and they don't change their,

697
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,953
you know,
life made a bet 400 million years ago 

698
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:51,270
and it was one of those bets that's just
not going to change.

699
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,283
The dominance hierarchy is something 
that's going to feature a lot in our 

700
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:59,211
conversations because it's such a stable
element of the environment that it's one

701
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:02,334
of the fund,
its existence and its nature is one of 

702
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:06,444
the fundamental presumptions of our 
being and so there it's extremely 

703
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:10,710
important.

704
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,980
So for example,
one of the things that women do with men

705
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,233
and men do it with women as well,
but they use different criteria is men 

706
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,583
are very competitive in a certain manner
and the women assume that the guys who 

707
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:24,744
win are the better men and they just 
peel them from the top and so the 

708
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:27,954
dominance hierarchy and part female 
selection is one of the things that 

709
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:34,710
determines whether male genes have a 
particular type go into the future,

710
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,763
but so is the structure of the dominance
hierarchy because if you're at the 

711
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:39,040
bottom of it,
I mean,

712
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,110
good luck finding a partner.
It's very,

713
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,450
very unlikely unless it's random and 
impulsive,

714
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,030
so or involuntary.

715
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:51,910
So yes.
[inaudible].

716
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,283
I don't know what to say about that.
Actually you don't because I think that 

717
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,250
they both ground out in true and that 
that grounds out in,

718
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,703
in,
in the Darwinian theory that's at the 

719
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:13,420
bottom.
So because the question is,

720
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:15,460
for example,
I think is,

721
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:19,620
look,
let,

722
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,490
let me put it this way,
and you can see he see what you think of

723
00:39:22,491 --> 00:39:24,080
this.
So here's a claim.

724
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,933
Our theory about the atomic substructure
of material entities is sufficiently 

725
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:34,740
accurate so that we can make 
thermonuclear bombs,

726
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,993
right?
Everybody agrees with that because 

727
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,610
they're,
they are thermonuclear bombs.

728
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:40,883
Here's a counter proposition.
Our theory about the substructure of 

729
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:49,110
reality is so flawed that we will make 
thermonuclear bombs.

730
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,990
Now you see now.
So you think,

731
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:54,090
well yeah,
that's not a bad proposition either.

732
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,370
So how can both of those be true?
Well,

733
00:39:56,371 --> 00:39:57,204
here's what it looks to me is like,
you know that when you parse an entity 

734
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:06,870
out of its context,
you lose something of the entity.

735
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,900
Now this is something that really 
plagues psychologist,

736
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:10,910
right?
Because psychologists,

737
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:14,280
so you know,
maybe you'll go up to someone and say,

738
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,070
I was angry today and the person says,
well,

739
00:40:17,071 --> 00:40:17,904
why were you angry?
And then you have a little discussion 

740
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,124
about why you're angry and you never 
really worry about whether the person 

741
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,693
understands what you mean by angry 
because you assume that they've been 

742
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:29,160
angry before and so have you,
so you share that,

743
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:29,994
but also you also assume that the 
context of the conversation defines the 

744
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,213
ambivalence of the word sufficiently in 
that time in place so that it has an 

745
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,170
actual meaning.

746
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,783
That's the context.
You know the person hypothetically 

747
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:47,370
because they wouldn't be telling you 
that otherwise you know other people.

748
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,700
You understand the language so that when
the word angry emerges that someone just

749
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,530
doesn't come up and go angry.
You know they,

750
00:40:55,531 --> 00:41:00,531
they put it in a story and so the 
meaning of the word angry is confined by

751
00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:01,734
the story that's constructed around the 
word and that's confined by your 

752
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:07,470
relationship and the relationship is 
confined by the culture that you're in.

753
00:41:07,471 --> 00:41:08,304
And so there's lots of levels of 
analysis that are going on 

754
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:11,394
simultaneously for you to be able to 
understand what the person means when 

755
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,204
they talk about being angry.
Now a psychologist to come along and 

756
00:41:16,981 --> 00:41:17,814
say,
oh,

757
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,100
anger is a thing,
you know,

758
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,970
pull it out of its context and then 
treat it like it's a material entity and

759
00:41:23,971 --> 00:41:25,500
actually that doesn't work very well.
I mean,

760
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:26,334
there's lots of things that people 
discuss in the context of multilevel 

761
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:33,590
language that you can't just pull out as
entity.

762
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:39,010
Now with regards to our understanding of
the subatomic realm,

763
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,000
well the problem is is that we're 
parsing out,

764
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,950
we're parsing out from a very complex 
reality,

765
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,143
a particular form of perception.
Now it's a very powerful form of 

766
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,150
perceptions,
the form of perception that allows us to

767
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,550
mess about with things at the subatomic 
level,

768
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,593
but while we're doing that,
there's a lot of things that those 

769
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:05,270
particles are associated with that we're
ignoring.

770
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,580
So we narrow our knowledge in some sense
by decontextualizing the phenomena,

771
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,640
and then we can do things like make atom
bombs.

772
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,773
But the question is,
is that what makes you think that the 

773
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:22,850
process of decontextualization produces 
an outcome?

774
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:23,990
That's true?

775
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,820
Now you could say pragmatically,
well,

776
00:42:27,821 --> 00:42:29,480
it's true enough to make atom bombs 
like,

777
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:30,314
yeah,
okay,

778
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,660
but it's not true enough.
Not to make them,

779
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,440
so it's tricky.
It's tricky.

780
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,970
Yeah.
Well that's the next thing.

781
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,340
That's the next thing I want to know 
that I want to get to.

782
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,290
That's actually why I have this little 
diagram up there,

783
00:42:58,291 --> 00:42:59,124
so I'm going to do that now.
So now I'm going to offer you a 

784
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:06,270
proposition and it's like a core.
I'll get to you right away.

785
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,710
How is it?
It's a core proposition.

786
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:10,343
We tend to think that our knowledge 
structures are made out of facts and 

787
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,464
that factor about the material world and
I would say that's not very true and 

788
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,870
it's partly because who the hell cares 
about facts?

789
00:43:21,871 --> 00:43:24,870
Most of the time they just lie there and
they're not good for anything so.

790
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,020
But more importantly,
it can't be right.

791
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:30,120
It can't be right for a variety of 
reasons.

792
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,510
First of all,
the scientific endeavor is only about,

793
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,080
let's say 500 years old formally.
Now you could stretch it back.

794
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,790
Maybe you can stretch it back to the 
Greeks.

795
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:40,830
You know,
if you want to look at precursors,

796
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:42,210
but it's still,
who cares?

797
00:43:42,211 --> 00:43:44,010
It's 2000 years there,
3000 years,

798
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:47,940
whatever.
It's like compared to 400 million years,

799
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:50,910
that's it's nothing.
It's like dust on a.

800
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,220
it's like dust on a cliff.
It's nothing.

801
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,620
Now.
We were doing perfectly well without the

802
00:43:55,621 --> 00:44:00,030
theory beforehand and so to animals and 
so you know what?

803
00:44:00,031 --> 00:44:04,860
That you can define,
decide for yourself what that indicates,

804
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,130
but it does indicate that you can.

805
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,890
You can exist in a manner that fulfills 
the dark Darwinian ricart requirements,

806
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:14,724
perfectly fine without ever formalizing 
a theory about the nature of material 

807
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:19,080
reality,
so fine.

808
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:23,580
Now the next thing is your nervous 
system isn't built

809
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,033
to to view the world through a cognitive
framework that's composed of empirical 

810
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:33,030
facts obviously,
because we've only been doing that for a

811
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,863
few hundred years.
Chimps aren't doing that and you're 

812
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:36,960
mostly chimp,
you know,

813
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:38,620
I mean,
I don't know what the similarity is.

814
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:41,340
It's like 90,
99 point nine at the genetic level.

815
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,600
It's really,
really high.

816
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,080
So it's not like the dissimilarities are
unimportant,

817
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:50,070
but there's a lot of you that's chimp.
There's a lot of you that's mammal.

818
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,160
There's a good chunk of you that's like 
a crustacean.

819
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:53,994
So you know,
obviously none of those entities are 

820
00:44:56,491 --> 00:45:00,960
predicating their action in the world or
their knowledge of the world on material

821
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:01,681
theories.
Okay,

822
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:03,420
so then the question might be,
well,

823
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,300
what are the nature of your theories of 
the world?

824
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:07,134
And that's where you get into the 
distinction between motivational 

825
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:13,800
significance and value and material 
reality.

826
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:18,300
And I would say that you're the the 
cognitive structures that use,

827
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,193
they're not just cognitive,
it's actually your personality because 

828
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:26,940
the personality is far more than it than
a cognitive structure.

829
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:31,800
Your personality is how you act.
So that's how you act out ideas,

830
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:32,634
right?
Actually how you move your body through 

831
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:34,764
time and space.
It's how you perceive because you don't 

832
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:38,064
perceive everything.
You perceive a very limited subset of 

833
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,154
things and there are processes that are 
associated with your personality that 

834
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:48,180
determined what that subset is.
It determines how you value things.

835
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,150
It determines how you respond to them 
emotionally.

836
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:56,270
And then it sets the boundaries for the 
contents of your cognitive knowledge.

837
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,100
So I would think of that as a 
personality.

838
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,090
And what's the personality up to?
Well,

839
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,020
it's trying to orient itself in the 
world.

840
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,363
It's trying to figure out how to act in 
the world and I would say that's our 

841
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:10,884
fundamental problem.
Our fundamental problem isn't what are 

842
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:14,904
things made of.
Although I'm not saying that's not a 

843
00:46:16,471 --> 00:46:17,730
problem,
it's a problem,

844
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:18,803
but it's not the fundamental problem.
The fundamental problem is what to do 

845
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:27,810
about what things are made of.
It's like where to go now and you know,

846
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:29,910
that's an existentialist claim in some 
sense.

847
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:31,140
It's like,
well,

848
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,160
what's the meaning of your life?
What's the purpose of your life?

849
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,383
You know?
And we shouldn't be using materialists 

850
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:43,920
theories to address such questions,
but we do and it's cost us a lot.

851
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,630
So.
Yep.

852
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,863
Really

853
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,670
well that,
that's exactly what I want to talk about

854
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:58,170
next.
Is it a problem?

855
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,150
Okay.
So Yup.

856
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,503
System of values is,
it's somehow hijacked our motivational 

857
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,550
system without being connected,
but that sounds really.

858
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,300
Well,
it couldn't be true.

859
00:47:20,301 --> 00:47:23,400
I mean if it turns out that the 
scientific endeavor dooms us,

860
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:28,070
which it might,
then you could certainly make that case.

861
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:29,143
You'd have to make it post hoc though 
when you won't be able to because there 

862
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,650
won't be anybody around.
But you know,

863
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:35,980
what is that like the idea that science 
is a valuable enterprise is a,

864
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,810
it's a theory,
you know,

865
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:39,490
and it's,
you know,

866
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:42,550
it's 50 slash 50 and you know,
if people,

867
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,420
maybe not,
but it's,

868
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,080
there's definitely room for dispute 
dispute.

869
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:47,914
I don't think we would see the massive 
emergence of phenomena like the 

870
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,784
environmental movement if there wasn't 
part of the human psyche that was very 

871
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:58,870
much worried about untrammeled 
technological progress.

872
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,720
Now you know,
it's like hey,

873
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,393
we should also be equally worried about 
not like no technological process 

874
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,820
progress.
We're basically screwed either way.

875
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,050
So,
so,

876
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:13,690
but that's in some sense beside the 
point.

877
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:14,583
Okay.
So the reason I got into the ideas that 

878
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:23,350
I'm describing to you,
it's quite straightforward now.

879
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:24,130
It's,
it's,

880
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,180
I can't really use the story that I used
to use to,

881
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:32,340
to frame why I'm telling you what I'm 
telling you because when I develop these

882
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:35,620
ideas and I'm been working on them for 
30 years,

883
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:36,843
my primary motivation was to understand 
what insanity was driving the Cold War 

884
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
because.
And so I started working on these things

885
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:46,834
probably in about 1982,
although I'd been thinking about things 

886
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:53,971
like that far longer than that and I 
don't know what it's like for you people

887
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:56,460
as young people I know you're worried 
about the environment and,

888
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,550
but when I was young,
younger,

889
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,780
young,
everyone I knew was very,

890
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:05,614
very obsessed with the idea that there 
was likely going to be a thermonuclear 

891
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:12,970
war and we didn't assume that it was 
certain,

892
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:16,360
but we certainly assumed that it was a 
high,

893
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,240
it was highly probable,
you know,

894
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,050
when things came pretty damn close.

895
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,430
So I'll tell you a story.
So one time,

896
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,020
about 10 years ago,
I went to Arizona and,

897
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:32,500
uh,
I went to see a Patriot missile site.

898
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,150
And the Patriot missiles were the early 
intercontinental ballistic missiles.

899
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,110
Now a ballistic missile is an 
interesting entity because,

900
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,060
you know,
if you think about something like a,

901
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,360
what do they call those cruise missiles?
Cruise missiles,

902
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:49,420
it's like a robot.
You can tell that thing where to go,

903
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,260
you know,
it's sort of,

904
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,093
it's got enough intelligence.
So if you don't want it to land there 

905
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,333
and you've launched it,
then you can have it land somewhere 

906
00:49:57,101 --> 00:49:57,934
else.
But an intercontinental ballistic 

907
00:49:58,661 --> 00:49:59,520
missile.
It's no,

908
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:00,280
no,
no,

909
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,250
it's a rifle.
You point and you pull the trigger at 20

910
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:04,084
minutes later that thing has blown up a 
city and there's no calling it back and 

911
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,850
there was no diverting it and you know.

912
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,510
So I went to the missile site and those 
things were huge.

913
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,210
They were like major rockets.
The launch tube,

914
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,910
because they were underground would have
been much,

915
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:23,140
much broader in diameter.
Then this room,

916
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:27,830
like it was a major league thing because
it would zip up into space and land back

917
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:29,600
on the other side of the world in 20 
minutes.

918
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:32,990
It's like those things are cruising 
seven miles a second.

919
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:33,824
They're moving.
So when some of them had multiple 

920
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:38,240
warheads,
so they'd get over to the Soviet Union,

921
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:39,074
let's say.
Then they break apart into multiple 

922
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,070
nuclear warheads and you know,
they were,

923
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,530
they were nasty.
And the forest in those things,

924
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:48,920
there's still lots of them around.
Was made Hiroshima,

925
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,330
looked like a pop gun.
I mean,

926
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:51,980
people built,
you know,

927
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,320
I don't know if you know this about a 
hydrogen bomb,

928
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,233
so a hydrogen bomb has the same 
mechanisms that the son uses to produce 

929
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:01,064
heat.

930
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,740
Okay.
Whereas if your standard at Tomic bomb,

931
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,650
it's,
it's low grade in terms of evolution,

932
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:07,723
in terms of energy transformation,
a hydrogen bomb is so powerful that it 

933
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:16,360
uses an atom bomb as it's trigger.
So you'd like.

934
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,950
It's a whole new scale of,
of destructive magnitude.

935
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:22,700
And there was like at that point we'll 
say 1982,

936
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:25,280
there is tens of thousands of these 
things.

937
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:27,010
Twenty 5,000
on the Russian side,

938
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,760
maybe $50,000
on the American side.

939
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:29,594
And they're like,
everybody had it pretty itchy trigger 

940
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,450
trigger finger,
you know,

941
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:35,540
Reagan was in power and he was in many 
ways,

942
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:36,980
right about the Soviets,
you know,

943
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:40,610
they were an evil empire but,
and he scared the hell out of them.

944
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:45,410
But um,
but it was touch and go and anyway,

945
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:46,244
so we're back in this old missile base 
and so roadside looking at it and 

946
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,470
there's a nose cone for one of these 
things that sort of lay in there in the,

947
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,393
in the desert.

948
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,443
And so that was kind of an eerie thing.
So it was about this high and probably 

949
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:03,380
about 12 feet in diameter and it was 
made out of plastic about that thick.

950
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,840
It was sort of variegated plastic a 
little bit clearer.

951
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,913
That was the thing that would melt off 
when the missile reentered the 

952
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:10,580
atmosphere.
So it was like,

953
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:11,743
you know,
it was a,

954
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,663
it was a weird artifact.
You couldn't just stand beside that 

955
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:18,740
thing and you know,
think neutral thoughts.

956
00:52:18,741 --> 00:52:19,491
It was like,
hmm,

957
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:21,110
that's a,
that's a wicked thing.

958
00:52:21,111 --> 00:52:24,800
So then we went underground and it was 
very bizarre.

959
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:25,634
It was surreal because the first thing 
we pass through was like this museum 

960
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,423
front because it was a museum and it was
sort of like your grandmother's nuclear 

961
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:38,630
missile site because it was staffed by 
volunteers,

962
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:39,464
seniors and you know,
there was a little guest book that you 

963
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:42,230
could sign.

964
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,420
It was sort of pine panels and it was 
like,

965
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,330
you know,
southern Americans are pretty hospitable

966
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,910
so there are sort of happy to see you.
And it was like,

967
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,543
like I said,
it was like your grandmother's nuclear 

968
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:55,580
missiles silos.
So that was bloody weird.

969
00:52:55,581 --> 00:53:00,230
And then all around the outside of the,
on the walls of the museum,

970
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:03,200
there were pictures of Reagan basically 
and you know,

971
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,290
interacting with various people,
including people from the Soviet Union.

972
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,124
So it was quite weird because it was a 
time of war because there I was in like 

973
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,970
1982 and then in my grandmother's 
nuclear missile silo.

974
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:16,820
And then we went into the silo itself 
which was quite deep underground.

975
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:17,683
And so first of all,
you go through this massive door that 

976
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,960
looks like a safe door except the state.
The safe is on steroids.

977
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:24,794
It's like 12 feet high and this thick 
and it's made out of steel and it's 

978
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,480
painted that kind of pastel green that 
everybody was really excited about 1957.

979
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,100
And so the whole missile site is like 
that.

980
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:35,934
It's like,
Oh,

981
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,740
here I am in like 19,
19,

982
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:38,574
57 world destroying technology.
So I moved from the say 2005 until the 

983
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:49,050
year 1982 and then I'm in 1957 and it's 
like star trek down there,

984
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,310
you know.
So,

985
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:51,983
so,
uh,

986
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,380
we go into the main control room after 
seeing the silo,

987
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:57,660
which is now empty.
We go into the main control room,

988
00:53:57,661 --> 00:54:00,240
I think it's 35 feet underground or 
something like that,

989
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:02,220
which is basically far enough under 
ground.

990
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:07,221
So it would be protected from a nuclear 
blast that wasn't a direct hit know dirt

991
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:10,500
has a really good shield against 
explosions as it turns out.

992
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,420
Um,
anyway,

993
00:54:12,421 --> 00:54:13,254
so we're down there and one of the 
control tables is over there and it 

994
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:18,090
looks like the Star Trek,
you know,

995
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,610
control module,
except it's 1957.

996
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:22,440
So everything switches and so forth.

997
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,630
And you know,
the technology is kind of rough and um,

998
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,633
there's another control,
there's another control desk here and 

999
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:29,821
they say,
well,

1000
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:32,820
would you like to go through a simulated
missile launch?

1001
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:36,090
And you know,
of course that was definitely my idea of

1002
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:37,500
a good time.
So,

1003
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,380
so they showed us what their protection 
laws.

1004
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:41,214
And so what happened was there's like a 
little place on that side and there's a 

1005
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:44,484
little place on that side and there's a 
key and I believe that the people who 

1006
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:49,890
had the keys wore them around their 
necks,

1007
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:51,900
although that might not be right,
they may have been stored,

1008
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:53,550
but I think they wore them around their 
necks.

1009
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,633
Makes Sense,
right?

1010
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,230
Because that's really high security.
We're in the key around your neck.

1011
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,050
And so the deal was if you wanted to 
launch a missile,

1012
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,063
that person a was over there with their 
key and person b was over there with 

1013
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,850
therapy because you needed two people to
launch the missile and then you both put

1014
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:09,684
your keys in at the same time and then 
you turn them and you held them for 10 

1015
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:17,190
seconds and then,
and then bang,

1016
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,113
right?

1017
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,030
God only knows what happens next.
And so then they said,

1018
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,390
someone said,
how close did you get?

1019
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,160
And they said,
well,

1020
00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:31,161
the keys were in the law at one point.
Now they wouldn't tell us when,

1021
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,810
but we knew when it was during the Cuban
missile crisis.

1022
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:35,603
So.
And there are other times where that 

1023
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:38,580
happened as well.
That wasn't the only time,

1024
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:40,980
but you know,
it was good enough time.

1025
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:42,720
It was.
So,

1026
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:44,790
uh.
Anyways,

1027
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:48,000
so back when I was your age,
roughly speaking,

1028
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,493
you know,
this,

1029
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,350
the world was locked in this dispute and
it was no joke,

1030
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:53,184
you know,
it was,

1031
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,683
it wasn't that long since the Soviets 
went into Czechoslovakia and it wasn't 

1032
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:57,714
that long since they went into Hungary 
and it was only 40 years after the 

1033
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:03,360
second world war.
And it was tense.

1034
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,570
It was tense.
And lots of people I knew,

1035
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,670
maybe they've,
you know,

1036
00:56:08,671 --> 00:56:11,820
maybe it was just justification for 
their own psychological nihilism,

1037
00:56:11,821 --> 00:56:12,654
but they had a hard time being concerned
about their futures because they really 

1038
00:56:15,391 --> 00:56:16,560
didn't think they were going to have 
any.

1039
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:20,610
And so it was always a heavy Paul that 
was over everyone's spirits.

1040
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:21,444
And what it really didn't peak again in 
about 1982 under Reagan and there was a 

1041
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:29,050
whole bunch of movies made at that time 
about nuclear destruction,

1042
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:29,884
including one called the day after,
which you may have watched or may not 

1043
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:36,430
have,
but more people watched that than any TV

1044
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:39,520
movie ever made at that point.
And you know,

1045
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:43,210
it was pretty dismal man.
It was like there's the city and Poof,

1046
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:46,510
there's a nuclear bomb and everyone's 
wandering around ruined.

1047
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,493
And that was sort of the movie.
And Reagan actually said weirdly enough 

1048
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:55,270
that that movie actually motivated him 
to enter into more negotiations with the

1049
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:56,470
Soviet.
So you know,

1050
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:57,304
you,
you might have thought he would have 

1051
00:56:57,641 --> 00:56:59,830
thought that through before,
but you know,

1052
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,693
he was an actor.
And so I guess the movie was enough to 

1053
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:03,064
convince him,
but,

1054
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:05,050
but anyway,
so everyone was,

1055
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:05,884
you know,
we were carrying this around on our 

1056
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:08,710
backs in some sense.

1057
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:12,970
And I was obsessed by it for one reason 
or another.

1058
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:17,860
I had nuclear nightmares on a regular 
basis and God only knows why that was.

1059
00:57:17,861 --> 00:57:18,694
You know,
who knows why you get obsessed with 

1060
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:20,584
something.
But,

1061
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:21,220
you know,
I was,

1062
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,053
I'd already always been interested in 
belief systems and what they motivated 

1063
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:26,710
people to do.
So when I was really young,

1064
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:27,544
I was 13,
we had a dentist in our town way the 

1065
00:57:30,221 --> 00:57:32,950
hell up in northern Alberta,
and he had a tattoo on his arm,

1066
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:34,060
you know,
and he was,

1067
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,040
maybe there were two Jewish people in 
our town,

1068
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,650
may never really even occurred to me 
that he was Jewish.

1069
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:40,780
So it's not a lot of Jewish people in 
Alberta.

1070
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:42,260
But anyways,
you know,

1071
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,330
that was Kinda,
I was kinda curious about that in a sort

1072
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:48,370
of small town sort of way.
And um,

1073
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,653
I also did a project when I was in 
junior high about the Holocaust and I 

1074
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:53,540
got pretty interested in that,
you know,

1075
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,393
and part of I was interested in why,
why in the world would people do such 

1076
00:57:58,631 --> 00:57:59,464
things,
you know,

1077
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,610
protecting their belief systems.

1078
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,443
So let's say that's the Nazis,
but then they were committing these 

1079
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:05,254
atrocities that were just,
they are the worst things that human 

1080
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:09,634
beings could imagine.
That's the right way to conceptualize 

1081
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:11,780
them.
So you know,

1082
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,400
you sit in a dark basement with spiders 
on your head for two or three years,

1083
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:16,234
dreaming up,
miserable things to do and then come up 

1084
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:18,904
with a most miserable thing you can 
possibly imagine and then multiply that 

1085
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:25,540
by 100 and have people do that.
That's sort of what was happening in the

1086
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,673
concentration camps and you know,
and there were places on earth during 

1087
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:32,920
the Second World War that were worse 
than the concentration camps.

1088
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:35,260
And if you want to read about those,
you can read about,

1089
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,393
I think it's unit 52,
it was a Japanese medical experimental 

1090
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:39,880
unit who,
Oh,

1091
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,180
I would recommend that you don't read 
that because you'll read things,

1092
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:44,890
you'll never get them out of your mind.

1093
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,230
So.
So that was,

1094
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:49,840
I was very curious about that.
It's like what the hell?

1095
00:58:49,841 --> 00:58:50,674
Here we are arming ourselves to blow 
each other up and maybe the whole 

1096
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:55,510
planet.
And it seems somewhat counterproductive.

1097
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:56,344
You know,
even if you're a communist or 

1098
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,083
capitalist,
it's like being communist king of a 

1099
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:03,730
burned out.
Cinders seems to be a bad outcome,

1100
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:06,400
especially when you're suffering from 
radiation sickness and everyone,

1101
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,020
you know,
his dad and you know,

1102
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:08,854
you could say thing about.
Same thing about the capitalist end of 

1103
00:59:10,691 --> 00:59:12,550
things and then I also was curious.
He's like,

1104
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,660
well,
why is this war of ideas occurring?

1105
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:19,240
And it burst out into real war is a lot,
right?

1106
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:22,910
Why is it occurring?
Some of it's still going on.

1107
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,073
We're still.
The Americans are still at war with 

1108
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:26,570
North Korea,
right?

1109
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:27,404
They never did sign a peace treaty and 
the North Korean state that rather 

1110
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:30,644
seriously.

1111
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,340
So there was the issue of well what the 
hell?

1112
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:35,174
Why are we arming ourselves with these 
horrible weapons that are more than 

1113
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:39,254
sufficient to blow up our enemies 
multiple times and would maybe take the 

1114
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,880
whole planet with them.
That seems rather insane.

1115
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:44,923
And then the other issue was,
well we do have two belief systems 

1116
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:49,250
operating here.
They're,

1117
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,750
they're really not the same.
You know,

1118
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:55,580
like the presuppositions of communism 
and the presuppositions of the West,

1119
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:56,414
we're not the same.
They were seriously different at the 

1120
00:59:58,911 --> 01:00:02,420
level of like constitutional assumption 
way down deep.

1121
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,800
And so,
you know,

1122
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:04,634
another question and emerged from that 
was why a system at all and then how do 

1123
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:15,680
you determine the validity of one system
compared to another.

1124
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,540
It's a big problem even now,
right?

1125
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:19,850
We have culture wars going on and all 
sorts of ways,

1126
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:20,684
you know,
radical Islam against the West for 

1127
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:23,024
example.

1128
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:23,953
Um,
is there any way of sort of getting a 

1129
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:30,920
handle on what these systems are,
what differences in the mean,

1130
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:31,993
why they motivate people to do atrocious
things as well as defending their own 

1131
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:37,701
territory,
which,

1132
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:38,100
you know,
is,

1133
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:42,320
is an understandable thing.
And so generally for me it was like,

1134
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,490
what the Hell is going on?
What,

1135
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:47,270
what is happening here?
So I don't know,

1136
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,163
you know,
I was going to university and I want it 

1137
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:51,950
to continue.
And so that was a pretty good problem.

1138
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:55,370
And I studied political science and 
English literature for,

1139
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,920
for the first part of my university 
career.

1140
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:01,970
And then the political scientists kept.
They were basically Marxists as clueless

1141
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:04,100
as you can possibly get.
And they,

1142
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,213
you know,
they basically propose that the reason 

1143
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:09,200
people engaged in social conflict was 
for economic reasons.

1144
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:10,970
It's like,
that's no answer.

1145
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:12,350
It's like,
okay,

1146
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:15,590
economic reasons that means people fight
about things they value.

1147
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:17,000
It's like,
well,

1148
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:18,920
yeah,
self evident,

1149
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,023
but what's not self evident is why 
exactly do they value that things they 

1150
01:01:23,271 --> 01:01:24,620
value,
you know,

1151
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:29,621
because obviously people can live at 
very different levels of material.

1152
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:32,180
Plenty,
you know,

1153
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,450
I mean there's people who live in the 
Amazon jungle and they basically have,

1154
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,613
from our perspective,
they have nothing and they're living 

1155
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,610
away just perfectly fine.
And then there's people you know,

1156
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:41,444
in New York penthouses and it's like 
people are capable of adapting to 

1157
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:51,011
situations where the variance in 
economic wealth is insanely large.

1158
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:52,844
And so the idea that we're fighting over
scarce resources or something like that 

1159
01:01:57,351 --> 01:02:00,260
just struck me as stupid and I do think 
it's stupid.

1160
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:03,380
It's not even easy to define what 
constitutes a resource.

1161
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,131
And then,
you know,

1162
01:02:04,131 --> 01:02:05,660
you might think about Japan,
right?

1163
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,000
It's got no resources at all and it's 
rich,

1164
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,033
you know,
it's a bit stagnant at the moment 

1165
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:12,380
because it's aging,
but Japan has nothing.

1166
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,470
It has rice that they have to subsidize 
and it's rich as can be,

1167
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,753
you know.
So none of that made any sense to me at 

1168
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:19,244
all.
I thought it was just posturing and I 

1169
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:24,150
still think that I think it's a 
ridiculous idea.

1170
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,010
It's shallow is can be.

1171
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:29,670
So then I thought,
oh,

1172
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:33,100
I'll study psychology instead,
you know,

1173
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,003
and I did that partly because I was 
interested in problems at a clinical 

1174
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:38,700
level.
But I was also,

1175
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,253
I started reading some,
I took a psych course that was self 

1176
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:45,390
study and I started reading some real 
psychologists,

1177
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:46,081
you know,
in this,

1178
01:02:46,081 --> 01:02:50,970
in this self guided reading course.
I read original works by Carl Rogers and

1179
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,570
Abraham maslow and I read the archetypes
of the collective unconscious by young.

1180
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:56,640
And I read the interpretation of dreams 
by Freud.

1181
01:02:56,641 --> 01:03:01,200
Like I was trying to pick out core texts
in the history of psychological ideas.

1182
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:03,090
And you know,
that was really helpful.

1183
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:03,924
I mean,
there's nothing like reading original 

1184
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:08,460
works by geniuses to provide you with 
some useful information,

1185
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:09,990
you know,
is extraordinarily useful.

1186
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:11,640
Reading.
Um,

1187
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,970
and I was reading the chat the same 
time,

1188
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:17,400
which was also really remarkable.
I think I read,

1189
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,790
I read most of what was published at 
that point by niche.

1190
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:23,910
And I tried to read it in chronological 
order and it really blew me away.

1191
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,690
It,
Mandy,

1192
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:27,360
that guy don't know what was up with 
him,

1193
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:29,250
but he could sure think.
I mean,

1194
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:34,200
Nisha said at one point I write in a 
sentence what it takes other people,

1195
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:36,310
a whole book to say.
It's like,

1196
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:39,690
that's a pretty huge mystic and 
narcissistic comment,

1197
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:40,511
right?
It's like.

1198
01:03:40,511 --> 01:03:42,270
And then he talks and he said,
ah,

1199
01:03:42,271 --> 01:03:45,450
they can't even say it in a whole book.
So,

1200
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:46,320
you know,
that's,

1201
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,690
I love that.
And he was right too.

1202
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,130
That's the thing.
And he was right,

1203
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:51,960
you know,
and nature was not in very good health.

1204
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:52,794
And so he'd think like mad and then 
write something down that summarize the 

1205
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:56,814
thinking because he didn't have the 
energy to run through the whole 

1206
01:03:58,051 --> 01:03:58,884
arguments.
And so he said he liked to philosophize 

1207
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:03,120
with a hammer and it's like,
yeah,

1208
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:05,380
I have,
I haven't had a client recently who,

1209
01:04:05,381 --> 01:04:06,214
who is,
who was raised as a Christian 

1210
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:08,310
fundamentalist state.

1211
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,533
And uh,
he was kind of cocky intellectually and 

1212
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:14,070
he's not a stupid guy.
And he thought that he would,

1213
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,293
you know,
take on Nicha intellectually because he 

1214
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:17,484
knew about Nisha statement about the 
death of God and so he read me each and 

1215
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,680
that was the end of his Christianity.
It's like,

1216
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:25,140
you know,
it's you to watch who you pick on,

1217
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:25,974
you know,
and he's not a good guy to pick on 

1218
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:30,570
because he's a lot smarter than you and 
you know,

1219
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:33,990
a lot smarter than almost everyone.
He was an amazing person.

1220
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,660
But,
and so I was reading Nietzsche and I was

1221
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:37,494
reading Dostoevsky and I was reading 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn at the same time 

1222
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:42,750
and social units and wrote this book 
called the Gulag Archipelago,

1223
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,480
which is like the second volume of that 
book.

1224
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:49,740
It's just.
He memorized the book in Karnes in a,

1225
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,410
in a prison camp in Russia.
And the book is,

1226
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:53,423
I believe it's 2,400
pages long and it's written in like 

1227
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,300
seven point type.

1228
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,163
It's a major league book and you know,
he didn't have much pen and paper in 

1229
01:05:01,091 --> 01:05:02,760
the,
in the gulag camps.

1230
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:03,594
And,
and he spent a lot of time thinking 

1231
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:06,024
about why he was in there and why Russia
was basically the whole economy was 

1232
01:05:10,651 --> 01:05:13,620
basically predicated on slave labor and 
it was absolutely murderous.

1233
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:15,870
So,
and the second volume of that series,

1234
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:20,940
he escaped from Russia in 1975.
It was brought over in a bad translation

1235
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:24,220
and circulated in the,
in the west,

1236
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,950
long before it was available in Russia.
I tell you,

1237
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,770
once that book was published,
1975,

1238
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,873
there was no being a Marxist anymore.
Like he just demolished the claims of 

1239
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:39,880
the Marxist left to its moral 
credibility,

1240
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,610
just demolished it.
And rightly so.

1241
01:05:42,611 --> 01:05:44,860
And it's a,
it's an amazing book,

1242
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:46,630
the Gulag Archipelago.
But it's,

1243
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:48,070
it's a,
it's a Walkthrough,

1244
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:48,904
a very deep swamp.
And it's a remarkable book because it's 

1245
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:53,914
like reading someone who's screaming and
outrage at the top of their lungs for 

1246
01:05:57,701 --> 01:05:59,500
2,400
pages,

1247
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:00,873
you know.

1248
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,360
So I was reading all that,
you know,

1249
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:05,194
and,
and I was having these nightmares and I 

1250
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:07,444
was.
So I was trying to figure out what the 

1251
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:12,730
hell it was about belief systems and,
and how things had gone.

1252
01:06:12,731 --> 01:06:14,890
So as strange,
especially in the 20th century,

1253
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:15,724
so now I was reading the chip at that 
point and I read parts of thus spake 

1254
01:06:19,691 --> 01:06:20,524
Zarathustra and which is not a book by 
Nietzsche that anyone should read until 

1255
01:06:22,931 --> 01:06:23,764
they read everything else he wrote 
because it's nothing like anything else 

1256
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:26,614
he wrote.
It's this weird sort of old testament 

1257
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:30,490
like poetry and it's,
you know,

1258
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:33,340
it's revelatory in some sense.
So it's a very strange book,

1259
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:34,174
but it's in that book were Nietzsche 
announces the death of God and he has a 

1260
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:38,494
profit.
Sarah Oostra come down from a mountain 

1261
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:44,260
into a marketplace and tell everyone 
that God is dead,

1262
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,390
you know,
and he says,

1263
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:47,943
God is dead and we have killed him and 
where will we ever get enough water to 

1264
01:06:52,901 --> 01:06:53,734
wash away the blood,
which is the part of Nietzsche's quote 

1265
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:56,620
that no one ever refers to.

1266
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,850
So I mean,
because we,

1267
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:00,190
you know,
people like to think of niches statement

1268
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:03,160
as triumphal,
in some sense God is dead.

1269
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:03,851
It's like,
yeah,

1270
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:06,670
but Nisha knew what was coming because 
back in the eighties,

1271
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,830
eighties,
because he was a real prophet.

1272
01:07:08,831 --> 01:07:12,490
This man like Dostoevsky.
I don't know how they did this knee,

1273
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:13,450
just sad in,
in,

1274
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:16,690
in his notebooks and will to power that 
the concept.

1275
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:17,583
There's two things that were going to 
happen to the human race because of the 

1276
01:07:19,991 --> 01:07:20,824
death of religion.
One was that people would become 

1277
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:23,704
nihilistic and the other was that they 
would become totalitarian and he said 

1278
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:30,430
that what would happen in Europe in the 
next century,

1279
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,293
so this is like 20 years,
15 years before the 20th century 

1280
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:36,940
started,
that there would be hundreds of millions

1281
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,310
of people dying as a consequence of the 
conflict.

1282
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:40,144
Basically between Communist 
presuppositions in classic Western 

1283
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:43,960
presuppositions.
It's like,

1284
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,370
you know,
when the wall fell in 1989,

1285
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:49,810
no one predicted.

1286
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:53,170
It was like everyone was left 
dumbfounded by that event.

1287
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,033
You know,
so predicting what's going to happen 

1288
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,104
tomorrow that's impossible.
Predicting what's going to happen in a 

1289
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,050
whole century,
15 years before it starts.

1290
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,810
It's like you,
you got to think someone's tapped into a

1291
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:05,644
very deep,
deep underground vein to be able to do 

1292
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:09,394
that.
But he thought about it as a idiation 

1293
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,560
and necessity.
It's like cars,

1294
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:17,870
furniture.
Once the idea of God was killed,

1295
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:19,243
he believed that the entire moral 
structure that was predicated on that 

1296
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:23,360
idea,
which was its fundamental assumption,

1297
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:26,540
would be shaken,
shaken to its core because it's like the

1298
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:30,410
foundation piece was knocked out and 
everything would be up for grabs.

1299
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:34,820
If that's not true,
then what?

1300
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,093
Well,
that's a theme that Dostoevsky explored 

1301
01:08:38,091 --> 01:08:38,924
to continually was Dostoevsky who needs 
you to read and even more than I 

1302
01:08:43,221 --> 01:08:44,750
thought,
as I found out recently,

1303
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:48,170
I'm Dostoevsky's take on it was that,
well,

1304
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:51,830
if there's no God than anything than you
can do anything you want.

1305
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:55,250
Everything is permitted.
There's no morality whatsoever and all.

1306
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:56,084
There is an issue.
Also pointed this out to some degree 

1307
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,010
because Nisha said most people's 
morality is cowardice.

1308
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:03,800
He didn't say that morality was 
cowardice.

1309
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:04,813
He said that people cover up their 
cowardice by pretending that they're 

1310
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:11,270
moral when they refuse to do things that
they're terrified of.

1311
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:15,950
It's like it's a nasty little comment 
and it happens to be true.

1312
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:18,440
So Dostoevsky as well,
at the same time,

1313
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:23,441
was exploring what might happen from a 
political perspective.

1314
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:27,800
For example,
if his ideas about the death of God were

1315
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:28,634
true,
that everything would be permitted if 

1316
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:33,200
God was dead and he wrote a book called 
the Devil's,

1317
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:35,510
which are the possessed,
which I would also highly recommend,

1318
01:09:35,511 --> 01:09:38,210
especially if you read it with the Gulag
archipelago because they're like,

1319
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,910
Dostoevsky predicts what's going to 
happen.

1320
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,310
And then Solzhenitsyn describes what 
happened in there.

1321
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:44,510
The same thing.
It's,

1322
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:48,290
it's,
it's rather staggering actually.

1323
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,710
And especially because you know,
they're having.

1324
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:52,583
There wasn't anything more powerful 
written in the 20th century than 

1325
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:55,873
Solzhenitsyn's books and there wasn't 
anything written in the 19th century 

1326
01:09:58,191 --> 01:09:59,990
that was more powerful than 
Dostoyevsky's books.

1327
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:03,260
So like that's a one two punch.
So.

1328
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:05,623
So anyway,
so nature is prediction was that once 

1329
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:12,230
you pull the rug out from underneath the
system,

1330
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:13,303
it might take a long time to fall,
but it's going to fall because there's 

1331
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:17,174
no foundation left.
And the system was actually logically 

1332
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:21,740
coherent.
Once you accepted the assumptions.

1333
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,583
The assumptions were while they were 
basically Christian assumptions in our 

1334
01:10:24,771 --> 01:10:27,170
Judeo Christian assumptions in Europe,
you know,

1335
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:28,004
and they were predicated on the 
religious substructure and those 

1336
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:31,004
religious ideas.
Though it wasn't as obvious in the late 

1337
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:34,550
$1,900
as it is now,

1338
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:37,930
had an unbelievably ancient history.
So you know,

1339
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:38,764
a Christian ideas are derived from 
Jewish ideas and Jewish ideas are 

1340
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:45,100
predicated on Egyptian ideas and 
Egyptian ideas are based in Mesopotamian

1341
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:47,990
ideas and that's about as far as back as
we can go.

1342
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,063
But then we know that there are 
shamanistic traditions that are 

1343
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:53,900
basically religious instruction that go 
back maybe 25,000

1344
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:55,020
years and then,
you know,

1345
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,830
before that we don't know,
we don't know,

1346
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:59,743
but there wasn't nothing before that 
because there were people like us 

1347
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:06,620
fundamentally for at least 150,000
years.

1348
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:07,783
And then there were people who were more
or less like us for depends on how you 

1349
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:11,744
count.
We diverged from our chimp human 

1350
01:11:13,861 --> 01:11:14,694
ancestor about 7 million years ago.
So God only knows how deeply rooted 

1351
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:20,100
those ideas are.
Now,

1352
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:20,934
you know,
the rationalist critics like and we 

1353
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:25,470
still have the like darkens for example,
you know,

1354
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,230
they kind of think of,
of a religious system as a,

1355
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,610
as a superstitious scientific theory,
you know,

1356
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:36,660
and that's,
it's exactly what people like.

1357
01:11:36,661 --> 01:11:38,940
Voltaire thought 300 years ago,
you know,

1358
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,280
and it's uh,
you know,

1359
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:42,840
I get their point,
but it's stupid.

1360
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:44,730
No,
I'm telling you like,

1361
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:45,930
it's like,
forget about that.

1362
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:49,020
That's like 1750,
you know,

1363
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:52,530
it's not 1750 anymore and we've got 
different problems.

1364
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:56,910
And the idea that religion is a 
superstitious scientific theory,

1365
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:58,650
it's like,
that's a really stupid idea.

1366
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,633
All that means is that you haven't read 
anything about the psychology of 

1367
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:04,740
religion or about religious 
phenomenology in general.

1368
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:09,810
I mean anybody who has any grounding in 
neuroscience and who actually reads,

1369
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:10,830
knows,
for example,

1370
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:11,664
that there are all sorts of neural 
phenomena that result in religious 

1371
01:12:14,611 --> 01:12:16,070
experience.
You know.

1372
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,970
So for example,
if you get epilepsy,

1373
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,120
there's a high probability that your 
aura,

1374
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,120
which is the sense you have before the,
the,

1375
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:26,850
uh,
epilepsy hits is a high probability that

1376
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:29,160
that's going to be associated with 
religious experience.

1377
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:31,710
And it was for Dostoevsky,
for example.

1378
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:35,370
So what happened to Dostoevsky was that 
he was kind of a student radical,

1379
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,350
you know,
under the czars.

1380
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:41,640
And they arrested him along with the 
other student radicals and threw them in

1381
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:44,590
the prison in Moscow.
I think it was in Lubyanka and they kept

1382
01:12:44,591 --> 01:12:46,530
them there for a while.
He's kind of an aristocratic guy,

1383
01:12:46,531 --> 01:12:50,370
so he wasn't used to a hard living and 
then before they let him go,

1384
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:51,204
they woke him up at six in the morning 
and took them out in the firing squad 

1385
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:55,163
yard and then they lined up all the 
people who would do the shooting when a 

1386
01:12:59,011 --> 01:13:01,950
firing squad and they shot them with 
blanks,

1387
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:05,490
but he didn't know they were blanks and 
so that was a little hard on his nervous

1388
01:13:05,491 --> 01:13:08,070
system and so he developed epilepsy as a
consequence of that.

1389
01:13:08,071 --> 01:13:08,904
And one of the consequences of example,
epsy was that just before he had the 

1390
01:13:11,671 --> 01:13:15,750
actual seizure,
he said that it appeared to him that his

1391
01:13:15,751 --> 01:13:16,584
knowledge of the structure of reality 
was deepening and deepening and 

1392
01:13:19,111 --> 01:13:22,050
deepening and deepening until it was 
absolutely overwhelming.

1393
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:22,883
He felt like he was on the verge of 
discovering the secret of the universe 

1394
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:26,634
and then apparently the secret of the 
universe was a little too big to fit 

1395
01:13:28,891 --> 01:13:30,930
inside his head and he'd have an 
epileptic seizure.

1396
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,213
But it's very interesting because 
Dostoevsky was kind of a hack novelist 

1397
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:39,480
before,
before he underwent prison,

1398
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:40,403
then he had the firing squad thing 
happened and then he was sent to this 

1399
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:47,010
like horrible prison full of murderers 
and rapists for for a long time.

1400
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:48,990
And so when he came out,
he wasn't the same guy.

1401
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:52,560
It's hard to say exactly how much the 
experience has changed them and how much

1402
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:53,394
the epilepsy changed in.
But certainly there are depths of 

1403
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,033
representation in his writing that I 
don't think he could have reached 

1404
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:05,340
without the epilepsy.
And so religious experiences,

1405
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:07,650
man,
they're hardwired into your brain and we

1406
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:10,110
can elicit them with some,
with some regularity.

1407
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:11,303
Now you might think,
well that means there are biological 

1408
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:13,600
side effect.
It's like,

1409
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,800
yeah,
yeah maybe.

1410
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,270
And maybe not to,
you know,

1411
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:19,383
so you,
I don't know what the rationalist do 

1412
01:14:21,401 --> 01:14:22,480
with that sort of thing,
you know,

1413
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:24,700
maybe they say,
well that's an evolutionary spandrel.

1414
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:26,530
It doesn't really mean anything of any 
importance.

1415
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,364
It's like

1416
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,793
the whole span two spandrel is Spandrel,
is something that characterizes an 

1417
01:14:33,581 --> 01:14:36,250
organism,
but it hadn't really evolved.

1418
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:39,610
It just more or less happened.
So you can't say that it has a function,

1419
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:41,650
it's like a side effect of something 
else.

1420
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:42,783
One of the great tricks of rationalist 
evolutionary thinkers is that they call 

1421
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:46,624
anything that a biological organism 
manifests that they can't account for 

1422
01:14:49,721 --> 01:14:52,090
rationally a spandrel.
And it's a real,

1423
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:54,790
it's a real,
it's a pathological trick.

1424
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,940
And you certainly can't do that with 
something like religious experience.

1425
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:02,620
I mean you just have to be adult to 
think that I can give you an example.

1426
01:15:02,621 --> 01:15:03,454
So I'm obviously part of what's 
happening and really just phenomenology 

1427
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:12,580
is dominance hierarchy perception gone 
mad in a sense.

1428
01:15:12,581 --> 01:15:13,414
So you know,
so imagine that there's a hierarchy of 

1429
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:20,320
people and that you're hardwired to 
admire those at the top.

1430
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:21,850
Well obviously right?

1431
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,833
I mean how,
What Percentage of magazine Sold 

1432
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:30,010
Disposer About Celebrity Culture.
It's like 50 percent.

1433
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,900
So like primates,
like us,

1434
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:35,020
we like to gaze at high status primates 
and if you take,

1435
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:35,854
I think they're vervets and you figure 
out the vervet hierarchy and you show 

1436
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,990
low status vervets photographs of high 
status for bits,

1437
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,720
then they'll spend a lot of time looking
at them.

1438
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:44,973
So part of,
part of what I'm trying to suggest here 

1439
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:52,480
is that part of what religious 
phenomenology is,

1440
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:57,580
is the inbuilt sense of awe that we have
when we gaze up the hierarchy and we see

1441
01:15:57,581 --> 01:15:58,414
what's at the top and you know,
it's not that long since we had 

1442
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:01,573
monarchies and in many societies you 
weren't even allowed to look at the 

1443
01:16:04,181 --> 01:16:05,220
king.
You know,

1444
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,810
that was certainly the case in Japan 
where,

1445
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,270
you know,
the,

1446
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:10,103
the,
the emperor would be surrounded by 

1447
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,720
shoguns shoguns I think that's right.

1448
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:14,853
And they,
they were authorized to kill anyone who 

1449
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:17,913
got line.
They just chopped them up with their 

1450
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:22,720
swords and any bit of being out of line 
was enough.

1451
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:23,890
So,
you know,

1452
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:25,870
dominance hierarchy is a very serious 
thing.

1453
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,420
And so,
you know,

1454
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:30,520
it's hard for modern people to 
understand the aw,

1455
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:35,650
that must have accompanied the 
experience of being exposed to a monarch

1456
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:38,020
in a society that was fundamentally 
monarchical.

1457
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:38,854
But the Japanese believed like right up 
to the second end of the Second World 

1458
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:45,310
War that their emperor was a Sun God.
And you think,

1459
01:16:45,311 --> 01:16:46,660
well that's pretty damn weird.
It's like,

1460
01:16:46,661 --> 01:16:47,590
no,
it's not.

1461
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:51,040
It's the fact that we don't have sun 
gods that's weird,

1462
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:53,470
like that's a really,
really old idea,

1463
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:54,304
and the Japanese were just doing what 
virtually every culture before them had 

1464
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:58,960
done that ever got anywhere with 
organization,

1465
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:00,623
and so there's one of the things about a
god is that a god is something like 

1466
01:17:04,631 --> 01:17:06,490
what's at the top of the dominant 
Turkey.

1467
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:08,140
Now,
human beings are very,

1468
01:17:08,141 --> 01:17:12,050
very peculiar creatures and we're 
capable of high levels of abstraction.

1469
01:17:12,051 --> 01:17:15,250
So I'm going to offer you a theory.
Okay?

1470
01:17:15,251 --> 01:17:19,250
And this is a lot of thinking compressed
into a very tiny sentence.

1471
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,490
Okay?
So imagine a dominance hierarchy.

1472
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:23,803
Okay?
Now imagine that there's a set of 

1473
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:27,254
qualities that makes it more probable 
that you'll get to the top of a 

1474
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:32,300
dominance hierarchy.
Now,

1475
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,950
that's not that hard to imagine,
right?

1476
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:34,880
You might think,
well,

1477
01:17:34,881 --> 01:17:35,714
intelligence might have something to do 
with that attractiveness might have 

1478
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:42,950
something to do with that power.
We know from studies of chimps,

1479
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:45,980
and this is mostly done by friends to 
all that you know,

1480
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:46,814
because you might think of kind of 
prototypical caveman society that it's 

1481
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:54,740
like the caveman that looks most like a 
bodybuilder who's the most dominant cave

1482
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:56,810
man,
but so to speak,

1483
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:57,823
but what do all found among the chimps 
was that the chimp who is at the top of 

1484
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:02,204
the male dominance hierarchy,
who remained at the top relatively 

1485
01:18:06,021 --> 01:18:08,360
stable so that he wasn't brutally 
murdered,

1486
01:18:08,361 --> 01:18:11,060
say bye to chimps that were below him in
the dominance hierarchy,

1487
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,240
was actually kind of a good leader in 
some sense.

1488
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,300
You know.
So he got along well with females in the

1489
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:20,450
troop and maybe even attended to their 
children to some degree.

1490
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,360
And it wasn't a completely unpredictable
tyrant.

1491
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,180
And if he was like that,
then you know,

1492
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,073
a couple of male chimps would form a 
coalition and when his back was turned 

1493
01:18:30,231 --> 01:18:32,210
at any moment,
then they'd rip them to pieces.

1494
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:34,070
And so.
So that's really.

1495
01:18:34,071 --> 01:18:34,904
It's phenomenally interesting because 
what it suggests is that there's a 

1496
01:18:37,431 --> 01:18:38,264
stable set of characteristics,
relatively stable that are operative 

1497
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:44,750
within a dominance hierarchy that 
propels you to the top and that and that

1498
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:47,810
that's characteristic not only of human 
dominance hierarchies,

1499
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:52,490
but it's also characteristic in a way 
that's analogous to even chimp dominance

1500
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:53,324
hierarchies.
So you can read Frans de Waal if you're 

1501
01:18:54,681 --> 01:18:55,514
interested in that sort of thing is he's
written a lot of books about the 

1502
01:18:57,291 --> 01:19:00,680
emergence of morality and in,
in chimpanzees in particular,

1503
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,850
it's very nice work.

1504
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,470
I mean he's observing chimps that are 
basically in a zoo in,

1505
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,400
in Holland,
so you know,

1506
01:19:06,401 --> 01:19:08,390
you could make the case that,
you know,

1507
01:19:08,391 --> 01:19:12,200
there are a little,
not like wild chimps but whatever,

1508
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:13,520
you know,
fine.

1509
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:14,383
They're not exactly like wild chimps,
but I don't think that invalidates his 

1510
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:19,430
research at all.
So,

1511
01:19:19,431 --> 01:19:19,971
and,
and you know,

1512
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:22,610
you can observe similar things in wild 
chimps.

1513
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:25,250
Okay.
So that's kind of an interesting idea,

1514
01:19:25,251 --> 01:19:26,084
right?
There's a set of stable traits that 

1515
01:19:27,021 --> 01:19:30,140
propels you towards the top.
And some of those would be indicators of

1516
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:32,930
biological health,
like symmetry and beauty,

1517
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:35,930
and some of them would be well,
what other characteristics?

1518
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:37,620
The rest of the bloody truth,
thinker,

1519
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,473
admirable.
And because admirable is also a very 

1520
01:19:41,781 --> 01:19:43,130
interesting phenomena,
right?

1521
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,550
Because there are people you admire,
you think,

1522
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:49,730
well,
why are there people that you admire and

1523
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:51,080
what does it mean to admire someone?

1524
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,273
And what it means in some sense is that 
the effect they have on you is one of 

1525
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:58,100
wanting to imitate.
And you know,

1526
01:19:58,101 --> 01:19:59,660
human beings,
a lot of our knowledge,

1527
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:04,010
a tremendous amount of our knowledge 
isn't propagated linguistically.

1528
01:20:04,011 --> 01:20:08,250
It's propagated through invitation and 
the probability that were imitating each

1529
01:20:08,251 --> 01:20:11,490
other before we develop language is 
extremely high.

1530
01:20:11,491 --> 01:20:12,324
And we're also one of the few animals,
maybe the only animal that are really 

1531
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:21,441
capable of true invitation.
And it's a major league advance in terms

1532
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:22,464
of the transformation of information.
Because what it means is you can go out 

1533
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:26,004
there and half kill yourself,
learning how to do something and 

1534
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,110
stumbled back into the tribe and 
recover.

1535
01:20:31,111 --> 01:20:34,290
And then I can just watch you and embody
what you did.

1536
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:35,124
And poof,
I've got the damn information and you 

1537
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:37,194
know,
I didn't have to expose myself to 

1538
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,473
dragons and,
and all sorts of other horrible things 

1539
01:20:41,761 --> 01:20:43,170
that were out there in the unknown.

1540
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:44,330
And so,
you know,

1541
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:47,550
we're imitating ourselves all the time.
So if you admire someone,

1542
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:52,110
what that does is hook up,
it hooks into your desire to imitate.

1543
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,670
And that's also part of an like an 
inbuilt intrinsic biological process.

1544
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:58,500
Okay,
now fine.

1545
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:01,050
So here's what we're going to say,
dominance hierarchy,

1546
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:05,340
reason for getting to the top,
that produces admiration,

1547
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:08,130
partly because people want to be at the 
top of a dominance hierarchy.

1548
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,200
That's success.
And we're,

1549
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:15,201
we're wired to climb dominance 
hierarchies because the top of a dorm,

1550
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,280
if you live at the top of the dominance 
hierarchy,

1551
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,250
you live longer than you do.
If you live at the bottom of a dominance

1552
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:21,084
hierarchy,
even if you factor out the effect of 

1553
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:26,010
relative income,
it's more,

1554
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:29,670
it's less stressful at the top,
you have better resources at the top and

1555
01:21:29,671 --> 01:21:32,310
the top is a place,
right?

1556
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,800
Because it's been around for 400 million
years.

1557
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:35,813
It's a place,
it's like a conceptual place in a sense 

1558
01:21:38,221 --> 01:21:42,000
or it's a place that's the emergent 
property of social organization,

1559
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:44,730
but it's a place and it's a place where 
people want to go,

1560
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:46,650
okay,
you got a dominance hierarchy,

1561
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,650
someone gets to the top,
you admire them.

1562
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:53,130
All right?
But that's not exactly what human beings

1563
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:54,570
are like.
First of all,

1564
01:21:54,571 --> 01:21:57,780
there isn't one dominance hierarchy.
There's hundreds of the bloody things.

1565
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:58,643
Especially as society becomes complex,
there's a radically very a gated realm 

1566
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:06,600
of dominance hierarchies.
Right?

1567
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:10,740
And so then you might ask yourself

1568
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,043
across the set of dominance hierarchies,
is there a set of properties that makes 

1569
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:20,444
people likely to get to the top?
And that's the kind of question that 

1570
01:22:22,641 --> 01:22:25,880
only a creature capable of abstraction 
could ask or pause it.

1571
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:27,823
And I would say that the figure that 
represents the properties that produces 

1572
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:34,124
the highest probability of climbing to 
the top of the set of all dominance 

1573
01:22:38,841 --> 01:22:41,570
hierarchies is a mess.
Cyanic figure.

1574
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:46,710
That's what a messianic figure is.
So,

1575
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,593
and it's a kind of abstraction it says,
because of course obviously a messianic 

1576
01:22:50,401 --> 01:22:54,540
figure is an ideal write clearly and so 
then you might think,

1577
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,460
well,
an ideal in relationship to what?

1578
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:02,210
Well the he,
he generally is the perfect person.

1579
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,030
Well,
how would we come up with the concept of

1580
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:07,864
what constitutes perfect?
Think about it as a biological category 

1581
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:12,003
where all there's hardly anything more 
perfect and the ability to climb to the 

1582
01:23:16,431 --> 01:23:19,130
top of whatever dominance hierarchy you 
happened to be put in.

1583
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:20,143
Now.
One of the things I would say is that 

1584
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,943
women exerted tremendous selection 
pressure on men to be exactly that sort 

1585
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:28,030
of creature.
So,

1586
01:23:28,031 --> 01:23:28,864
and I can tell you a little bit of 
experimental evidence that we have in 

1587
01:23:31,101 --> 01:23:31,934
relationship shipped to that later.
Fortunately it was an unpublished study 

1588
01:23:34,341 --> 01:23:36,210
because it was an undergraduate thesis,
but,

1589
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,800
but what the hell else would women 
select men for?

1590
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,630
They had any sense?
No.

1591
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,510
You want to select a partner because you
know,

1592
01:23:46,511 --> 01:23:48,190
you've heard the idea of hyper gummy,
right?

1593
01:23:48,191 --> 01:23:51,070
Women made across or up dominance 
hierarchies.

1594
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,293
And so people think,
well women are after say something like 

1595
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:55,384
wealth and success.
So we tested that women aren't that 

1596
01:23:58,361 --> 01:24:01,300
stupid,
so what we did was this,

1597
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:06,301
so we showed a bunch of women the same 
picture of a guy,

1598
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:12,330
but we attached for stories to it.
One story was the basic two by two cross

1599
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:18,100
was useful versus useless and poor 
versus rich.

1600
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,260
So we had useless,
poor,

1601
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,460
useful,
rich,

1602
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,610
useless,
rich and useful,

1603
01:24:24,611 --> 01:24:26,680
poor.
And so here were the story.

1604
01:24:26,681 --> 01:24:28,660
So the useless,
poor guy.

1605
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:29,583
Well you don't need a story for that.
It's like everybody can figure out what 

1606
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:32,230
that is,
you know,

1607
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:35,110
he doesn't have anything and he's never 
going to get anything so fine,

1608
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:36,430
useless and poor.

1609
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:39,220
Then there's useless and rich.
That's a harder one,

1610
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:40,054
right?
So what we did was the guy had won a 

1611
01:24:41,471 --> 01:24:46,060
lottery that paid out weekly for the 
rest of his life.

1612
01:24:46,061 --> 01:24:49,210
So he couldn't squander the money 
because it only came in weekly.

1613
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:50,044
So there was always going to be money 
around and we made the amount 

1614
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,460
sufficiently substantial so that,
you know,

1615
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:56,260
he was in the top one percent,
let's say.

1616
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,630
So that's useless.
Rich and useful.

1617
01:24:58,631 --> 01:24:59,464
Poor was this guy that he worked for an 
NGO and like he was a good guy and you 

1618
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,960
know,
he's helping people out,

1619
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:06,850
but he was never really gonna make any 
money doing this.

1620
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,440
He was Sorta altruistically committed to
a benevolent cause,

1621
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:12,520
useful,
poor.

1622
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,410
And then there was useful rich,
right.

1623
01:25:14,411 --> 01:25:15,244
Which,
you know,

1624
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:16,623
that's sort of the useful rich guy.
He's like the hero of every two bit 

1625
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:21,604
romance and if you don't believe me,
then you could read a billion wicked 

1626
01:25:25,601 --> 01:25:26,434
thoughts.

1627
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,333
It's quite a cool book.
It's written by Google analytics guys 

1628
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,273
and they were looking for the 
architectural structure of the sort of 

1629
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:35,290
literature that women read on in their 
spare time,

1630
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:36,310
so to speak,
on the web.

1631
01:25:36,311 --> 01:25:38,380
It's sort of like the female equivalent 
of pornography.

1632
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:42,310
And so the main guys in these stories or
surgeon,

1633
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:47,050
that's a good one.
Billionaire Pirate Vampire Werewolf.

1634
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,810
Yeah.
So it's very funny.

1635
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,093
Anyway,
so what we found was we had women raped 

1636
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:54,760
the guys for,
you know,

1637
01:25:54,761 --> 01:25:57,250
would you date this guy,
you know,

1638
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:58,870
go out for coffee.
Would you date him?

1639
01:25:58,871 --> 01:25:59,704
Would you consider a long term?
Would you consider a longterm 

1640
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:02,703
relationship?
And the result was wealth was 

1641
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:08,720
irrelevant,
useful was relevant,

1642
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:12,190
so the useful poor guy was just as good 
as the useful rich guy and that,

1643
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:13,063
you know,
that's smart because what you should 

1644
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:19,901
select for isn't having stuff now that's
because maybe this stuff will go away.

1645
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,793
And that was especially true in 
societies where stuff couldn't be 

1646
01:26:23,961 --> 01:26:24,794
stored,
which was almost every society we ever 

1647
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:31,400
had until the modern times.
So what you select for is the capability

1648
01:26:31,401 --> 01:26:34,760
of being successful across multiple 
environments,

1649
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:38,060
obviously.
Okay.

1650
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:38,894
So that's very much like the capability 
of climbing to the dominance hierarchy 

1651
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:44,930
across sets of dominance hierarchies.
And then,

1652
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:47,030
you know,
I talked to you about a little bit and I

1653
01:26:47,031 --> 01:26:50,750
suggested that it's not so obvious what 
would put someone at the top.

1654
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,340
So leadership qualities,
you know,

1655
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:54,500
because you can think about it as blunt 
power,

1656
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,770
sort of like psychopathic leader,
but you know,

1657
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:02,330
that's pretty pessimistic and it could 
easily be that a leader who can maintain

1658
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:03,164
power for any amount of time,
so in some sense isn't going to be 

1659
01:27:06,231 --> 01:27:11,231
thrown over by violent revolution,
has to be a leader of a certain type.

1660
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:14,930
And that,
that stable across,

1661
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:16,820
let's say it's stable across the 
islands,

1662
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,710
or we could even say maybe it's stable 
across millions of years in very complex

1663
01:27:21,711 --> 01:27:22,730
social organisms.

1664
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,013
It's a possibility because you know,
partly what I've been trying to get it 

1665
01:27:26,331 --> 01:27:28,520
as the biological basis of religious 
belief.

1666
01:27:28,521 --> 01:27:29,354
And I would like to tell you,
I'm not trying to reduce religious 

1667
01:27:32,241 --> 01:27:33,074
belief to anything because it's not,
it's like Daniel Dennett wrote a book 

1668
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:38,354
called consciousness explained and the 
critics said consciousness explained a 

1669
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:44,360
way,
you know,

1670
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:46,520
so and I could say,
well,

1671
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:48,530
I'm trying to explain religious 
phenomenology,

1672
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:52,550
but I am not trying to explain it a way.
I'm not trying to reduce it to something

1673
01:27:52,551 --> 01:27:53,384
else.
I'm trying to account for its 

1674
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:56,930
relationship with evolutionary 
structure.

1675
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:57,883
And you know,
this is also why I think the modern 

1676
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:00,920
atheist,
it's a damn clueless.

1677
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:05,030
It's like religion is a human universal,
right?

1678
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:09,020
There's lots of human universals.
Decoration is one everywhere.

1679
01:28:09,021 --> 01:28:11,720
People decorate themselves.
Clothing seems to be another.

1680
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:13,310
Roughly speaking.
Um,

1681
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:17,210
some form of marriage seems to be 
another language seems to be another.

1682
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,730
Sharing food seems to be another.
Like,

1683
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:20,683
you know,
we're human and human beings have 

1684
01:28:22,521 --> 01:28:27,521
characteristics like other animals have 
characteristics and religious experience

1685
01:28:28,371 --> 01:28:31,250
and belief of some form is also a human 
universal.

1686
01:28:31,251 --> 01:28:31,971
So,
you know,

1687
01:28:31,971 --> 01:28:34,580
it's something you have to contend with 
from an evolutionary perspective.

1688
01:28:34,581 --> 01:28:36,350
You can't just brush it off and say,
well,

1689
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:38,230
it's like superstitious science.
It's like,

1690
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:39,403
that's not an analysis.
It's like human beings that religious 

1691
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:44,090
animals.
So what the hell does that mean?

1692
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:44,953
You know,
we bury our dead with ceremonies and 

1693
01:28:46,191 --> 01:28:48,410
we'd been doing that for tens of 
thousands of years.

1694
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:49,843
So it's in us.
And no one came up with these theories 

1695
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,740
because that's what the Marxists used to
say it,

1696
01:28:54,741 --> 01:28:55,311
right?
They said,

1697
01:28:55,311 --> 01:28:57,770
well,
religion is the opiate of the masses.

1698
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,020
It's like,
yeah,

1699
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,640
add Marxism was the math,
the math is massive,

1700
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,490
you know,
so we know where that went.

1701
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:07,350
So you know,
when Marx's idea,

1702
01:29:07,351 --> 01:29:08,184
and this is the same idea that the post 
structuralists and the postmodernist 

1703
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,100
bandy about is that,
you know,

1704
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,943
religion is some sort of semi calculated
expression of the power elite and the 

1705
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:19,164
purpose of it is to subordinate those 
who were subordinate and to keep those 

1706
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:24,360
who were in power,
in power across time.

1707
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:28,710
It's like it's a conspiracy theory.
Nobody invented Christianity.

1708
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,060
You know,
it's like,

1709
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:30,750
it,
it,

1710
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:31,583
it's,
it took 2000 years to reach its current 

1711
01:29:34,081 --> 01:29:34,914
form and it was based on ideas.
There are tens of thousands of years 

1712
01:29:37,441 --> 01:29:40,080
older than that.
So nobody was sitting around thinking,

1713
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:41,063
well,
let's whip up a system to oppress the 

1714
01:29:42,301 --> 01:29:43,680
masses.
And like,

1715
01:29:43,681 --> 01:29:45,900
even if you did come up with a theory 
like that,

1716
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,600
how in the world are you going to get 
people to buy into it?

1717
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:50,423
You know,
it's not that easy to start a mass 

1718
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:54,730
movement and I think there's a 2 billion
Christians,

1719
01:29:54,731 --> 01:29:55,564
something like that.
How do you get all those people to be 

1720
01:29:58,711 --> 01:30:01,230
thinking that this is a good idea?
It's not easy.

1721
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:12,600
Would I say say again?
That superstition?

1722
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:15,470
Yeah,
it created to control.

1723
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,340
Sure,
absolutely.

1724
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,233
You know,
I mean superstition is what you have 

1725
01:30:19,621 --> 01:30:21,810
when you don't know what the hell you're
talking about fundamentally.

1726
01:30:21,811 --> 01:30:24,630
Although I wouldn't put it down that 
much because you know,

1727
01:30:24,631 --> 01:30:28,170
often superstitions are like functional 
theories,

1728
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,500
you know,
so they're.

1729
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,883
And in theories have,
there's a lot of different ways that a 

1730
01:30:32,851 --> 01:30:34,710
theory can be valid.
You know,

1731
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:35,544
we talked about functional utility as 
well and some things that look like 

1732
01:30:38,221 --> 01:30:40,230
they're superstitious have functional 
utility.

1733
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:43,770
They're approximations.
And one thing to think about a theory is

1734
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:48,540
I think of theories as tools and that's 
a pragmatic perspective.

1735
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:51,510
So I would think of scientists science 
as a tool.

1736
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:56,040
I think religion is a tool as well and 
nobody would complain if they had a tool

1737
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:58,500
box full of different tools.
Right?

1738
01:30:58,680 --> 01:30:59,513
And,
and you can chop down a tree with a 

1739
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:04,590
hammer if you have to,
but it would be better to use an ax,

1740
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,260
but a hammer beats the hell out of a 
stick.

1741
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:08,700
So,
you know,

1742
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:09,533
my point is,
is that even a bad theory can be a 

1743
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:14,034
better tool than the one you had before.
It's like approximations to the perfect 

1744
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:18,894
tool in some sense,
so I think your thinking is going to be 

1745
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:22,200
a hell of a lot easier,
you know,

1746
01:31:22,201 --> 01:31:23,034
all things considered if you start to 
think about theories as tools and to 

1747
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:26,964
also think about the theory as a tool 
that has a limited domain of 

1748
01:31:30,481 --> 01:31:34,440
applicability and that is a pragmatic 
idea and I really think,

1749
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,170
I really think the pragmatists were 
right.

1750
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,460
I think they got it right.

1751
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:43,730
Religion is a universal human 
characteristic.

1752
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:44,960
So many people that

1753
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:51,760
no there aren't.
They just think about how many vegans do

1754
01:31:51,761 --> 01:31:54,040
you know?
No,

1755
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:55,093
they're clueless.
They're clueless religious because what 

1756
01:31:56,771 --> 01:31:59,040
they have is ritual without,
without,

1757
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:01,690
without philosophy.
Fundamentally.

1758
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,733
So what's happened in,
in many cases is that as the 

1759
01:32:04,691 --> 01:32:08,200
sophisticated religion so to speak,
have collapsed.

1760
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:09,303
What emerges from their ashes are 
rituals and rituals are sort of the 

1761
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:14,980
ground out of which are religion 
emerges.

1762
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:17,050
Vegans,
vegetarianism,

1763
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,480
Vegetarians,
environmentalist's.

1764
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:22,060
Anybody who's in India log,
you know,

1765
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:23,200
and,
and the reason,

1766
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:28,420
the reason that I would consider those 
in the religious domain is because their

1767
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:33,450
systems of value and they're predicated 
on fundamental assumptions that you have

1768
01:32:34,601 --> 01:32:36,250
to take on faith.
See,

1769
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:37,084
that's the thing that's so peculiar 
because it really turns out that if 

1770
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:45,181
you're going to act and you have to act,
you have to make assumptions.

1771
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,190
And the reason for that is what the 
hell.

1772
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:48,043
You know,
you got to put your ignorance somewhere 

1773
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,663
and people put their ignorance.
They box it up inside their assumptions 

1774
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,500
and those assumptions very so.
And then you know,

1775
01:32:58,630 --> 01:33:03,370
the other thing is you got to ask 
yourself,

1776
01:33:03,371 --> 01:33:05,290
when you're wondering if someone is 
religious,

1777
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,753
what you use as a marker.
Now the typical marker would be I give 

1778
01:33:10,631 --> 01:33:13,600
you a questionnaire and I asked you,
are you religious or do you go to church

1779
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:14,434
or you know,
do you follow the precepts and rituals 

1780
01:33:16,571 --> 01:33:19,240
of something that we would recognize as 
a standard religion?

1781
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:21,350
And lots of people will say no to that,
hey,

1782
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:25,210
but then you watch them and you think 
this is a Nietzschean observation.

1783
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:26,583
What makes you think that the morality 
that you consider moral hasn't been 

1784
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:30,034
conditioned to the absolute last degree 
by 2000 years or 3000 years of in the 

1785
01:33:34,061 --> 01:33:36,880
West at least Judeo Christian tradition.

1786
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:38,583
It's like all the ideas of fundamentally
all the ideas that individuals have 

1787
01:33:41,981 --> 01:33:43,900
value.
It's like we just,

1788
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,420
which is very peculiar idea.
You know,

1789
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:49,180
everyone here,
all you people virtually I would suspect

1790
01:33:49,181 --> 01:33:50,080
believe that.
It's like,

1791
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:52,570
why do you believe that and what do you 
mean you believe it?

1792
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:54,483
What does that mean?
And what it means is you act as if it's 

1793
01:33:57,461 --> 01:33:58,294
true and I don't care what you say.
Like what the hell do you know about 

1794
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:02,590
what you believe?
You know,

1795
01:34:02,591 --> 01:34:03,730
you,
you come to university,

1796
01:34:03,731 --> 01:34:04,564
you can probably spout off a few 
ideologies and rationalize all sorts of 

1797
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:10,390
complex behaviors.
But the idea that you actually know what

1798
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:14,560
you're up to or who you are is like,
why would you think that you're the most

1799
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:15,394
complicated thing that exists?
So you don't think you understand the 

1800
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:20,320
son,
you know,

1801
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:22,960
in the son's a lot more,
a lot less complicated than you are.

1802
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,153
So I don't buy for a moment the idea 
that people don't have religious 

1803
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:28,114
beliefs,
they just are generally clueless about 

1804
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:31,780
what they are.
So and that's,

1805
01:34:31,781 --> 01:34:32,614
that's actually part of the problem I 
want to address is that one of the 

1806
01:34:34,511 --> 01:34:39,511
things that has happened is that in some
sense what the evolved religions,

1807
01:34:40,691 --> 01:34:45,370
let's call them did was there's a 
behavioral substructure that constitutes

1808
01:34:45,371 --> 01:34:49,120
cultural practice,
accepted cultural practice.

1809
01:34:49,121 --> 01:34:52,570
And I would say it's predicated on 
observations.

1810
01:34:52,571 --> 01:34:53,404
Like there is an optimal pattern of 
behavior that's associated with across 

1811
01:34:57,981 --> 01:34:59,870
dominance hierarchies.
That's the central value.

1812
01:34:59,871 --> 01:35:01,850
It's something like that.
And that happens everywhere.

1813
01:35:01,851 --> 01:35:02,684
And there's similarities in those 
rituals because there are similarities 

1814
01:35:06,411 --> 01:35:09,110
among human beings and similarities 
among dominance hierarchies.

1815
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:11,870
Okay.
So you get the behavior laid down,

1816
01:35:11,871 --> 01:35:12,704
first is which everyone's acting like a 
pro social creature and then the next 

1817
01:35:16,821 --> 01:35:17,654
thing you get is the representation,
the symbolic representation of what the 

1818
01:35:20,901 --> 01:35:23,000
pro sociality might be like.

1819
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:25,490
And then you get that expressed in 
religious symbolism.

1820
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,533
And then on top of that you get 
something like an articulated system of 

1821
01:35:30,231 --> 01:35:32,600
religious propositions.
And then on top of that,

1822
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:35,570
maybe you extract out a philosophy.
It's something like that,

1823
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:39,290
so it's relatively coherent across 
different levels of analysis.

1824
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:40,363
Now what happened in the 19th century 
and partly because of the rise of 

1825
01:35:42,591 --> 01:35:43,424
science,
is that the conscious element of the 

1826
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:50,180
religious belief got flipped on its head
because everybody woke up and said,

1827
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:52,940
what the hell do we believe these things
for and what do we even mean?

1828
01:35:52,941 --> 01:35:55,670
They're true,
virgin birth and reincarnated,

1829
01:35:55,671 --> 01:35:56,950
God,
and you know,

1830
01:35:57,250 --> 01:36:01,940
for God the father and all the peculiar 
propositions of Christianity and Judaism

1831
01:36:01,941 --> 01:36:04,370
and Islam.
It's like we wake up,

1832
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,050
we think,
wow,

1833
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:07,820
look what we're doing.
We don't know what we're doing,

1834
01:36:07,821 --> 01:36:11,390
and here we have this whole new body of 
knowledge that suggest that none of that

1835
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:14,330
is factually true.
Well,

1836
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,710
no one was saying,
well,

1837
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:17,540
maybe there's more than one form of 
truth.

1838
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:18,403
You know,
and people weren't thinking about 

1839
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:21,230
pragmatic truth,
for example,

1840
01:36:21,231 --> 01:36:22,064
or behavioral truth.
They were having this weird conflict 

1841
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:26,570
which you all suffer from between,
you know,

1842
01:36:26,571 --> 01:36:29,570
a materialist description of reality and

1843
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:31,643
what

1844
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:35,610
religious propositions that didn't seem 
to be in concordance with that.

1845
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:37,710
You know,
we've looked far out into heaven through

1846
01:36:37,711 --> 01:36:38,544
the Hubble Hubble telescope.
Nobody found God because that means 

1847
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:45,300
there is no God in heaven.
It depends on what you mean by God.

1848
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:46,223
Depends on what you mean by heaven.
So it's not obvious at all that the 

1849
01:36:49,591 --> 01:36:50,424
heaven of the Medieval thinkers is the 
same as the space that we know about 

1850
01:36:53,911 --> 01:36:56,850
from an empirical perspective.
It's not obvious at all.

1851
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:57,781
So.
Okay,

1852
01:36:57,781 --> 01:37:01,610
so let's stop for a bit.
For 10 minutes.

1853
01:37:01,611 --> 01:37:02,444
Let's say.
