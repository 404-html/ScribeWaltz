1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,373
Yeah.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,760
Okay.
So here's some other ideas that,

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,343
okay,

4
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,620
so here's an argument.
I don't know what you think about this,

5
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:28,454
but I've,
I've often thought about it as an 

6
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:33,470
argument by necessity for evolution.
It's like if the,

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,760
if the environment as such is too 
complex to predict,

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,553
then how do you build anything that can 
live in it because living in the 

9
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:44,780
environment is the same as predicting 
it.

10
00:00:44,781 --> 00:00:45,614
It's the same problem.
Well let's think about that for a 

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,580
minute.
The first answer is it doesn't work very

12
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:55,490
well because you guys have been last 
boat 80 years and that'll be that.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,750
So in so far as you are a solution to 
the problem of the environment,

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,793
you're a pretty temporary one and that's
pretty much the best that our path and 

15
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:06,290
evolution could cobble together in 3 
billion years.

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,930
So that just shows you how complex the 
problem is.

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,693
The other issue is that maybe there is 
no other mechanism then the Darwinian 

18
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:16,040
mechanism to account for any success 
whatsoever.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,873
Because the basic idea is,
well you cobble something together and 

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,290
is it good enough for the environment?
And the answer to that is probably not.

21
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:28,070
So you make a million variants and all 
the ones that aren't any good die,

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,690
and so it's,
it's evolution by an excess of death.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,673
Fundamentally it's you solved the 
problem by failing brutally generation 

24
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:38,474
after generation and you know,
I can't see how the problem could be 

25
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,004
solved in any other way.
If the answer to the question is the 

26
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:48,170
environment predictable?
No,

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,473
because then failure is there's no 
alternative to failure the best you can 

28
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:59,000
ever get as temporary success.
So anyways,

29
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,830
you can chew on that.
It's kind of a,

30
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,023
it seems to me to be correct.
Now a couple other things here as you 

31
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:11,800
have to accept some propositions for 
this argument to go forward and actually

32
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,570
laying out the propositions is the hard 
part.

33
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:14,404
So one of the propositions I offered you
is that you look at the world through a 

34
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:18,664
frame of reference.
In that frame of reference is both 

35
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:24,610
cybernetic and narrative.
Now you can debate both of those.

36
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,670
You could debate about whether or not 
the frame of references,

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,513
cybernetic.
All I can tell you about that is when 

38
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,710
I've gone through the animal 
neuroscience literature,

39
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,170
the people who I thought were most 
informed,

40
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,510
broadly informed about psychology and 
general psychopharmacology,

41
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,700
neuroanatomy,
functional neuroanatomy,

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,310
um,
the really hard end of,

43
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,820
of the biological sciences that are 
relevant to psychology,

44
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,410
their models are cybernetic.
So that's kind of interesting.

45
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:03,244
And then the next interesting thing is 
the cybernetic models were designed by 

46
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:06,514
people who were,
who were the founders of artificial 

47
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,304
intelligence.

48
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,070
So there's an interesting parallel 
there.

49
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,120
And then a lot of the great personality 
theories are cybernetic.

50
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,983
You know,
Piaget's theory is basically a 

51
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:18,874
cybernetic theory.
And so perhaps the cybernetic theories 

52
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:24,160
are not exactly right.
That's fine.

53
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,083
But they're pretty damn good.
So I'm going to rest on that for the 

54
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,290
time being.
And then the next question is,

55
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,124
well,
is it reasonable to propose that the 

56
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,950
fundamental cybernetic frame,
his narrative,

57
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,143
and I would say pretty much none of the 
theorizes except for maybe piaget who 

58
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,114
have a cybernetic model,
have drawn a relationship between 

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,730
narrative and cybernetic models.
But here's why.

60
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,564
I think if you look at someone like 
Jeffrey Gray who was credibly 

61
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,314
intelligent,
well educated psychologist really are 

62
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,323
outstanding scholar in my estimation,
he derived his cybernetic models from 

63
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,874
Russian cybernetic models that were 
based on the presupposition that what 

64
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:09,784
you do when you move in the world is you
compare the current state of the world 

65
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:14,200
to the state you expect.

66
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,090
Okay.

67
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,923
And that's wrong.
It's wrong in an important way because 

68
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,034
you're not an expectancy machine.
You're not a cold cognitive computation 

69
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:28,120
machine.
You don't act in the world in accordance

70
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:28,954
with what you expect.
You Act in the world in accordance with 

71
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:34,120
what you want.
And that's like,

72
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,580
it's a critical difference.
So if you read graze,

73
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:38,710
for example,
the neuropsychology of anxiety,

74
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,860
and you get a sense of the cybernetic 
model that's underneath there,

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,520
there's never any real mention of 
motivation per se,

76
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,354
except for emotional motivation.
There's the approach system and the the 

77
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,550
fear system and the negative emotion 
system,

78
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:52,384
but,
but motivation as such doesn't seem to 

79
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,420
enter into it.
You know,

80
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,254
the fact that entities,
animals are hungry and thirsty and 

81
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,530
desirous of sexual contact and playful 
and all those sorts of things.

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,470
You can read Jaak Panksepp for better 
descriptions of those systems.

83
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,090
But those things have to be brought 
together.

84
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,110
And my proposition as soon as you bring,
bring them together is you get narrative

85
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:11,944
because you're talking about people who 
are motivated and want things and then 

86
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:16,504
descriptions of the structures that they
use to operate in the world to get the 

87
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:22,540
things that they want.
That's a narrative now.

88
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,360
So you can think about that.
That's how it looks to me.

89
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,703
So here's another set of propositions.
The propositions are this and that is 

90
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:37,870
that the systems that we use to perceive
and categorize,

91
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:42,871
the world did evolve and they evolved in
a manner that's standard with regards to

92
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:46,174
how things evolve,
which is that new things are built on 

93
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,594
old things.
And you can't escape from the old 

94
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,380
things.
You have to have them.

95
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,490
They're present in your current model.
So you can't get somewhere from nowhere.

96
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,590
And so you're constrained by your 
starting points.

97
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,424
And so I would like to offer you the 
proposition that the basic sub elements 

98
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,554
of our conceptual structures and 
therefore of our narrative structures 

99
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,663
are symbolic representations of the 
world as a place to act that are based 

100
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:19,400
in our long prehistory of fundamentally 
social existence.

101
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,773
And so I'm just going to give you a 
brief introduction into some of those 

102
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,270
categories.

103
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,900
And so,
and I think that the more probable,

104
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,070
the more long lasting a phenomena is,
the more it's probable that a biological

105
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:39,521
entity in contact with that phenomena is
going to have adapted to it perceptually

106
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:40,574
behaviorally and conceptually.
So one of the things we might think 

107
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:48,491
about is given your nervous system,
given that you're an evolved organism,

108
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,720
what have been the most permanent 
features of your evolutionary history to

109
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:54,554
which you've adapted?
And I'm going to talk about some that 

110
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,184
are more complex than the fact that the 
ground beneath your feet is generally 

111
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:05,000
from we obviously we've adapted to that,
you know,

112
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,073
and we've adapted to the presence of 
light and we've adapted to the presence 

113
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:11,300
of an atmosphere and so forth.
Those are all very constant phenomena.

114
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,950
But then there are constants of social 
being that are virtually as old.

115
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,720
And we've talked about that a little 
bit.

116
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,140
One of them I posited was the dominance 
hierarchy.

117
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,320
I gave you some evidence that that's at 
least 400 million years old.

118
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,530
But then there's also the fact of sexual
differentiation.

119
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,783
You know,
one of the fundamental facts of human 

120
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,024
being and human social being is that 
there are roughly speaking two genders 

121
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,153
and that that's permanent.
So a masculine element of the social 

122
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:41,054
world and a feminine element of the 
social world are constants just as the 

123
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:48,200
social world is a constant.
And then I would say mothers and fathers

124
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,130
are very constant.
There is constant as mammals are,

125
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,993
right?
So because we've had mothers and 

126
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:54,524
fathers,
roughly speaking since we became 

127
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:56,564
mammals,
and there are some reptiles that are 

128
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:02,240
actually manifest some pretty decent 
parental behavior and it occurs in birds

129
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:03,074
as well.
So,

130
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,670
and even in fish.
So you know,

131
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,504
it's pretty constant.
And then I would say the figure of the 

132
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:09,284
child is constant and to figure of the 
old man and the old woman are constants 

133
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,473
and there's some more important 
constants that are necessary to 

134
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,204
consider.

135
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,163
Uh,
one constant is that you have a 

136
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:20,054
territory.
The other constant is that there's 

137
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,084
something outside that territory.
Another constant constant is that you 

138
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:29,900
can be a pro,
you can be prayed for a predator.

139
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,973
That's a big one.
And then another constant is there are 

140
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,600
predators.
Okay.

141
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,434
So your conceptual systems,
the ones that you utilize today are 

142
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:42,644
going to be grounded in representations,
embodied representations and conceptual 

143
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:52,601
representations that have already 
structured themselves in accordance with

144
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:53,714
the existence of those constants.
And you're drawing on them as part of 

145
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:59,940
the representational system that orients
you in the world.

146
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,270
And weirdly enough,
it actually works,

147
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,670
which is very peculiar thing as far as I
can tell.

148
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,504
So one of the things that's struck me as
in some sense in comprehensible is that 

149
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,800
the use of these fundamental cognitive 
categories too,

150
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,813
when you apply them to a world that in 
some sense isn't objectively configured 

151
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,720
in accordance with those conceptions.

152
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,490
It works,
it functions if you,

153
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:27,324
if it actually applies so that you can 
live using those categories and you're 

154
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:33,240
successful.
So anyways,

155
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,320
that's a tough one.
So,

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,040
so as we move,
so because so I said,

157
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,750
well you've,
you have to have a frame of reference in

158
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:40,584
the frame of reference is cybernetic.
And then there's an analogy between the 

159
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,630
cybernetic structure and an at a 
narrative structure.

160
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,690
And that's a very tight analogy.
It's likely an identity.

161
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,890
Okay.
So that's,

162
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,873
that's a set of premises.
The next premise is that within those 

163
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:58,581
narratives there are constants of 
representation and action and that those

164
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:04,671
are human procedural,
universal.

165
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:08,130
So things that we do.
And then there are,

166
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:13,131
there are human conceptual universals 
and those conceptual universals,

167
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,743
the grounding of those conceptual 
universals is in ancient biological 

168
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:25,581
systems that had to conceptualize that,
that failed if they didn't conceptualize

169
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,820
a certain realm of constance in the 
environment.

170
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,860
And I laid out the constance masculinity
femininity,

171
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,480
youth,
old age.

172
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,070
Okay.

173
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,380
Explored territory,
unexplored territory,

174
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,020
prey and Predator.
Now,

175
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm not saying that's all of them 
because I don't think it is all of them,

176
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,080
but we can get an awful long way with 
just those.

177
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,900
Now if you read terror management 
theorists,

178
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,603
the terror management theorists will 
tell you something like your belief 

179
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,284
system,
which is kind of conceptualized as a 

180
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:08,031
system of interrelated abstractions,
prevents you from terror of death.

181
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,690
All right,
so that's Ernest Becker.

182
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,970
That's her inspectors theory.
It's pretty good theory.

183
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:15,804
It was grounded on Friday and 
presuppositions and he developed that 

184
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:20,880
theory in a book called the denial of 
death,

185
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,953
which is also a pretty good book.
There's a problem with the basic theory 

186
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,930
as far as I can tell though,
well,

187
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:28,764
there's multiple problems.
It's not a bad theory and at certain 

188
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,370
levels of analysis,
it's a pretty good theory,

189
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,520
but it,
it has serious flaws.

190
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,450
The first flaw is your belief system is 
not merely conceptual.

191
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,170
You act it out and that's really 
important and so,

192
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:48,690
and it isn't also not the belief system 
that protects you.

193
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,153
It's the fact that other people have 
organized a society around you 

194
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:53,454
predicated on that belief system and the
society works like it's not a 

195
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,900
psychological society isn't a 
psychological phenomena.

196
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,063
You have a representation of it and the 
representation in part as a 

197
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:03,604
psychological phenomena,
but the fact that you can sit here in 

198
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,350
relative peace,
harmony,

199
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:09,430
security,
warmth,

200
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:12,280
and light is not a psychological 
phenomenon.

201
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,683
It's embedded in the world,
so a lot of what protects you from 

202
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,494
death.
Anxiety isn't a psychological structure 

203
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:20,704
that stops you from being afraid.
It's an actual structure that stops you 

204
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:27,760
from dying,
and so both are right,

205
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:30,100
but you can't forget about the most 
fundamental one,

206
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:30,934
right?
The most fundamental one is the most 

207
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:33,310
fundamental one,
and if,

208
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,090
if an event's so occur,
maybe even social conflict,

209
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:37,924
and I perceived that the consequences of
that social conflict is not only a 

210
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,394
direct disruption of what I believe,
but also a disruption of the society 

211
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:46,444
that that protects and shelters me.
Then of course I'm going to respond 

212
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:51,214
negatively to that,
and it's not for only for merely 

213
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:54,454
conceptual reasons.
It's because if the substructure of the 

214
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,450
is actually destroyed,
I'm going to freeze to death in the dark

215
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,620
immediately.
So we don't want to oversight the law.

216
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,890
We don't want to make things more 
psychological than they actually are.

217
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,290
And we have to remember that these 
structures,

218
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,243
the dominance hierarchy is represented,
but it also exists out there in the 

219
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:17,880
world.
And it's a real thing.

220
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,890
Okay,
now we're going to progress through some

221
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,790
models of emotional processing and then 
some neuropsychological models,

222
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,010
and then we're going to get to the 
symbolic domain.

223
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,440
That's that.
That's what's going to happen now.

224
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,303
So you're going from point a to point B 
and you're looking at the world through 

225
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:37,074
that framework.
So that framework also configures your 

226
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,170
perceptions and it also configures your 
emotional responses.

227
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:46,860
And so it's variable,
but within the variability,

228
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,310
there are constants and the constants 
are you're going somewhere,

229
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,340
you come from somewhere,
and when you go from one to the other,

230
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,960
there's only three things that can 
happen,

231
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,453
something you want,
that's a good thing that gets you to 

232
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:04,281
where you're going and it validates the 
theoretical integrity of your perceptual

233
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:06,870
frame.
That's an important thing,

234
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:07,231
right?
It,

235
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:08,064
it does two things.
You get to where you're going and it 

236
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:13,350
provides evidence that your current 
model is actually function.

237
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,770
So if you fail,
both of those things go into question.

238
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,780
One is you're not getting where you want
to go,

239
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,820
that's a problem.
But the worst one is,

240
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,713
oh,
the whole system that you're using to 

241
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:25,770
try to get to where you go also might be
wrong and you don't know where.

242
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,570
Okay,
so that's

243
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,890
things that happen the way you want them
to happen.

244
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,003
That gets you to where you're going,
validates your model that produces 

245
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:37,024
positive emotion.
The way it produces positive emotion is 

246
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:44,050
by activating the dopaminergic system.
The dopaminergic system is embedded,

247
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,153
it has its roots in the hypothalamus and
the hypothalamus is roughly split into 

248
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,204
two parts.
One part pops up sub personalities that 

249
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:57,530
are charged with dealing with 
fundamental biological necessities.

250
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,510
So aggression,
hunger,

251
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:01,070
thirst,
sexual activity,

252
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:01,904
temperature regulation.
You know the real basic animal like 

253
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,910
drive,
so to speak,

254
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:10,550
that have to be gratified in order for 
you to survive.

255
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,680
Half the hypothalamus deals with those 
things.

256
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,370
And then the other half deals with 
exploration.

257
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,350
And so that's pretty cool because what 
it implies is that the urge to explore,

258
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,733
okay,

259
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,580
and the capability of responding to 
things that serve as markers on your way

260
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,570
to a goal.
That system is about as old from a file,

261
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:36,000
a genetic perspective as the systems 
that regulate such things as hunger is a

262
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,200
very,
very fundamental,

263
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,490
it's fundamental and deeply rooted 
system.

264
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,313
And so we're not talking about something
that's peripheral or that's only 

265
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:49,400
cognitive or it's only a manifestation 
of a few thousand years of culture.

266
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,360
It's deep and it's so deep that you 
can't even fight with it.

267
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:57,950
So for example,
part of the reason that you can tolerate

268
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,784
being alive is because when you're 
progressing towards goals that you 

269
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:05,330
regard as valid and when you're making 
progress,

270
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,410
the dopaminergic system kicks in,
it's an approach system.

271
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,810
It kicks in,
it makes you feel good.

272
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,240
So there's a positive emotional element 
to that,

273
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,990
which is sort of like it's okay to 
engage with the world.

274
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,823
That's sort of the message of that.
It also facilitates certain kinds of 

275
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:25,580
learning because it basically says since
what you're doing right now is working,

276
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,100
it's okay if you learn how to do it 
better.

277
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,540
So it reinforces it,
right?

278
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,190
That's part of the reinforcement 
structure.

279
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,790
And then it also suppresses anxiety and 
pain.

280
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,310
So for example,
I don't know if you know this or not,

281
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:41,690
but cocaine is a pretty good analgesic.
And if you mix cocaine with opiates,

282
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,333
which is something to think about.
If you ever dying of intractable cancer 

283
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,364
and you're in terrible pain.
If you Mitch mixed stimulants with 

284
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:49,214
opiates,
you get a better pain medication than 

285
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:54,410
either one of them alone.
Plus you stay alert,

286
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:59,120
which is also a useful thing to know.
So ritalin and opiates works as well.

287
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,253
So,

288
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,760
okay.

289
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,520
It's important to know that if you ever 
know someone who's in severe,

290
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:07,790
intractable and final pain cause it can 
be managed,

291
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,680
although doctors are loath to fix those 
things,

292
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:10,940
but whatever.
Okay.

293
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,800
So when does the dopaminergic system 
that manifest itself?

294
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,634
Well under two conditions.
One is when you're moving towards a 

295
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:20,804
valued goal and the signs are that 
you're actually succeeding in your 

296
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:24,434
movement towards it.
And part of that is because the 

297
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,104
dopaminergic system responds to cues of 
conservatory reward and Consumer Tory 

298
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,500
reward is any reward that brings the 
perceptual system,

299
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,870
we'll call it the sub personality to a 
halt.

300
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,060
So for example,
if you're hungry,

301
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,613
then as long as you're hungry and in 
that frame of mind than anything 

302
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:46,214
associated with food is going to be 
reinforcing in a dopaminergic Lee 

303
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,500
mediated way.
Technically that's incentive reward.

304
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,603
But as soon as you eat well,
then that frame of reference is no 

305
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,260
longer relevant,
it disappears,

306
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,610
and then food isn't reinforcing.

307
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,200
Even though it's interesting,
hey,

308
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,093
because you might think that one of the 
ways that you could stop eating when 

309
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:07,020
you'd had enough is that food would stop
tasting,

310
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,730
but it doesn't.
Right?

311
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:11,280
It's kind of weird.
The food still tastes the same,

312
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,670
roughly speaking,
but it's no longer enjoyable.

313
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:16,670
And the reason for that actually is that
the,

314
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,700
the taste system has two elements that 
are separated physiologically.

315
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,534
One of them is responsible for taste.
And it's also responsible for sort of 

316
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,920
making,
you want to crave different foods during

317
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:29,754
an eating episode.
So there's actually a separate one for 

318
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,030
sweets,
for example.

319
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,210
And so you can satiate the others and 
not satiate the sweet receptors.

320
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,370
And then you want some dessert.
So any,

321
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,350
and if you keep rewarding that system 
with dessert,

322
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:44,730
then it's going to get more and more 
powerful.

323
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,750
But there's another system that sits on 
top of that that acts independently.

324
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,680
And it's job is to say how good each of 
those tastes now are.

325
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,413
And so as you get satiated,
what happens is that system just shuts 

326
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:58,884
down.
It stops associating the tastes with 

327
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:02,010
reward.
So you know,

328
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:03,630
it's kind of a cool way of setting it 
up.

329
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:04,464
I think you can still taste things which
you need to do because you're an 

330
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,374
omnivore.
And if you couldn't taste things well 

331
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,114
then you die because you put something 
stupid in your mouth and that'd be the 

332
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:13,050
end of you.
So you can maintain the taste.

333
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:13,884
But the reward varies.
So the dopaminergic system responds to 

334
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:18,804
incentive reward,
which is accused that a consumer reward 

335
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:21,984
our forthcoming from a behavioral 
perspective and the Conservatory reward 

336
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,363
stops the action of the cycle.
And then another system that needs a 

337
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:29,694
conservatory reward pops up.
So in some sense what's happening is 

338
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:32,724
that you're continually subject to the 
emergence of new motivated 

339
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,403
subpersonalities or frames of reference 
and you're just cycling through those 

340
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:43,524
things all the time.

341
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,480
And then you might say,
well,

342
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:50,110
what happens if you are in some 
favorable state and you've just satiated

343
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,963
everything?
And answer to that is you'll find the 

344
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,570
environment itself,
mildly curiosity,

345
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,404
inspiring.
The dopaminergic system will make 

346
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:02,304
exploring novelty rewarding.
And so you'll go out and you'll do some 

347
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:07,800
random exploration because what the 
hell,

348
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:11,460
you might as well do something while 
you're awake and that will increase your

349
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,490
realm of competence and the the the size
of your explored territory.

350
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,560
And that's a fundament.
That's a very fundamental,

351
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,630
it's not a drive.
It's a very fundamental subpersonality.

352
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,860
It's,
and the reason I'm telling you that it's

353
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,713
nested in the hypothalamus is because I 
don't want you to be thinking that this 

354
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:32,250
is some new thing.
It's really,

355
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,250
really old.
It's,

356
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,473
it's probably about as old as pain and 
its older I think than anxiety because 

357
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:40,734
anxiety seems to be manifested mostly as
a consequence of higher order cognitive 

358
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:48,160
and emotional systems that evolved after
the hypothalamus evolved,

359
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,023
roughly speaking.

360
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,313
So,
okay,

361
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,040
so when you're on your way somewhere,
good things or bad things can happen.

362
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:54,874
If good things happen,
you get a dopamine kick and that keeps 

363
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:57,424
you focused on your goal and it 
validates your theory and you get to 

364
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:02,920
move to where you're going and you get a
consumer Tory reward and good for you.

365
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:03,754
That's success.
Except that a new frame of reference 

366
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,600
pops up and you have the same problem 
that sizzle,

367
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,613
right?
You're always pushing the damn rock up 

368
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:11,890
the hill.
It's always rolling back down.

369
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,023
Question is,
do you find any delight and pushing the 

370
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:15,304
rock up the hill.
So the other thing that can happen is 

371
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,730
something you don't want to have happen.
And that thing indicates that you're not

372
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:25,780
getting to where you're going.
Now the question is,

373
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,823
what should you do when you find out 
that you're not getting where you want 

374
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:29,230
to go?

375
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,740
And the answer to that is you don't 
actually know.

376
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,160
You actually don't know.
And this is where things get complicated

377
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,700
because on the one hand you could say 
you could run into a known obstacle.

378
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:40,534
You remember Rumsfeld,
there are known unknowns and unknown 

379
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:45,420
unknowns.
No,

380
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,140
that's probably,
you're probably too young for that.

381
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:47,974
Anyways,
if I'm walking towards the door and I 

382
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:55,240
encounter this table,
then that's going to frustrate and annoy

383
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:56,074
me.
But it's only going to do it to a 

384
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:58,474
limited degree because I can make a very
trivial correction in trajectory and I 

385
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:04,210
can get to the door.
And so I would say,

386
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:05,800
well that's just an obstacle.
It's,

387
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,870
it's an obstacle.
I know its features.

388
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:08,704
I have a prearranged Schema of 
conception and action so that I can 

389
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:14,980
render it irrelevant with very little 
effort.

390
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,720
Okay.
So it's a known obstacle,

391
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,000
but then that's fine.

392
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,580
So those are just negative things and 
you try to get them out of your way.

393
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:22,414
So for example,
that's partly why you clean up your 

394
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:24,970
house,
right?

395
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:25,804
Because you want your house to be in 
order so that if you're doing things in 

396
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:29,464
there,
things don't get in your way and annoy 

397
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,230
you.
It just makes it more efficient.

398
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,963
So basically what you're doing doing is 
trying to ensure that the paths you 

399
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:41,800
take,
two desired ends are clear.

400
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,440
That's what it means to have a place in 
order.

401
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,950
So it'll,
you know,

402
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,000
it means also the next thing,
which is even more important,

403
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:52,510
which is fine.
Sometimes you're walking from point a to

404
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:53,344
point B and a table gets in the way and 
it's like you're a little annoyed that 

405
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,550
you go around it.
That's not a problem.

406
00:22:57,551 --> 00:23:02,551
And sometimes something else happens.
So my old supervisor had this dog and he

407
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:03,880
used to take it for a walk.

408
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,900
It's like every,
you can take your dog for a walk.

409
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,420
It's no problem.
So one day he was walking along the curb

410
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,890
and his dog pulled him a little bit into
the street and he fell.

411
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,100
And he shattered his leg like in seven 
places and it was just,

412
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,200
there was nothing wrong with them 
physically.

413
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,450
It's just that he fell wrong and like 
poof,

414
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:24,550
he was,
and they had to put a bunch of plates in

415
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:25,384
there.
It's like,

416
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,313
hmm,
that's a whole different category of 

417
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,670
event,
right?

418
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,533
It's,
it's the magnitude of that negative 

419
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:35,530
thing is very large compared to just 
running into a table.

420
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,240
And then,
okay fine,

421
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:40,150
there's hospitals and everything.
So he got dealt with and he was put back

422
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:40,984
together and even his fear of the event 
would be bounded by his knowledge that 

423
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:48,980
there is a hypothetical means of dealing
with the unexpected occurrence.

424
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,010
So it's nasty,
but it's not as nasty as things that you

425
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:52,844
don't know what to do with that all.
And those are things you encounter in 

426
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:57,104
life too.
And so I've given you some examples of 

427
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,580
those before.
A betrayal's a big one.

428
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,720
And I think the reason betrayal is such 
a big one is because first,

429
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,050
if you're going to form a partnership or
a friendship with someone,

430
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,630
you're staking a lot of your life on 
that,

431
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,883
right?
Because you're staking your future on 

432
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:15,800
it,
you're staking your present on it.

433
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,863
It's,
it's an important presumption of the 

434
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:24,290
nature of your reality moving forward.
So the next thing is,

435
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:29,291
is that when someone betrays you,
they violate your model of what it means

436
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,164
to be human.
And that's a big problem because you're 

437
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:33,530
dealing with humans all the time.
And you're also a human.

438
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,340
So if,
if you're betrayed,

439
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,713
that casts the validity of the entire 
structure you use to orient yourself 

440
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:46,340
with regards to yourself and in the 
social world into disarray.

441
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,000
So that's a very big explosion of 
snakes.

442
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,890
And so,
you know,

443
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:52,724
I could say,
well people are full of snakes and you 

444
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:55,230
might say,
well what does that mean?

445
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,360
It means that something like during our 
evolutionary history,

446
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:03,020
predatory reptiles were a big problem.
So for example,

447
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:03,854
when we used to live in trees,
then tree dwelling snakes would eat us 

448
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:11,150
and our offspring more likely,
cause that would be easier.

449
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,313
So that's a big problem.
It lasted some tens of millions of 

450
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:16,370
years.
It's not a trivial amount of time.

451
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,443
And then there was,
when we're on the belt and we're going 

452
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:22,250
down to get a nice drink of water and 
then there's a Nile crocodile down there

453
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:24,410
and he's comes up and snaps you and 
pulls you in.

454
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:29,411
So that subterranean predatory reptiles 
really sort of make us nervous.

455
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:30,644
And you know,
perhaps that's why people think snakes 

456
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:34,400
are slimy and they're not.

457
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,620
But if you talk to someone who's afraid 
of a snake,

458
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,521
they'll say,
oh,

459
00:25:37,521 --> 00:25:38,540
it's slimy.
It's like,

460
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:43,220
well no,
an underwater reptile might be slimy and

461
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,380
a snake is quite a lot like an 
underwater reptile.

462
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:48,230
And who cares how they're different.
The question is,

463
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,540
the relevant issue is how they're the 
same.

464
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,530
And so you could say,
well this is one of the categories.

465
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,520
It's horrible Predator that lurks.
That's a category.

466
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,953
Now I think that what happens when we 
run into something that's radically 

467
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:08,471
unexpected is that we use are horrible 
Predator category to get ready for it.

468
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,203
And so that's partly,
I think also why the terror management 

469
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:14,054
theories aren't exactly right.
Like we have some evidence from our lab 

470
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:17,504
that I've really been wrestling with 
over the last few years because one of 

471
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:20,384
the things we found is that 
conscientious people are more 

472
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:24,134
conservative,
so they tend more towards right wing 

473
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,290
authoritarian viewpoints.

474
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,830
And you can parse conscientiousness up 
into two elements,

475
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,783
industriousness,
and that sort of predicts academic 

476
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:36,800
performance and success in life and 
orderliness.

477
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,190
Orderliness predicts right wing 
authoritarianism,

478
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,121
and you might think,
well,

479
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,740
that's no surprise,
it's like authoritarians orderly,

480
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:44,574
but it's a bloody big surprise.
I can tell you that because we've been 

481
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,024
trying to localize the position of 
authoritarianism in the personality 

482
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:55,050
hierarchy for 50 years and for the 
longest period of time,

483
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:55,884
people thought that the reason that 
people were conservative and right wing 

484
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:01,860
is because they were afraid,
but it turns out that's not true.

485
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,410
They're lower in neuroticism than 
liberals.

486
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,521
And you could say,
well,

487
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:06,354
that's because they're so well protected
by the rigid theories that they'd never 

488
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:11,040
have to expose themselves to anything.
That's frightening.

489
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:11,874
But if you could use your damn theory to
predict results that are opposite to 

490
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:15,660
what you predict,
you know,

491
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:16,494
it's really not much of a theory.
So I think it's better just to take the 

492
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:20,094
data on the face of it.
Conservatives are higher and wellbeing 

493
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,010
and their lower in neuroticism.
Now it's not a huge difference,

494
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,750
but it's,
it's different enough.

495
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,930
However,
orderly people are high in disgust,

496
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:31,764
sensitivity.
And that's a whole new realm of horrors 

497
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:40,410
because disgust sensitivity is the 
action of an intrinsic biological system

498
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:41,244
that stops you from being contaminated 
and contamination kills you if it's 

499
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:47,790
contaminate,
if you're contaminated enough.

500
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So here's one way of thinking about it.
So what happened to the native Americans

501
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,360
when the Europeans showed up?

502
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,110
95% of them died,

503
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,720
right?
Measles,

504
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,790
they didn't.
Measles wasn't good.

505
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,770
Moms,
smallpox,

506
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,160
fatal.
So you know,

507
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,610
you shake hands with someone from Spain 
and Poof,

508
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,420
250 million people are dead.
It's like,

509
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:19,090
so you think about that over the course 
of evolutionary history,

510
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:20,980
like this is still happening,
by the way.

511
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,143
So you know,
there's still isolated tribes in the 

512
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:26,350
Amazon.
And so when the miners or the oil,

513
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,483
you know the oil explorers or whatever,
go into the jungle and they find a new 

514
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:32,200
tribe,
it's like they interacted,

515
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,670
poof,
then the whole tribe's dead.

516
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,463
And so you think how often in our 
evolutionary history has it been the 

517
00:28:38,441 --> 00:28:42,310
case that when we encountered a group 
that had been separated us from,

518
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,173
from us historically,
that one or the other of the group just 

519
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,640
basically all died.
God only knows and we are.

520
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:49,474
So that's something to think about 
because what's one of the things that 

521
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:56,731
seems to happen is that we associate the
strange and unknown and foreign with the

522
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:02,140
disgusting and contaminating as well as 
with the frightening and uncontrollable.

523
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,303
And I think the best way to 
conceptualize that is as a global pred 

524
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,723
prey Predator response.
We're responding using the biological 

525
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:10,054
systems that we originally used to 
protect us from predators that were 

526
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:16,470
lurking.
And I don't know if you've ever might,

527
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,313
my daughter picked up a garter snake at 
one point and the males exude this sort 

528
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:23,260
of sticky substance that's protective 
that I tell you,

529
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,094
man,
there is nothing in the world that 

530
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:29,050
smells worse than that.
It's just indescribably horrible.

531
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:31,640
And she used to keep snakes in her room 
and um,

532
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,660
she'd have nightmares about snakes 
fairly often,

533
00:29:34,661 --> 00:29:35,494
which I thought was quite interesting 
because I think it was probably an old 

534
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:39,610
factory issue.
But again,

535
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,444
their,
uh,

536
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,510
their biological byproducts shall we 
say,

537
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,640
are unbearably disgusting.
And so well,

538
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:50,560
what should be the response to a 
predator?

539
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,880
Hard to say,
but discussed is pretty good to go along

540
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:57,670
with fear and apprehension and 
readiness.

541
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,080
And so,
so,

542
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,110
so.
All right.

543
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,033
So then you might say,
well how is that associated with the 

544
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:11,140
fact of the unknown?
So because I was talking about betrayal,

545
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,253
said if you'd be traced someone,
then what happens basically is that you 

546
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:19,990
manifest yourself as a set of snakes.
And I said,

547
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:20,471
well,
why,

548
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:21,710
why,
why?

549
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,970
How can I justify a statement like that?
And the answer is,

550
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,793
first of all,
don't be thinking that we've never been 

551
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:32,440
preyed upon by each other.
Cause that's definitely wrong.

552
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,053
You know,
humans are a very murderous lock and 

553
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,500
we'd been running back and forth across 
the surface of the earth,

554
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,780
wiping each other out for a very long 
period of time.

555
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,913
So the idea that you're full of snakes 
is a perfectly adequate idea except 

556
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:46,660
maybe it's,
you know,

557
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:47,494
you're full of Nile crocodiles except 
you're even worse cause you have a huge 

558
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,920
brain in weapons.

559
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,540
You're one nasty thing and so to,
for me to respond to you,

560
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:56,374
revealing yourself as something other 
than what I expected as if you were a 

561
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:02,650
Predator is a perfectly reasonable thing
to do.

562
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,140
And in fact,
if you'd be traced someone,

563
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,130
it fundamentally is the case that you've
been a Predator in relationship to them.

564
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,233
You know,
it's more of an abstract Predator in 

565
00:31:11,231 --> 00:31:13,330
that you've been taking advantage of 
them.

566
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,850
But who cares?
It's close enough so that it'll work.

567
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,600
So if you understand,
if you understand,

568
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:23,074
if you're willing to accept the idea 
that you use the same systems to deal 

569
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:31,600
with profound anomalies that your 
ancestors used to deal with predators,

570
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,330
then there's a whole bunch of things 
that start to become clear.

571
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:37,180
One of them is the symbolism that's 
associated with the unknown,

572
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:42,040
but the other is the pronounced human 
tendency to demonize the foreigner.

573
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,360
So we don't demonize the foreigner.
We demonize them.

574
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:49,000
Once we get to know them,
they start out demonic,

575
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,283
they start out as prey predators,
and it's very difficult for us to pull 

576
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:54,851
back from that.
Now,

577
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:58,090
I'm not saying that's the only way we 
respond to people who are different than

578
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:58,924
us because you know there are unknown 
and the unknown is complex and there's 

579
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,060
promising that too,
but we know that for human beings,

580
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,990
negative emotions are far more powerful.
Pound for pound,

581
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:11,824
let's say.
Then positive emotions and the 

582
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:17,140
appropriate way for me to respond to you
if I don't know you is to start out with

583
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:18,970
the presupposition that maybe you'll 
kill me.

584
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,253
Now,
I don't know if you know how isolated 

585
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:25,690
tribes start to trade with each other.
It's pretty interesting.

586
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,890
So maybe they'll get some idea that 
there's another tribe around and so,

587
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,873
and maybe they'll observe that that 
tribe is doing something or rather that 

588
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:33,850
might be interesting.

589
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,683
And so what they'll do is they'll find a
border between the two territories and 

590
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:38,284
they'll leave things that might be 
valuable there and then they'll run the 

591
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,874
hell away.
And then maybe what will happen is the 

592
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:45,050
other tribal come along and if they want
those things,

593
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:48,140
they'll pick them up and they'll leave 
some other things that are valuable that

594
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:50,180
maybe they make behind.
And then,

595
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,500
you know,
that's the beginning of,

596
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,100
that's the beginning of trust,
but it's certainly not,

597
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,230
you know,
we run up to each other and see what the

598
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:58,064
hell is going to go on right off the bat
because God only knows what's going to 

599
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:02,270
happen if you do that.
And so we,

600
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,540
it's reasonable for us to conceptualize 
the foreign other as a predatory entity,

601
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,260
even though obviously that has all sorts
of catastrophic consequences,

602
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:15,920
but it doesn't matter.
Like if you want to fix that,

603
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:18,020
you have to understand why it's 
happening.

604
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,093
So it isn't that we attribute to the 
strange person and the strange idea or 

605
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:27,881
the foreigner what's negative fro from a
conscious cognitive perspective.

606
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:29,500
Although we might also do that.
It's that,

607
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,343
that's just the way we are with regards 
to things that we cannot conceptualize 

608
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:37,310
or frame in question.
Yup.

609
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,943
Okay.

610
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,360
So you'll have to make that a little bit
more specific.

611
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,723
Right.

612
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,823
Well I would say the reason that Ebay 
worked is because all it was all the 

613
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:03,570
members of the same tribe that were 
doing it.

614
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,093
We'd already laid down rules for trading
that everyone really understands and we 

615
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:09,144
automatically engage in so we could just
transfer what we already knew about 

616
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:13,860
trading to the new domain.

617
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,343
So,

618
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,840
well I think it's the basis of 
reciprocity.

619
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,790
It's basically sharing,
you know,

620
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:40,190
in human beings are deeply sharing 
creatures.

621
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:41,024
You know,
it's one of the things to think about 

622
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:44,630
when you're thinking about us wandering 
around desecrating the planet.

623
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,890
We're really good at sharing and other 
animals aren't good at that at all.

624
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:51,770
Generally speaking.
And so sharing and trading.

625
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,680
Okay.

626
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
Trading is sharing over long

627
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,220
run,
right?

628
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,003
Because you know,
if I,

629
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:02,400
if I'm only sharing with you that's,
and you're not sharing with me,

630
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,620
that's going to get pretty damn boring 
pretty quick.

631
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,753
And so you're going to be very careful 
about reciprocity arrangements and so 

632
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:11,670
that can keep the sharing going.
And that's basically what trade is.

633
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:17,570
So okay,
now you're going along and

634
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,550
you can encounter positive things that 
you can encounter negative things,

635
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:25,820
and then you can encounter the category 
of things that you don't understand.

636
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,033
And the question is,
the fundamental question is what should 

637
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:31,880
you be doing about the category of 
things that you don't understand?

638
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,860
So I'm going to go back to

639
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,900
this finger.

640
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,650
I hope this is it.
Oh good.

641
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,200
So we're going to try to understand 
this.

642
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,220
You're betrayed by someone,
okay?

643
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,050
You had them in the good person 
category.

644
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,343
All right?
Now they're not in the good person 

645
00:36:17,331 --> 00:36:18,710
category.
All right?

646
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:22,280
So exactly what are they like?
And the answer to that is,

647
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,590
while all these sub routines are up for 
grabs,

648
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,020
you don't know what any of them are 
composed of anymore.

649
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,020
So in some sense the fact that the 
person has betrayed you,

650
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,170
reveals to you their potential inner 
complexity,

651
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:34,004
and it also reveals to you the potential
potential potential inner complexity of 

652
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,600
beings in general.
All right.

653
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:46,370
Now you might want to say if something 
unexpected happens,

654
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,340
how should you calibrate your emotional 
responses?

655
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,773
And the answer to that,
because the problem is here is that 

656
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,580
responding to novelty turns out to be a 
very complicated phenomena.

657
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,683
And the reason for that is that novelty 
or a normally is a very complicated 

658
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:00,464
category.

659
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,333
And the reason for that is that 
sometimes when unexpected things happen 

660
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:05,030
to you,
they're good.

661
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,580
And other times when unexpected things 
happen to you,

662
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,623
they're bad.
And that means that they're a 

663
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:12,920
paradoxical category.
There are category two,

664
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:13,754
which the rules of logic do not apply 
because they can be be a not be your Aa 

665
00:37:17,991 --> 00:37:19,530
and na Aa at the same time.
It's,

666
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,413
it's not a good thing.
So if something unexpected happens to 

667
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:25,394
you,
what's the appropriate way to respond 

668
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,200
and answer to that is,
well,

669
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,513
you do a firsthand approximation when 
the unexpected thing first reveals 

670
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:36,644
itself.
Then basically you adopt the stance of 

671
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:44,201
this might be a fatal predatory 
manifestation and then pretty rapidly if

672
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:45,974
nothing else happens,
you're going to loosen up and start to 

673
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:54,410
infer that the unexpected thing isn't as
catastrophic as you thought it would be.

674
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,693
The question is,
how do you determine the difference 

675
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:02,600
between levels of catastrophic,
unexpected events and answer to me seems

676
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:06,470
to be found in this idea of the 
hierarchical structure.

677
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Is that all right person?
Be Tracy?

678
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,250
The idea that there are a good person no
longer holds,

679
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,670
that's very upsetting.
Why is it upsetting?

680
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,410
Oh,
here's the answer.

681
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,633
If a person is good,
how do they behave in every situation 

682
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,090
like a good person?
If they're not good,

683
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,813
how do they behave in every situation?
Now answer to that is you don't have a 

684
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:41,740
clue how they're going to behave.
So man,

685
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:42,574
they're all of a sudden extraordinarily 
complicated and so we could go through 

686
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:46,984
this.

687
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,183
Okay.

688
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,050
If you do a,
let's say you play with the baby and you

689
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:56,420
make it cry.
All right,

690
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:59,900
so,
and that's unexpected.

691
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,370
You're playing with baby,
poof,

692
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:02,840
it cries,
it's all upset about it.

693
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,360
So then what do you think about 
yourself?

694
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,093
You think,
I'm not a good person because I make 

695
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:09,950
babies cry.
It's like,

696
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:11,240
you know,
it's a reasonable inference,

697
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:12,074
right?
But you probably don't want to 

698
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:16,760
immediately leap to that conclusion.
It's an anomaly.

699
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,740
The baby cried.
It isn't what you wanted.

700
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,720
So you've got to frame that.
And normally in,

701
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:21,800
because it could be,
you know,

702
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,480
maybe the mother comes running in and 
says,

703
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,210
Huh,
I got a story about this.

704
00:39:29,211 --> 00:39:30,044
So one of my friends,
he's kind of a wild guy and he was 

705
00:39:33,891 --> 00:39:36,260
babysitting his daughter at another

706
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,920
woman,
a woman started from down the street.

707
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:40,754
Hey.
And so he plays with them and he plays 

708
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:42,594
with them,
you know,

709
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,943
pretty intensely.
And so the kids love that except when 

710
00:39:46,411 --> 00:39:47,600
they don't.
So,

711
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,013
so what he's doing is he likes to chase 
his daughter around with this remote 

712
00:39:52,801 --> 00:39:54,720
control car,
you know,

713
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,540
so he's chasing his daughter round with 
this remote control car.

714
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:58,374
And she's having a fine time and her 
friend is there and she's also running 

715
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:03,420
away from the remote control car.
And uh,

716
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,793
you know,
they're having fun and then the two 

717
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:10,740
girls run into the closet and hide.
And so my friend is like roaring the car

718
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,390
up against the,
the,

719
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:13,224
uh,
outside of the closet and scratching at 

720
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:17,070
it a little bit then.
And then his daughter says,

721
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,501
Daddy,
Daddy,

722
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,830
you have to stop.
Uh,

723
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,790
my friend is crying and it's for real.

724
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,571
It's like,
okay.

725
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:28,110
So he's feeling pretty bad about that.
So he takes the little kids out and he's

726
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:30,030
picking up the daughter and given her a 
pat,

727
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:32,700
and then she's pretty upset.
She's wailing away about this.

728
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,570
And then the doorbell rings and it's the
girl's mother.

729
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,520
And then he's thinking,
Huh,

730
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,383
I just chased this girl into the closet 
and then made like scratchy monster 

731
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:46,380
noises on outside and now she's really 
upset.

732
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,993
How exactly am I going to explain this 
in a way that doesn't make me look like 

733
00:40:50,821 --> 00:40:53,010
a pathological beast?
So,

734
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,160
hey,
here's kind of a pathological beast.

735
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:57,660
So it's a good question.
But anyways,

736
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,390
you see that,
you see,

737
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,120
hopefully you see the point there.
So all right,

738
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:11,620
now the question that he posed to his 
neighbor was,

739
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,583
where in the hierarchy did I go wrong?
And what he was afraid of was that her 

740
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:18,714
response would be if you chase my child 
into the closet and then made monster 

741
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:26,010
noises and scared her so much that she's
this upset,

742
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,320
that doesn't mean you don't know how to 
play with the baby.

743
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,570
That means that you are not a good 
person.

744
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,340
Right?
Right,

745
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,740
right.
So,

746
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,460
so you can see how that inference can 
propagate itself up this chain.

747
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,950
Now,
generally speaking,

748
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,153
if you make an error like that,
you should make the presupposition that 

749
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:46,364
one of your local routines is at fault.
And you should also make that 

750
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:49,634
proposition in relationship to whoever 
might be making a mistake like that 

751
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:53,894
around you.
You should start from the high 

752
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:56,600
resolution level and say,
well,

753
00:41:56,601 --> 00:42:00,560
maybe they are missing a micro skill 
instead of the low resolution level,

754
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:01,394
which is they're a bad person.
Now the problem with that sometimes is 

755
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:07,010
it the reason that things didn't go well
for them is that they are a bad person.

756
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:07,844
But probably you should explore that 
possibility a bit before immediately 

757
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:12,974
leaping to that conclusion.
Because if you do leap to that 

758
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:17,540
conclusion and you're wrong,
that's also a huge problem.

759
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,980
The problem is is that when the 
unexpected occurrence occurs,

760
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:22,814
like in this story,
the entire framework is up for debate 

761
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,070
because you don't know how to localize 
the,

762
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,520
the error and you don't know how to 
localize its magnitude.

763
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,533
And so what your body will do is default
to the worst possible option at least 

764
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:37,210
initially.
And then you,

765
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,650
and that makes sense cause that's a 
defensive reaction,

766
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,970
right?
And so,

767
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,043
and that can really get out of hand.
I mean it got out of hand with the 

768
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:44,654
daycare scandals in the 1980s when,
you know there were daycare centers all 

769
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,334
over the United States and Canada where 
there are these horrible stories 

770
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:53,054
emerging of say,
titanic ritual abuse in the daycare 

771
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:56,540
centers.
And it's like,

772
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,110
well that's pretty bad.
You'd go up to the top and you say,

773
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,120
you know,
not only are you not a good person,

774
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,190
you're actually Satan himself or you 
know,

775
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:05,200
a pretty good,
uh,

776
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,290
pretty good,
uh,

777
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,090
what,
uh,

778
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,690
approximation,
a sufficiently good approximation.

779
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,940
So the title is,
is accurate.

780
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,223
So,
and that caused a lot of people a 

781
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:18,350
tremendous amount of trouble.
But it's a perfectly,

782
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,100
it's an a priori,
undifferentiated natural response.

783
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,410
And the category of Satan,
so to speak,

784
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:27,740
is individual human being has hyper 
predator.

785
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,173
That's a perfectly reasonable category 
because individual human beings are 

786
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:34,520
hyper predators.
So luckily enough,

787
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:36,590
that's not all we are.
So,

788
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,083
all right.
So the idea in some sense is that when 

789
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:43,460
you're walking along and something 
unexpected happens to you,

790
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,130
you basically fall into a hole in the 
hole,

791
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:49,790
is the complexity that's underlying your
presuppositions.

792
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,803
And that's a whole different place.
And then the next proposition I would 

793
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,440
say to a next proposition I would like 
to lay out is that we actually represent

794
00:43:57,441 --> 00:44:01,490
that domain symbolically.
And we represented first of all,

795
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:04,010
often as a whole.
So it's the,

796
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,353
it's the water you plunge into when the 
ice beneath your feet breaks the thin 

797
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:09,320
ice.

798
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,620
You're always skating on.
It's the underworld of the ancients.

799
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:13,723
It's hell.
It's the place you go when you're 

800
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:18,960
desperate and anxious and unhappy.
Um,

801
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,400
it's the source of all terrible things.
But at the same time,

802
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:26,930
it's also the source of all possibility,
because as the unexpected itself,

803
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:27,764
as the anomalous itself,
it's not only everything that can 

804
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:30,884
terrify and destroy you,
but it's also everything new that can 

805
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,151
emerge as a consequence of old habits 
and presuppositions falling apart.

806
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,613
There were erroneous.
And so I would say one level of 

807
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:43,614
representation that we use for that 
domain and for the Denisons of that 

808
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:51,951
domain is prey animal.
And so that's roughly toothy reptile.

809
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,910
And that can be subterranean toothy 
reptile,

810
00:44:56,911 --> 00:45:00,260
or it can be under the oceans toothy 
reptile and,

811
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,540
and their variants of that.
And they take monstrous form,

812
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,880
you know,
so it's a complex of,

813
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:09,180
of things that will destroy you in a 
predatory manner.

814
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,043
So that's one domain of symbolism.
The other domain of symbolism is that 

815
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:14,064
which I lies outside tribal territory.
That's no man's land and no man's land 

816
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:19,734
is in a complicated way.
That's where you go when you're 

817
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:25,800
culturally sanctioned.
Presuppositions do no longer function.

818
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,490
It's a weird thing because on the one 
hand you could go outside the borders of

819
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:30,930
your community,
you know,

820
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:33,360
as a physical act.
On the other hand,

821
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:34,194
you can go outside the metaphysical 
boundaries of your community by acting 

822
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:40,530
out a culturally sanctified role and 
failing.

823
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,873
Cause as soon as you fail,
then you're somewhere that your culture 

824
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:46,560
isn't.
And that's for all intents and purposes,

825
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,200
that's unexplored territory.
It's not just a metaphor,

826
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,034
it's actually the case.
It's just the idea of territory is much 

827
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:53,154
more complicated.
And then the other domain that seems to 

828
00:45:55,411 --> 00:46:00,411
be consistently used to represent the 
unknown as such is the feminine.

829
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,300
And the reason for that,
as far as I can tell,

830
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:04,134
we talked about this a little bit,
is that females are actually the 

831
00:46:06,451 --> 00:46:09,090
gatekeepers to propagation among human 
beings.

832
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:13,050
And so the idea that they should be 
symbolically represented by the terrible

833
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:17,910
and re rejecting element of nature is 
perfectly reasonable perspective,

834
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,170
even though it's harsh,
but also because the unknown is not only

835
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:26,310
the place where terrible things happen,
it's also the place where everything new

836
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:27,750
was born,
so to speak.

837
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:32,340
And the most salient characteristic of 
the feminine is that the feminine is the

838
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:36,750
place where new things are born.
And we had to use some damn category for

839
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:37,590
it,
you know,

840
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:38,424
and we only had a certain number of 
categories at hand because of our 

841
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:41,784
biological evolution.
So what happens is you're wandering 

842
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:47,430
around in your life and then you fall 
into a hole.

843
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,620
And the question is how big is the hole?

844
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,350
And at the moment you're falling,
you don't know.

845
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,780
So I have another story.
So I had a friend who was,

846
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:55,883
he used to hang out in the bush and 
British Columbia and now and then he 

847
00:46:58,561 --> 00:46:59,394
would be tromping around their owed in 
the winter and sometimes he'd crossed 

848
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:02,004
rivers.
And one time he was crossing a river 

849
00:47:02,941 --> 00:47:05,700
that was covered with snow and he fell 
through the surface.

850
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,710
Now he was very lucky because what he 
had fallen through was a bubble of ice.

851
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,620
So we sell about four feet and he hit 
the ice again.

852
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:14,723
But you can imagine what must have been 
going on in his little sphere of the 

853
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:18,414
world during the one 10th of a second 
where he was falling before he hit the 

854
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:23,700
new ice.
Well that's,

855
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,470
that's a good story to indicate,
you know,

856
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,000
the similarity between the unexpected 
and falling into the underworld.

857
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,833
And one of the things that I think is 
extraordinarily useful is that once you 

858
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:35,704
guys know that the idea of a journey to 
the underworld is the same thing as the 

859
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:42,154
idea of the validity of your conceptual 
structures breaking out from underneath 

860
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:52,150
you and plunging you into the complexity
that characterize his life,

861
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,240
then you have one of the keys that you 
need to understand mythology.

862
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:59,020
And that's a big deal because most of 
our history,

863
00:47:59,050 --> 00:47:59,883
like our cultural history is presented 
to us in the form of extraordinarily 

864
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:07,120
ancient stories.
And the categories those stories use are

865
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,960
as far as I can tell,
are the categories that I'm outlining to

866
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:11,794
you.
And once you know what the categories 

867
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:13,834
mean,
then you can read the stories and they 

868
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:15,724
make sense.
And that's a mind bogglingly important 

869
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:22,540
thing because some of the stories that 
we're going to be studying,

870
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,720
like people worked on those things for 
150,000

871
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:29,600
years,
you know,

872
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:30,434
and now maybe that's an overstatement,
but we certainly know that they worked 

873
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:34,780
on them for thousands of years.

874
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,630
And if you can't understand them,
it's a big problem.

875
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,464
You know,
before maybe you could just believe 

876
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:41,290
them,
whatever that meant.

877
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:42,683
But people,
modern people can't do that anymore 

878
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:44,974
because partly because I think because 
we've developed that a new kind of 

879
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:52,330
cognitive system that essentially 
response to the world as if it's a place

880
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:55,510
of objective material,
but,

881
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,550
and that's fine.
It's really useful.

882
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,890
Maybe it'll kill us,
but it's certainly useful.

883
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,173
But then there's this other cognitive 
domain that we actually have to 

884
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:07,920
understand because without it,
we're bereft of our history and our,

885
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,873
our values are the bedrock values that 
we use to orient ourselves in time and 

886
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:16,840
space and to protect us from the 
catastrophic release of our emotions.

887
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,330
All of that's invalidated.
And you might say,

888
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:19,871
well,
you know,

889
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,220
does that really matter?
And it's like,

890
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,293
well,
I don't know how many of you have gone 

891
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:26,770
through nihilistic periods in your life,
but I suspect that it's more than one or

892
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:27,604
two.

893
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,550
So that's one danger is that when the,
when,

894
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,850
when the validity of your value system 
is,

895
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,773
is demolished,
then you end up in a place where 

896
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:38,710
everything's so terrible and 
overwhelming that you cannot survive.

897
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,940
And one response to that is you become 
nihilistic and depressed and anxious,

898
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:46,690
and that's not merely psychological.
That's really hard on you.

899
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:48,550
It can undermine your entire wheel to 
live,

900
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:49,503
can even drive you to suicide.
And other option is you adopt some 

901
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:53,194
moronic totalitarian ideology that 
purports to explain everything with a 

902
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,034
few simple axioms.
And that's each equally catastrophic 

903
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:00,484
because that makes you immediately a 
danger to anyone who doesn't believe 

904
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:06,550
what you believe.
Plus you're fragile because you know,

905
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:10,210
if it's a simplistic but coherent 
ideology,

906
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,044
like the idea that all knowledge systems
are motivated only by the pursuit of 

907
00:50:14,891 --> 00:50:17,380
power,
it's like good luck implementing that in

908
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:17,830
the world.

909
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:18,663
You know,
you'll find out pretty soon that that 

910
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,990
sort of theory is just not going to get 
you anywhere at all.

911
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,990
So it makes you brittle and fragile.
So.

912
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,493
All right,
so I'm going to stop and let you ask 

913
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:32,654
questions because I,
I threw a lot of information at you in 

914
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:37,520
the last three weeks and what I want to 
do now,

915
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:38,354
I'm going to,
the next thing is I'm going to tell you 

916
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:43,310
a little bit about the brain areas that 
are associated with the information,

917
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:46,100
information processing phenomena that I 
described.

918
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:49,610
So like one of the things that's quite 
interesting apart from the fact that the

919
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:52,100
exploratory system is grounded in the 
Hypothalamus,

920
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:52,934
which is mind boggling,
mind boggling stock given how the 

921
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:58,610
hypothalamus operates,
is that your right hemisphere,

922
00:50:58,970 --> 00:50:59,803
if you're lefthanded and relatively 
lateralized in the approximately 

923
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:04,574
normative manner,
your right hemisphere basically deals 

924
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:07,334
with novelty and anomaly and your left 
hemisphere deals with explored 

925
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:10,790
territory.

926
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:14,630
So it's sort of like you have,
your brain is split in a manner.

927
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,020
So that one part of it,
which is mostly responsible for negative

928
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:18,854
emotions.
So that's the right hemisphere is kind 

929
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,244
of good at global pattern,
global quick pattern recognition and it 

930
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,993
responds to anomaly and novelty with its
initial formulations of what might be 

931
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:30,764
there.
And then the left hemisphere is 

932
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:34,070
specialized for operation and explored 
territory.

933
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,263
So the left hemisphere is primarily 
what's operating when you're somewhere 

934
00:51:38,691 --> 00:51:41,240
that you understand and everything is 
going according to plan.

935
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,550
And it's pretty damn interesting.
You can,

936
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:44,331
if you,
you know,

937
00:51:44,331 --> 00:51:47,960
if you're dubious about the validity of 
this theory,

938
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:50,810
you could look up elk Colon Goldberg.
So He's,

939
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:54,110
he's one of the people who've proposed 
the novelty,

940
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,253
uh,
unexplored territory explored territory 

941
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:01,560
dichotomy with regards to Brayden 
hemispheric specialization.

942
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:05,270
And Goldberg was a student of Luria and 
Gloria was a student of Pavlov.

943
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,103
And like,
there's a pretty vicious intellectual 

944
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:08,114
history there.
So it's not something to be dispensed 

945
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:11,010
with lightly.
Um,

946
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,940
he thinks the reason that the left 
hemisphere is linguistic,

947
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:15,350
roughly speaking,
is because it,

948
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,293
it,
it,

949
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,893
because the ability do you use 
linguistic systems is one of its 

950
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:21,344
preconditions is that you're operating 
in a domain where things are understood 

951
00:52:24,081 --> 00:52:25,640
and shared.
So,

952
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,283
so there's that.
And then there's the response of your 

953
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:32,990
emotional systems that are at least in 
part,

954
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:33,824
the hippocampus.
We mediated that outlined the manner in 

955
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:37,724
which you respond to novelty.
So we're going to talk about both of 

956
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,124
those things.
And the prefrontal cortex is very good 

957
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:44,330
for exploration and abstract 
representation.

958
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,400
So I'm going to lay out a bit of a brain
theory.

959
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,473
And then the next thing we're going to 
do is start to look at narrative 

960
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:53,011
patterns.
I,

961
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:55,730
I want to show you one more slide.
Sorry,

962
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,770
before,
before we,

963
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,343
I want to show you that one.
Now most of you have seen that probably 

964
00:53:02,871 --> 00:53:03,860
a multiple times.

965
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,153
Yeah,

966
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,660
but here's the idea.
You're going along just fine.

967
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,770
Something emerges from the depths so to 
speak.

968
00:53:13,771 --> 00:53:16,860
So it's some complex phenomena that was 
here to,

969
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,590
for invisible that made its 
manifestation.

970
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,310
It knocks the validity out of your 
current mode of operation.

971
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,850
And it plunges you into a place chaotic 
and complex,

972
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,863
where you flail about mostly a negative 
emotion depending on how radical the 

973
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:36,630
discontinuity is.
Cause if it's just a little one mile,

974
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,640
maybe you'll find it exciting.
But if it's a big one,

975
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:40,620
man,
you're down there in the dumps,

976
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:43,290
so to speak,
for a very long period of time.

977
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,500
Now with any luck,
and this is sort of piaget,

978
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:46,343
Eddie and idea,
you do some exploration and some 

979
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:53,760
recategorize Zation you ingest the new 
information that was associated with the

980
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:54,594
anomalous event.
So that's like the treasure that the 

981
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:57,264
dragon guards and then park.
You pop up and you have a new framework 

982
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:01,284
of reference and it's better than the 
old one in that it does everything the 

983
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:05,760
old one did.

984
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,850
Plus it accounts for the new thing that 
brought you down.

985
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,540
Now if you can't do that and you've been
hit hard,

986
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,733
then you have something like post 
traumatic stress disorder or an anxiety 

987
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:17,004
disorder,
longterm depression and you're stuck 

988
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:22,140
down there and chaos and the underworld 
and maybe you never get back up.

989
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,040
So narrative,
narrative,

990
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:28,680
one point a to point B and here's how to
do it.

991
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:31,710
Narrative to what do you do when your 
narrative falls apart?

992
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,800
That's a Meta narrative.
The narrative falls apart.

993
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:35,903
You fall somewhere,
something happens there that's 

994
00:54:37,801 --> 00:54:41,310
transformative or not and then you pop 
back out.

995
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,323
So the Meta narrative is a narrative 
about the transformation of narratives 

996
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,123
and it's the Meta narrative that most 
mythologies feature front and center 

997
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,940
because it's basically the same as the 
hero myth.

998
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,253
The hero myth.
The hero is the person who encounters 

999
00:54:57,301 --> 00:55:01,920
the anomalous and the unknown at a time 
and place of their choosing.

1000
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,030
Okay.

1001
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:08,120
Garners the information,
which is the treasure that the anomalous

1002
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:13,121
predatory thing guards.
And if it's a full hero myth,

1003
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:16,450
shares that with the community in 
reconstitutes themselves.

1004
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,930
And that's the fundamental story of 
mankind.

1005
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,350
Yeah.

1006
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,860
It's the fundamental story.
And if you understand the categories,

1007
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,430
all right,
if you're,

1008
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:32,130
I think if you understand the categories
in the manner that I laid out,

1009
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,993
then you can understand those stories.
And that is so cool because they're so 

1010
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:39,190
powerful and they orient you properly.
And it,

1011
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,043
it just demolishes the,
the nihilism and totalitarian belief 

1012
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,073
inducing elements of moral relativism 
and the collapse of religious belief 

1013
00:55:49,351 --> 00:55:52,350
systems because it can put some ground 
underneath your feet again,

1014
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,760
and it's,
it's important,

1015
00:55:53,761 --> 00:55:54,594
like it's,
it's a defense against it theology and 

1016
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:57,084
it's a get a defense against despair and
those things are attractive forces and 

1017
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:05,790
nihilism in particular.
It's like life is suffering.

1018
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,240
Why shouldn't you be cynical about it?
Well,

1019
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,030
that's a real question.
That question is no joke.

1020
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,170
It's like,
just get on with it.

1021
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,711
Yeah,
right.

1022
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:14,544
That's not gonna help

1023
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:17,960
ideology because of it.

1024
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,340
It's a defense.
Again,

1025
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:22,960
I can,
that's a good question.

1026
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,660
This is a defense against ediology 
because it,

1027
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,750
it tells you something different about 
the state of your being.

1028
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,120
So here,
here's how it works.

1029
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:36,700
You can be locked in your first system.
I don't care what the system is,

1030
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:38,350
you're locked in it.
You're an idiot log.

1031
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,860
Something comes along and blows your 
system into bits.

1032
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,990
You're in the underworld,
you're in chaos.

1033
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:44,824
So it's,
you're either an idiot log or pretend 

1034
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:47,830
protected or poof,
you're blown into bits.

1035
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,053
Okay.
Well then another identity you could 

1036
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:51,934
have instead of the identity of the 
initial framework is you can have the 

1037
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:59,300
identity of being in chaos and then 
you're sort of a nihilist.

1038
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,910
You know,
you're fundamentally depressed,

1039
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:01,744
you're cynical about the world,
it's hard for you to get motivated and 

1040
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:05,440
so forth.
So that's your identity.

1041
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:10,540
Or You could have the identity that you 
rebuilt after going through one of those

1042
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:11,680
processes and you think,
well,

1043
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:14,860
that'd be an improvement because it's a 
better identity than the previous one,

1044
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:16,023
and it's certainly a lot more pleasant 
than being neck deep in snakes and 

1045
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:22,090
lizards.
And so,

1046
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:22,924
so that's an improvement.
But then there's a step that you can 

1047
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:25,624
take this further that's better,
which is forget about identifying with 

1048
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:29,314
the first stage or the second stage,
which is the collapse or the third 

1049
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,630
stage.
Forget about all of that.

1050
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,270
Realize that you're the process of doing
that.

1051
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,033
That's what you are fundamentally,
so you don't have to identify with what 

1052
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:49,510
you believe and you don't know.
I have to identify with despair.

1053
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,823
You can identify with the process of 
coming to terms with the world as it 

1054
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:55,144
manifests itself.
And you do embody that process if you 

1055
00:57:58,661 --> 00:57:59,890
want.
And not only that,

1056
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,140
well,
you're engaged in that process.

1057
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,600
Number one,
your engaged.

1058
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,060
That's a good thing.
And number two,

1059
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:10,090
the systems that protect you against 
despair and pain.

1060
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:12,430
So if you're going to think about it 
biologically,

1061
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:16,120
that would be the dopaminergic system.
Primarily that thing is on.

1062
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:19,240
You're in the game,
but you're a player,

1063
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:20,074
you're not the game.
And I believe that what religious 

1064
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:23,194
stories attempt to teach people among 
very many other things is that you're 

1065
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:29,950
not the bloody game and you're not the 
chaos of defeat.

1066
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,173
You're the player and you play many 
games and the meaning is in the playing 

1067
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,593
and it's not.
It's not a platitude that is actually 

1068
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:45,430
where the meaning is and the meaning is 
it real?

1069
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,300
And so then the question is,
the more fundamental question is,

1070
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:54,330
is that meaning real enough to protect 
you from cynicism and nihilism?

1071
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:59,500
And answer to that is you have to figure
that out for yourself because no one can

1072
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:00,334
tell you that.
But the stories can show you the way so 

1073
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:04,990
to speak,
which is why they're there.

1074
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:12,320
When you said experience and what does 
that mean?

1075
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,733
So Dostoyevsky's in the prison after 
getting arrested by the czar's men and 

1076
00:59:20,881 --> 00:59:23,310
then six in the morning after a couple 
of weeks in his cell,

1077
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:25,620
they take them out into the courtyard 
and shoot him with blanks.

1078
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:27,203
Yeah.
That moment when he's standing there 

1079
00:59:28,051 --> 00:59:28,884
before he's going to be shot.
That's a religious experience and the 

1080
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:34,680
thing it is,
it overwhelmed him to such a degree that

1081
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:38,160
it basically gave him epilepsy,
so like full,

1082
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,560
there's a reason I say that in the Old 
Testament,

1083
00:59:40,561 --> 00:59:41,394
God is represented as the burning Bush.
It's like don't get too close to that 

1084
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,414
stuff.
It'll,

1085
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,093
it's too much.
The reality that transcends your models 

1086
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,130
free.
Forget about personified representations

1087
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:53,964
of the day and for the time being,
the reality that transcends your models 

1088
00:59:57,121 --> 01:00:01,740
is sufficient so that if you're exposed 
to it at an untrammeled manner,

1089
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:02,783
it will hurt you.
It might destroy you and it's not a 

1090
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:06,594
trivial sort of objective experience.
It's like the law that rat feels when 

1091
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:15,090
it's trapped in the corner by a very 
large cat,

1092
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,460
terrorist stands up.
You know,

1093
01:00:17,461 --> 01:00:19,470
when you feel awe,
what happens?

1094
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,660
Your hair stands on end.
Yeah.

1095
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,523
Well there's a reason for that.
It's like the remnants of a prey 

1096
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:25,530
response.
So

1097
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,500
also be enlightened.

1098
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,720
Yeah,
but who wants that?

1099
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:31,970
You know,
because of your,

1100
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:34,280
your new age types and your Joseph 
Campbell's,

1101
01:00:34,281 --> 01:00:34,881
they say,
well,

1102
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:35,780
you know,
enlightenment,

1103
01:00:35,781 --> 01:00:36,680
it's all good.
It's like,

1104
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:37,970
forget that.
Believe me,

1105
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:39,890
if it was all good,
people would be doing it.

1106
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,143
It's not all good.
And that's one of the major differences 

1107
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:45,830
say between the unions and the new age 
people,

1108
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:48,080
the new age people say,
follow your bliss.

1109
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:48,711
It's like,
yeah,

1110
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,690
right.
The union say,

1111
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:52,610
look,
follow what you're interested in.

1112
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:53,444
It will take you places you do not want 
to go and you're not getting anywhere 

1113
01:00:56,961 --> 01:01:00,140
until you go to those places.
And so everyone takes one look and says,

1114
01:01:00,141 --> 01:01:00,980
Hey,
no,

1115
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,840
that theory's wrong.
It's like,

1116
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:04,970
it's not wrong.
It's just very,

1117
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:05,804
very difficult.
So enlightenment is down first and then 

1118
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:10,850
up and the more enlightened do you want 
to get,

1119
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:12,500
the more you go down before you go up?

1120
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,810
Me Ask him that.

1121
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,913
That's a harder question.
I think part of what enlightenment is 

1122
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:24,960
not,
is not hiding behind the shields of your

1123
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:28,200
tentative belief systems.
That's one way of thinking about it.

1124
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,090
Another way of thinking about it,
I think,

1125
01:01:30,091 --> 01:01:30,924
is that if you're engaged in a 
conversation with someone with whom you 

1126
01:01:34,171 --> 01:01:36,810
disagree,
the more you're enlightened,

1127
01:01:36,811 --> 01:01:37,644
the more you'll listen to them.
Because otherwise you have to prove to 

1128
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,450
them that the way you look at the world 
is correct.

1129
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,030
Well,
that's not an enlightened stance.

1130
01:01:45,031 --> 01:01:47,280
That's a dogmatic and totalitarian 
stance.

1131
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:48,331
It's like,
I'm right,

1132
01:01:48,331 --> 01:01:49,590
I'm right.
Here's why.

1133
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:50,963
It's like,
fine.

1134
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,253
Except if I'm right,
I already know what I'm writing about 

1135
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:54,923
and if you disagree with me,
there's always the possibility that you 

1136
01:01:57,241 --> 01:01:58,074
know something I don't like horrifying 
is that possibility is so listening to 

1137
01:02:02,911 --> 01:02:03,744
you would be a good idea.
And so then another way of thinking 

1138
01:02:05,191 --> 01:02:07,320
about that is you can think about this 
yourself.

1139
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:13,320
What's your friend?
What you know or what you don't know.

1140
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,113
And part of identifying with the process
of transformation instead of the stages 

1141
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:20,670
of it,
is understand that what you don't know,

1142
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,800
it's a more reliable friend than what 
you know.

1143
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,083
First of all,
there's a lot of it you're not going to 

1144
01:02:25,471 --> 01:02:27,570
run out.
And second,

1145
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:29,460
every time you encounter it 
successfully,

1146
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:30,743
the world becomes a more comprehensible 
place and you become a more powerful 

1147
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:35,220
force.
So you know,

1148
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:37,890
you could be running around all the time
looking for little things that you don't

1149
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:42,180
know makes you tough and awake and 
that's,

1150
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:43,014
and if you're tough and awake,
maybe you don't have to believe things 

1151
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:48,300
to make sense out of life.
Maybe your life is so damn rich that you

1152
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:48,781
think,
yeah,

1153
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:49,614
well,
you know,

1154
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,820
suffering,
disease,

1155
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:52,020
death,
tyranny,

1156
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:52,741
all that.
It's like,

1157
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:56,220
yeah,
well I can deal with that.

1158
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,820
I don't want to wish it away even though
I'd rather it wasn't there.

1159
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,043
That's not the point.
It's like I can have my eyes open and 

1160
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:04,970
see that and still think,
no,

1161
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,440
this is worth,
this is worth continuing.

1162
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:26,081
Oh yeah.
Well,

1163
01:03:26,081 --> 01:03:27,640
through experience and training.
Yeah.

1164
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:29,620
Because I mean,
think about it this way.

1165
01:03:29,621 --> 01:03:32,200
It's like you guys just don't have 
enough life to figure everything out for

1166
01:03:32,201 --> 01:03:34,000
yourselves.
You know,

1167
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:34,841
it's,
forget it,

1168
01:03:34,841 --> 01:03:36,700
you can't do it.
Life's too complicated.

1169
01:03:36,701 --> 01:03:37,534
Then you're too short.
You're life is too short and you're not 

1170
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:40,690
that smart,
you know?

1171
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:45,520
And so unless you have guidance,
obviously people have to be socialized,

1172
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,833
you know,
they have to be socialized or they're 

1173
01:03:48,281 --> 01:03:49,114
just ruined.
The question is what's the end product 

1174
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:54,280
of the socialization?
One is well nihilistic,

1175
01:03:54,281 --> 01:03:55,900
totalitarian,
you know,

1176
01:03:55,901 --> 01:03:56,734
the other is the other is the person who
has one foot in order in one foot in 

1177
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:05,334
chaos.
And that's a better place to be because 

1178
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:10,340
the world isn't just order and it's not 
just chaos

1179
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,873
scientific.

1180
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:29,360
Well I think that's what happened in the
20th century and that's what we're going

1181
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:30,194
to take a look at.
Like part of the re I told talk to you 

1182
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:35,270
guys about nature and his announcement 
at the end of the 19th century,

1183
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:35,841
you know?
Okay.

1184
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:37,310
So what are you,
is announcing his,

1185
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,490
oh no.
Our new mode of thinking has invalidated

1186
01:04:40,491 --> 01:04:43,530
our old modes of thinking.
And that's not it.

1187
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,560
It's like a mass.
It's like a giant,

1188
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,710
it's like a murder of the most valuable 
thing you can imagine.

1189
01:04:48,711 --> 01:04:52,790
That was his perspective.
And then his observation was look out.

1190
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,910
Cause when something of that magnitude 
dies,

1191
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:59,690
there's a big void and something's going
to take its place.

1192
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,270
So what took its place?
What's pretty all of this.

1193
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:06,140
I mean communist totalitarianism took 
its place.

1194
01:05:06,141 --> 01:05:08,360
That was pretty much half the planet.
We haven't quite,

1195
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:09,194
you know,
scrapped all the problems that were 

1196
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:12,110
associated with that.
And then there's,

1197
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,720
there's widespread nihilism and,
and,

1198
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:18,040
and like a pathological form of 
relativism.

1199
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,140
So,
and for neat chair,

1200
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:24,310
those were the two options.
It's like where else do you have to go?

1201
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:26,783
Well

1202
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:30,250
that's what happened and it wasn't good.
And I think,

1203
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:31,084
you know,
it's like one of the things that Viktor 

1204
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:34,503
Frankl said about his clients,
his clinical clients and Frankl was a 

1205
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:40,090
psych psychologist who'd been through 
the concentration camps.

1206
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:42,310
You know,
he said that very frequently.

1207
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:47,290
The problem that his clients came to him
about was the problem of meaning.

1208
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,153
It's like the,
and I think who was it that said he 

1209
01:05:50,871 --> 01:05:51,704
opened his book?
I think it was Camou the only 

1210
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:57,310
philosophical question worth posing is 
why not commit suicide?

1211
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:59,350
Now it's a little on the depressing 
side,

1212
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:02,710
but if you ever talk to someone who's 
thinking about committing suicide,

1213
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:03,544
I'll tell you,
they can come up with some pretty 

1214
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:07,360
comprehensive answers for why that's a 
reasonable thing to do.

1215
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:08,403
And you know,
you just don't leap there from happy to 

1216
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:12,940
suicidal.
You have to go through a lengthy process

1217
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:16,180
of determining just exactly why suicide 
is the appropriate option,

1218
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,860
you know,
unless you're tremendously impulsive.

1219
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,100
And so to me it's like if we lose our 
grounding in history,

1220
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,360
given that were historical creatures and
if we lose the proper sense of identity,

1221
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,330
then we're either going to be weak or 
dangerous.

1222
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,030
Those are the options.
And if you're weak,

1223
01:06:31,031 --> 01:06:32,950
you're dangerous,
and if you're dangerous,

1224
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:34,000
you're weak.
So like,

1225
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,030
you know,
either way it's not good.

1226
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,433
And I also think,
and this is skipping ahead in the class 

1227
01:06:40,481 --> 01:06:41,314
a lot,
is to the degree that you think that 

1228
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,003
existence is unbearable because if it's 
meaningless structure and it's implicit 

1229
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:49,594
suffering,
it's going to be a big chunk of your 

1230
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:56,131
psyche that's wandering down genocidal 
and apocalyptic lanes.

1231
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,800
Because if it's pointless misery,
why not put an end to it?

1232
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:04,673
And you know,
if you don't think that people are 

1233
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:06,654
trying to figure that out all the time,
you're just not paying any attention 

1234
01:07:08,881 --> 01:07:11,280
because people are trying to figure that
out all the time.

1235
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,740
So,
and if you read,

1236
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:16,020
okay,

1237
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,900
the brothers Karamazov I think is the 
best example of this.

1238
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:21,060
You know,
Dostoyevsky has a figure in the brothers

1239
01:07:21,061 --> 01:07:24,060
Karamazov whose name is Ivan and Ivan's 
a pretty vicious character.

1240
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:25,800
He smart as can be.
He's good looking.

1241
01:07:25,801 --> 01:07:27,420
He gets along well with people,
he's,

1242
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,920
you know,
he's debonair,

1243
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:29,754
Suave and he's a committed nihilist and 
he has a rational arguments to backup 

1244
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:37,710
his nihilism like that are the most 
powerful ones Dostoyevsky could invent.

1245
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:38,993
And so there are powerful enough,
like he's done as good a job as anybody 

1246
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:45,930
needs to.
And he puts forth a vicious argument for

1247
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,960
the pointlessness and essential 
immorality of existence.

1248
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,473
Well,

1249
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,780
maybe he's right,
maybe not.

1250
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,093
That's the question.
So part of what I've been trying to 

1251
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:08,090
figure out is how could it be possible 
that Ivan is wrong?

1252
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,460
And if so,
why?

1253
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:15,990
And that's what I'm trying to tell you 
is that these that we think

1254
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:16,823
of as archaic superstitions are not 
theories about objective reality and 

1255
01:08:22,021 --> 01:08:24,720
they're not archaic and they're not 
superstitious.

1256
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:25,973
And not only that,
you already live by their dictates in 

1257
01:08:28,051 --> 01:08:29,910
one form or another,
whether you know it or not.

1258
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,313
And they're,
the old stories are perennially 

1259
01:08:32,971 --> 01:08:37,110
attractive to you and you need the,
you can't live without them.

1260
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:41,460
So what I'm trying to do,
what I've tried to do is to figure out

1261
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:48,823
how they can be true while still 
allowing the other things that we know 

1262
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:55,094
as modern people to be true.
So that's what we're trying to figure 

1263
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:01,880
out.
Other questions,

1264
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,043
it's the actual stories themselves.
You're trying to think of how can the 

1265
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:07,530
two religious stories be true?

1266
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:11,250
Yeah,
and what it means for them to be true.

1267
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,593
What that means.
Because one of the things we've been 

1268
01:09:14,461 --> 01:09:15,294
doing over the last three weeks,
it's thinking what does it mean for 

1269
01:09:17,851 --> 01:09:20,640
something to be true?
That is not a simple question.

1270
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,133
And one idea is that theories about 
objective world are the only form of 

1271
01:09:26,401 --> 01:09:29,160
truth,
but that's not that.

1272
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:30,170
First of all,
that can't,

1273
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:34,710
that can't be true because your problem 
is how to act and you might say,

1274
01:09:34,711 --> 01:09:35,544
well that's not a real problem.
It's like at at that point in the 

1275
01:09:39,061 --> 01:09:39,894
discussion,
then we start talking about what's real 

1276
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:43,020
and what isn't.
Right.

1277
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,303
It's such a deep question that the 
nature of your term starts to become 

1278
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,083
important.
And I would say the most important 

1279
01:09:49,831 --> 01:09:53,730
question that you have to answer is how 
and why to live.

1280
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,890
And you might think,
well that's an episode nominal question.

1281
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,411
It's like,
well,

1282
01:09:58,411 --> 01:09:59,730
I don't,
I don't think it is.

1283
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,700
And I don't think there's any evidence 
that it is.

1284
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:03,983
I think it's a proposition that it is,
and I don't think it's supported by the 

1285
01:10:07,591 --> 01:10:08,424
fact,
and that's what you're going to be 

1286
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,370
trying to figure out while we go through
this course.

1287
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:15,900
So other questions and if any of the 
things I don't,

1288
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,080
if I say don't make sense,
please tell me.

1289
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:22,200
Because I know that I,
it's complicated thing to try to explain

1290
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:31,220
religion,
that structure of beliefs too,

1291
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:38,990
but actual religion dogma that goes with
that.

1292
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:46,310
And people can take that more literally 
as in the objective world.

1293
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:47,853
Yeah.
The dogma is just the dominance 

1294
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:51,940
hierarchy.
So everything has a dogmatic structure.

1295
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:53,980
That doesn't mean it's,
it's right.

1296
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,950
I mean,
religions are generally made out of a,

1297
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,053
forget about religions.
Belief systems have a dogmatic element 

1298
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,600
and a transformative element.
And they're always at war because one,

1299
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,230
the,
the dogmatic element constraints,

1300
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,083
the revelatory element and the 
revelatory element undermines the 

1301
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:16,500
dogmatic element,
but they're both necessary.

1302
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:19,830
So it's a very,
it's a form of dialogue.

1303
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:20,723
It's the best way to think about,
there's gotta be a dialogue and belief 

1304
01:11:23,131 --> 01:11:26,640
systems between the structure and the 
process of updating the structure.

1305
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,013
And,
and any belief system can err too much 

1306
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:31,434
one way or the other.
And the only reason way that you can 

1307
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:36,900
figure out if you're airing is by paying
attention and,

1308
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:39,030
and,
and communicating.

1309
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,153
So,
and if you want a definition of 

1310
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:43,374
religion,
well you know that's not a straight 

1311
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:46,344
forward thing to do but I would say that
you have that you have axioms of belief 

1312
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,670
and your axioms,
whatever they are are religious entities

1313
01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:02,210
for you whether you know it or not cause
you hold them as absolutely true and,

1314
01:12:03,581 --> 01:12:06,630
and you have insufficient evidence for 
anything.

1315
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,870
So you know,
this is a cure could guardian idea,

1316
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:12,600
you are by necessity a creature of 
faith.

1317
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,033
And the reason for that is there isn't 
much of you and there's a lot of the 

1318
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:21,411
world and so you have to make 
assumptions in order to move forward.

1319
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:23,850
And you might think,
well I don't make assumptions.

1320
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,910
And then I would say,
well when you crossed the street,

1321
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:29,820
you're making an assumption.
The assumption is that the other side of

1322
01:12:29,821 --> 01:12:30,654
the street is a better place to be than 
this side of the street you're already 

1323
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:35,130
on.
So that's an assumption.

1324
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,473
You know,
maybe you're going to get hit by a bus 

1325
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:40,680
as you cross,
you know so much for that axiom,

1326
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:42,563
but you just can't move forward without 
making assumptions because if you 

1327
01:12:46,021 --> 01:12:48,870
question everything all the time,
then you're paralyzed.

1328
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:49,704
You're in chaos.

1329
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:55,660
So wondering story,
story,

1330
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,570
the negative side and ideology,
which can be extreme.

1331
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,033
So taking that

1332
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:12,110
excellent question.
Well,

1333
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:14,690
that's partly what we're going to talk 
about a lot.

1334
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:18,530
Um,
it's the difference between,

1335
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,353
it's like the difference between surfing
and being in a styrofoam bubble on a 

1336
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:24,980
lake.
You know,

1337
01:13:24,981 --> 01:13:28,070
there's a dynamic element.
So if I say,

1338
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:28,904
well,
if you're going to identify with the 

1339
01:13:29,721 --> 01:13:32,230
process of transformation,
I'm,

1340
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,133
first of all,
I'm not saying that's all you should 

1341
01:13:34,251 --> 01:13:35,480
identify with.
That's,

1342
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:40,010
that's a different question.
It might depend on where are you are and

1343
01:13:40,011 --> 01:13:40,844
what you're doing and at what stage of 
life you are and all sorts of other 

1344
01:13:42,711 --> 01:13:46,760
things.
But to the degree that you identify with

1345
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:49,340
the process that transforms belief 
systems,

1346
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,353
you're not an idiot log.
It's as simple as that because in video 

1347
01:13:53,801 --> 01:13:55,460
log is a totalitarian and they say,
well,

1348
01:13:55,461 --> 01:13:58,790
here's the bloody axioms.
Here's the system that generates,

1349
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,043
we're done.
So you're not done and you've left 

1350
01:14:04,131 --> 01:14:04,964
things out.
Now that doesn't mean you don't need 

1351
01:14:06,861 --> 01:14:08,660
structure to move forward.
Right?

1352
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:10,880
So it's a tricky thing,
but you can say,

1353
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:11,853
that's why I'm trying to communicate to 
you the idea that it's better to 

1354
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:18,070
conceptualize a belief system has a set 
of tools.

1355
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,680
They don't have to be perfect.
You know,

1356
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:21,573
you can,
you can fix a pipe with a pretty lousy 

1357
01:14:22,781 --> 01:14:26,200
wrench.
So you've got tools at your disposal and

1358
01:14:26,201 --> 01:14:30,310
you shouldn't abandon them.
We thank God for the tools,

1359
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:32,710
you know?
But if you can think of a better tool,

1360
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:36,340
it's more power to you.
So

1361
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:58,530
it seems like the religious stories

1362
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:12,783
might not help them.
It might knock them right out of the 

1363
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:16,170
bloody thing into a pit.
I mean,

1364
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,940
I've had fundamentalist Christians in my
classes before,

1365
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:19,730
you know,
and,

1366
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,563
and it's pretty,
it rattles them up pretty hard because 

1367
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:25,660
they implicit,
they're kind of funny.

1368
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,513
They're sorta like the rational atheist.
They tend to think of the religious 

1369
01:15:28,901 --> 01:15:31,630
system as a theory about objective 
reality.

1370
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:33,063
It's so funny because they both share 
that they both share the same priests 

1371
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,420
opposition.
And so,

1372
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:38,254
you know,
I outlined evidence that it's not and 

1373
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:45,700
that that often is extraordinarily hard 
on their fundamentalist viewpoint.

1374
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:47,620
So,
but that's okay with me.

1375
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:48,454
It's like,
yeah,

1376
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:02,240
over time as,
as a culture.

1377
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,620
And then that probably affected the core
of the belief system.

1378
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:06,853
The religions too.
So not even they're fully understanding 

1379
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,520
what beliefs are actually helping them 
with their lives.

1380
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,180
Oh,
definitely not like,

1381
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:14,213
I mean,
all of you people in this class or 

1382
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:19,270
uncover unconscious advocates of ancient
religious ideas,

1383
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:20,583
like I don't care whether you know it or
not because otherwise you run into 

1384
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:25,084
Dostoyevsky's conundrum.
If there's no absolute morality he 

1385
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:32,740
really meant if there's no god,
then you can do anything you want.

1386
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,540
Everything's up for grabs.
And so the question is,

1387
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:40,060
do you run around doing anything you 
want?

1388
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,760
Or you can say,
well you don't because you're afraid.

1389
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:44,440
It's like,
fine,

1390
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:45,970
you can take that avenue.
I don't care.

1391
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:48,730
That just puts it outside of the context
of this argument all together.

1392
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:53,470
Why do you act morally?
Why should you,

1393
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,500
why shouldn't you lie to get what you 
want?

1394
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:57,603
Or why should or should you?
Why shouldn't you steal to get what you 

1395
01:17:00,371 --> 01:17:03,220
want or killed to get what you want?
Why not?

1396
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,280
There's got to be answers to these 
questions.

1397
01:17:06,281 --> 01:17:08,980
So obviously every three year old knows 
that if you lie carefully,

1398
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:12,650
you can get what you want.
So why not do it all the time?

1399
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,500
Why not practice it until you're great 
at it?

1400
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,760
Like compulsive liar or sold to other 
people?

1401
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,393
Like it's almost like I find that 
interesting that like people that do 

1402
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:32,370
that or like other people see it and 
like really wrong.

1403
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:34,620
So,
so I've got a story for you.

1404
01:17:34,621 --> 01:17:37,170
So if you go on a chip bunch of chimps 
in a,

1405
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:39,390
in a cage,
and you bring a snake in there,

1406
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:42,000
even the plastic snake,
they'll all hit the ceiling,

1407
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:43,583
get away from that snake.
But then they'll look at it and look at 

1408
01:17:45,511 --> 01:17:46,320
it,
look at it.

1409
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,153
And if a snake,
if a chimp comes across a big snake in 

1410
01:17:48,721 --> 01:17:51,420
the wild,
they have a particular call they use,

1411
01:17:51,421 --> 01:17:54,450
which the primatologist caught a snake 
rat,

1412
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,310
which is w r a,
h.

1413
01:17:56,311 --> 01:17:57,900
So it's sort of like the sound the 
chimps make.

1414
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:58,973
So they make this noise and then all the
other chimps have come and they'll just 

1415
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:03,660
look at that snake,
like they stay a fair distance from it,

1416
01:18:03,661 --> 01:18:04,494
but they'll look at it and look at it 
and look at it and look at it for hours 

1417
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,660
and hours and hours.
It's like dexter,

1418
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:12,490
right,
right.

1419
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,160
The serial killer contemptible object 
and ever eternally fascinating.

1420
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:22,520
It's the same sort of thing,
you know?

1421
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:25,490
And so there's discussed and attraction 
at the same time.

1422
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,133
So

1423
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:36,490
there's a relationship with Alexa,
the lack of not being able to feel

1424
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,740
that will,
that's a good question.

1425
01:18:39,741 --> 01:18:42,740
So I Alexithymia is a hypothetical 
psychiatric condition.

1426
01:18:42,741 --> 01:18:47,390
That's the consists of the inability to 
articulate emotional states.

1427
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:49,063
It's a good question because it depends 
on the degree to which your personality 

1428
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,850
has to be articulated in order to be 
functional.

1429
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:58,610
And one of the things I would propose to
you,

1430
01:18:58,611 --> 01:19:00,890
and this is partly why we're doing the 
exercises that we're doing,

1431
01:19:00,891 --> 01:19:05,480
is that just like imagine that if your 
joints weren't articulated,

1432
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:09,260
not very helpful cause you could just 
sort of slap things with your hands,

1433
01:19:09,261 --> 01:19:10,400
you know,
they'd be like pause,

1434
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,473
but they're fully articulated and 
there's a conceptual relationship 

1435
01:19:14,961 --> 01:19:17,240
between articulated speech and 
articulation.

1436
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:18,373
Articulated speech means that your tools
for dealing with the world are more 

1437
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:24,320
differentiated,
perceiving acting in the world.

1438
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:27,230
And so the more you can articulate 
yourself,

1439
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,780
the more of you there is,
the more the world there is.

1440
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,370
Hypothetically.
That's a good thing.

1441
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:34,160
So if you're,
if you're without terms for emotions,

1442
01:19:34,161 --> 01:19:35,420
pretty damn hard to communicate.

1443
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,273
Um,
what do you say some of the new age 

1444
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,584
concepts that the objective reality,
I guess that we're living right now in 

1445
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,390
terms of yes,
mate.

1446
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,283
Yeah.
Maybe standing before for bliss and 

1447
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:53,110
falling intuition and trying to tap it.

1448
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:53,811
Yeah.
Well,

1449
01:19:53,811 --> 01:19:56,660
a big part,
a big part of the new age movement is in

1450
01:19:56,661 --> 01:19:59,880
fact a reaction against rationalist 
style Islam.

1451
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,590
So to that degree,
there's some utility in it.

1452
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:07,340
But the problem is,
is that it's sort of like protestantism,

1453
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:10,500
the devil.
The world is all good.

1454
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,720
Well no wrong,
that's not even close to right.

1455
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:19,470
The world is a horrible place and people
are terrible creatures.

1456
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,530
But that's not the whole story,
right?

1457
01:20:21,531 --> 01:20:25,320
Cause the world is also a wonderful 
place and people are amazing creatures.

1458
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:28,140
So,
but I think that's another answer to the

1459
01:20:28,141 --> 01:20:31,350
ideology question too,
is that in my understanding,

1460
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:37,140
a philosophy that unites the opposites,
which is kind of a union idea,

1461
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,650
is not an ideology.
So here's an ideology.

1462
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:41,723
Human beings are despoiling the planet.
Western culture does nothing but rape 

1463
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:48,070
and pillage and nature is a,
uh,

1464
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:53,160
innocent,
virginal victim.

1465
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:54,751
It's like,
yeah,

1466
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:55,584
that's all true,
but it's only half true because human 

1467
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:03,450
beings are all also unbelievably 
interesting and remarkable creatures.

1468
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:06,270
And it's no bloody wonder that we're 
trying to survive.

1469
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:07,104
And that has costs.
And thank God for culture because 

1470
01:21:09,391 --> 01:21:11,340
otherwise,
you know it was minus 10 last night,

1471
01:21:11,341 --> 01:21:12,174
so we'd all be popsicles and nature is 
doing everything it possibly can in 

1472
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:18,990
every moment to destroy and undermine 
us.

1473
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,970
So it's like,
okay,

1474
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,160
you want an ideology,
you can pick the first one,

1475
01:21:23,161 --> 01:21:26,460
that's an environmental ideology.
The second one is like a frontier myth.

1476
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,223
So you put them together and you've got 
nature is terrible and beautiful and 

1477
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:33,870
culture is tyrannical and provide 
security.

1478
01:21:33,871 --> 01:21:35,760
And the human being is,
you know,

1479
01:21:35,761 --> 01:21:40,710
a remarkable exploratory hero and an 
absolutely satanic figure.

1480
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,380
And then you've got the whole thing not 
quite.

1481
01:21:43,381 --> 01:21:44,214
Cause there's one other category that 
that is sort of like the category from 

1482
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:51,510
which all those categories emerge.
It's a very low level category.

1483
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:52,733
But as far as I can tell,
a system that has representations of 

1484
01:21:57,541 --> 01:22:02,220
those classes of phenomena is not an 
ideology.

1485
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:06,660
And I also think that's partly why it's 
so damn hard to get rid of Freud because

1486
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:09,900
freud categories map onto that map.
You know,

1487
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:10,734
there's the Ed that's sort of nature and
it's great source of energy and it's 

1488
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:16,980
horrible.
And then there's the ego.

1489
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:19,650
The Ego is,
you know,

1490
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,100
pretty good thing with all sorts of 
weird troubles and pathologies.

1491
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:25,560
And then there's the Super Ego,
which is society.

1492
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:27,540
You need that.
Otherwise you're out of control.

1493
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:30,060
But it can also be a crushing and 
tyrannical force.

1494
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,433
It's like,
well you can't get rid of Freud because 

1495
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,660
he got story,
right.

1496
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:35,970
And you might argue about is categories 
and all that,

1497
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,980
but doesn't really matter because 
they're grounded in,

1498
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:41,190
in something deeper than the terms that 
Freud used.

1499
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:43,830
So,
and if you see Christ,

1500
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:47,400
any Disney movie that that's worth its 
salt has all of those characters in it.

1501
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,533
Otherwise it gets one sided like frozen,
which was an absolutely dismal and 

1502
01:22:51,001 --> 01:22:51,834
wretched movie.

1503
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:52,983
It was meant the law,
it was Disney is pretty good at 

1504
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:57,120
mythology,
but frozen frozen was pure radiology.

1505
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:58,583
So it was very annoying to see that 
because in most situations the Disney 

1506
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,750
movies are pretty good at balancing out 
the archetypes.

1507
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:05,243
So,
and that's part of the reason there's 

1508
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,100
there.
So once insanely popular know,

1509
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,800
they present an architectural picture of
the world.

1510
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:13,720
And the thing is,
you say,

1511
01:23:13,721 --> 01:23:14,260
well,
you know,

1512
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,540
I don't have any religious beliefs.
You might say that to yourself.

1513
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:17,111
It's like,
fine,

1514
01:23:17,111 --> 01:23:17,944
why do you watch Disney movies?
What the hell do you think you're doing 

1515
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:20,554
in the theater?
You don't think that's a religious 

1516
01:23:21,941 --> 01:23:22,774
experience.
It's just cause you're completely 

1517
01:23:23,861 --> 01:23:25,960
clueless about what religious 
experiences are.

1518
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:31,200
You're watching a bunch of pictures,
like their drawings,

1519
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,360
you know,
there are things that aren't even real.

1520
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,200
And then you're just in there like 
embedded in there.

1521
01:23:38,201 --> 01:23:40,900
It's got your imagination.
So you say,

1522
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:42,220
well,
I don't believe in any of that.

1523
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:42,671
So like,
yeah,

1524
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:43,504
right.

1525
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:46,600
So come on,
you believe in it

1526
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:03,670
basically.
Yes,

1527
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,681
but it's,
it's,

1528
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:05,140
it's,
uh,

1529
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,500
there's a problem underneath that that's
even a bit deeper because like,

1530
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:12,550
I think the dominance hierarchies real 
period real,

1531
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:14,760
but it's not,
it's,

1532
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,010
it's a weird structure cause it's,
it's,

1533
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:20,140
it's like,
you know,

1534
01:24:20,141 --> 01:24:20,974
it's like the example I gave earlier 
where there's the tunnel and the train 

1535
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:25,714
going through it and the train keeps at 
any moment the train cars are full of 

1536
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:31,540
different things with dominant Turkey is
kind of like that.

1537
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:34,160
It's actually a dissipative structure 
that's tell you.

1538
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:36,370
So a dissipative structure is like a,
uh,

1539
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,590
you know,
when you let the water go out of a drain

1540
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,320
and you get that coil,
that funnel.

1541
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,600
Well,
is that a thing?

1542
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,193
Well,
it's a constant across a series of 

1543
01:24:46,951 --> 01:24:47,784
transformations.
It's a dissipative structure and the 

1544
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:53,550
physicist Schrodinger regarded people as
dissipative structures.

1545
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,460
So because we're our,
our,

1546
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,340
our structure isn't constant.
Like,

1547
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:58,283
I don't know,
you've probably replaced every cell in 

1548
01:24:59,131 --> 01:25:00,240
your body,
roughly speaking,

1549
01:25:00,241 --> 01:25:02,550
or at least the constituent elements of 
air resell,

1550
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:03,623
you know,
two or three times since you've been 

1551
01:25:04,771 --> 01:25:06,330
alive.
But there you are.

1552
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:07,403
So you're like this thing that's a 
permanent structure in a flux and the 

1553
01:25:11,161 --> 01:25:15,270
doormen hierarchy sport sort of like 
that because the constituent elements of

1554
01:25:15,271 --> 01:25:16,830
it keep changing,
but it's,

1555
01:25:16,831 --> 01:25:20,520
existence is,
its existence is there.

1556
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,360
And so I don't exactly know what to make
of a category like that,

1557
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:27,210
except that I'm certainly going to say 
that it's real.

1558
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,433
Or if you don't like that,
I can say I don't care if it's real 

1559
01:25:30,481 --> 01:25:33,360
because all of you act as if there's 
nothing that's more real than that.

1560
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:36,600
So that'll do for me,
because you know,

1561
01:25:36,601 --> 01:25:37,434
that brings up another question.
How do you know what someone regards is 

1562
01:25:40,381 --> 01:25:41,214
real?
And one answer is while you listen to 

1563
01:25:43,081 --> 01:25:45,030
what they say,
it's like,

1564
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:46,410
uh,
no.

1565
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:52,460
You watch what they do.
That's a much more accurate guide to who

1566
01:25:53,311 --> 01:25:56,430
they are because what do they know about
who they are?

1567
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,013
They got a vague model of who they are 
and it's usually hyper tilted towards 

1568
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:01,703
banality and conformity and self 
protection and deceit and all sorts of 

1569
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:10,154
things.

1570
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:17,693
Hurricane,

1571
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:22,240
well [inaudible] like a hurricane is a 
dissipative structures.

1572
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:22,940
So that,
you know,

1573
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:26,570
that's a reasonable analogy and the 
spirit is often likened to the wind.

1574
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:30,560
So,
so any other questions?

1575
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:31,963
Yes.

1576
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:35,103
Yeah.

1577
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:40,373
Oh,
it's an appalling ideology because the 

1578
01:26:41,311 --> 01:26:44,490
people who created it had the idea about
what it should be before they made it.

1579
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,533
So it's propaganda.
You can say exactly what frozen is 

1580
01:26:48,481 --> 01:26:50,670
about.
So it's propaganda.

1581
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:56,220
A truly mythologically based story,
you can never fully say what it's about.

1582
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:00,120
You can just talk about it forever and 
ever and ever and ever.

1583
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:02,520
So it's,
it's a wellspring of meaning.

1584
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,153
So,

1585
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:09,511
oh sure.
They are.

1586
01:27:09,511 --> 01:27:10,920
Of course that's what they're doing.
Oh yeah,

1587
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:13,230
it's calculated marketing.
Yeah,

1588
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:14,730
yeah,
sure.

1589
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,120
It was hyper politically correct.
Yeah,

1590
01:27:18,121 --> 01:27:18,661
yeah,
yeah.

1591
01:27:18,661 --> 01:27:20,640
And they didn't need men and you know,
God,

1592
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:22,650
give me a break.
You know,

1593
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,830
just because you need men doesn't mean 
you have to like them.

1594
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:28,620
Yeah.
So,

1595
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:32,340
so I mean I've thought a lot about the 
difference between propaganda and art.

1596
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:36,810
So art is actually a process rather than
an end product.

1597
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:39,990
And with any luck,
if you have a piece of art,

1598
01:27:39,991 --> 01:27:42,660
the process is embedded in the 
byproduct.

1599
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,840
And so it reflects the process when you 
bring it into your house.

1600
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,330
And so it's an active,
it's a,

1601
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:49,463
it's a crystallized act of exploration 
and the real artist doesn't know what 

1602
01:27:53,491 --> 01:27:56,070
they're doing.
They don't know what they're doing.

1603
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,570
They're exploring.
I can,

1604
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,433
I can recommend a film.
There's a film made of Picasso Wooden 

1605
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:04,320
Boat in 1957 and it was a black and 
white film and it was actually a film of

1606
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,154
him making a painting and he painted it 
on glass so you could see what he was 

1607
01:28:08,191 --> 01:28:08,460
doing.

1608
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:12,000
It's really quite fascinating because 
you can see that he's playing,

1609
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,130
he sketches it in and then he rubs it 
out.

1610
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,013
So then he's sketches it in again and he
rubs it out and he sketches over here 

1611
01:28:17,101 --> 01:28:19,530
and it's like there's a real dynamism 
about it.

1612
01:28:19,531 --> 01:28:20,364
He doesn't plan it out to begin with.
Not that there's necessarily anything 

1613
01:28:22,921 --> 01:28:24,850
wrong with that as an artistic endeavor 
too,

1614
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:25,953
but,
but Gasa was trying to explore and 

1615
01:28:27,601 --> 01:28:28,434
understand and you know,
I don't know what you know about cubism 

1616
01:28:30,991 --> 01:28:33,630
but cubism,
it's a strange thing.

1617
01:28:33,631 --> 01:28:38,631
But what he was doing with his cubism 
was to try to show you that you only see

1618
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:39,564
things from one perspective,
but the things exist in multiple 

1619
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:44,400
perspectives.
So you know,

1620
01:28:44,401 --> 01:28:48,870
a cubist painting is your face this way 
and your face this way at the same time.

1621
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:51,980
And so you could say,
well is that a more accurate way of,

1622
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:54,990
of representing a person that just a 
standard portrait.

1623
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:55,823
And Picasso would say,
well in some ways definitely because it 

1624
01:28:58,531 --> 01:29:02,400
captures the transformative element 
rather the static element.

1625
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,900
And so someone who's a true artist 
doesn't have a political message.

1626
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,293
And it's funny cause my house is full of
ideological propaganda from the Soviet 

1627
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:12,990
Union.
It's just packed full of it.

1628
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:14,303
And it's so interesting to watch these 
artifacts because a lot of them were 

1629
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,400
there socialist realist,
although mostly they're impressionist.

1630
01:29:20,401 --> 01:29:21,234
Really,
it's so interesting to watch them 

1631
01:29:22,681 --> 01:29:27,390
because in that painting themselves,
there's a war that you can perceive.

1632
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:28,553
And the war is a lot of the people who 
made these paintings were incredibly 

1633
01:29:31,651 --> 01:29:33,060
talented,
really,

1634
01:29:33,061 --> 01:29:34,950
really skilled.
Cause the Russians kept their,

1635
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:39,450
their formal academy's open so the 
Russians can really paint impressionism.

1636
01:29:39,451 --> 01:29:40,284
It's remarkable.
But their talents were encapsulated 

1637
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:45,900
within this book,
mostly stellar in this ideology.

1638
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:47,003
And so in each canvas there's this war 
between the ideological message and the 

1639
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:53,370
artistic message.
And what's so cool is the farther we get

1640
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:56,430
away from the Soviet Union,
the more the art wins.

1641
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:00,480
Because in 300 years there isn't gonna 
be a shred left of that ideology.

1642
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:03,180
And all they'll will be left to the 
paintings is the art.

1643
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,083
So

1644
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:07,763
part of the reason that people are so 
attracted to art is because the artist 

1645
01:30:11,461 --> 01:30:14,700
actually manifests identity with the 
process of transformation.

1646
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:17,640
And so that's why the artist is a 
cultural hero.

1647
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:21,090
That's also why every nihilist worth his
salt wants to be an artist.

1648
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:24,030
Like who are you?
What are you gonna say?

1649
01:30:24,031 --> 01:30:25,080
I'm an ils.
It's no,

1650
01:30:25,081 --> 01:30:26,220
I'm an artist.
It's like,

1651
01:30:26,221 --> 01:30:28,110
no you're not,
but I can see why you want to be.

1652
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:30,050
Right,
right.

1653
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,740
Yeah.
Just cause you're a failure.

1654
01:30:31,741 --> 01:30:32,730
It doesn't mean you're an artist.

1655
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:48,540
Well I think it depends on who you are.
It's really interesting to me.

1656
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:50,730
But I'm really interested in that,
you know,

1657
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,593
and I'm also interested in the way that 
etiologies coopt more fundamental 

1658
01:30:56,431 --> 01:31:00,900
processes to two and harness their 
energy as a,

1659
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:06,170
as a rational and motivating force.
And so for me,

1660
01:31:06,451 --> 01:31:11,451
these pieces of art propaganda are 
extremely interesting.

1661
01:31:12,511 --> 01:31:13,344
I mean,
it's very interesting to be surrounded 

1662
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:17,910
by them because I can see this war going
on all the time.

1663
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,673
So it's very cool.
And there are twinning far as I can 

1664
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:23,544
tell.
So that's very interesting because they 

1665
01:31:25,921 --> 01:31:27,990
were pure propaganda,
many of them when I bought them.

1666
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,990
But it's getting farther and farther 
away from the Soviet Union.

1667
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:35,430
So the more architectural elements are 
coming to the forefront.

1668
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,053
So

1669
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:45,880
I think it would depend on the skill of 
the artist,

1670
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,550
you know,
and some of these artists are incredibly

1671
01:31:48,551 --> 01:31:51,630
skilled.
So to the degree that there are,

1672
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:55,210
there's genuine artistic merit in the 
painting,

1673
01:31:55,450 --> 01:32:00,370
regardless of its constraint,
that can itself is value.

1674
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,050
So,
Yep.

1675
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:07,990
So any other questions?
Okay.

1676
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:10,660
So while you basically know where we're 
headed.

1677
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:13,990
So I'm going to start telling you 
stories in the next class,

1678
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,900
a little more neural,
a little neuroscience,

1679
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:19,390
and then a lot of stories.
So.
