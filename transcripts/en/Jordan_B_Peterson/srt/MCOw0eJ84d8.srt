1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,640
So I'm going to read something that
nature road in the first part of beyond

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:14,060
good and evil,
which is a section called the prejudices

3
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:19,061
of philosophers and it's a really good
example of the dance density.

4
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:24,450
The of this book,
one of the ways of conceptualizing

5
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:27,090
beyond good and evil,
and I think this is true for most great

6
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:27,924
work,
so

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,090
it's true [inaudible] works,
is that

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,223
the

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,390
author of the work
collects unconsciously collects patterns

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,400
from his or her interaction with the
world and then give them initial

11
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,390
formulation

12
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,670
and the patterns can be deep and
multilevel.

13
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,950
And the initial formulation translates
them into not so much ideas as into the

14
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:11,711
seeds of future ideas.
And the more poetic the author happens

15
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:15,860
to be,
the more the case that his or her

16
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,460
writings contain within it.
The seeds of future ideas and one of the

17
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:26,450
romantic philosophers are authors and I
think niche industry have ski or are in

18
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:30,680
some sense foremost among them are
particularly notable.

19
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,710
Further ability to do exactly that.
Now in this particular paragraph,

20
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,190
this particular paragraph not only
serves as an example of that,

21
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,180
but it also serves as the self conscious
reflection on that because Nietzsche is

22
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:51,311
writing a paragraph here that is full of
the seeds of ideas that will actually

23
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,570
bloom and flower to a great degree in
the 20th century,

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,590
but well he cymbalta caneously revealing
these those ideas.

25
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:04,160
He's also telling you exactly how he's
doing it and how it is that philosophers

26
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:04,880
do it.

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
So it's a,
it's a spectacular accomplishment.

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm going to read it probably phrase by
phrase and then take it apart because

29
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:16,850
it's so dance and beyond good and evil
is like that.

30
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,280
It's neat you,
when Nisha was writing beyond good and

31
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:23,750
evil,
he wasn't very well and because of that

32
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:27,080
he had to spend a lot of time thinking
and not very much time writing and

33
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:30,410
because he was also brilliant beyond
comprehension,

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,920
his ability to distill what he was
thinking into incredibly rich phrases is

35
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,360
I think it's some sense it's beyond
parallel.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,160
I mean often if I'm reading a book,
if it has any utility at all market,

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,940
usually I fold over the top of the page
or sometimes put a yellow sticky note on

38
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,580
it too.
If I find a place where there's an idea

39
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:58,320
that's worth returning to that that's
um,

40
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,820
it's particularly worth understanding.
And you can't do that with a book like

41
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,940
beyond good and evil because what ends
up happening is you have to mark every

42
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,800
sentence and obviously marking every
sentence isn't any better than not

43
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:13,720
marking any sentences at all.
So

44
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,890
I guess I also might as well tell you
why it is worth bothering with a book

45
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:31,590
like this at all because it's a very
difficult book and it,

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,330
it's also the sort of book that will
rattle you up so neat.

47
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:38,520
You is,
is very interested in the problem of

48
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,720
value.
And the problem of value fundamentally

49
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:46,721
is not the problem of what is the world
made out or even how does the world

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,800
function,
which are more in some sense more

51
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,150
specifically scientific questions.
But how is it that you should conduct

52
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:58,760
yourself in the world?
How should you act?

53
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,450
And people act towards aims in a sense
because we're active creatures and we're

54
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:10,310
moving from one point to another.
We're moving towards things that we

55
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:13,670
want.
And that means that we're guided by our

56
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:18,671
desires and we're not only guided by
designers in so as we have individual

57
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:23,801
desires,
we're guided by the structure that

58
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,920
consists of how those desires are
related to one another.

59
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,490
So for example,
if you have a room full of people,

60
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,400
say a room full of children,

61
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,810
they're active and they're each pursuing
their individual desires.

62
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:44,790
But at some point they may choose to
organize themselves into a game and if

63
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:48,900
they organize themselves into a game,
what they're doing for all intents and

64
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:52,650
purposes is producing a little society,
a little micro society.

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,880
And within that micro society they're
deciding what desires will be currently

66
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:00,960
expressed and how they'll exist in
relationship to one another.

67
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:05,961
And that means that they can cooperate
without too much conflict and that they

68
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:10,480
can jointly move towards,
um,

69
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,650
a joint ame without
and,

70
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:18,810
and,
and gather all the benefits that might

71
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:21,990
be associated with that.
And that might be the accomplishment of

72
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:22,980
the Ame,
whatever it is.

73
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:26,700
But it also might be just the enjoyment
that's to be had in the pursuit of that

74
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,790
activity.
Now people do that

75
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,990
socially because we have to do that in
order to get along with other people

76
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:40,050
because our designers have to be melded
with those of other people.

77
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,290
But we also do in psychologically.
And those two things exist in a dance

78
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:48,210
because as I'm interacting with other
people,

79
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,770
the demands of the fact that we're
interacting make require each of us to

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,770
arrange our desires in a way that's
acceptable to everyone else.

81
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,040
But at the same time,
what we're doing that we're also

82
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,970
observing the process by which those
desires are ordered.

83
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,840
And then we internalize that process and
use that to order our own desires.

84
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,140
And then so there's a constant
mutually informative dance between the

85
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,840
individual and the group.
And the culmination of that is the

86
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:24,470
organization of society and the
simultaneous organization of the psyche.

87
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,250
And it's that process that needs you is
talking about in these paragraphs.

88
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,730
Now you might ask yourself,
well,

89
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:38,810
what's the utility of articulating such
things?

90
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:43,811
And conceptualizing them and
understanding them and the answer in

91
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,440
some ways,
it's straight forward.

92
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,620
If you don't want to run a foul of the
your own desires,

93
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:55,060
you have to organize them
because some of them are short term and

94
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:59,070
some of them are medium term and some of
them are long term and some of the main

95
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,740
this and some of the main that.
And it isn't necessarily the case that

96
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:06,910
those desires allow for mutual
fulfillment.

97
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:09,940
So for example,
maybe you're very interested in pursuing

98
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:13,750
a sexual relationship with someone,
but you're also very interested in

99
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,270
having a family and some stability in
your life.

100
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,620
Or maybe you're interested in pursuing a
sexual relationship with a whole

101
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:23,320
sequence of people,
but you're also interested in having a

102
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:28,240
family of stabilizing your life.
It's not obvious that those desires can

103
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,370
exist in the same universe without
producing what you might think about as

104
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,350
a war.
And some of that might be a

105
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:38,620
psychological more,
but some of it's also going to be a war

106
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,180
that actually occurs in existence.
Well,

107
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:46,480
you're fighting through the
contradictory consequences of wanting to

108
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:50,200
pursue many people and formulate a
stable relationship with one person.

109
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,110
Now,
part of the reason that you want to

110
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:59,280
think about these sorts of things is
because if you think about them and get

111
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:04,281
your thoughts and your value system
intelligently and coherently cogently

112
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:12,750
laid out,
then when you act out that value system

113
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:15,510
in the world,
you're going to run into less conflict

114
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:18,780
and less uncertainty and less misery,
and you're going to have a higher

115
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,810
probability of getting what it is that
you want.

116
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,100
But you're also going to have a higher
probability of getting what you want in

117
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:31,101
a way that allows you to cooperate with
other people without entering into too

118
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,190
much conflict with them.
And so in some sense,

119
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,250
the purpose that you think,
the reason that you think are the

120
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:43,251
purpose of thinking is so that you can
sort out how you're going to move

121
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:49,131
forward in the world without having to
directly run headlong into all the

122
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:53,820
obstacles that you might run into if you
were doing such a thing blindly.

123
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,650
And so then you might yourself,
well,

124
00:08:55,651 --> 00:09:00,651
why would you bother reading philosophy?
The philosophy written by someone who's

125
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,040
great.
And the answer to that is,

126
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:08,041
is that they can help you think these
things through in a manner that you

127
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:11,250
would not be capable of doing on your
own.

128
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,970
You know,
because Nisha,

129
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,200
I mean it's,
it's difficult to estimate how

130
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:21,060
intelligent needs you it was.
But I suspect he was perhaps one in a

131
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,060
billion,
which would put him far beyond the

132
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:29,061
99.999 percentile.
And there's a massive difference between

133
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,540
the ability of people to think as you
move farther and farther out into the

134
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,650
extremes of intelligence.
And when you have the writings of

135
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:45,480
someone who's one in a billion,
then you can interact with those

136
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:49,590
writings in a way that enables you,
if you'll put the time into

137
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,330
benefit from the spectacular.
The fact of that intelligence nature was

138
00:09:56,461 --> 00:10:00,510
a full professor by the time he was 24
at a time when he didn't even have to

139
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:04,080
write this dissertation.
They just made him a full professor at a

140
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,690
time where that was,
that never happened.

141
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,140
So this is what he has to say.
And the prejudice is a philosopher.

142
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:19,090
So just the first chapter of that,

143
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,550
oh,
beyond good and evil,

144
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,920
it has gradually become clear to me what
every Greek philosophy up until now has

145
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:33,351
consistent of namely the confession of
its originator and the species of

146
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:37,440
involuntary and unconscious
autobiography.

147
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,363
Well,

148
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,960
that's deceptive.
That's a deceptively simple sentence.

149
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:48,040
Even though it's not a particularly
simple sentence because it,

150
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,490
it stands on a tab.
What people generally assume about the

151
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:53,630
process of thinking.

152
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,850
You generally think that when you're
thinking,

153
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:00,010
you're thinking about,
as I mentioned before,

154
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:04,510
the structure of the objective world
niches is making an entirely different

155
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:07,660
point here.
And what he's fundamentally doing is

156
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,410
treating the philosopher not as a
rational being,

157
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:15,010
but as a living being.
And there's a big difference between

158
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:17,770
being a rational being and being a
living being.

159
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,130
Because if you're living being,
your primary goal is to do whatever it

160
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:23,650
is that furthers your life.
And if you're a rational being,

161
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:28,120
then your primary goal is to do whatever
it is that a rational being Mike Duke,

162
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,950
and you could say that the living being
should first and foremost be a rational

163
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:35,770
being.
And in some sense that's the message of

164
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:37,930
the,
of the Western enlightenment.

165
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,500
But it's by no means self evident that
that's the case.

166
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,330
And it's certainly not something that
Nietzsche,

167
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,300
Nietzsche doesn't believe that people
are rational beings as certainly not a

168
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:51,130
primarily and more importantly,
he isn't exactly convinced that they

169
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:52,060
shouldn't be.
So,

170
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,090
so for example of nature's most famous
maximums is that truth serves life and

171
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:03,520
that's a very difficult different idea.
Then the purpose of truth say is the

172
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,770
accurate representation of the objective
world.

173
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,010
Those aren't the same thing at all.
Now you could ask,

174
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,720
well,
what does it mean for truth to serve

175
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,270
life?
And if you construed truth that way,

176
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:15,730
what would truth look like?
And you know,

177
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,470
the mere statement that truths should
serve life doesn't offer you the answers

178
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,180
to those questions.
But

179
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,750
it's the beginning of a different
metaphysics.

180
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,400
And in some sense of metaphysics,
which is say the universe within which a

181
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:37,401
philosopher might operate a metaphysics
is the initial structure of

182
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,290
presuppositions within which a view of
the world is organized.

183
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,590
One presupposition might be human beings
are rational and that we're attempting

184
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:55,591
to formulate and improve our sense of
the objective world,

185
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,340
our formulation with the objective
world.

186
00:12:57,341 --> 00:13:01,480
And another would be that you would be
so aren't rational or irrational,

187
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,030
and that we're,
what we're motivated to do is to live

188
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,900
whatever that means and that the purpose
of our thinking and our philosophy

189
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:11,800
should be to facilitate our living.
And that's Nietzsche's,

190
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,860
that's one of the foundation
blocks of niches,

191
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,890
philosophy.
So he's a moral philosopher,

192
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:23,680
fundamentally,
because morality is about values and the

193
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:26,650
values essentially values are,

194
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,180
you could say values are what you aim
for,

195
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,270
but it's more complicated than that.
Values actually constitute the lens

196
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,690
through which you view the world.
So it's partly what you're aiming APP,

197
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,500
but it's also partly your conception of
who you are now and where you are.

198
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:46,420
And it's also partly your conception of
how you're going to get to where it is

199
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:51,421
that you want to be.
And it's also partly the psychological

200
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:56,440
system that you use to parse up the
world so that it reveals to you the

201
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,860
pathway that you can take to get to what
you want.

202
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,230
Value is all of that.
And then it's more than that because you

203
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:06,240
could say that you have added value
which contains all of that.

204
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,440
But then you can say that you have a set
of values,

205
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:11,710
which is the arrangement of all about,
and then you can say that you have a set

206
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,080
of values that's the range,
but of all of that,

207
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,480
that you have to arrange with other
people.

208
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,550
And then you could say that you have all
that and you have to arrange it without

209
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:23,830
a people and you have to arrange it
across different spans of time.

210
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,580
Because what you want today and what you
want next week and what you want next

211
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,380
month are not necessarily at the same
thing.

212
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,990
And one does not necessarily lead into
the other.

213
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,280
So to be a moral philosopher is to
examine how that,

214
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,240
what that system is and how it operates
and how it came about.

215
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,850
Now,
one of the things that nature says is it

216
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:46,120
has gradually become clear to me what
every Greek philosophy up until now as

217
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:50,410
consistent up namely the confession of
its originator and a species of

218
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,730
involuntary and unconscious
autobiography.

219
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,470
So his claim fundamentally is that no
matter what the philosopher thinks he's

220
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,510
doing well,
he's reading philosophy.

221
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,660
What he's actually doing is revealing
and articulating his Ba.

222
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,060
And then you might say,
well,

223
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:11,690
where did that be income from?
And the answer to that is,

224
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,100
well,
partly it's,

225
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,070
you could consider it a biological
function in so far,

226
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:20,150
is that we have value structures that
are built into us that are the process.

227
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:23,150
We would say the process of a very long
evolutionary history.

228
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,570
But because you're also a cultural
phenomenon and because the manner in

229
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:33,080
which you've arranged your values and
your desires has been conditioned to the

230
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:38,081
last degree by the process of
enculturation that you were subjected to

231
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,553
when you

232
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,630
can fast and an autobiographical manner
and articulate that what you're also

233
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:51,631
doing is re capitulating the entire
structure of your culture.

234
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,230
It's in you.
And you might say,

235
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:56,800
well where is it in you and that and
what does it do you mean part of it

236
00:15:56,801 --> 00:16:01,801
means is that you act out in a pattern
of behavior and that pattern of behavior

237
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:06,880
is like a dance that someone is
manifesting to a symphonic score.

238
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:11,881
It's unbelievably complicated and it has
its psychological elements.

239
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:14,050
And some of those are conscious and some
of them aren't.

240
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,140
Some of them are just implicit in
embedded in the way you act and the way

241
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:19,090
you perceive.
And what the philosopher is attempting

242
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:24,091
to do is to reveal those to himself and
to articulate them so that the entire

243
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:27,250
structure can be analyzed.
Well.

244
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:32,251
So nature's first proposition is that
when a philosopher is thinking that what

245
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:36,070
he's doing is not thinking,
it's revealing himself and an

246
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:39,340
autobiographical sense under the guise
of rational thinking,

247
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,590
and so then it becomes something more
like a story.

248
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,373
MMM.

249
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,840
Well,
any governors all about in the first two

250
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,750
phrases,
so that gives you some example,

251
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,180
some indication of what this book is
like

252
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,920
the species of involuntary and
unconscious autobiography.

253
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,260
Well,
that's a more complicated idea too

254
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:05,250
because you might say,
well,

255
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:09,930
why would someone be driven in an
involuntary way and an unconscious way

256
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,440
to describe their autobiography?

257
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,183
And

258
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,250
that's a very complicated question.
It might be that one of the reasons that

259
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:22,070
people value one another is because we

260
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,510
engage in the process of sharing deeply
autobiographical information.

261
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,620
You tell me your story and I tell you my
story and you might say,

262
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:32,961
well,
why?

263
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,890
Why do we even bother with such things?
And the answer to that as well.

264
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:40,300
If you can tell me about the pain and
tragedy that you've encountered,

265
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,160
then that gives me a better way of,
that gives me a better vision of the

266
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:49,030
dangers of the world without actually
having to expose myself to those

267
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,730
dangerous,
except in simulation.

268
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:53,430
I might feel sorry for you.
I might feel bad about your tragic

269
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:56,040
experiences,
but I'm not bleeding for them.

270
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,700
And then there's always the possibility
that you'll also tell me how you solved

271
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:02,760
your problem,
in which case I can either avoid that

272
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:06,120
problem entirely or if I do encounter,
I can solve it without having to go

273
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,520
through.
Maybe it took you decades to formulate

274
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:12,450
your solution to that problem and you
can tell me your story and then I have

275
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:16,110
the information and so that's part of
what human beings are always trading.

276
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,740
That's why we talked to each other.
That's why we can communicate and so

277
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,401
neat.
You would say,

278
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:20,880
well,
it's,

279
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,740
it's involuntary,
unconscious,

280
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,570
involuntary unconscious.
He's alluding to the fact that that

281
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:31,410
proclivity is so deeply embedded in
people that desire to,

282
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,040
to make an autobiographical recounting
that,

283
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,103
okay,

284
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,810
it serves as the kind of motivation that
we don't question for doing almost

285
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:45,060
everything that we do.
So,

286
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:48,450
you know,
I mean people do such things as a 10

287
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:51,000
movies in place and they usually do that
happily,

288
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,360
especially if the movie or the play is
of high quality.

289
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,940
And the same thing happens when people
are reading novels.

290
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,500
They're attracted to such things.
They have a built in value and it's very

291
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:06,290
rarely the case that people will ever
question why it is that they're doing

292
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,460
such things.
In fact,

293
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,670
you see this quite commonly with
students who were first introduced to

294
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,750
the study of literature.
The,

295
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,180
the introduction of the idea that you
should analyze what it is that you're

296
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:24,910
engaged in when you're reading actually
comes as unwelcome news to most people

297
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:29,450
who are inclined towards fiction because
they don't want to interfere with the

298
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,280
process of engagement.
You know,

299
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:36,050
automatic unconscious engagement with
the material by detaching themselves and

300
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,910
having to think about what they're
doing.

301
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,600
So that's why it's an involuntary and
unconscious.

302
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:42,290
It's,
it's,

303
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,690
it's,
it's one of the things within which

304
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:48,980
thought operates rather than what are
the things on which thought operates.

305
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,080
Then he says the moral or immoral
purpose in which every philosophy has

306
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:58,120
constituted,
sorry,

307
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,330
the moral or immoral purpose in every
philosophy has constituted the true

308
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,020
vital germ out of which the entire plant
has always grown.

309
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,570
Well,
that's a hell of a thing to say too,

310
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:14,230
because what Nietzsche is alluding to
there in some senses that

311
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,583
yeah,

312
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,770
the philosopher Kant help and that would
be in some sense also the person who was

313
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,310
recounting their autobiography can't
help but tell you what they're up to,

314
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,140
even though they might not know.
And this is something that you own

315
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:37,340
because you almost have Carl,
you'll know the site.

316
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,490
They,
psychoanalysts was a great student of

317
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:44,491
nature and you came to believe that we
all inhabit and stories,

318
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,890
stories,
his stories.

319
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:50,890
We didn't happen to who were actually
the structures of value within which we

320
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:54,220
live.
And that those stories essentially had

321
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:58,570
an ethic or a moral and then you,
you can start thinking about what the

322
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,810
ethics and the morals might be.
And you kind of have some sense of that

323
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:04,150
because there's,
there's comedic stories and tragic

324
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:07,360
stories and there's evil characters in
good characters and so forth.

325
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:10,660
Those are architectural characters.
But part of the point that Nietzsche is

326
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:13,660
attempting to make here is that the
philosopher is in fact aiming it

327
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:17,260
something with his life,
with all of his actions.

328
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,890
He might not even know what it is,
but partly what he's doing in his

329
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:25,510
attempt to philosophize is to articulate
that in reveal it to himself and to

330
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:26,344
other people.

331
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,250
So then the question becomes,
well,

332
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,730
what is it that the person is up to?
And I would say in some sense that's the

333
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:37,070
ultimate question.
So neat.

334
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,110
You here in this paragraph,
it is also dealing with the,

335
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,940
with the ultimate question in life,
which might be well to what is your

336
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:46,260
life?
And,

337
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,551
and you might say,
well,

338
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:49,050
it's not aimed at anything.
It's it.

339
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,840
I don't know.
I don't seem to have any coherent set of

340
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:53,040
beliefs.
I don't know what I believe.

341
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:57,360
I don't believe in anything either.
But that's not the case because if you

342
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:59,460
didn't believe in anything you couldn't
see,

343
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,750
you have to believe in something to be
able to see because you point your eyes

344
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:07,050
and things and you can't organize your
vision without having a name.

345
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,250
And so the very act of interacting with
the world presupposes an ethic.

346
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,020
And then all those micro ethics that you
contain within,

347
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:18,660
you are organized into some sort of
structure,

348
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,550
either badly or well.

349
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,040
And that structure roughly has an aim
and you might know it and you might not,

350
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,810
but that doesn't mean it isn't there.
So,

351
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,390
so what other thing that needs he is
alluding to is that you believe things

352
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,650
whether or not you think you believe
them.

353
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,570
In fact believing them,
unknowing you believe them aren't even

354
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:39,630
the same thing.
And so the people believe all sorts of

355
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:43,410
things that they don't know about.
And that partly what they're doing when

356
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:46,020
they're doing philosophy is to try and
figure out what those things are.

357
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:46,531
You,
you know,

358
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,810
when you can also ask yourself,
well where did they come from?

359
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,970
Well,
I think partly came from you,

360
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:53,520
but you,
you're an old thing.

361
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,830
Your physical form is three and a half
billion years old and you're the process

362
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:02,400
of all that.
All of the death and struggling that

363
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:07,401
went along the entire course of that
three and a half billion years is you

364
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:08,850
carry that with you.

365
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:14,270
And then on top of that inside you is
the consequence of the entire cultural

366
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:18,420
history of complex life.
That's all inside youtube.

367
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,780
And then on top of that,
some of that's articulated more or less,

368
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,650
some of act without dramatized
represented and fiction and that sort of

369
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:27,630
thing.
And then some of it's articulated,

370
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,110
but there's way more at the bottom.
Then it is fully articulate and so god

371
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:36,240
only knows what you're up to.
And then you might say,

372
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:37,040
well,
who cares?

373
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,480
Well,
the problem with that is that you care

374
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:41,640
because first of all,
that's the definition of caring.

375
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:45,430
And second of all that determines that
the,

376
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,090
the way that you will move through your
life and everything that happens to you.

377
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:53,720
That's good or evil or good or bad,
it's going to be a consequence of the

378
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:55,910
manifestation of that ethic in the
world.

379
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,610
So,
and now nature is saying something else

380
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:04,790
too.
When he says the moral or immoral

381
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,690
purpose in whichever,
in the moral or immoral purpose in every

382
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:13,250
philosophy has constituted the true
vital germ out of which the entire plant

383
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:17,720
is always grown.
He's saying that the philosopher can't

384
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:22,250
help but reveal his aim in his writings
and then he's saying something else,

385
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:26,760
which is that even might be malevolent.
And you know,

386
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,400
modern people aren't very comfortable
with ideas like malevolence because

387
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:36,401
malevolence is an idea that's related to
evil and modern people think of

388
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:39,380
themselves as beyond good and evil to
some degree.

389
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,740
They don't believe in the reality of
those concepts.

390
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:46,190
And of course in this book,
beaches also questioning our,

391
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,120
at least our a priori presuppositions
about what do they need the lar.

392
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,870
But that doesn't mean that he doesn't
believe that they don't exist.

393
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,980
That doesn't mean that he doesn't
believe that they don't exist.

394
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:58,940
Yes,
I guess that's,

395
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,840
I guess that's right.
You know,

396
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:06,660
this is one of the things I've thought
about when I was thinking about when

397
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:09,180
I've thought about how Hitler died.
No,

398
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,860
Hitler died.
Hitler committed suicide in a bunker

399
00:25:13,861 --> 00:25:16,160
underneath Berlin when Europe was
inflamed.

400
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,820
And so one

401
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,630
conclusion that a psychoanalytically
minded historian could derive from that

402
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:29,900
is that's what he wanted,
right?

403
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,230
And then that opens up an entire binder
of vast nest of snakes because one of

404
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,900
the things that you might ask is,
well,

405
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,190
how is it that someone would desire
that?

406
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:41,960
First of all,
could that even be desired?

407
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,210
Is that actually something that anyone
could even desire?

408
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,940
Then you might ask,
well,

409
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,420
why is it that someone would design
that?

410
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,680
And then the next thing you might ask is
if a human being could desire that and

411
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:57,890
hit there was a human being then exactly
what does that say about you?

412
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,541
And you might say,
well,

413
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:03,140
I could never desire is such a thing.
But following along that train of the

414
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:05,930
argument that we've been laying out,
just like what makes you think you're a

415
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,910
reliable judge of what it is that you're
up to.

416
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,820
So.
Okay,

417
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:15,821
so now we've unpack three sentences and
we'll continue on with the same

418
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:22,030
paragraph.
Indeed to understand how the most

419
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:26,570
abstract metaphysical assertions of a
philosopher have been arrived out.

420
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,760
It is always well and why is to first
ask oneself what morality do they or

421
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:37,730
does he a mat?
So what the question is,

422
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,020
what's the first enough to,

423
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,423
well,

424
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,290
there's an entire nest of snakes
underneath that sentence,

425
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,350
that sequence of propositions as well.
And one of them is,

426
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,040
well,
what does it mean that people are up to

427
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,430
something?
What does it mean that they're aiming at

428
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:12,431
something
accordingly?

429
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:17,440
I do not believe that an impulse to
knowledgist the farther of philosophy

430
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,950
about that,
another impulse here as elsewhere has

431
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:25,630
only made use of knowledge and mistaken
knowledge as an instrument.

432
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,930
Well,
whoever considers the fundamental

433
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:32,230
impulses of man with a view to
determining how far they leave here

434
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:33,640
after this inspiring,
no,

435
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,650
this is why this is going to require it
editing it so complicated to go through

436
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,690
accordingly.
I do not believe that an impulse to

437
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:48,340
knowledge,
just the farther up philosophy,

438
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,470
but then another impulse here is
elsewhere has only made use of knowledge

439
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,500
and mistaken knowledge as an instrument.
All right,

440
00:27:56,501 --> 00:28:00,550
so let's take that apart accordingly.
I do not believe that an impulse to

441
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:05,200
knowledge is the farther off philosophy.
So one of the claims,

442
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,560
I suppose this would be an enlightened
human claim,

443
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,150
is that people do have to drive to
knowledge and that that drive is in fact

444
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,840
what underlies the production of such
things as philosophy,

445
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:22,420
but need to questions that because he's
trying to bring us back to consideration

446
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:27,421
of the fact that you can't separate the
philosophers mind from the philosophers

447
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,070
being he's first and foremost the living
creature and the,

448
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:34,450
he's up to something.
And the question is,

449
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,520
what is it that he's up to?
And so you can see the earliest

450
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:43,960
manifestations in a paragraph like this
of what later developed into

451
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:48,961
deconstructionists thought and that that
was mostly French continental

452
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,230
philosophers who pursued that particular
line of reasoning.

453
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,450
And it,
it is derived exactly from this kind of

454
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:01,990
statement by nature.
So for example,

455
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,580
someone like Garrett,
I would say

456
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,870
it doesn't matter what the content of
the text is.

457
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,560
What matters is that the text can be
used as a tool for power.

458
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,710
And then whether the person who wrote
the tax knew it or not,

459
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,890
that's what they were doing and they
were doing it in a way to privilege

460
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:21,100
themselves above other people.
And that's really,

461
00:29:21,101 --> 00:29:23,470
I would say,
the fundamental deconstructionist plain

462
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,890
and it's a powerful claim.
It's an utterly corrupt claim,

463
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,610
but it's a really powerful claim and
it's related directly to the sorts of

464
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:34,660
things that need you was referring to in
this paragraph.

465
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,730
What is it that the person is truly up
to?

466
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,990
Now the problem with the
deconstructionist claim is that it's an,

467
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,630
it's an open invitation,
cynicism to thoughtless citizens.

468
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,950
I can just make the presupposition that
whatever it is that you're telling me,

469
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,340
you're you,
you're telling me merely to dominate

470
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,370
regardless of what it is that you claim
to be doing.

471
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,840
Well,
the problem with that approach is that

472
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,400
it's predicated on the implicit
assumption that the only value that

473
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:08,970
people actually have is the value is the
desire to dominate.

474
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,510
And of course that's a purely like that
could be the case.

475
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:17,160
And I also think that it's even
reasonable to posit that to some degree

476
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:20,490
that it is the case.
But to take that from a contributing

477
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:24,630
factor and to make that the highest God
because that's essentially what the

478
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:28,650
deconstructionists are doing.
Those are entirely different things and

479
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,600
you have to be aware of people who

480
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,660
take a single causal element and
elevated to the stature of single

481
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,120
comprehensive cause.
You know,

482
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,800
it's more reasonable to assume that
people are complex in their motivation.

483
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:50,810
So many different strands of biological
and cultural motivation are in some

484
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,840
sense primary.
And then what happens is that they come

485
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:57,620
together to weave the kind of tapestry
rather than to make the automatic

486
00:30:57,621 --> 00:31:01,550
assumption that you can reduce the
entire set of human motivations to a

487
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:04,070
single principle like that power.
Now you know,

488
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:08,210
I would say niche is also responsible to
some degree for the deconstructionist

489
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:11,540
claim that it's power.
Because one of his most famous

490
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,720
utterances was that the fundamental
motivating force in life is the will to

491
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:21,470
power.
But he wasn't so much because nature is

492
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:24,860
a subtle thinker.
He wasn't so much attempting to reduce

493
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,780
human motivation to power.
He was attempting to redefine what it

494
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:33,770
was that we conceptualize downs power.
Whereas that isn't what the

495
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:37,190
deconstructionists circling and all.
Because fundamentally they're Marxists

496
00:31:37,191 --> 00:31:40,910
and they believe that you know who they
is ensconced themselves within an

497
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:45,911
economic viewpoint where within a
philosophical viewpoint where economics

498
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:51,641
is paramount and where all that matters
is power construed as socioeconomic

499
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,620
domination fundamental,
you know,

500
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,840
and that's in turn is embedded in
metaphysics.

501
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:02,690
That's even deeper,
which is a metaphysics that presume that

502
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:06,770
people are fundamentally materialists
and all of those things are quick in a

503
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:08,600
lot of those things are highly
questionable.

504
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,250
So I'm going to skip ahead a little bit
of the paragraph.

505
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,380
When Nietzsche talks about
the motivations of,

506
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,130
you would consider them
people who were working in the middle

507
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:39,710
ranks of bureaucracies,
whether they're scientific or otherwise.

508
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,550
So they're in some sense acting as cogs
in a particular machine.

509
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:45,830
And so that's what he's describing here.
He says

510
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,620
in the case of scholars or in the case
of really scientific men,

511
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,650
it may be there may really be such a
thing as an impulse to knowledge,

512
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,190
some kind of small independent clockwork
which when well wellmed out works away

513
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:11,621
industriously to that end without the
rest of the scholarly impulses taking

514
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:16,751
any material park there in the actual
interests of the scholar therefore are

515
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:22,061
generally in quite another direction.
It is the family or in moneymaking more

516
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:25,160
in politics.
It is in fact almost indifferent at what

517
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:29,030
point of research his little machine is
place and whether the hopefully young

518
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:32,780
worker becomes a good fill.
Ologist someone who studied the origin

519
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:35,180
of words,
a mushroom specialist or a chemist.

520
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,850
He's not characterized becoming this by
this.

521
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,640
He's not characterized by becoming this
or that

522
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,890
niches point.
There are fundamentally is that even

523
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:52,891
when you do analyze people who in whom
the the wheel to knowledge might

524
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:57,970
actually be operative,
even though he wouldn't be willing to

525
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,980
granted the status of highest motivating
power that even in those people where

526
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:07,300
that Wilton all does exist,
the probability that that is in turn

527
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:11,980
subordinated to some other principle
that's higher than the value hierarchy

528
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:13,030
is very,
very high.

529
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,870
And it's hard to tell exactly what that
additional principle might be,

530
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:20,320
but he points out such things as well.
Maybe they're primarily interested in

531
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:24,310
serving the interests of their family or
they're primarily interested in making

532
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:27,610
money or maybe they're primarily
interested in status and maybe they're

533
00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:30,760
interested in status status becomes it
because it makes them more sexually

534
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:33,310
attractive and that sort of thing.
So,

535
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,173
but,
uh,

536
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,560
the question of what is it that's
lurking in the background is always

537
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,970
paramount.
So

538
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,303
there

539
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,220
detour in this particular paragraph,

540
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,293
okay,

541
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,530
whoever considers the fundamental
impulses of man with a view to

542
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:08,270
determining how far they may have here
acted as inspiring Jenai

543
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,210
or his demons will find that they have
all practice philosophy at one time or

544
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:16,730
another.
And that each of them would have been

545
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,740
only too glad to look upon itself as the
ultimate end of existence and the

546
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:24,710
legitimate lord over all of the other
impulses.

547
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,150
That's another like the beyond good and
evil.

548
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,210
To think of it as a book is a really
foolish

549
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,333
framework.

550
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,580
You know,
cause this is what a book is.

551
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:43,340
When people think about a book,
you know,

552
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,210
it's like a material entity.
It's,

553
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,820
it's eight inches high and six inches
wide and two inches thick and weighs a

554
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:53,040
pound and it's made out of paper and
it's between two,

555
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,530
two covers.
You know?

556
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:58,270
And that's a materialist.
That's the eight priority,

557
00:35:58,271 --> 00:36:03,271
sort of axiomatic view of book.
Nature's beyond good and evil isn't a

558
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:08,370
book at all.
It's a series of bombs and each sentence

559
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:12,240
is a ball.
And each sentence blows things up that

560
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:15,810
people don't even know exist.
And so one of the things that with this

561
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:16,920
sentence,
for example,

562
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,680
here's how he's conceptualizing human
being.

563
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,210
So the first thing he talks about is
that the FA,

564
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,680
there are fundamental impulses that
human beings,

565
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,080
okay,
so that begs a question.

566
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,310
Well,
what do you mean by impulse and what do

567
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:33,480
you mean by fundamental?

568
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,920
And both of those are extraordinarily
complicated problems.

569
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,310
So an impulse,
you can think of an impulse as it drive.

570
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,160
You could think about it as a biological
instinct.

571
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,760
They could think about it as a name or a
goal.

572
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,040
You could think about it as an act of
will.

573
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:54,060
Like there's,
there's endless questions that that,

574
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,930
hang off that question.
But we could start with the idea that we

575
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,010
perhaps can't define it,
but we are willing to go with the

576
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,110
proposition that people do have the
impulses.

577
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,840
And I think maybe that's manifest to you
more.

578
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:11,930
Most particularly when you're attempting
to do something voluntarily and

579
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,900
something in voluntarily interferes with
that.

580
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,960
You know,
so maybe you're sitting down to to try

581
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:23,940
to get some work done in the work is not
of any particular intrinsic interest but

582
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,310
you regarded as necessary,
you know,

583
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,860
necessary element in some higher order
scheme.

584
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,700
And so you're attempting to organize
yourself so you will in fact concentrate

585
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:36,150
on that particular relatively mundane
activity.

586
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:40,080
But what you find when you sit down to
actually engage in that is you can't do

587
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:43,110
it.
You have to go do the dishes or you have

588
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:46,830
to clean under the bed,
or you have to have a sexual fantasy or

589
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,050
you or,
or there's some other thing that you

590
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:51,510
could do that's useful but that you
wouldn't normally do,

591
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:55,350
that you'll go do instead.
Or that you fall asleep or that you get

592
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:57,840
hungry or like there's an endless number
of,

593
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,730
let's call them impulses that might
arise to interfere with your conscious

594
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,530
movement forward.
Well,

595
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,970
exactly.
What are those things?

596
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,230
While nature certainly conceptualizes
the human being as a place where those

597
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,980
things live,
and he does mean live too because it

598
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:21,981
wouldn't refer it to the misdeed demons
are or Jeanie's without introducing the

599
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:25,680
metaphor conception of something that
lives.

600
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:29,460
And so partly what needs to reveals in
no sentences is that he conceptualized

601
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:34,260
as a human being as the dwelling place
of spirits.

602
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,000
And

603
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,420
some of them are Gv,
let's say that's the root word of

604
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:42,240
genius.
That's the terribly powerful thing that

605
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:44,790
exists in the terribly small
compartment,

606
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,380
right,
that you have to call forth.

607
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,130
And some of them are demons and demons
are things that have their own

608
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:53,370
autonomous will and the generally aren't
aiming for the good.

609
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,670
So then,
so those are all things need.

610
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:59,580
She just lays out as implicit parts of
the sentence.

611
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:02,880
So we activates all those ideas,
whether you know it or not,

612
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,310
in your mind,
to the degree that you processed the

613
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:07,620
sentence.
And those things start to take on a life

614
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:09,450
of a row of their own,
those ideas.

615
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,433
So

616
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,050
then he adds another dimension of
complexity to that by saying,

617
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,620
well,
you're full of demons and,

618
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:24,770
and,
and Jeannie's and they're all doing

619
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:27,520
their own thing,
whatever that happens to be.

620
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:32,050
But each of them,
if left to their own devices,

621
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:35,560
would attempt to remake the entire world
in there

622
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,013
form.

623
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,940
And so I thought of this from,
from a narrative point of view or from a

624
00:39:45,871 --> 00:39:47,780
symbolic point of view in,
in,

625
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:48,240
in,
uh,

626
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,380
in old stories and folktales and
fairytales,

627
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,630
you often have a,

628
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,580
um,
cyclops

629
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,680
one night giants and there's a sexual
connotation to that which is,

630
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,170
which is apropos that the psychoanalysts
would,

631
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:09,140
would certainly point out.
But the one idea is that this thing is

632
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,200
gigantic and wants one thing.
And so that's another way that Nietzsche

633
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,780
is conceptualizing the fundamental

634
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,250
structure of the human psyche.
It's a dwelling place full of one I

635
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:27,710
giants.
And they're constantly,

636
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,010
while one thing,
one way of looking at is they're

637
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,380
constantly at war.
One of them wants to be the largest one.

638
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:36,620
I giant and dominate everything else.
Then one of the things that,

639
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,660
so in each,
it takes that argument further and he

640
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:41,480
says,
not only is this always happening in

641
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:44,380
human beings,
but then if you look at philosophy,

642
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,750
what it is,
is it's a continual revelation of the

643
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:52,751
attempt of some singular minded psychic
monster psychological monster to

644
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:59,480
dominate the entire psychological
structure that are for the entire

645
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:01,490
cultural structure.
And therefore the entire world.

646
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:05,690
And then you can,
you can see in that the entire religious

647
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:10,691
structure struggle of mankind to take
this vast polytheistic vision of reality

648
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,290
and to organize it into some sort of
monotheistic,

649
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:22,400
an integrated structure,
which you could also consider

650
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,730
indistinguishable from the civilizing,
the impulse that operates in human

651
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,980
beings to become civilized.

652
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:35,300
Because on the one it might be a
terrible thing that one,

653
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:38,660
one eyed monster emerge as to attempt to
dominate all the others.

654
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,390
But then on the other hand,
there's no difference between that and

655
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:45,710
organizing something because to organize
something is to bring it all into a

656
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:50,711
hierarchical structure with some sort of
singular value at the forefront.

657
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,240
And then the question might be,
well,

658
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:56,930
what should that singular value b and
then neat you would.

659
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,860
That ties the whole argument back into
the first sentences that he wrote at the

660
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:02,360
beginning of the paragraph,
which is,

661
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,180
well,
what is it that the philosopher is up

662
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:07,670
to?
What is the force that he serving?

663
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,030
What is that unifying impulse?
That's another way of looking at it.

664
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:14,870
If there's a unifying impulse and he's
not only fallen prey to some internal

665
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,930
email,
if there's a unifying impulse to bring

666
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:21,860
all of this together into some sort of
functional structure,

667
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:23,630
what exactly might that look like?

668
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,400
For every impulse is imperious.
And as such attempts to philosophize,

669
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,670
that's part of that sort of niches idea
of will to power in in its nascent form.

670
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,280
All of these unconscious entities that
inhabit the human psyche are all alive

671
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,490
and they're trying to live.
They're trying to,

672
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,750
they're trying to climb up the dominance
hierarchy and dominate because of course

673
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:57,950
that's partly what lights does.
Because let's say from an evolutionary

674
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:01,880
perspective,
and this is probably more true for males

675
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:06,910
because there were less
effective in their attempts to replicate

676
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,280
the distinction between climbing up a
dominance hard keep,

677
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:16,370
whatever that might happen to be.
And success is,

678
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,560
there may be no distinction at all.
And then you might say,

679
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:23,880
well that just shows,
but there's nothing but willpower.

680
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,400
But
that still doesn't answer one of the

681
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:33,370
most fundamental questions is that power
in relationship to what?

682
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:39,570
Cause that's the question.
Okay.

683
00:43:39,781 --> 00:43:40,870
So you can shut that off.
