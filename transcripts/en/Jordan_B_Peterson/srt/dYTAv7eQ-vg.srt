1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,780
There'll be an exam on Thursday,
I presume it'll be multiple choice.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,780
Like the last one was,
um,

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,070
you've already taken one exam,
so you kind of have some idea about what

4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:12,510
they're like.
So,

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:13,560
um,
it'll be here,

6
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,870
like the last one was,
um,

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,390
and this lecture will be covered.
So.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,793
Okay.
So we talked a little bit about 

9
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:26,010
motivation last time or quite a bit 
about motivation and what I,

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,100
I told you that I was basically teach 
you,

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,430
teaching you a personality,
neuroscience approach to personality.

12
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:33,264
And um,
part of the reason that I have to go 

13
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:40,380
into the biology to give you is to give 
you the kind of foundation that you need

14
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,214
in order to understand,
I would say what's essentially the 

15
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,840
cutting edge in personality research.
You know,

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,680
I mean,
I know that what we're going,

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,543
what we covered last lecture and what 
we're going to cover today are 

18
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:54,300
relatively complicated.

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,540
But if you get them right,
then you're right at the forefront of,

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,073
of,
of our ideas about brain function and 

21
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:04,620
emotion and about personality.
So you get all that at the same time.

22
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,740
And today you'll get a little bit of 
learning theory thrown in as well.

23
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:11,350
So the learn learning theory is 
basically what used to be,

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,490
what's what's alternatively described as
behaviorism.

25
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,324
And I don't,
I used to teach behaviorism in this 

26
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:18,024
class,
but I've subsumed it underneath the 

27
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:23,730
biology because the old be a lot of the 
old behavior of presuppositions,

28
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:27,420
although they were extremely useful.
We're not right is,

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,710
which is exactly what you'd expect.
They were formulated in the 1950s.

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,933
Um,
and it's actually the sign of the 

31
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:37,710
progress of a science that theories that
are 60 years old or no longer.

32
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,240
Right.
So,

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,273
um,
we'll also cover a little bit of 

34
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:43,950
behavioral theory today too.

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,420
So,
okay.

36
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,910
So the hypothesis we've been working on 
so far,

37
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:48,744
or we'll call it the working theory,
is that motivations set goals or more 

38
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:54,054
accurately that they defined a 
conceptual space within which you 

39
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:01,860
perceive the world and within which you 
act towards some goal and,

40
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,903
or to some endpoint and the endpoint in 
some sense as specified by the 

41
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:10,800
motivational system.
It's a hypothalamic system are often,

42
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:11,634
but not always,
but not only is the goal specified but 

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,000
they,
the underlying motivational systems also

44
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:18,834
tune your perception.
So you're only looking at the things 

45
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,550
that you know to be relevant to the 
pursuit of that goal.

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,530
And they also either disinhibit or 
activate the behavioral schemes that you

47
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:33,480
would normally use to pursue the goal.
And sometimes those are the,

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,000
let's say the motor schemes cause that 
would be more accurate.

49
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,103
When you think about behavior,
you tend to think about voluntary 

50
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:43,350
behavior,
but a motivational state will disinhibit

51
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:46,950
or activate depending on the situation,
autonomic responses.

52
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,630
So for example,
when you,

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,913
when you were food deprived and you 
start to think about food and start to 

54
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:53,634
organize your behavior towards food as 
an end and to perceive the world that 

55
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:59,010
way,
your body also prepares for.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,513
And so the motivational state is an all 
encompassing psychophysiological 

57
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,224
phenomena.
It's not something as simple as chain 

58
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,534
behavior,
which was an early be behavioral theory 

59
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,180
or as simple as something that's merely 
setting a goal.

60
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,220
It's much more complicated than that.
It's,

61
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,173
it's useful to think about as we've 
already talked about with regards to 

62
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:20,884
psychodynamic theory,
it's useful to think about a motivated 

63
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,770
state as a micro personality.
I mean it's,

64
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,240
it's got one aim in mind fundamentally.
So it's,

65
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,074
it's not particularly sophisticated,
but it has all the other elements of a 

66
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,420
personality.
So now,

67
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,254
so motivation establishes the framework 
within which goals are pursued and the 

68
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:44,161
goal itself,
and then roughly speaking emotions or at

69
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,830
least many of the motions track progress
towards goals.

70
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,890
And so they kind of tell you whether 
you're on the right tracker or not.

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,760
So that's a reasonable way of 
distinguishing them.

72
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,653
Even though there is no single 
motivation system or a single emotion 

73
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:03,010
system,
there's some basic motivations.

74
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,410
These are the sorts of things that Freud
would have associated fundamentally with

75
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,890
Id.
So,

76
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:09,724
and he thought of those as primordial 
and that's exactly right because pretty 

77
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,384
much all of these motivational systems 
we share certainly with other people 

78
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,000
also with other mammals.
And then of course with animals that are

79
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,700
farther down the evolutionary chain than
mammals.

80
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,040
So some of these systems are 
extraordinarily old.

81
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,053
In fact,
all of them are extraordinarily old 

82
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,660
hunger,
consequence of food deprivation,

83
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:32,494
obviously thirst.
Obviously people are very dependent on 

84
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,230
water.
Pain,

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,270
pain's complicated.
There's,

86
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,553
there's physical pain and then there's 
it's mental equivalents and the mental 

87
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:51,871
equivalents of pain are grief,
disappointment,

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,820
frustration,
roughly speaking.

89
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,090
And so you can,
the way you can think about that as you,

90
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,953
you know,
you saw the picture of the nervous 

91
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,614
system that I showed you last time with 
the branches going up into the brain 

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,393
obviously,
but with all the branches or the roots 

93
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,704
say going down into the body.
So we discussed the central nervous 

94
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:12,340
system as a sort of all encompassing 
system distributed throughout the body.

95
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,503
Imagine that part of that network 
throughout your body is associated with 

96
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,800
pain reception and that would be roughly
equivalent to systems registering levels

97
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:27,190
of input that are high enough to 
potentially damage them.

98
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,470
That's,
that's where pain seems seems to come in

99
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,280
and that different pieces of that can be
activated at different times.

100
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,550
So if it's psychological pain,
as I said,

101
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:37,750
grief,
frustration,

102
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:40,060
disappointment seems to fall into that 
category.

103
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,220
Uh,
loneliness as another one.

104
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,593
Um,
then maybe it's primarily the cortical 

105
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:48,660
circuitry for paying that's activated.

106
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,040
Although people who are depressed,
for example,

107
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,070
or who are grieving often have somatic 
pain as well.

108
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,830
And depression really looks like it's a 
pain state.

109
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,163
Um,
we know loneliness is because if you 

110
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,374
take like little chicks or little 
kittens and you make them loan and 

111
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,730
they'll cry,
you know,

112
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,564
which is,
uh,

113
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,170
or,
or,

114
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,640
or peep if their chicks,
and you can stop them from doing that by

115
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,474
using opiates.
And it's not because it stops them from 

116
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,940
vocalizing.
Cause that would be a possibility.

117
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,740
Just get them so stoned on,
you know,

118
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,870
morphine that they can't peep.
And you think,

119
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:23,690
well they're now they're,
they're not lonesome anymore sites.

120
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,823
The experiments have been done carefully
enough to factor out the effect of the 

121
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,080
opiates on the vocalization.
So,

122
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,093
and that's also led to some suspicion 
that people who have have had to have a 

123
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:37,814
history of extraordinarily painful 
personal relationships might be those 

124
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,520
who are more prone to opiate use.

125
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,070
And so opiates,
analgesics are,

126
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,600
they basically dampen out pain and 
frustration and disappointment and grief

127
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,583
and loneliness.
So there's an anger and aggression 

128
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:55,700
system.
It's complicated.

129
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:58,340
There's probably two of them.
One is defensive aggression,

130
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:01,040
that's probably more associated with 
neuroticism.

131
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,520
Technically.
The others probably predatory aggression

132
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,013
and you know,
human beings are definitely predators 

133
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,520
were meat eaters and you know,
uh,

134
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,980
our closest relatives,
chimpanzees for example,

135
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:14,300
they're,
they're pretty good hunters.

136
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,033
They,
they'll,

137
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,083
they'll pack,
gathered together and packs and bring 

138
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,754
down 30 pound colobus monkeys and,
and the meat is very popular among the 

139
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:23,564
chimps.
And so predatory aggression seems to be 

140
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,880
a separate circuit.
And as we'll discuss further along,

141
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,320
I think the predatory aggression circuit
and the maternal solicitude circuit,

142
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:34,154
because there's also a care circuit have
evolved to be at opposite ends of the 

143
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,164
same distribution.
I think that's the agreeableness 

144
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,410
distribution in the big five.

145
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,650
So on one end there's maternal 
solicitude and the other end,

146
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:46,484
there's predatory aggression.
And you could imagine how those things 

147
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,990
have to inhibit one another.
Um,

148
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,220
because well with,
with many mammals,

149
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,370
bears for example,
the males are so predatory that you have

150
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:00,770
to keep them away from the cubs because 
they'll kill them.

151
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,913
You human beings.
I mean there's some aggression towards 

152
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,103
children,
especially if the children aren't 

153
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:07,844
biological relatives,
but men are pretty caring for male 

154
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:15,070
mammals and women are actually quite 
predatory for male mammals.

155
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:15,904
So thermal regulation,
your hypothalamus takes care of whether 

156
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:23,600
you're hot or cold,
panic and escape that those are circuits

157
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:26,750
that also seem to be associated with 
with pain fundamentally.

158
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,270
Although threat can maybe trigger them 
as well,

159
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,403
and the panic escape system doesn't 
exactly seem to be the same system as 

160
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:34,604
the anxiety and fear system.
Even though they sound they sound 

161
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,020
roughly equivalent,
right?

162
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,980
You might think of panic as just the 
extreme level of fear.

163
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,323
I think fear can trigger panic,
but panic seems to be a more primordial 

164
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:51,881
circuit and if you're panicking,
there's an immense impetus to to escape.

165
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,590
So that's a different circuit 
affiliation of care.

166
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:59,130
We covered sexual desire,
exploration and play.

167
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:00,930
Both of those seem to be separate 
circuits,

168
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:01,920
so Jaak,
Panksepp,

169
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,910
Jaak Panksepp actually who wrote a great
book called an affect of neuroscience.

170
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:09,030
By the way,
if any of you are interested in like the

171
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,520
psychobiology of behavior and 
motivation,

172
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,930
Jaak Panksepp book is one of the best,
I don't have a paper by him in,

173
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,360
in our collection,
but he's a very smart guy.

174
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:22,650
He wrote this book called affective 
neuroscience and it's actually given its

175
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:26,130
title and the relative complexity of its
of its thoughts.

176
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,710
It's actually quite readable even though
it's a text,

177
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:31,110
it's a little more personal than your 
typical texts.

178
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,720
Might be.
An panksepp is also very interested in a

179
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,100
psychodynamic and personality idea.
So he's a very broad thinker.

180
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:40,980
And so if you're interested in,
you know,

181
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,843
uh,
an approach to psychology that sort of 

182
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:43,944
crosses the threshold from personality 
into emotion and biology Panksepp as 

183
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,494
well as gray.
There's a great paper that you're 

184
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,530
reading.
Panksepp's are very,

185
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,420
very good source.
He's a very,

186
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,320
he discovered the play circuit for 
example.

187
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,360
Um,
and he also discovered that rats laugh.

188
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,690
So if you take a rat,
it laughs.

189
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:10,800
You can't hear it though because it 
laughs ultrasonically like a bat.

190
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,130
But if you record the rat giggling and 
then slow down the tape,

191
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,590
then you can tell that the rat laughs.
Rats need to play in.

192
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,960
Most mammals need to play in order to 
uh,

193
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,060
socialize them.
So,

194
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:26,580
so one of the things you can think about
this when your parents do,

195
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:27,414
and this is probably especially relevant
for the man cause one of the things you 

196
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:33,060
might ask is what role do men play in 
the socialization of children?

197
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,893
And one thing that men really do seem to
do with kids is to engage in rough and 

198
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:37,944
tumble play,
especially once they're a little older 

199
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:43,140
than to say two to five or something.
And kids love that.

200
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:47,230
They absolutely love rough and tumble 
play gets them so excited that you know,

201
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,113
they get out of control.
Fundamentally rough and tumble play is 

202
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:51,504
an excellent mode of socialization 
because it teaches the child that just 

203
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,670
the distinction between aggression and 
too much aggression,

204
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,620
right?
Cause if you're wrestling with the kid,

205
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,130
the kid has to keep their behavioral 
output under a fair degree of control to

206
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:10,320
keep the game going,
to make it rough enough to be exciting.

207
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:12,510
But not so rough that they get hurt or 
you know,

208
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,120
that they stick their thumb in their 
dad's I or something like that.

209
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,350
And you can think of that from a 
Piagetian sense too because it's a game.

210
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,183
But imagine that if you're trying to 
figure out how to configure yourself 

211
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:27,180
around other people,
if you haven't had that rough and tumble

212
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,014
play,
you don't really know where the 

213
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:31,020
boundaries of your body are,
you know?

214
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,450
And,
and you don't know how much you can take

215
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,284
and how much you can be stretched and 
how much you can be thrown around and 

216
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,390
when something actually hurts rather 
than this frightening.

217
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:43,170
And so all of that intense sort of play 
that,

218
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,363
that,
um,

219
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,060
that boys in particular are likely to 
engage in all the girls also.

220
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:48,894
Like,
it

221
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,040
seems to be very useful for teaching 
children about to engage with the world,

222
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,640
but,
and with other people in a physical way.

223
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,474
And that's one of the physiological 
foundations for higher order 

224
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,880
socialization.
So it's very useful.

225
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:04,714
I mean I've,
I've often noted the children who 

226
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,340
haven't had the opportunity to engage in
physical play.

227
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,140
They're kind of awkward,
you know,

228
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:11,974
they,
they're not,

229
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,873
they're not seated well in their body 
and it's like they're kind of vague 

230
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,204
physically.
Whereas the ones who've been twisted 

231
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:20,740
around and Banton thrown up in the air 
and you know,

232
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,574
wrestled in general,
there are a lot more conscious of their 

233
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,443
limits and their abilities and their 
body and they're also much more able to 

234
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,010
invite other kids to play.
You can think about this with regards to

235
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:33,844
dogs.
You know,

236
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,710
if you have a dog,
you know the dog,

237
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,600
you can tell when the dog wants to play.
Right.

238
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,160
What does the dog do?

239
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,523
Yeah,

240
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,900
yeah.
It jumps around and it puts its rear end

241
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:47,600
in the air often and its head down,
it looks up,

242
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,763
which is a little bit submissive and a 
little bit friendly and it wags its 

243
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:52,484
tail.
It might bark and it moves back and 

244
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,240
forth and like little kids that want to 
play do well.

245
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:58,100
They don't put their tails in the air 
obviously,

246
00:12:58,101 --> 00:12:59,190
but they,
they,

247
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,073
they,
they engage in like play invitation 

248
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,410
behaviors like that,
you know,

249
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,483
a little bit of teasing sometimes and 
they were trying to get some play 

250
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:07,814
initiated down.
It's also practice for later dominance 

251
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,830
when chimps play the males in particular
as they approach adolescence,

252
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:16,664
the play behavior cause they'll all,
they'll throw sticks at the old chimps 

253
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:23,210
who were laying down and sleeping or 
come up and poke them or tease them.

254
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,403
And then as they become more and more 
powerful and more and more adolescents 

255
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:29,114
say you need to at all,
because I did not play will become full 

256
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:31,634
blown dominance challenges as you don't 
no doubt noticed if you were in junior 

257
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:38,510
high school because that's exactly what 
happens to teachers,

258
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:38,750
right?

259
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,583
The little elementary school kids,
they're kind of cute when they 

260
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,194
misbehave.
There's sort of playful but by the time 

261
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,623
grade eight or grade nine comes around,
the pushing on the teacher is a lot 

262
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:48,674
harder.
And so you can see how play shades into 

263
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:54,740
dominance dispute.
But it is a separate circuit exploration

264
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:55,574
that's a separate circuit.
And one of the things that we'll talk 

265
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,744
about today is Swanson's elaboration of 
the fact that half of the hypothalamus 

266
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,080
is fundamentally devoted towards 
exploration,

267
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:08,450
which is quite cool.
It means exploration is a really,

268
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:09,284
really,
really old system and it's sort of like 

269
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,070
if you haven't got anything else to do 
so you don't want to play,

270
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:17,630
you're not hungry,
you're not thirsty,

271
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,380
you're not angry,
you're not too warm or too cold,

272
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:22,370
et Cetera,
et cetera.

273
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,820
Your default isn't sort of quiescent 
sleep,

274
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,230
right?
You don't just

275
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,320
run out of batteries and lie on the 
floor unless you're of course,

276
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,820
obviously,
unless you're very tired.

277
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,043
What will generally happen is if the 
other fundamental motivational states 

278
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:38,884
have been satiated,
then you'll engage in exploration and 

279
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,710
some different people at different 
rates.

280
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,023
If you're an extroverted,
you'll engage in exploration in the 

281
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:49,234
social environment and if you're open,
then engage in exploration at a more 

282
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:53,924
cognitive level.
So that would be with regards to 

283
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:56,114
artistic creativity or to fiction or,
or the expression of some sort of 

284
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:03,830
intellectual or philosophical pursuit.
And the reason that you're wired up that

285
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,890
way is because if you have a little 
extra energy,

286
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,813
you might as well use that to map out 
more of the environment so that when 

287
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,454
push comes to shove,
somewhere down the road you'll be in 

288
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:21,491
possession of more information and more 
flexible and more knowledgeable in your,

289
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,723
in your,
in your conceptual and perceptual 

290
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,270
structures and also in your actions.

291
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,130
So people have a pretty strong tendency 
to default to exploration,

292
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,440
but there's variability in that.
Um,

293
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,610
you can also sort of divide up these 
motivations as ingestive or defensive.

294
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:38,444
That's not a bad way of looking at it.
And then there's reproductive 

295
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:45,641
motivations as well.
That's unlikely to be a full map.

296
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,150
It kind of depends on where you put the 
emotions because we know,

297
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:50,984
for example,
that there's a separate discussed 

298
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:57,110
circuit and that doesn't seem to load 
with anxiety or with pain.

299
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:57,531
It's,
it's,

300
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:58,364
it's its own biological
system and it seems to be associated 

301
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:03,944
with trait conscientiousness maybe and 
also with political conservatism in 

302
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,134
orderliness.
So those things are all quite 

303
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:12,740
interesting.
We all kind of clumped together and,

304
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,080
but whether that's an emotion or 
motivations,

305
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,900
not exactly clear,
but um,

306
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,963
we'll talk about it a little bit more.
So there's the hypothalamus and as you 

307
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:24,480
can see,
um,

308
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,450
it's not one thing.

309
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,523
Of course,
nothing at the macro level in the brain 

310
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,554
is one thing.
Obviously it's this layered thing just 

311
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,034
like everything else in the world except
even more so because the brain is so 

312
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,304
incredibly complicated.
And you can see by looking at that 

313
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,540
there's all those little,
all the things that are colored.

314
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,140
They're basically hypothalamic,
um,

315
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,980
modules I guess would be a reasonable 
way of putting it.

316
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,700
And you can tell they're even an 
anatomically distinct,

317
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,580
so obviously they're not doing exactly 
the same thing.

318
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,050
So you might think of brain anatomy as 
sort of a fixed,

319
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,770
what would you call something that we've
already managed quite well.

320
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:04,604
And we have all the categories.
Systems down in the structure of the 

321
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:09,290
brain is quite well known.
And that's really not true at all.

322
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,393
Like the brain is truly terra incognita 
and it isn't even like our naming a 

323
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,343
rituals let's say,
or conventions are not necessarily 

324
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,010
appropriate for one to one mapping of 
say structure onto function.

325
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,290
So,
um,

326
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,303
they're,
they're,

327
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,143
they're sort of anatomical,
they're markers for anatomical 

328
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:31,220
convenience in some ways.
Okay.

329
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,770
So,
so here's a way of thinking about it.

330
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,680
So you have your frame which specifies 
your lack.

331
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,760
Say I'm hungry and then a goal pops up,
which is,

332
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:41,594
well I should have something to eat.
And the hypothalamus is modulating 

333
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:45,674
perceptual and cognitive circuits so 
that you think that and so that you 

334
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,334
start to up the world into a place where
a hungry person like you could become 

335
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:59,391
satisfied and then the behaviors kick in
that are relevant to that,

336
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,710
um,
pursuit.

337
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,860
And so you can think of yourself as 
popping through these sorts of frames on

338
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,990
a fairly sick like basis throughout the 
day.

339
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,850
You know,
obviously you get hungry,

340
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:13,470
you get thirsty,
you get tired.

341
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,573
And so your consciousness is being 
modulated by subcortical circuitry that 

342
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,030
is basically charged with your self 
preservation.

343
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,430
And in some ways you come along for the 
ride.

344
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:31,431
I mean your consciousness is mostly 
there in some sense to detect deviations

345
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:35,220
from not so much expectation but from 
desire,

346
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,083
right?
Because you lay out one of these little 

347
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:37,494
maps on the world and then you want 
something to happen and what your 

348
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,454
consciousness does more or less is more 
monitor and if something that you don't 

349
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:51,930
want to happen happens,
then consciousness will take a look.

350
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:52,764
In some sense.
You remember that hierarchy of goals 

351
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:56,780
that I showed you from,
you know,

352
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,653
motor output up to high order goals.
Your consciousness kind of moves up and 

353
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,350
down that thing.
If you've made an error trying to figure

354
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:08,490
out at which level of abstraction that 
error should be rectified,

355
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,620
which is sort of what you do when you 
think,

356
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,813
and so that process is going to kick in 
whenever you're moving towards your 

357
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,140
desired end and something that you don't
want to have happen happens,

358
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:19,974
right.
Do you usually stop that sort of an Eng 

359
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,463
anxiety response?
The stopping and then if nothing else 

360
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,840
happens,
that's too bad.

361
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:30,120
Well then you'll,
you'll start to explore it in,

362
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:30,954
animals often do that by moving around,
but people will do that just as with 

363
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,023
with equal facility just by running 
simulations in their mind and trying to 

364
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:41,220
calculate what went wrong.
Right.

365
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,980
To try to think about it.
That's a form of exploratory behavior as

366
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:47,760
well that would be more associated with 
trait openness and with intelligence.

367
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,313
So,

368
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,863
so there's how m Swanson divides up the 
hypothalamus see the a little pink 

369
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,070
things there on the left are part of the
defensive circuits.

370
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:07,730
And then the red things on the laughter 
part of the reproductive circuits.

371
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:10,400
And you know,
obviously those,

372
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,760
the fact that those circuits exist lays 
onto Darwinian theory quite nicely.

373
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:16,694
The defensive circuits obviously protect
you from dying and the reproductive 

374
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:20,660
circuits,
you know,

375
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,250
facilitate your reproduction,
which is not much of a

376
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,690
fairly obvious conclusion.
Okay.

377
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,360
And so those are all located in this,
in this,

378
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,070
you know,
essential part of the brain,

379
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,293
the hypothalamic hypothalamus.
Now this is something little that's a 

380
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:40,994
little more complex.
So I'll go through it a little bit more 

381
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:43,930
carefully.
So if you look on the right,

382
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:44,764
right,
this is where Swanson perfectly onto 

383
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,630
piaget and I put this once in paper in 
as a optional reading,

384
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,940
but if you're interested in the sorts of
things that we're covering this class,

385
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,013
that's a great paper to hack your way 
through even though it's very hard 

386
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:06,991
because you learn a lot about the 
underlying biology of some of these more

387
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:11,530
complex clinical and developmental 
theories that we've covered.

388
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:16,531
So basically what Swanson is pointing 
out is that at the lowest level,

389
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,100
at the highest resolution level of your 
central nervous system,

390
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,413
your your,
you have motor output circuits that are 

391
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,963
enabling you to move and those are 
communicating in large part with your 

392
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:33,990
spine but also with lower parts of your 
brainstem.

393
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,893
So those are fundamental movements of 
the sorts that piaget would call 

394
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,374
reflexive.
And then the locomotor pattern 

395
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:43,750
generator.
I think the best way to think about this

396
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:44,584
from an analogical perspective,
and actually Alexander Luria used this 

397
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,030
analogy,
he called behavioral patterns,

398
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:55,010
kinetic melodies.
And it's a lovely phrase say,

399
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:55,844
because you know how obviously a song is
made out of notes and then the notes 

400
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:01,840
combined into phrases and the phrases 
combined Santa's passages.

401
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:02,674
And then,
well even more interestingly then if 

402
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:05,464
it's an orchestral piece of music,
multiple instruments are playing at the 

403
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:08,914
same time.
So it sort of extends right into the 

404
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:12,000
social domain.
But your,

405
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,863
your actions are sort of like that.
They're made out of micro routines and 

406
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:15,934
then those are chained together and 
those are chained together in higher 

407
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:23,170
order abstractions and so on,
all the way up to the cortex.

408
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,290
And so
Swanson points out that the,

409
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,040
the motor system has three sets of 
inputs.

410
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,000
So the cognitive system that sort of 
weigh up,

411
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,880
that's our level of abstraction that's 
way up in the brain.

412
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:42,090
So the cognitive system is where you 
know,

413
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,650
you might do a voluntary action.
So you look at something and say,

414
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:46,480
well I'm going to pick up this piece of 
paper.

415
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,733
And so that's talked down cortical 
control and then the state system input 

416
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,170
to the motor system.
The state system is your body monitoring

417
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,300
what's going on inside of itself.
And the autonomic nervous system is part

418
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:05,290
of the motor output system.
And so the state monitoring system takes

419
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:08,110
a careful look and the hypothalamus does
a fair bit of this,

420
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,093
takes a careful look at what's going on 
inside you and then activates different 

421
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:12,844
parts of your digestive.
And you know that the gut system 

422
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,550
fundamentally that,
that you have no conscious control over.

423
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,090
And then obviously their sensory system 
inputs too.

424
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,323
So,
so those are the three main inputs into 

425
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,374
the,
into the motor system and that acts on 

426
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:28,984
the environment.
And then the motor system has this 

427
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:34,900
hierarchical nature that's built from 
the spine upwards.

428
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:35,734
And so you can think of like the brain 
as a collection of ever expanding 

429
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,733
control systems that allow you to what?
Learn and undertake evermore complex 

430
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,020
motor schemes of action.
You know,

431
00:23:50,021 --> 00:23:50,854
and one of the things that people think 
about human beings is that we're very 

432
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:55,250
good at thinking,
right?

433
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,113
What,
we're not just good at thinking like 

434
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,910
work.
We're crazy,

435
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,420
crazily adaptable in terms of our motor 
output.

436
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:05,150
I mean if you watch the watch the 
Olympics,

437
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,373
you know when you see human beings can 
do things that no other animal could 

438
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:10,784
even think of doing.
I mean we're completely crazy when it 

439
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,990
comes to the sorts of things we can do 
with our body.

440
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,600
Like we're good on ice,
we're good in the water,

441
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,240
we can ski.
People are really good at jumping,

442
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,074
they can climb across buildings.
I people who train themselves can climb 

443
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:24,824
like mad.
I mean human beings are unbelievably 

444
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:27,854
variable in terms of their motor output.
So that's another part of our 

445
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:30,674
intelligence that's not just abstract.
And so in part that's because we have 

446
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:35,564
this very well developed cortical area 
that enables us to chain ever more 

447
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:44,741
complex patterns of behavior together 
and also to develop patterns of behavior

448
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:48,260
that are sort of outside instinctual 
specification.

449
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:52,490
So you imagine with an animal that has a
less complex brain,

450
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,273
a lot of its behavior is going to be 
limited to those cause a instinctual 

451
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:58,514
patterns of behavior that are devoted 
directly towards the solution of basic 

452
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:05,030
biological problems.
But you know,

453
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:07,280
we can kind of solve those without too 
much effort.

454
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,113
And then we have all this spare motor 
capacity leftover and people do the 

455
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:12,260
weirdest things with it,
you know,

456
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,930
and,
and really remarkable.

457
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,340
Absolutely remarkable things.
So that's,

458
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,750
that's pretty cool.
We're pretty cool that way.

459
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,120
We don't get enough credit for it,
I don't think,

460
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,060
because human beings think about human 
being as an animal,

461
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:26,511
which,
you know,

462
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:27,344
people are kind of loath to do.
We are definitely the most interesting 

463
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,950
animal.
I mean,

464
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:35,780
if you saw like a what a pygmy 
hippopotamus skateboarding,

465
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:37,700
you'd think that was pretty remarkable,
you know,

466
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,773
but people,
they do those sorts of things all the 

467
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:41,540
time.
And you know,

468
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,490
we just take it as a matter of course 
the lowest of motor neurone pools,

469
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,290
the lowest level,
the locomotor system,

470
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,590
it's locomotion and an action is foreign
by a subset of motoneuron tools.

471
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,900
That's wrong.
Motor neurons in the spinal cord,

472
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:00,734
ventral horn that innovates the limb 
muscles responsible for locomotor 

473
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,604
behavior.

474
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,890
I dictated this with dragon dictate and 
now and then it does weird things.

475
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:09,830
Hey,
so tools,

476
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:10,664
God only knows where that came from.
So a set of motor neurons in the spinal 

477
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:16,670
cord,
ventral horn.

478
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:17,504
So it's way down in the spine that 
innovate the llamas limb muscles 

479
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:20,894
responsible for locomotor behavior.
When you start to think about the brain 

480
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,200
as something that moves your body,
it's a lot easier to conceptualize.

481
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:29,480
The brain is something that's 
distributed through the body,

482
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,330
you know,
and your spine is actually quite smart.

483
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,120
So even though in some sense you don't 
think with it,

484
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,650
it's capable of very complex sensory 
detection and also motor mapping.

485
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:41,300
And so,
um,

486
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,793
mostly are relatively automated and 
relatively reflective one level up the 

487
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:51,300
existence of a spinal locomotor pattern 
generator.

488
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,253
So this shows that the spine isn't 
responsible just for the most basic of 

489
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:56,960
motor outputs or sensory inputs.

490
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,803
It can actually generate patterns is 
demonstrated by the fact that whereas a 

491
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:05,580
spinal animal displays no spontaneous 
locomotor activity.

492
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,700
So if you sever an animal,
it's nervous system.

493
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,680
So it only has the spine,
it'll just lay there,

494
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,390
you know,
you'd think it's paralyzed.

495
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,650
That's what you would think.
But coordinated limb movements,

496
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:20,484
characteristic of locomotion may be 
elicited when the limbs of such an 

497
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:24,534
animal are placed on a moving treadmill 
that's providing sematic sensory input 

498
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:30,930
to the pattern generator.
And so they've done this with people who

499
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:33,780
are paraplegic.
If you take someone who's paraplegic and

500
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:34,614
so they can't obviously walk and you 
hoist them up and you put them on a 

501
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,983
treadmill and you lean them forward,
their legs will walk and that spinal 

502
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,244
controlled.
So that's what you're doing with your 

503
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:47,244
spine,
you know,

504
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,190
because you're not thinking when you 
walk you're or you're not thinking about

505
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,024
walking unless you know,
unless you're one of those people who 

506
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:56,010
can't chew gum and walk at the same 
time.

507
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,293
So anyway,
so it just shows you how complex you 

508
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:01,560
are,
even at the,

509
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,380
you know,
the sort of the base levels of your,

510
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,500
of your intelligence hierarchy,
level up,

511
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,670
locomotor pattern controller.
So it's controlling the

512
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,340
locomotor pattern generator
in contrast,

513
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:20,310
undisturbed chronic hypothalamic 
animals.

514
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:21,144
Okay,
so now one of the ways people figured 

515
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,960
out how the brain works was by 
sectioning animals,

516
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:28,500
nervous systems when they're alive at 
different levels of complexity.

517
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:31,200
So a spinal animal is one that's 
basically paralyzed.

518
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,480
It's brain is separated from it spinal 
cord,

519
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,553
but then you can separate the 
hypothalamus with the intact spinal 

520
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:38,394
cord.
So it's one unit from the cortex and 

521
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:43,890
even from the memory systems and even 
from most of the emotion systems.

522
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:47,190
And so the animal in some sense hardly 
has a brain at all.

523
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,930
You know,
I mean the hypothalamus is,

524
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:49,764
you saw it's a little tiny thing and 
everything that's on top of that can be 

525
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:57,441
separated from it and the animal can 
still act spontaneously.

526
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,620
So,
so here's an example.

527
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:06,621
If this has been done with cats and if 
you have a female cat and it's in a cage

528
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,453
and it's only a hypothalamic animal,
it can basically manage like it can't 

529
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:16,350
learn new things very well and it,
it can't remember anything.

530
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,340
Like it doesn't have episodic memory and
so,

531
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,710
but it can,
it can maintain its temperature,

532
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:25,620
it can eat,
it can engage in sexual activity.

533
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,410
It's got defensive aggression.
Like most of the animal in some sense is

534
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:32,910
still there from an,
from an input output perspective.

535
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,760
Um,
it's also hyper exploratory,

536
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,740
which is quite interesting.
Hey,

537
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:38,670
because you wouldn't think,
well,

538
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:42,550
animal with no brain is the most 
exploratory kind of animal.

539
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,133
Well,
it happens to be the case as long as it 

540
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,114
has a hypothalamus.
So that shows you a how old exploration 

541
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:49,984
is,
but it also kind of gives you some clue 

542
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:52,450
about what the rest of the brain is 
doing.

543
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,290
I mean
you,

544
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,193
you explore new things we'll say.
So what that means is you have to be 

545
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:01,660
able to tell the difference between 
what's new and what isn't.

546
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,883
And so what you need to tell the 
difference between what's new and what 

547
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:06,334
isn't is memory.
And so a lot of what the higher order 

548
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,174
parts of the brain you're doing is 
basically keeping track of where you've 

549
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:13,594
been.
And so if you've been somewhere before 

550
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,200
then the exploratory circuit is 
basically shut off as long as everything

551
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,034
that you're doing there is working and 
you need the whole brain basically to 

552
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:28,180
shut off the hypothalamus in some sense.
That's how the thing works.

553
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:31,330
It's like you're kind of a default on 
system.

554
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,410
You know,
your,

555
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:34,660
your motor systems are ready to go and 
you're kind of,

556
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,390
you're alive and you're ready to go like
a wild animal.

557
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,490
But the cortex dampens that down.

558
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,563
And it does that by only allowing the 
activities that are relevant to that 

559
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:47,950
area that might be none of them to 
function at any one time.

560
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,850
So you take off the cortex while the 
animal can still do a lot of things,

561
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:52,684
but you know,
its ability to match its behavior to 

562
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:57,610
novel situations and to learn new 
behaviors is very,

563
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:58,600
very limited.
So it,

564
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,643
it becomes hyper exploratory,
but it can't remember anything and it 

565
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:06,220
becomes very limited in the flexibility 
of its behavior.

566
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:11,490
And so as you move farther up the 
hierarchy of complexity,

567
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,360
then you're able to do more and more 
novel and more and more complex and more

568
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:17,194
and more situation specific things.
So in the sense of providing a certain 

569
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:27,200
level of endogenous activity,
which means self-generated activity.

570
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:31,900
So the hypothalamic thalamic animal will
move by itself without being stimulated.

571
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,333
The hypothalamic locomotor region can be
thought of as a locomotor pattern 

572
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:37,534
controller,
which generates spontaneous inputs 

573
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:42,550
ultimately to the spinal locomotor 
pattern generator.

574
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,900
So there's,
there's hierarchy.

575
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,653
Um,
I already talked about behavioral state 

576
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:47,734
inputs.
There's another picture of the nervous 

577
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,890
system just to remind you of how it 
looks,

578
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,160
um,
counts distributed through the body.

579
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,373
Oh this is very interesting too.
I didn't learn this until I read this 

580
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:01,990
paper by Swanson.
I thought,

581
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:03,910
that's so dumb.
How could I have not learned that?

582
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:07,910
Like 30 years ago Swanson said that,
um,

583
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,170
let's go back one.
Did I?

584
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,850
Yeah,
Ray Moncayo.

585
00:32:10,851 --> 00:32:13,460
Kal was like the world's greatest 
neuroanatomist.

586
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,970
He was the guy who really established 
the field,

587
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:19,300
so did a tremendous amount of 
investigation into the fine structure of

588
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:23,050
the brain like 110 years ago,
a long time ago.

589
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,663
And he pointed out that sensory systems 
have a dual projection within the 

590
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:28,864
central nervous system.
I told you guys about blind sight 

591
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:31,331
already,
you know,

592
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:35,470
and I in fact that your eyes map onto 
different levels of the hierarchy,

593
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,420
say of sensory input and motor control.

594
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,493
Kal basically outlined the for that one 
branch goes directly to the motor 

595
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:43,730
system.
So it's,

596
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,743
that's for I to output mapping.
So that's fast cause there's not a lot 

597
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:48,734
of thinking in between.
And you might think that's bad because 

598
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:54,230
you want to think,
but it's good because sometimes you know

599
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:55,064
what to do and you don't want to thank 
you just want to execute it as fast as 

600
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,690
you possibly can.
So these lower orders,

601
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:01,700
simpler inputs are good for that sort of
thing.

602
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,720
One goes directly to the motor system 
and the other goes more or less directly

603
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:06,554
to the cerebral cortex where sensations 
and perceptions are elaborated and 

604
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:14,720
voluntary motor impulses are generated.
So this sort of explains for a long time

605
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,213
experimental psychology was dominated by
behaviorists who thought of the animal 

606
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:20,024
as a stimulus response machine and never
paid much attention to the function of 

607
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:28,310
things like thought or emotion or 
complex internal states.

608
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,340
And you know,
the behaviors got an awful long way with

609
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:35,690
their idea of the animal as a sort of 
simple stimulus response machine.

610
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,720
And that's partly because of this 
hierarchy that we're describing.

611
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,800
You know,
cause you,

612
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,570
you can treat an animal as if it's a 
pretty simple machine because it has all

613
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:45,404
that simple machinery in it.
It's just that on top of that simple 

614
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:51,110
machinery,
there's a lot more complex machinery.

615
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,840
And so,
but the simple machinery does a lot more

616
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:56,600
than people generally think and can do 
more than people think.

617
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:01,520
And so the fact that there are these,
at least two projections,

618
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:02,354
they branch more than that gives you 
right away a sense of why the behaviors 

619
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,170
could have been right and the cognitive 
psychologists could have been right.

620
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:10,004
And even the cycle dynamic thinkers can 
be right because they're analyzing the 

621
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:14,204
system at different levels of 
hierarchical complexity and extracting 

622
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:19,570
out slightly different,
um,

623
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,280
what would you call,
uh,

624
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,293
observations and some of these things,
or even like the simpler systems can 

625
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:28,970
have quite complex output.

626
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,803
So,
so one of the things that the simpler 

627
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:32,294
sensory motor system does is it detects 
snakes because primates don't like 

628
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:36,440
snakes.
In fact,

629
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,483
there's a woman named
Lynn is bell wrote a nice book on 

630
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:42,854
primate vision and snakes and she was 
very curious about why human beings 

631
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:46,710
could see so well.
And,

632
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,520
uh,
she also noticed that we're very good at

633
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,020
detecting,
um,

634
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,740
the sort of camouflage patterns that 
snakes used,

635
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,840
especially in the lower half of our 
visual field.

636
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:57,674
And she did this cross cultural survey 
around the world and found out that 

637
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,510
where there's more predatory snakes,
the primates have better vision.

638
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,643
So we sorta coevolved with snakes and 
snakes gave us vision just like it says 

639
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:12,620
in Genesis,
which is pretty damn funny as far as I'm

640
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:15,020
concerned.
And it was snakes in trees even so,

641
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,450
and fruit of course gave us color 
vision.

642
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,330
So the whole genesis story nailed it 
pretty well.

643
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,523
But you know,
snakes have been around long enough and 

644
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:26,330
have been our enemy or say predatory 
reptiles,

645
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:26,831
you know,
if,

646
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:29,900
if you don't really want to go with the 
little snake thing that are,

647
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,040
we've,
we've evolved,

648
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,410
we've coevolved with them.
It's like 60 million years.

649
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:35,060
It's a very,
very long period of time.

650
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,930
So Darwin used to amuse himself in a 
Darwinian way.

651
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,970
He'd go to the,
there is a zoo or a rep place that shows

652
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:46,740
reptiles,
I don't remember what they're called,

653
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:50,370
but they had one glass cage where there 
was some kind of poisonous snake,

654
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:51,204
I think it was a cobra.
And Darwin would put his face right up 

655
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:55,450
against the glass and the kroeber would 
go whack.

656
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,630
And he jumped back.
And he,

657
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,363
he did that many times because he was 
curious about whether or not he could 

658
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:05,430
actually bring the snake avoidance 
reflex under conscious control.

659
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,440
And he couldn't,
every time the snake jumped,

660
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:09,240
he jumped backwards.
He couldn't control it.

661
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,613
And so that's because all the primates 
that could control it when there were 

662
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:18,210
snakes biting them are dead.
So it was,

663
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,210
Darwin was the beneficiary of the 
Darwinian process in that,

664
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,070
in that sense.
So,

665
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,580
so the point is your body's conserved,
all these low level,

666
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:30,290
fast operating circuits.
And so you're a simple machine in a sort

667
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,940
of complex machine and an extremely 
complex machine.

668
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,983
And then something that's so complex 
that you can't even think about it as a 

669
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:38,730
machine and you're all those things at 
the same time.

670
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,003
And there's Swanson's take on how the 
motor system and the hypothalamus are 

671
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,330
integrated,
so it's quite nice.

672
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:54,360
He shows that the hypothalamic 
controller,

673
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,553
so that's one of the circuits that we've
been talking about that are responsible 

674
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:00,630
for a basic motivated state,
gets sensory input,

675
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,500
behavioral state input.
That's about the body and the input from

676
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:05,334
the cerebral hemispheres.
Hypothetically that's thought or or 

677
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:11,070
voluntary action plan,
something like that.

678
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,240
And then it has output to the motor 
pattern initiator,

679
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,740
the generators and the motor neuron 
pools and then you act lovely.

680
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,510
It's a beautiful,
beautiful model.

681
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,880
And so you can see that it maps very 
nicely onto that with the sort of higher

682
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:27,714
order levels of the,
of the hierarchy of sensory motor 

683
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,124
framing associated with cognitive 
abstractions in the lowest levels 

684
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:39,240
associated with the sorts of things that
you do with your spine.

685
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,223
And this,
I flip this upside down here because 

686
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,480
it's,
I,

687
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:50,280
I've been very interested in how people 
get traumatized and it's easier to think

688
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:51,114
of trauma when you flip the thing 
because once you develop the higher 

689
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,340
order abstractions cortically,
you know,

690
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:56,821
he'd say,
well,

691
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,380
I'm a good person,
let's say.

692
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,483
Then that's sort of the,
the fact that you're a good person or 

693
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,550
what constitutes good starts to become a
box.

694
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,990
The box within which all the things that
are associated with it are put,

695
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,330
it's one of the dangers of abstraction,
right?

696
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,583
And categorization.
Because if you couldn't think of 

697
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:16,824
yourself as a good or bad person,
let's say you didn't have that capacity 

698
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:23,220
for that level of abstraction,
which is like a binary abstraction,

699
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:25,020
right?
Good is,

700
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,393
you know,

701
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,700
one in and bad is zero.
So it's a really,

702
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:35,120
it's a really simple,

703
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,053
and so if someone,
if you do something that a good person 

704
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:40,444
wouldn't do,
well clearly you don't fit into the one 

705
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,380
category because a good person wouldn't 
do that.

706
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:49,000
So maybe you fit into the zero category.
And that's that capacity for abstraction

707
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:49,834
is also precisely the sort of thing that
allows human beings to undermine 

708
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:52,864
themselves with thought.
Because once you have that capacity for 

709
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:56,794
abstraction,
you can make these ridiculous over 

710
00:38:58,371 --> 00:38:59,650
generalizations.
In fact,

711
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:01,570
they're really simple.
I'm not a good person.

712
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:02,404
I'm a horrible person.
It's like that's what how someone who's 

713
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:07,660
really depressed thinks whenever,
whenever anything goes wrong.

714
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,793
And so it's the danger,
the powerful danger of abstraction is 

715
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:12,064
that you can make a terrible mistake and
overgeneralization this is partly 

716
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:17,740
because,
well,

717
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,753
let's say a hard know you're out with 
your girlfriend and you flirt with 

718
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:26,440
someone else.
Um,

719
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,840
so what does that say about your 
character?

720
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,633
Well,
she might think that puts you in the 

721
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,550
zero category like now,
right?

722
00:39:35,551 --> 00:39:37,560
You're not a good person.
It's like,

723
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:38,640
well,
it's complicated.

724
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:40,260
Is that or is that true?
Do you,

725
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,160
do you belong in that zero category?
She might treat you like that for a week

726
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:45,390
or two.
I mean,

727
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:46,224
should you be taking yourself apart 
completely because you've made that 

728
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:49,404
error?
Or should you seek farther down the 

729
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,793
chain of abstractions for a more 
specific mistake and or should she help 

730
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:56,910
you do that?
It's like,

731
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,290
well,
you're not a complete zero.

732
00:39:58,291 --> 00:39:58,980
You're more like,
uh,

733
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,480
you know,
0.1,

734
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,493
she could help you figure out exactly 
where in your personality hierarchy you 

735
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:06,810
have this fault.
So being that it's a fault,

736
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,973
you know,
maybe it's an indication that the 

737
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:10,380
relationship is over who,
who knows.

738
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,693
So anyways,
I wanted you to show you that because 

739
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,533
then you can develop a sense of how this
hierarchical system can also lead to 

740
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:22,620
cataclysmic overgeneralization and 
that's associated with lots of different

741
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:23,454
mental illnesses,
especially depression because depressed 

742
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:29,970
people generally go from a small mistake
while a mistake,

743
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,403
hard to parameterize,
right to the highest level of 

744
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,070
abstraction say,
well,

745
00:40:35,071 --> 00:40:37,170
I've made error a,
therefore I'm useless,

746
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,700
you know,
are therefore I bad?

747
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,000
It's not good.
It's a two undifferentiated,

748
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,500
I put that in there to remind you that 
all these little things

749
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,160
are informed
by the underlying hypothalamic circuits.

750
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,820
So you know that whole hierarchy has to 
be managed and how it's conditioned.

751
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:07,480
That whole hierarchy of motor output,
part of it is conditioned by,

752
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,493
and this is sort of like an output or an
input system that Swanson didn't talk 

753
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:12,940
about,
sort of sensory,

754
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,360
that whole motor sensory,
sensory,

755
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:18,550
motor hierarchy,
sensory motor perception,

756
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:19,384
action hierarchy will say has to be 
constructed so that your basic 

757
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,770
motivational states stay satiated,
right?

758
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:30,160
Because otherwise you get thirsty enough
and you die or you get hungry enough and

759
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:30,994
you die.
It's like you have to organize your 

760
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:37,280
behavior so that those basic motivations
stay fulfilled.

761
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,430
So each of the little,

762
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:41,830
okay

763
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,663
ovals that make up that hierarchy have 
to be organized and laid out with that 

764
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:48,364
set of limitations in mind.
But then of course there's a higher 

765
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:53,980
order limitation,
which is more the one that piaget talked

766
00:41:53,981 --> 00:41:54,814
about,
which is that not only do you have to 

767
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:56,974
organize your internal hierarchies to 
take care of all of your basic 

768
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:02,380
motivations,
but you have to do that well,

769
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:03,214
everyone else is doing the same thing.
And so in some sense the hypothalamic 

770
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:07,564
system that's generating the impetus for
these layers and layers of motor output 

771
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,600
also has to do so in a social context 
because otherwise,

772
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:17,434
you know,
you fight to the death over a stick of 

773
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:19,804
bread,
which seems like a very 

774
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:23,080
counterproductive thing to do.
So

775
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm trying to point out to you how many 
parameters those,

776
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,830
that hierarchical organization has to 
meet simultaneously.

777
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,323
Also that one of the implications of 
that is that it's not an arbitrary 

778
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:39,950
system.
Again,

779
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:44,240
this is one of the problems I have with 
the radical moral relativists stats.

780
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:45,800
It's like,
wait a minute,

781
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,323
wait a minute.
For you to set up your perceptual and 

782
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:51,104
behavioral system,
it has to solve a whole bunch of 

783
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,404
problems.
Like in they're really complex problems 

784
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:56,594
and they're,
and they're kind of arbitrary in some 

785
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:00,300
sense.
Like you get hungry and you need deet.

786
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,153
It's arbitrary.
So what that means is you can't fill 

787
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:05,990
that hierarchy with just any old thing.
You know,

788
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:10,970
not only does it have to work to keep 
all the complex parts of you functioning

789
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,600
here and now,
but it has to keep them functioning here

790
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:15,434
and now in a way that doesn't disturb 
them functioning tomorrow or the next 

791
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,910
day or the next week or the next month.

792
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,390
So that's integration across time spans.
That's a killer,

793
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,493
right?
Cause he can't just go out tonight and 

794
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:27,260
drink 40 ounces of vodka and then,
you know,

795
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:31,010
write the test on Thursday.
So there's a probably not.

796
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,040
So some of you might try.
So,

797
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,593
but then you also have to organize your 
behavior in the here and now with your 

798
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:40,844
behavior spread across timeframes in the
presence of other people who are also 

799
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:46,730
organizing their behavior across 
timeframes.

800
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,863
It's like once you put that many 
parameters on the organization of a 

801
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:50,894
personality,
you can see right away that it can 

802
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:54,830
hardly be arbitrary.
You know,

803
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,560
it's tightly constrained.
Okay.

804
00:43:57,561 --> 00:44:00,410
So here's some basic emotions.
We talked about basic motivations.

805
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:04,130
And so the web we're going to do in a 
simple way is we're going to divide them

806
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:07,040
into two positive emotions and negative 
emotions.

807
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,053
Okay?
And that basically gives you 

808
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:10,460
extroversion and neuroticism.

809
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,320
So positive emotions,
they kind of fall into two classes.

810
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:20,930
The one class is the positive emotion 
you feel when you,

811
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,470
when you run a motivational frame to its
limit.

812
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,710
So you're hungry,
you go have a peanut butter sandwich and

813
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:29,210
then you're no longer hungry.
Okay.

814
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:34,211
So what's the state?
How do you define the state after you've

815
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:37,290
eaten your peanut butter sandwich and 
you're no longer hungry?

816
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,630
Well,
you know,

817
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:40,464
you're not jumping up and down and 
cheering like someone who just made a 

818
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:42,960
touchdown,
right?

819
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:45,390
So it's,
it's not that kind of enthusiastic,

820
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,940
positive emotion that you see when 
people are celebrating,

821
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,330
you know,
it's more like satisfaction.

822
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,780
And that's actually technically what 
it's known as satiation.

823
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,420
And so when a motivational routine runs 
successfully,

824
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,463
what happens is it eliminates,
it eliminates the necessity for it to 

825
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:08,080
exist temporarily.
So basically what happens is you run A,

826
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,980
a framework to its logical conclusion.
Poof,

827
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:13,680
it disappears because it's done.
And you know,

828
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:14,514
you might be satisfied about that.
But that's the next thing that happens 

829
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,710
is another motivational framework pops 
up and you're,

830
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,270
you know,
you're in the same game.

831
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:25,500
It says office fundamentally.
So anyways,

832
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,113
it's satiation.
That is t the term satiation is 

833
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:34,230
technically use to describe the state of
being.

834
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,160
It's characteristic of the successful 
execution of a motivated frame.

835
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,920
It's also known as conservatory reward,

836
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,453
consummation consume.
And that's associated with 

837
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,810
unconditioned.
That's an unconditioned response

838
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,680
it,
which means you don't have to learn it.

839
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,950
So it's a,
it's an unconditioned positive response.

840
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,653
So,
and that means that satiating stimuli 

841
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,053
when delivered to a creature in the 
proper motivational frame have the 

842
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:12,480
properties of unconditioned rewards.
So you get three things there.

843
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:13,314
You know,
the satiation brings the moated frame 

844
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,653
motivated frame to an end.
The satiation is also known as consumer 

845
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:19,254
Tory reward.
Conservatory reward is very similar to 

846
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:25,500
what the behavior is described as 
unconditioned reward,

847
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,990
unlearned.
So you can,

848
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,840
you can stack each of those things to 
know on top of each other.

849
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:31,674
And then you've got the,
the other kind of positive emotion is 

850
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:35,664
the positive emotion that you feel when 
it looks like you might get a 

851
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:39,120
conservatory reward,

852
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,590
right?
Right.

853
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,090
Hope,
curiosity,

854
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,520
anticipation,
excitement,

855
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:46,354
enthusiasm,
all of the positive emotions that we 

856
00:46:48,311 --> 00:46:49,144
think of as really like happy,
happy usually has to do with evidence 

857
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:57,580
that your pursuit of a valued 
conservatory reward is going well.

858
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,080
Okay?
Now that this,

859
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:00,923
that's incentive reward and the reason 
it's called incentive reward is because 

860
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,960
you're incentivized to move forward to 
the reward and the moving forward.

861
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,990
The impulse to move forward towards a 
desired goal.

862
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,710
That's what your positive emotion 
systems,

863
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:15,544
the dopaminergic systems that are 
nestled have the roots in the 

864
00:47:18,131 --> 00:47:22,300
hypothalamus.
That's what they motivate you to do.

865
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,583
That's what positive emotion is.
Fundamentally positive emotion is 

866
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:27,280
there's something good,
I'm going to go get it.

867
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,323
It's the,
I'm going to go get part that's 

868
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:32,110
associated with excitement and positive 
emotion.

869
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:34,090
It's what you feel.
Maybe you're an extrovert,

870
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:37,630
you want to go to a party and so you're 
probably more excited about going to the

871
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:37,900
party.

872
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,910
Then you will be when you get there,
you know,

873
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:40,923
because it's the,
it's the apprehension of the reward 

874
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:45,580
that's with human beings because we're 
such weird creatures.

875
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,623
So often the apprehension of the 
conservatory ward is a more powerful 

876
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,523
emotion than the emotion that's actually
felt as a consequence of gaining the 

877
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:56,350
reward itself.
And that's partly,

878
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:58,090
and this is where it gets a little more 
complicated.

879
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,640
That's part of it because we're so 
bloody exploratory,

880
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,863
you know?
So there's things that you can learn 

881
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,970
about that are associated with the 
conservatory reward.

882
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,500
Those are conditioned rewards.
So an incentive reward and the condition

883
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:13,334
reward are in the same category.
Although not all incentive rewards are 

884
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:18,604
learned.
This is where the behaviors went wrong 

885
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:22,660
because the behavior's thought there are
consumer Tory rewards.

886
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:27,850
Those are unconditioned rewards to get a
conditioned to come.

887
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,330
If you condition a stimulus to an 
unconditioned reward,

888
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:34,810
you get a condition stimulus with a 
conditioned reward as a response.

889
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:35,643
But the problem with that line of 
thinking is that there's actually 

890
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,220
incentive reward circuitry.
It's not just secondary learning.

891
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:44,890
It's like incentive rewards have been 
around so long.

892
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:47,950
So those are things that indicate that a
conservatory reward is coming.

893
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,023
They've been around so long that your 
brain has developed its own circuit for 

894
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:52,294
that.
And that's the one that produces 

895
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:57,070
positive emotion.
And so that's also produced by the way,

896
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,143
if you,
when you're taking a drug of some sort 

897
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:00,814
that you really like,
that's because it's activating this 

898
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:04,414
dopaminergic incentive reward system.
If you take a drug that activates 

899
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:08,614
conservatory reward,
you just like lay in front of the fire 

900
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:11,800
like a sleeping dog,
you know,

901
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:13,210
it's,
it's not exciting.

902
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,890
It's cocaine,
amphetamines,

903
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:18,460
alcohol for lots of people nail the 
incentive reward system.

904
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:19,294
And that's the dopaminergic exploratory 
system that emerges out of the 

905
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:25,150
hypothalamus.
And it's also the thing that learns what

906
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:27,490
to associate with conservatory rewards.

907
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,960
So I know that's a lot to take in,
but well it doesn't matter.

908
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:33,520
That's how it is.
So,

909
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:39,650
so the approach systems respond to cues 
of consumer Tory reward.

910
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:44,570
And they also,
they also respond to a large set of um,

911
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,280
biologically prepared stimuli smells,
for example.

912
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,990
So
now you should approach good things,

913
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,050
but if a bad thing happens,
what should you do?

914
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,420
Well,
one thing you should do is stop.

915
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,850
Another thing you should do is get the 
hell out of there.

916
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,043
So there's a constellation of negative 
emotions that are associated with 

917
00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:06,274
defense and avoidance,
and we kind of ran through those 

918
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,130
already.
Pain,

919
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,270
grief,
frustration,

920
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:13,270
disappointment,
and then fear,

921
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:18,271
which is sort of what you learn.
You learn that things to be feared.

922
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:21,580
Signal,
primary pain,

923
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:22,930
stimulus,
you know,

924
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:24,520
so a child is going to be afraid of a 
needle,

925
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,530
especially if the child's got a needle 
before.

926
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,033
Most children are smart enough to figure
out what they should be afraid of the 

927
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:30,464
needle even when they haven't had it.
But the thing is is that if you come 

928
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:34,784
into contact with something that's 
already caused you pain and now there's 

929
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,580
something that only signals that that's 
likely to happen,

930
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:44,040
that's when you experience fear.
Okay?

931
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:44,874
And fear is its own circuit again,
which is where the behaviors in some 

932
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:48,764
sense wind a little bit wrong to cause 
they thought of unconditioned 

933
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:51,764
punishment,
which produces pain as the primary 

934
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:57,350
motivational system.
So it would be unconditioned punishment,

935
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,070
unconditioned reward.
Then there were things you learned about

936
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:02,830
those that produced conditioned 
punishment.

937
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:04,370
Conditioned reward.
Okay.

938
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:07,040
But all of those have circuits,
independent circuits.

939
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,233
So the defense and avoidance,
negative emotions seem to be roughly 

940
00:51:11,331 --> 00:51:13,220
pain,
anxiety and fear.

941
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:14,054
But then there's discussed and people 
have been looking at discussed a lot 

942
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:19,220
lately and it doesn't load on 
neuroticism,

943
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:20,750
it doesn't seem to load on neuroticism.

944
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,760
So it's its own circuit.
So,

945
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,640
okay,
so here's another one.

946
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:28,340
Other complexity that you need to 
grapple with,

947
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:31,850
which is there are things that hurt that
cause you pain.

948
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,560
There are things that are satiating and 
letter our conservatory reward.

949
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,410
Then there are things that signal each 
of those,

950
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,830
but there's one class of stimuli,
so to speak,

951
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:45,890
or things that you're going to encounter
that or a paradoxical,

952
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,310
and that's the class of things that you 
don't understand.

953
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,400
That's novelty and novelty.
It's,

954
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:53,234
it's,
it's novelty itself that sort of 

955
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:57,800
associated with what the 
phenomenologists are primarily concerned

956
00:51:57,801 --> 00:51:58,634
about.
The idea of the revelation of meaning 

957
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,243
because the revelation of beating is 
mostly associated with you encountering 

958
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,980
something that you haven't already 
understood.

959
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:07,933
Right?
You explore that new information comes 

960
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,450
out of it,
a new you comes out of it.

961
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,240
Okay,
so you're going from point a to point b,

962
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,630
what might happen?
Well,

963
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,753
things might happen that that appear to 
demonstrate that you're on the right 

964
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:24,830
track.
So that makes you happy.

965
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:26,570
That's the yellow box,
positive emotion.

966
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,910
You know,
your,

967
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:29,803
your pathway is being facilitated.
So that's why tools are sort of sort of 

968
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:35,720
in that category.
Or you can be moving towards point b and

969
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:36,554
you get something gets in your way.
And that might be something that hurts 

970
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:40,340
you,
that'd be,

971
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:42,913
and that hurt would be pain or 
disappointment or frustration or grief 

972
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,750
or something that signals that you might
get hurt,

973
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,913
which is threat not produces fear.
And so the positive emotion is moving 

974
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:58,010
you towards the desired goal in the 
negative emotion is protecting you.

975
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,413
And so if a negative things happens,
you'll stop and then you'll reconfigure 

976
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:04,034
the behavior that you're using or the 
framework in order to get around the 

977
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:09,770
obstacle and to continue.
Or if it's a bad enough obstacle,

978
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:11,270
you'll,
you might say,

979
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,104
well,
I'm not,

980
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,560
I'm too tired to eat and I'm too hungry 
to sleep.

981
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,270
That happens to people,
right?

982
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,220
It's a conflict of motivations.
And so if you get up and you go into the

983
00:53:23,221 --> 00:53:25,200
cupboard and you find out that there's 
nothing to eat,

984
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,041
you might say,
Oh,

985
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:27,690
to hell with it,
then I'll just go to sleep.

986
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,540
You know?
So sometimes the way you solve a problem

987
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,374
is by flipping the problem.
It's like we're not going to solve that 

988
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:35,160
problem right now.
We'll turn to another problem some.

989
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,410
And that's an explorer.
That's an exploratory move.

990
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,990
Sometimes you operate within the frame,
you know,

991
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,870
you go to the cupboard,
the cupboard is bare.

992
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,350
Yeah,

993
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,183
but you're hungry.
So you walked down to the corner store 

994
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:46,954
and you get something to eat.
And so that way you've sort of stayed 

995
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:51,760
within the frame and altered.
You know,

996
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,603
you've altered your behavior to too,
you've thought up another path and 

997
00:53:57,201 --> 00:54:01,580
altered your behavior so that that 
motivated state can run to completion.

998
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:06,683
Here's another way of looking at it.
You can be moving from point a to b and 

999
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,850
what you predict or want is happening.
That's a good thing that keeps your mood

1000
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,400
straight and you happy and that makes 
you whoa.

1001
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,263
That's a promise with the promise is 
you're going to get what you want and 

1002
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:23,250
that fills you with hope.
That's positive emotion.

1003
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,620
Or you can have an unpredicted outcome 
when you're,

1004
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,880
you know,
you uh,

1005
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,030
[inaudible] you're supposed to be going 
out with your friend,

1006
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,960
you go to the door,
you knock and there's nobody there.

1007
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,910
So it's like,
what's up with that?

1008
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,830
And so it's in a sense when that 
happens,

1009
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:39,810
there's like a hole in your framework,
you know,

1010
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,990
cause your framework was predicated on 
the presence of your friend,

1011
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,210
right?
It was a presupposition.

1012
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:46,643
And so now,
and then you'll run out of behavioral 

1013
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:50,220
routine and one of your presuppositions 
is wrong.

1014
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,970
And it's sort of like there's a hole in 
your theory and the whole,

1015
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,030
you sort of drop into it.
And when you drop into that hole,

1016
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,953
you get anxious because you don't know 
exactly what this unexpected thing 

1017
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:05,970
means.
And behind that you get exploratory.

1018
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,380
So with most people,

1019
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,563
they're going to get afraid first.
They're going to have negative emotion 

1020
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:11,784
first when they're little plan is blown.
And then if nothing additionally awful 

1021
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:15,894
happens and if they don't drive 
themselves crazy with some hypothesis 

1022
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,870
about he doesn't like me anymore and so 
no one likes me anymore,

1023
00:55:21,871 --> 00:55:24,000
so I'm a terrible person,
you know,

1024
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:27,030
then the x,
once they calm down a little bit,

1025
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:31,110
the exploration circuit will come up and
maybe they'll walk somewhere else,

1026
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,480
go to a bar,
or maybe they'll stand there and think,

1027
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:34,260
well,
you know,

1028
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,150
this didn't work out,
so what else could I do?

1029
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:40,140
And emotionally stable person say a non 
neurotic personnel flipped it out really

1030
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:40,974
fast,
especially if they're extroverted and 

1031
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:42,774
open.
Where someone who's heavy and negative 

1032
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:45,330
emotion,
you know,

1033
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:48,420
the fact that their friend wasn't there 
when they told them they would be,

1034
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,880
that might just produce a hole that they
fall into and it's,

1035
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:52,170
you know,
so deep and painful.

1036
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:54,420
They just go home and cry.
So,

1037
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:59,070
so the neuroticism and the extroversion 
are in some sense,

1038
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:04,080
they vary with the degree to which the 
negative emotion system is strong,

1039
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:07,530
or the positive emotion system is strong
and they're two different systems.

1040
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,690
And so you can think of them in some 
sense.

1041
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:10,680
You can think of the mass

1042
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:17,250
units of positive emotion per unit of 
promise.

1043
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:18,870
It's,
I mean,

1044
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,703
it's a weird thing to try to quantify or
units of negative emotion per unit of 

1045
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,020
threat.
So,

1046
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:26,920
you know,
if someone,

1047
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,110
maybe someone,
there's a rumor going around that you're

1048
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:29,944
going to lose your job.
Well how much should you worry about 

1049
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,070
that?
Well,

1050
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:34,120
God,
you don't know.

1051
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,800
So how do you decide?
Well,

1052
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:36,700
you don't,
you're,

1053
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,580
you're wiring decide.
So if you're high in negative emotion,

1054
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:41,410
you're going to get all anxious and 
freak out about it,

1055
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,110
which might be the right thing to do.
Maybe you will lose your job.

1056
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,430
And if you're emotionally stable,
you're going to thank God.

1057
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,650
I probably won't lose my job,
but even if I can't,

1058
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,530
even if I do,
I'm,

1059
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:55,180
I'm not gonna worry about it.
It's innate or lot of it's innate.

1060
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,523
So,

1061
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,970
okay.
So to recapitulate learning theory,

1062
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,300
behaviorism,
there are unconditioned rewards.

1063
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,360
Those are rewards you don't have to 
learn.

1064
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:12,260
Those are the things that bring a 
motivated state to its closure,

1065
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,370
roughly speaking,
and that makes you satisfied.

1066
00:57:16,371 --> 00:57:17,780
Satiation.
That by the way,

1067
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:22,520
is associated with Serotonin.
Serotonin is a satiating neurochemical,

1068
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,160
so if you're high levels of Serotonin 
are high,

1069
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,173
you're kind of satisfied,
which means you don't experience a lot 

1070
00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:30,410
of positive emotion or a lot of negative
emotion.

1071
00:57:30,411 --> 00:57:33,230
You're just kind of satisfied.
It's a high dominance thing.

1072
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,303
It's like all of the consumer.
Tory rewards are there when you need 

1073
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:37,514
them.
You don't have to worry and you don't 

1074
00:57:38,631 --> 00:57:43,550
have to get too excited.
Conditioned rewards or incentive rewards

1075
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:47,120
indicate progress towards a consumer,
consumer Tory reward.

1076
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:48,103
They can be learned or condition,
but they can also be a nate and they're 

1077
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:51,434
associated with dopaminergic activation 
and that's the exploration circuit that 

1078
00:57:54,741 --> 00:57:56,860
comes out of the hypothalamus.
Half the hymen,

1079
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:02,110
hypothalamus does goal specification
and the other half does exploration,

1080
00:58:02,871 --> 00:58:03,704
and so again,
if you're pursuing something that's an 

1081
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:11,411
identifiable goal and you fail,
well then you're going to back off.

1082
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:12,463
That's negative emotion.
Then you're going to start to explore 

1083
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,223
and that's that dopaminergic circuit.
What's associated with dopaminergic 

1084
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,533
activation,

1085
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,490
exploration,
extroversion,

1086
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:25,720
happiness,
play,

1087
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:26,583
enthusiasm,
assertiveness and the positive element 

1088
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,340
of novelty.
Okay,

1089
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:33,040
so that makes sense.
Anybody have any questions?

1090
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:33,874
I know that's a lot of information,
but I kind of designed this part of the 

1091
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:37,864
course so that at this point the levels 
of analysis would stack up so that you 

1092
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:41,944
could understand them simultaneously.
So the hypothalamus sets up your frames 

1093
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:48,484
of motivation

1094
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,500
running one of those two,
the co two.

1095
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:55,960
It's positive conclusion.
That satisfying.

1096
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,830
That's innate.
It's because it's consumer Tory reward.

1097
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:00,664
You'll work for that.
Anything that indicates that that might 

1098
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:05,410
happen,
that's incentive reward.

1099
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:07,570
You can learn that.
But some of it's also a nate,

1100
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,390
which is where the behaviors didn't know
that cause they thought of all the,

1101
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,240
all the secondary stuff that condition 
stuff has learned.

1102
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,360
It's not all learned.
Some of it's already prepared.

1103
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,370
You see a snake,
that's a threat.

1104
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,820
You don't have to learn that.
So fire is sort of like that as well.

1105
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,620
Um,
blood is like that.

1106
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,440
Teeth are like that.
Staring eyes are like that.

1107
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:30,560
Predatory postures are like that.
Um,

1108
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,280
loud,
loud vocalizations,

1109
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:38,720
especially if they're like low,
low in frequency,

1110
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:39,943
they indicate a large animal.
All those things are things you don't 

1111
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:42,674
have to learn to be afraid of because 
they've been so consistently dangerous 

1112
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:46,844
in the past that you've built up a 
circuit that aren't responds 

1113
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,120
automatically to the question.

1114
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,210
It seems like there will at least.

1115
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,130
Yeah,
it's complicated,

1116
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:04,964
you know,
because they do play a bit of an 

1117
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:08,360
inhibitory role,
but they're separate circuits,

1118
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:09,853
you know,
so you can be very extroverted and very 

1119
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,270
high in negative emotion.
Okay.

1120
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,173
So,
and you can be very emotionally stable 

1121
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:20,300
and very low in extroversion too.
So,

1122
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:22,550
but they are definitely separate things 
now.

1123
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:23,570
It's hard,
you know,

1124
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,210
you can flip from laughing to crying 
very rapidly,

1125
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:27,703
you know?
So people are very much capable of 

1126
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:31,820
experiencing mixed states of positive 
and negative emotion.

1127
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,863
Plus there are forms of manic depressive
disorder where people are manic and 

1128
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:36,554
depressed at the same time,
which I wouldn't recommend the people I 

1129
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:42,290
know that have had that they,
they seem to think that is certainly not

1130
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,880
fun.
So

1131
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,003
yeah,

1132
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,720
agitation,
tremendous agitation.

1133
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,113
So you're probably just sorta like that 
when you're deeply confused and you're 

1134
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:56,500
really bothered by it because then the 
threat circuits are going,

1135
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,390
but you're also sort of wandering around
going,

1136
01:00:58,391 --> 01:00:59,500
oh,
what am I going to do?

1137
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:00,573
That's all.
That's all like approach behavior 

1138
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,870
approach.
Motivation isn't always positive a,

1139
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:06,783
I mean most of the time it is,
but intensity managers and 

1140
01:01:09,311 --> 01:01:11,710
controllability matters too,
so,

1141
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:16,120
okay.
Unconditioned punishments,

1142
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:17,823
fundamentally they produce pain.
They also tend to Ha if you ran a 

1143
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:28,240
behavioral routine or a motivated 
framework that results in punishment,

1144
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,970
you're less likely to run it again in 
the future.

1145
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:31,923
That's learning.
If you run a motivated frame and it 

1146
01:01:34,271 --> 01:01:35,104
works,
you're more likely to run it in the 

1147
01:01:35,741 --> 01:01:37,560
future.
That's learning too,

1148
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,373
so I'm conditioned.
Punishments decrease the probability 

1149
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:46,300
that you're going to run to give and 
motivational frame because it failed.

1150
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,260
Right?
Do you run out?

1151
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,790
You got hurt.
It's like,

1152
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:52,660
don't do that again.
That's part of the purpose of memory and

1153
01:01:52,661 --> 01:01:53,940
the pain,
like emotions,

1154
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,660
just to say it again.
Our pain,

1155
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,850
frustration,
disappointment,

1156
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,580
grief,
sadness is in there as well,

1157
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:02,770
so those are paying like states of 
emotion,

1158
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,773
conditioned punishments.
Those are things that indicate that a 

1159
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:10,930
punishment is likely.
Some of them you can learn.

1160
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:14,270
Some of them you don't have to because 
they're already built into you.

1161
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:17,770
The negative emotions are dampened by 
Serotonin.

1162
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,880
That's the brain system.
Fundamentally,

1163
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,850
it's the serotonergic system is like a 
conductor of the orchestra.

1164
01:02:23,851 --> 01:02:27,630
It keeps everything in,
in balance and Gabba.

1165
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,070
Gabba is a anxiety lytic.
It makes people less anxious.

1166
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,960
It's endogenous.
Your brain produces it.

1167
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:39,290
If you take valium or barbiturates,
they act on the Gaba system.

1168
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:40,124
It's so does alcohol.
That's part of the reason why people 

1169
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:45,000
like alcohol because it dampens anxiety.
Now for some people,

1170
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:48,180
alcohol or also produces dopaminergic 
activation.

1171
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:52,950
So they really like alcohol because it 
calms them down like they're not anxious

1172
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:53,784
anymore.
And it also feels it produces incentive 

1173
01:02:57,031 --> 01:02:59,730
reward activation like cocaine for.
So for some people,

1174
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,743
alcohol is and absolutely deadly drug.
You can probably find out if you're 

1175
01:03:04,051 --> 01:03:07,590
susceptible to alcoholism quite 
straightforwardly.

1176
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,370
If you want to find out,
sit in a bar,

1177
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,563
take your pulse.

1178
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:14,430
Yeah,

1179
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:17,940
down five shots,
four shots.

1180
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:20,010
If you're little,
you gotta get your,

1181
01:03:20,011 --> 01:03:23,430
you got to get your blood alcohol level 
above legal intoxication or you won't be

1182
01:03:23,431 --> 01:03:26,220
able to tell and then take your pulse 
again 10 minutes later.

1183
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,580
If your pulse has gone up,
eight beats are more,

1184
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:34,170
watch it because you're probably 
producing an opiate response to alcohol.

1185
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,920
Secondary consequence of the opiod 
responses are dopaminergic response,

1186
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,113
reasonable probability that you'll like 
alcohol enough to find it difficult to 

1187
01:03:42,421 --> 01:03:44,070
stop drinking.
Once you start,

1188
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,570
some of you are probably like that,
right?

1189
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,450
You have a few drinks.
It's like ha,

1190
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:51,270
that's how we do it in Alberta anyways.
So,

1191
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:55,140
so part of that's killing the incentive 
reward system.

1192
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:59,220
And because it's an approach system and 
it's being cued by the alcohol,

1193
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:00,054
you just continue to hit it.
And the dopamine kicks only occur as 

1194
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:09,180
your blood alcohol level is rising.
So you have to keep nailing it,

1195
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,450
nailing yourself with alcohol because 
otherwise your blood alcohol level won't

1196
01:04:12,451 --> 01:04:13,284
keep rising and you won't get that nice 
enthusiasm and assertiveness that goes 

1197
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:19,950
along with the positive element of 
alcohol.

1198
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,480
Neuroticism.
So this is the neuroticism dimension.

1199
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,793
Um,
there's this gender difference in 

1200
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:28,824
neuroticism.
Women are about half a standard 

1201
01:04:30,811 --> 01:04:33,630
deviation,
higher negative emotion than men.

1202
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,810
It's seems like a cross cultural 
universal,

1203
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:37,973
the differences more enhanced.
And he galitary and states like 

1204
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:41,004
Scandinavia,
which is exactly the opposite of what 

1205
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:44,190
you'd presume,
right?

1206
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:46,170
If you were say us.
Um,

1207
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,490
a radical,

1208
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,513
I can't remember the name.
If you are someone who believes that 

1209
01:04:52,141 --> 01:04:54,540
everything occurs as a consequence of 
socialization,

1210
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:55,643
as you equalize the society,
the gender differences in personality 

1211
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:01,290
become larger rather than smaller.
So,

1212
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,153
which is,
you know,

1213
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,410
not what anybody expected.
But that's what happened.

1214
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:08,760
So boys and girls seem to have about the
same level of negative emotion.

1215
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,773
But as soon as puberty hits,
women become higher negative emotion 

1216
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,074
than men on average.
There's still a lot of overlap between 

1217
01:05:14,971 --> 01:05:19,900
the genders and it never goes away again
across the life course once it kicks in,

1218
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:21,760
in puberty.
And the reasons for that,

1219
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,920
women are smaller,
they're,

1220
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,650
their upper bodies are weaker,
so they're more physical,

1221
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,630
they're there at a physical 
disadvantage.

1222
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:31,810
If they're in a dominance dispute,
they're sexually vulnerable,

1223
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:32,943
plus they have to take care of infants.
So I think those four things are 

1224
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:36,574
probably enough to tilt the nervous 
system of women more towards negative 

1225
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,463
negative emotion.

1226
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,740
I've often thought maybe that women's 
name,

1227
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:44,883
emotional systems,
the negative ones in particular are 

1228
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:47,524
actually not tuned to the woman.
I think there are tuned to the woman 

1229
01:05:51,101 --> 01:05:54,110
infant combination.
So you know,

1230
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:57,040
if you think about it from an,
if you think about it for bit,

1231
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:01,840
it almost has to be that way because an 
infant has to be carried around for like

1232
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,673
a year and a half.
And so at that point when you have an 

1233
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:08,200
infant and maybe you're going to have 10
you know you guys won't,

1234
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:10,330
but in the evolutionary past,
that would have been the case.

1235
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:13,810
You'd have an infant for a bunch of your
life and then you'd be a grandmother and

1236
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:15,280
have an incident.
It's like,

1237
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,833
why wouldn't your nervous system be 
tuned at puberty for the two of you 

1238
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:23,860
instead of one of you?
So how could it be any other way?

1239
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:29,220
Anyways.
All right,

1240
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:32,380
I'll give you one more.
What time is it?

1241
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:35,350
This clock says one 46 is that vaguely 
correct?

1242
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:37,690
Okay,
wonderful.

1243
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,673
One 48 five okay,
now I'm going to run you through a 

1244
01:06:41,861 --> 01:06:43,030
problem that took me

1245
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:44,203
like

1246
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:46,631
yes,
yes.

1247
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:50,160
Two 48 ts.
So let's see.

1248
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,433
Oh yes.

1249
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:57,040
Okay.
Two things.

1250
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,443
So you've got your hypothalamus and then
on top of that you've got some circuits 

1251
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:02,254
that deal with memory and emotion.
So I'm going to run you through the 

1252
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:06,250
hippocampus and the Amygdala relatively 
quickly.

1253
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:07,413
So this is a theory that was basically 
put together by socal [inaudible] who's 

1254
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:11,124
a Russian neuropsychologist back in 1962
but it's a variant of a theory that 

1255
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:17,530
Norbert Wiener developed back in the 
forties so here's the idea.

1256
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,960
You wander through the world and you,
if you're in a place that you know,

1257
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,320
okay,

1258
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,320
your memory systems,
they hit the campus,

1259
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:30,154
looks inside your memory systems to see 
what it is that you want to have happen 

1260
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,450
based on your understanding of the 
world.

1261
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,220
Okay?
So

1262
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:41,613
you're in a motivated state,
but you have certain expectations that 

1263
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:44,824
makes sense within that state.
So the hippocampus is watching what you 

1264
01:07:47,411 --> 01:07:50,050
think is going to happen.
But remember that's motivated.

1265
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:54,340
It's not just expectation.
And then the hippocampus is also looking

1266
01:07:54,341 --> 01:07:59,341
at the world.
Now it's looking at an interpretation of

1267
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:03,460
the world because you can't help but 
interpret the world.

1268
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:07,180
But fundamentally the hippocampus is 
looking inside you and outside you.

1269
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,673
And then it seeing if what's happening 
inside and what's happening outside are 

1270
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:16,100
the same,
which means you know what you're doing

1271
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,560
and you know where you are.
And if they're the same.

1272
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:19,423
So if it detects a match,
then the hippocampus inhibits the 

1273
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:26,390
Amygdala and the hypothalamus,
roughly speaking.

1274
01:08:26,391 --> 01:08:27,224
Now what did it actually seems to do?
There's a little circuit in your brain 

1275
01:08:29,841 --> 01:08:31,670
stem called the reticular activating 
circuit,

1276
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,860
and it's the thing that turns your brain
on at night.

1277
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:36,470
If you're sleeping and you hear a noise 
that you shouldn't hear,

1278
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:37,790
it's like bang,
you're awake.

1279
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:40,640
It's the reticular activating system.
Way Down in your brainstem,

1280
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:45,350
puts your cortex into a high arousal 
state and Poof,

1281
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:46,184
you're conscious.
Now the hippocampus tells the reticular 

1282
01:08:49,731 --> 01:08:53,210
activating system to basically remain 
calm as well,

1283
01:08:53,211 --> 01:08:54,044
as long as what you're expecting and 
desiring and what's happening are the 

1284
01:08:58,941 --> 01:09:01,100
same thing.
So it's sort of like it's saying,

1285
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,750
I know you could jump up and freak out 
and run about,

1286
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:07,070
but you don't have to right now because 
everything's going according to plan.

1287
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:10,520
But as soon as there's a deviation 
that's an normally say,

1288
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,500
then the hippocampus says,
Whoa,

1289
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,753
something's wrong here.
And the it does inhibits the reticular 

1290
01:09:16,821 --> 01:09:19,430
activating system that turns on your 
emotions,

1291
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:20,264
especially your negative emotion,
but it primes your positive emotion and 

1292
01:09:22,971 --> 01:09:25,850
it prime some of the hypothalamic 
circuits to or disinhibiting them.

1293
01:09:25,851 --> 01:09:26,684
Because one way of solving the fact that
something isn't going well is to switch 

1294
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:31,484
to something else.
So it's sort of like it's a bunch of 

1295
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,204
circuits on underneath you,
but they're being held back like race 

1296
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,073
horses in race horse and then something 
that you don't expect happens in the 

1297
01:09:43,371 --> 01:09:45,710
gates come up a little bit because then 
you're prepared.

1298
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:47,600
Now a lot of that's negative emotion.
Oh,

1299
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:49,550
you don't know where you are.
But a lot of,

1300
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:50,503
a lot of the rest of it is be prepared 
to do whatever the hell you might need 

1301
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:53,504
to do next.
And so normally the hippocampus detects 

1302
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:59,600
the,
normally that's something unexpected.

1303
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:03,380
And then it disinhibiting your lower 
circuitry and it gets you ready to go.

1304
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:09,010
Now the problem is
this one.

1305
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:15,870
How?
How worried should you be when something

1306
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,300
that you don't expect happens?

1307
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,593
An answer to that is you don't know.
That's a big problem with life because 

1308
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,900
now something went wrong.
Here's the possibilities.

1309
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:27,940
You're not looking at the world,
right?

1310
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:30,340
So it's actually a perceptual problem,
right?

1311
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:32,890
Gray,
for example,

1312
01:10:32,891 --> 01:10:33,724
believes that you just see the world 
just like it is cause he's sort of a 

1313
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:37,330
behaviorist.
It's full of stimuli.

1314
01:10:37,331 --> 01:10:39,220
You don't have to interpret them.
That's wrong.

1315
01:10:39,221 --> 01:10:41,530
You have to interpret them.
So if something goes wrong,

1316
01:10:41,531 --> 01:10:43,480
it might be that you're looking at 
things wrong.

1317
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,240
Your perceptual systems are out.
It's unlikely.

1318
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:49,600
But sometimes that's the case.
But forget that.

1319
01:10:49,601 --> 01:10:50,434
Let's say that you're looking at the 
world correctly and you know your 

1320
01:10:53,111 --> 01:10:57,520
inferences about what went wrong,
what went wrong isn't the consequence of

1321
01:10:57,521 --> 01:10:58,354
you misperceiving it's a consequence of 
some stupid problem with your stupid 

1322
01:11:02,921 --> 01:11:03,754
plan.
The problem is you don't know where the 

1323
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:10,711
error is located and that's why I think 
there's temperament.

1324
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:16,350
Sometimes something unexpected happens,
you should really freak out.

1325
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,813
Other times you should ignore it,
but you can't tell which of those is 

1326
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:21,144
true right away.
So what happens is there's a 

1327
01:11:22,441 --> 01:11:24,720
distribution with a little thing 
happens.

1328
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:28,590
Some people really get upset about it 
and other people hardly care at all.

1329
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,440
And sometimes the people who get really 
upset about it or write,

1330
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,960
and sometimes the people who don't care 
at all are right.

1331
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:36,510
And that's why there's variability in 
neuroticism.

1332
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:38,783
Okay?
Now what you do when you were exploring 

1333
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:42,960
is you start to decompose your plan,
right?

1334
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:43,651
If you're,
if you,

1335
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:44,484
if you can manage it,
if you're not so like grip by anxiety 

1336
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:47,784
that you're paralyzed,
then you go into your plan and you 

1337
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:50,100
think,
well,

1338
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:53,970
am I a complete like loser or is it some
micro thing that's gone wrong?

1339
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:56,750
And then you can start to decompose it 
and reconstruct your plat.

1340
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,320
Okay.
So

1341
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,753
yeah.

1342
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,413
Oh,
there was something else I want to tell 

1343
01:12:06,801 --> 01:12:11,801
you about that.
Yeah.

1344
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:16,610
The other,
the other thing that this little diagram

1345
01:12:16,611 --> 01:12:17,960
helps you understand.
It's like,

1346
01:12:17,961 --> 01:12:20,600
look,
what happens is when you're laying out a

1347
01:12:20,601 --> 01:12:21,980
plan,
a motivated plan,

1348
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,480
and a hole appears in it,

1349
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,640
you have to figure out why you fell in 
the hole.

1350
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:27,474
And then what you have to do is you have
to take that motivated plan that's kind 

1351
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:33,480
of running on automatic and you have to 
remember what it's made out of.

1352
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,040
And so what opens up underneath you 
when,

1353
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:39,150
when you've made a mistake is the 
complexity of the plant.

1354
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:40,343
And then also potentially the complexity
of the world on the off chance that you 

1355
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:44,430
misperceived it,
right?

1356
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:45,750
You're just,
someone might say,

1357
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,600
you're not understanding me properly.
You know,

1358
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:51,300
maybe there's something wrong with you 
that's interfering with the perception.

1359
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:52,463
And then you have to do this massive 
search to try to figure out where there 

1360
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,220
are lies.
Now,

1361
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:57,623
part of the reason I believe that people
stick to their beliefs so hard is 

1362
01:13:00,661 --> 01:13:01,494
because people don't like it when the 
hole appears in one of their big 

1363
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:06,270
abstractions,
right?

1364
01:13:06,271 --> 01:13:07,104
So they've got these high order 
representations of the world that are 

1365
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:11,430
shorthand ways of representing 
something.

1366
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:14,700
They're sort of like axioms of faith.
And if they,

1367
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,160
if a hole appears in one of the axioms 
of faith,

1368
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,970
then all this complexity comes rushing 
up and it's overwhelming.

1369
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:26,060
And so people hate it when you undermine
one of their high order abstractions.

1370
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,420
And so I think I told you this before,
don't do that in relationships,

1371
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,463
right?
It's best not to do it to yourself as 

1372
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,140
well.
Okay,

1373
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:45,940
I'll start with this.
These are Medusa's and what,

1374
01:13:45,941 --> 01:13:49,040
what happens when you see the Medusa?
Okay,

1375
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:49,470
so what,
what,

1376
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:54,230
what might that mean?
You bet it's a,

1377
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:57,390
it's a prey response.
And so that's a sort of,

1378
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:00,030
that's the sort of thing that occurs 
when,

1379
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:01,670
okay,

1380
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:05,840
you're moving towards your goal in your 
frame and the bottom drops out.

1381
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:06,501
It's like,
oh,

1382
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:09,440
what's there?
You don't know.

1383
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,430
So what's the logical first response?
Well,

1384
01:14:12,431 --> 01:14:14,110
if you're high in neuroticism,
it's going to be this,

1385
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:15,243
you know,
freeze.

1386
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:17,740
And then,
and only then,

1387
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,053
if nothing else terrible happens to you,
you'll start to relax a bit and then 

1388
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:24,220
maybe you'll start to investigate the 
structure of your planet.

1389
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,590
Maybe you'll start to investigate the 
structure of the world.

1390
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,350
And then from a constructivist 
perspective,

1391
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:33,130
say once you start to do that,
you gather information from the world,

1392
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:36,370
and then you remake your plan and you 
remake your conception of the world,

1393
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:40,270
and then you could move on.
So you do that under the guidance of the

1394
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:42,730
positive and the negative emotions.
Okay,

1395
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:45,730
that's good.
We'll see you Tuesday.
