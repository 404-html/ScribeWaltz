1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,823
So in the first lecture,
I already told you guys a little bit 

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:05,544
about this,

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,043
about this figure and I mentioned that 
the idea of being swallowed up by a 

4
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,504
beast of some sort and then cast back up
is a very ancient and archetipal idea 

5
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,760
and an architectural idea you might 
think of as an instinctive idea.

6
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,160
This is,
this is an idea of Carl Jung by the way,

7
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:38,994
although it had its precursor,
is another intellectual systems of 

8
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,124
thought.
You might think of an archetype as an 

9
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,960
idea that you can understand without 
being predisposed to it.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,993
Now,
now blank slate models of human 

11
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:56,604
cognition assumed that all of our 
knowledge comes from our sensory 

12
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:02,690
experience.
But first of all,

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,220
there are very many problems with the 
blank slate model.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,740
First of all,
blank slate models are just wrong.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,990
Like they're,
you know,

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,030
they're,
they were useful conceptual structures a

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,993
couple of hundred years ago and there 
were situations where they could be 

18
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:24,990
applied in part to
two systems of thought,

19
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:25,960
like,
um,

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,150
behaviorism.

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,983
But fundamentally we know perfectly well
that the human being is not a blank 

22
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,104
slate.
And we also know that you couldn't be a 

23
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,760
blank slate.
And the reason for that is that there is

24
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,594
so much information so to speak,
surrounding you and making up your 

25
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:45,921
experience that without some a priori 
structures to handle that experience for

26
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,750
you and present it to your consciousness
in a,

27
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,763
in a pre structured manner and there's 
just not a chance that you could ever 

28
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:55,730
make sense out of it.
So plus we also know,

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,913
you know that your biology and your 
neurobiology is very much similar to 

30
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:08,070
that of all life on earth really for 
that matter,

31
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:11,130
but extraordinarily similar to that of 
mammals.

32
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,740
And we know things for example that are 
quite interesting like

33
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,073
the systems that make up the deepest 
part of your brains and partly the part 

34
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:21,780
say that keep track of things like 
dominance.

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,613
Hierarchies are hundreds of millions of 
years old and you share structure and 

36
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:28,794
function of those neurosis neuro 
psychological elements with animals as 

37
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,260
distinct from us crustaceans.
So,

38
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:38,094
for example,
crustaceans use the serotonin system to 

39
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,140
keep track of their dominance 
hierarchies.

40
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,243
And you do the same thing.
And drugs that work on people for 

41
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:47,694
dominance,
hierarchy related disorders like 

42
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:53,360
depression also work on lobsters.
And so,

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,590
so if you,
if you have a lobster,

44
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,863
you know,
that's a friend of yours and it's 

45
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,464
feeling depressed,
then you could recommend that it uses 

46
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,580
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 
that'll make it,

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,650
you know,
happy stretched out,

48
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,520
sort of confident lobster instead of,
uh,

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,560
you know,
bunched up and insecure lobster.

50
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,970
And the reason I'm telling you that it 
is pretty comical.

51
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,263
Um,
but the reason I'm telling you that is 

52
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,730
because it indicates something of 
tremendous importance,

53
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,564
which is that you are one old thing and 
there are elements of your structure 

54
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,280
that are,
you know,

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,430
that are importantly hundreds of 
millions of years old.

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,400
And they structured the way that the 
world appears to you.

57
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,343
And so
an article tipple idea in some sense is 

58
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,204
a,
is an idea that you can understand 

59
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:42,040
because you're a human being.
And you know,

60
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,770
if you think about this even for a few 
moments,

61
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:48,070
you can understand how this might be,
you know,

62
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,490
if someone comes up to you and says,
I'm angry today,

63
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,760
especially if you've been conversing 
with them for some time,

64
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,850
it isn't generally necessary for you to 
ask,

65
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,360
well what do you mean angry?
You might ask,

66
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:02,194
well why are you angry or what happened?
But because the person who's making the 

67
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,910
statement has a nervous system,
like your nervous system,

68
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,013
you can both mutually assume that you've
understood and experienced the emotion 

69
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:19,810
of anger and stow instead of trying to 
describe what that's like.

70
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:22,810
You can just describe the particular 
situations that elicited it.

71
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,093
And you know,
there's lots of evidence for basic 

72
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,660
emotions.
I mean the list of basic emotions varies

73
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:31,870
from thinker to thinker,
although they congregate around a pretty

74
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,704
definable sat.
And part of the reason that they differ 

75
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,370
at all is because,
well,

76
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:40,060
it isn't obvious how you distinguish an 
emotion from a motivational system.

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,430
And it's not even obvious that that,
you know,

78
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,210
the class of emotion is a reasonable 
class.

79
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:48,700
But there are certainly,
um,

80
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,680
subjective phenomena that emerge as a 
consequence of the active activity,

81
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,980
a fundamental brain systems that 
everyone shares.

82
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,950
So,
you know,

83
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,800
people understand what fear means.
People understand what pain means,

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,020
disappointment,
frustration.

85
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,890
People understand what surprise means.
They understand joy.

86
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,020
Um,
they understand,

87
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:11,854
discussed,
I think I hit most of the major ones 

88
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:14,890
there.
And then there's,

89
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,690
you know,
there's other systems that don't look so

90
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,910
emotion like that are maybe more 
motivation,

91
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,260
like,
like hunger and thirst and,

92
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,133
and you know,
uncomfortable hate and uncomfortable 

93
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,860
coldness that people also understand.

94
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,693
And the reason you understand that is 
because you are a certain way and you 

95
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:33,070
are a certain way because for the same 
reason you have two legs,

96
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,310
most of you and two arms and two eyes 
and all of that,

97
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:37,144
you know,
you're,

98
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,750
you don't just spring out of the void as
a completely unstructured organism.

99
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,333
And you know,
it's difficult to say exactly what 

100
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:45,904
elements of human experience and 
behavior and cognition and thought and 

101
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:50,704
all that are inbuilt precisely because 
we're also quite modifiable from a 

102
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,230
cultural perspective,
you know,

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,273
so it's,
it's structured plus the capacity for 

104
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,970
tremendous modification,
but,

105
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,180
and it's hard to exactly say,
well how much is structured and how much

106
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,014
is modification.
And partly the reason it's hard to say 

107
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,960
that is because it depends on how much 
effort you put into the modification,

108
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,190
right?
The more effort,

109
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:16,790
the more modification.
But having said all that,

110
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,743
the fact that we're similar in a priori 
structure is actually one of the 

111
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,970
preconditions that allows us to 
communicate with one another.

112
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,870
So there was a thinker,
a Harvard thinker named Eel Wilson.

113
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,670
Some of you may be familiar with that 
name.

114
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,610
He,
he's a famous biologist and he basically

115
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:33,200
studies ants,
um,

116
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,031
which,
you know,

117
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:37,370
ants answer very complicated and they're
very successful.

118
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,250
There are more,
there are more ants by weight than there

119
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,084
are people on earth.
So even though they're not necessarily 

120
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,570
concerned with overpopulation and 
environmental degradation,

121
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:50,000
there are in fact more ants.
So,

122
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,820
but one of the things he will Wilson 
pointed out was that,

123
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,410
you know,
even if we could talk to ants,

124
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:55,700
we wouldn't have anything to say to 
them.

125
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,313
And the reason for that is because ants 
concerned themselves with things that 

126
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:03,170
human beings have no intrinsic interest 
in.

127
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,290
So their fundamental value structure,
so to speak,

128
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,153
is so different from our value structure
that there wouldn't be anything to talk 

129
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:13,580
about.
Because you talk about with your friends

130
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:17,030
and with your family,
you talk about shared human experiences,

131
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,630
you talk about variation in shared human
experiences,

132
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,220
and you just take for granted that the 
shared element of that exists.

133
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,263
And so you can think of the shared 
element of human experiences 

134
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,500
architectural.
And then you might think,

135
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,334
well,
part of the shared human experiences 

136
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,004
architect will,
because we share an underlying biology 

137
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:40,190
and also to some degree of culture,
but then there's this weird,

138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,460
um,
what no man's land in some sense between

139
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:44,294
the biological system per se,
and the system of subjective experience 

140
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,434
and ideas.
And you might say that the biological 

141
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:56,471
systems or ideational to some degree.
So you can imagine if you get angry,

142
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,883
you think angry thoughts.
And so what that means is the system 

143
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:03,890
that mediates aggression is also capable
of thinking.

144
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:05,900
It thinks in abstractions.
And so there's a,

145
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,033
there's some relationship between the 
biological function which prepares your 

146
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:15,281
perception and your body for action and 
your capacity for abstract thought.

147
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,343
The,
the system that produces anger in some 

148
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,300
sense thinks within you.

149
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,133
It's really more accurate way of 
thinking about it because as you all 

150
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,550
know,
if you've become particular angry during

151
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:27,500
an argument or a discussion with 
someone,

152
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,400
you may say things that you,
whatever you are,

153
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,980
comes to regret very soon after the 
conversation.

154
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,130
And so it's as if in some sense the 
system is speaking within you.

155
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,503
And if you start to think that way,
you can also develop much more 

156
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:42,164
understanding right away of what the 
psychoanalysts were about when they 

157
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,790
started to talk about unconscious 
processes.

158
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,750
So you could say [inaudible] this is a 
realistic way of thinking about it.

159
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:53,950
Is that what the psychoanalysts,
um,

160
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,740
identified as unconscious process is in 
some sense where the thought patterns in

161
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,783
word and image and sometimes in behavior
as well of fundamental biological 

162
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:05,514
systems working within you.
And so even someone like Freud for 

163
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:12,240
example would say approximately look,
you know,

164
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,333
you're a relatively loose collection of 
somewhat integrated biological 

165
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:23,871
subsistence and each of them posits a 
goal that's worth attaining.

166
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,133
But the problem is is that many of those
goals exist in contradiction to one 

167
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,704
another.
And your problem as an organism is to 

168
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,333
unite those diverse biological goals.
And that would be the ID for example 

169
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:37,704
from a [inaudible] perspective to unite 
them into something that's relatively 

170
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:43,920
coherent and non internally 
contradictory.

171
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,993
And then also to express that union in 
the social sphere where hundreds of 

172
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,413
thousands of other creatures,
more or less like you are trying to do 

173
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,070
the same thing.
That's a tricky balancing act.

174
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,690
And so,
but these,

175
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,620
these systems inside of you so to speak,
are informing you constantly.

176
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,933
And some of that they do with direct 
physiological sensation because there 

177
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,344
are generally sensations that are 
associated say with motivational states 

178
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,660
or with emotions.
So,

179
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:14,850
and we kind of think of those as 
feelings,

180
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:16,140
whatever that means.
And then,

181
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,950
um,
there are ideas that are associated with

182
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:23,730
the two and some of those ideas are,
while they're often fantasies.

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,833
So I can give you an example of that.
So it turns out that the interest that 

184
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:29,604
women have in sexual behavior is 
dependent to some degree on their blood 

185
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:34,554
levels of testosterone.
And that varies across the menstrual 

186
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:37,614
cycle.
And so women tend to be most interested 

187
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:42,960
in sexual activity when their fertility 
is at a peak,

188
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,910
which is just after they offer late.
And,

189
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,223
but it doesn't look like testosterone 
produces an increase in sexual behavior 

190
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,890
in a causal sort of manner,
like a drive.

191
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,023
What seems to happen is that the 
testosterone produces an increase in 

192
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,140
sexual fantasy and the fantasy produces 
the impetus for the action.

193
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,020
So that's a very interesting way of 
thinking about it,

194
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:06,180
you know,
because what happens in some senses that

195
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,253
the biological system that's underlying 
sexual desire sets up a world in 

196
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:12,894
imagination that is more likely to 
contain images of sexual gratification 

197
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,440
and the organism so to speak,
follows in its wake.

198
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,710
And you know,
you can see this.

199
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,680
If you pay attention to the structure of
your own imagination,

200
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,110
you can see this sort of thing happening
all the time.

201
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,830
You know,
if,

202
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,663
if you're in an argument with someone 
for example and they humiliate you or 

203
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,160
put you down and that produces feelings 
of resentment.

204
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,570
If you watch your imagination like it 
might be quite conscious and it might be

205
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,720
quite fleeting,
you'll see that fantasies of revenge for

206
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,554
example in different scenarios of 
revenge play out in the landscape of 

207
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,940
your imagination.
You know,

208
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,860
and when you're hungry you're studying 
the way in me,

209
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:51,694
you're concentrating on something and 
you know your blood sugar level falls 

210
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:55,144
enough.
So your hypothalamus notes that maybe 

211
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,050
it's time for a few calories and so it 
starts to pop up,

212
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,210
you know,
an alternative sit,

213
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,630
a sequence of ideas,
you know,

214
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,493
it's like well you know,
maybe it's time for a pizza and you 

215
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:06,754
know,
you think about a pizza and it's got 

216
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,110
some mushrooms on.

217
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,480
It may be if you happen to like 
mushrooms and you know,

218
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,323
sooner or later the fantasy that's 
associated with the hunger becomes 

219
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,720
sufficiently demanding,
sufficiently likely to take up the space

220
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:20,554
inside your subjective experience that 
you'll switch activities from what 

221
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:27,100
you're studying.
Especially if you're not that interested

222
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,910
in it,
you'll,

223
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,743
you'll switch activities so that you 
pursue the new goal that's been put 

224
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:32,800
forth as a,
as a,

225
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,730
as a possibility by the action of one of
these underlying biological systems.

226
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,120
Now one of the things that Freud 
proposed,

227
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,800
and you know,
it's an interesting idea,

228
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:46,801
is that if you interfere with the 
activity of one of these systems,

229
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:52,060
especially the more troublesome systems 
like sexual desire and aggression,

230
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:52,894
and those are troublesome because in 
some sense they're the most social of 

231
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,310
emotions,
right?

232
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,144
Because generally speaking,
at least sometimes you need a partner 

233
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:02,140
for sexual activity.

234
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,140
Although that seems to be less frequent 
than it used to be in the past.

235
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,160
And you know,
and anger is something that also is very

236
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:12,520
socially disruptive.
And so one of Freud's claims was it's,

237
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,513
it's particularly difficult for 
individuals to integrate sexual desire 

238
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,873
and aggression into their personality 
and into the social world because those 

239
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,723
emotions are either socially disruptive 
or require a tremendous degree of 

240
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,560
cooperation from someone else.
And you know,

241
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,403
that was this best sexuality that was 
especially true before there was a 

242
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,374
reliable birth control.
And also when there was a lot more 

243
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:38,284
stigma associated with sex outside of 
marriage and also with child birth 

244
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,510
outside of marriage.
So,

245
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,040
you know,
I don't,

246
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,903
in my clinical practice for example,
now I don't see that many people who 

247
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:48,864
have this sort of sexual repression 
problems that Freud found so common 

248
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:56,890
among his Victorian clients mean in our 
culture it's more likely that people are

249
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,890
having a terrible battle with the demons
of,

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,730
of hunger.

251
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,563
And you know,
they have some sort of eating disorder 

252
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,543
because they're starving themselves and 
then bingeing and starving themselves 

253
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:08,890
and then bingeing or eating some,
you know,

254
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:09,724
God awful combination of pure 
carbohydrates and sugars on a sort of a 

255
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:15,410
random basis.
And so they dysregulate there,

256
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,863
their hypothalamic systems because the 
hypothalamus controls hunger and then 

257
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:21,970
they get into a vicious battle with it 
and you'd like,

258
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:25,780
you don't win against your hypothalamus 
because mostly as far as it's concerned,

259
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,300
you're just an appendage to it.
So,

260
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,134
and it's much more powerful than you are
as you'll find out if you ever have a 

261
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:32,674
scrap with it.
So you know people who have eating 

262
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:35,914
disorders,
they gorge and binge complete against 

263
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:40,870
their will and they don't seem to be 
able to control it.

264
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:43,240
And that's because your hypothalamus 
won't let you starve.

265
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,820
It's not,
it's not into that sort of thing.

266
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,863
So no matter how thin you want to be,
it would rather that you were alive and 

267
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,910
it's more,
it,

268
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,000
it has the capacity to exert more 
control over your behavior than you do.

269
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,043
Generally speaking,
the same thing often happens to people 

270
00:14:58,971 --> 00:14:59,804
who develop addictions and the 
addictions and addictive substance in 

271
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:07,010
some sense harnesses a fundamental 
motivational system.

272
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:07,844
And if you,
if you train that motivational system 

273
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:13,700
over a long enough period of time to,
to seek out,

274
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,730
to successfully seek out the addictive 
substance and you train it and reward it

275
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,510
by using the addictive substance.
When you are able to come across it,

276
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,630
you'll create this little biological 
monster in your brain.

277
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,123
You turn on at the drop of a hat and 
that you have very little control over 

278
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,170
when it's activated.
So,

279
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,793
and you'll see one of the things that 
happens when people go into Rehab for 

280
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:38,660
drug addiction is that pretty easy to 
get them,

281
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,690
um,
through the withdrawal phase,

282
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,810
even if it's something like heroin,
you know,

283
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
and heroin withdrawal.

284
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,120
Although people are always,
you know,

285
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,670
writing movies about how awful it is.
It's public,

286
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,920
it's bad as a bad case of the flu.
And people,

287
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,903
you know,
very seldom died during heroin 

288
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,153
withdrawal.
They die during alcohol withdrawal all 

289
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:58,430
the time,
but you,

290
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,990
so you can get someone through 
withdrawal.

291
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:00,824
But as soon as you put them back in 
their natural environment where their 

292
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:03,314
friends are and the cues that are 
associated with the addiction are still 

293
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,450
in place,
they start taking the drug right away.

294
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:09,530
And yet,
you know,

295
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:11,690
regardless of all their good intentions 
and you know,

296
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,760
you can see that as well in your own 
behavior.

297
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:14,594
Because I mean I doubt if a day passes 
where you don't do something that you 

298
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:18,614
swore you wouldn't do,
you know when you do it and then you 

299
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:21,404
think,
hmm,

300
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,240
why did I do that?
It's like,

301
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:24,920
well what do you mean?

302
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,920
I precisely and that's the fundamental 
psychoanalytic question cause I,

303
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,130
you know,
even the way the word looks,

304
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:35,780
it's one letter,
you know,

305
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:39,860
it's like a one I,
it's like well is there an eye there?

306
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,173
Well not really.
You know what there is generally 

307
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:46,154
speaking is a loose aggregation of 
systems that are more or less going in 

308
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:49,694
the same direction.
That's diluted into thinking that 

309
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,900
there's a unity.
And that's,

310
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,930
that's a,
that's a prime psychoanalytic theory.

311
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,680
And the part of the reason that people 
suffer is because those systems,

312
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:03,530
first of all,
don't necessarily have your wellbeing in

313
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:04,281
mind.
You know,

314
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:05,150
your,
your,

315
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,710
your pleasure,
your freedom from anxiety,

316
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:11,090
your freedom from pain,
like the system that mediates individual

317
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:12,860
rep production,
the sexual system.

318
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,490
Like it doesn't really care about you so
to speak.

319
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,740
It cares about whether or not you 
reproduce.

320
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,993
And you know,
one of the things you might think about 

321
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:23,900
if you think,
why is there so much conflict in human,

322
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:25,010
intimate relationships?

323
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,843
It's because the demands of sexual 
reproduction and the demands of 

324
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,960
individual happiness are not the same 
thing.

325
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,480
And you know,
you have to,

326
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,820
you have to try to integrate both of 
them,

327
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,654
but there's no reason that you would 
necessarily find the partner who would 

328
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:40,004
make your life most fulfilling.
Also the one that you're sexually 

329
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:44,570
attracted to.
You know,

330
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,240
you'd hope that would be the case.
But like good luck with that.

331
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:50,130
You'll end up with some jerky can't 
because you know,

332
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,830
you get so hot you can't stand it when 
you were anywhere near them.

333
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,881
So,
and you know,

334
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:54,714
you might think,
well wouldn't it be nice if you could 

335
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,600
bring that under voluntary control?
It's like,

336
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:00,450
well good luck with that.
So you know,

337
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:01,284
so these are the sorts of things that 
you need to think about when you're 

338
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:04,764
thinking about what the psychoanalytic 
thinkers we're thinking about as the 

339
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,480
unconscious.

340
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,720
In some sense,
the unconscious is the,

341
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,093
the ideational and motivational 
activities of all these underlying 

342
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,390
biological subsystems that make up your 
makeup,

343
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,220
your being that make up the substrata of
your psyche.

344
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,143
You know,
like you tend to think of your yourself 

345
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,850
as I,
so that would be the Friday and ego,

346
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,703
you know,
as the part of you that subjectively 

347
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:36,600
experiences and maybe also the part of 
you that has continuity of memory across

348
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:37,434
time and for one reason or another,
we tend to experience that as something 

349
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:44,790
of a unity.
It's not obvious why exactly.

350
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,073
I think part of it is that we can 
separate ourselves out as a unit from 

351
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:51,750
the rest of the world,
including other people,

352
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,584
you know,
and we're aware of our boundaries 

353
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,743
physically and also temporarily.
But I also think it's because for one 

354
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:58,644
reason or another,
we only seem to be able to do one thing 

355
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:02,094
at a time.

356
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,323
And so the limitation,
which is like a motor output limitation 

357
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,730
seems also to to imply to us that 
there's only one thing there.

358
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,870
But you know,
it's not that it's not that unreasonable

359
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:16,704
to think about ourselves as something 
more like an anthill than as something 

360
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,470
that's,
you know,

361
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,640
a completely unitary structure.
Because obviously our physical structure

362
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,160
is far from homogenous,
right?

363
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:26,994
You're made up of all sorts of different
sub parts and they're qualitatively 

364
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:32,730
different.
So anyways,

365
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:36,960
what I want to talk to you about today 
as far as as far as I can manage it,

366
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:39,600
is to,
to give you some insight,

367
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:40,434
or at least the insights I've been able 
to develop about how it is that your 

368
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,214
physiology speaks to your mind.
And I think the way to conceptualize 

369
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:49,344
that I,
I'm trying to give you some sense of 

370
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,560
what symbols are.
Now.

371
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,990
What Freud thought about symbols was 
that,

372
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,943
well let's say that you're in a society 
that was very sexually repressive and 

373
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:00,054
you were still stuck with the problem of
a fairly powerful sex drive and your 

374
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:04,134
culture had taught you that,
that needed to be suppressed and 

375
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:07,800
repressed and controlled.

376
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,933
And Freud's idea was that,
well that thing like the monster in the 

377
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,264
basement doesn't really like to be 
pushed around and controlled and it's 

378
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:15,744
going to manifest its desires and its 
and its once and it's view of the world 

379
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,820
in sub subversive form.
So,

380
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:27,240
and for Freud this subversive forums 
would be different sorts of symbols.

381
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:29,850
So if you weren't,
um,

382
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,180
satisfying the system that was 
underlying sexual interest,

383
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,940
then it would start to insert itself in 
random ways into your behavior.

384
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,533
Perhaps when you're interacting with 
someone of the opposite sex or maybe 

385
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:49,210
into your dreams and your fantasies.
And it would do that in a disguised form

386
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:50,044
because while,
because the part of you that was the 

387
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:56,650
integrated part,
the ego part in some sense wasn't really

388
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:57,484
willing to communicate with it.
So it had to sort of sneak its message 

389
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,900
up and through.
Well,

390
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,453
the union take on that with site 
slightly different human was perfectly 

391
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,893
willing to assume that Freud knew what 
he was talking about in some some 

392
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,883
domains,
especially those that were associated 

393
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:14,950
with psychopathology.

394
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,210
But for you in that realm of symbols 
with something different and for young,

395
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,690
the realm of symbols was where knowledge
had its origin.

396
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,883
And so you can imagine that there are 
things that you know absolutely nothing 

397
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:27,664
about.
And of course you don't know what those 

398
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:30,940
things are because you don't know 
anything about them.

399
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:34,650
But there's lots of them around.
And then you might imagine,

400
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,523
and there's also lots of things that 
exist that the people as a whole don't 

401
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,184
know anything about,
not just you there beyond our 

402
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:43,240
comprehension as a species.
For you,

403
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,163
the assemble was a mediator between the 
absolute unknown and the relatively 

404
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:52,270
known.
And so as the human imagination expanded

405
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:54,610
out and mastered more and more 
territory,

406
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:55,444
there was like a periphery around the 
island of knowledge and that periphery 

407
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,890
was made up of symbolic representations 
that were,

408
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,170
that were pre articulate knowledge.

409
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,910
So they were like things you might act 
out,

410
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,950
here's,
here's the way to think about that.

411
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:12,010
So you know,
you might watch a child who's engaged in

412
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,290
pretend play.
Okay.

413
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,400
And often children will pretend to be a 
mother or a father for obvious reasons,

414
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,234
you know?
And what they do is they observe their 

415
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:23,860
mother or their father and then they act
them out.

416
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:27,850
But it's very interesting form of acting
out because we think of it as imitation,

417
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,310
oh look,
you know she's imitating her mother,

418
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,340
but imitation means you move your arm 
like this and I moved my arm like this.

419
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:37,750
And that is not what children do when 
they're playing.

420
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,123
What they do instead is a very complex 
form of generalizations and they've 

421
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:47,161
watched the mother and they extract out 
something like the pattern of the mother

422
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,333
and they don't really understand what 
that pattern is because they don't have 

423
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:55,471
the articulation and the cognitive 
capacity to generate a fully articulated

424
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:57,340
and verbalized model of the mother.

425
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,180
But they acted out in behavior.
And so it's a,

426
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,063
in a sense,
they're incorporating the spirit of the 

427
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:05,290
mother.
That's one way of thinking about it.

428
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,273
Into their behavior.
And then they can act out things they 

429
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:08,614
don't understand,
or at least they don't understand in 

430
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:13,390
terms of being able to articulate them.
And you know,

431
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,440
lots of things,
you know,

432
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:17,620
you can't articulate,
you can't articulate how to walk.

433
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,873
You can't articulate how to ride a bike.
You can't articulate anything complex 

434
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,790
like how to engage in a successful 
relationship.

435
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,270
A lot of that knowledge is embodied,
assuming you have it at all.

436
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,700
So it's,
it's dramatic action.

437
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,973
And you can also think about the symbol 
as a mediator between dramatic action 

438
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,980
and full cognition.
So for example,

439
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,983
um,
imagine a child is playing at being a 

440
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:46,070
mother and then you stopped them and you
say,

441
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,480
well,
what are you doing?

442
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,700
And the child might say,
well,

443
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:49,220
I'm,
you know,

444
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,990
we're playing house.
I'm pretending to be mom.

445
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:51,920
And then you might say,
well,

446
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:52,843
how do you go about doing that?
And then they're going to try to 

447
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:57,140
articulate what they're doing,
you know?

448
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:57,974
And while they're doing that,
they're going to be using their 

449
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:02,690
imagination and representing the things 
that they're trying to understand.

450
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,100
And then you can see how the symbol,
which would be the visual representation

451
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:07,934
of the mother's action,
like a little movie that you might run 

452
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:10,604
in your head.
You can see how it might lay itself on 

453
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:17,150
top of the dramatic action as a 
precursor to articulation.

454
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,703
And so that's,
that's a good way of thinking about it 

455
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:25,121
is that the symbol is a precursor to 
articulation and that you use symbols of

456
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:26,774
one form or another whenever you use 
imaginative representation as a 

457
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,900
precursor to understand.

458
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,940
And so that happens for example,
when you're fantasizing about something.

459
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,540
So now for the psychoanalysts,
particularly psychoanalysts like Yom,

460
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,810
the imagination was something that had a
spontaneous operation.

461
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:47,810
It would just go along on its own and do
things.

462
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:50,480
And of course you also experienced that 
if you,

463
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,130
first of all,
when you dream,

464
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,400
obviously because you're not in control 
of your dreams,

465
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,460
things in control of them and they 
happen,

466
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,270
but it's not you or it's not the you 
that you normally think of yourself as.

467
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,500
And then if you're daydreaming that 
something analogous happens,

468
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:07,334
you know,
you find that maybe you're trying to 

469
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:13,451
concentrate on something and something 
that's of interest to you.

470
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:14,324
For one reason or another,
it starts to creep into the theater of 

471
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:21,170
your imagination and lay out different 
scenarios of one form or another.

472
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,363
And it's sort of like the natural 
language of the psyche because it isn't 

473
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:29,030
obvious that the natural language of the
psyche is in fact language,

474
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,110
right?

475
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,943
Because we don't really know how long 
human beings have been using formal 

476
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:34,990
language.
You know,

477
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,810
they estimates 150,000 years.
That's one estimate.

478
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,480
I doubt if it's more than 2 million 
years,

479
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,320
2 million years seems to be about how 
long we've been using fire.

480
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,890
So it's somewhere between 2 million and 
150,000 years.

481
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:52,790
But compared to the entire history of 
our cognitive development,

482
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,410
which you can stretch back well to the 
beginning of life itself if you want,

483
00:25:57,411 --> 00:26:00,560
or at least to the point where things 
have nervous systems,

484
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:01,394
that's more like 500 million years.
And so the psyche was operating without 

485
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:06,494
language for a much longer period of 
time that was operating with language 

486
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,453
and it was doing something to organize 
its conceptions of the world that were 

487
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,750
pre linguistic.
So what we're going to talk about today,

488
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:18,584
or what we're already talking about is 
what the structure of those pre 

489
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:23,960
linguistic cognitive forms might be.

490
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,793
And I'm,
I'm offering that to you partly as an 

491
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:28,694
element of the integrating theory that I
told you I would try to deliver in the 

492
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:36,920
first lecture.
And also as a means of giving you a,

493
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,903
a Schema or a language to start to 
understand what symbolic representation 

494
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:45,600
means from a psychoanalytic perspective 
and all.

495
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,310
I hope that'll be very useful.
I mean,

496
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:48,144
it's,
it's been extraordinarily useful for me 

497
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:50,784
because it offers a key to understanding
symbolic literature and symbolic modes 

498
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,630
of cognition.
So for example,

499
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:00,750
religious systems are symbolic modes of 
cognition,

500
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:03,000
part excellence.
That's what they are.

501
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,900
And they're not objects,
they're not primitive theories about the

502
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:07,734
nature of the objective world.
That's a foolish way of looking at 

503
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:11,664
religious systems.
And it sets up an artificial dichotomy 

504
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:15,810
between religious belief in scientific 
belief.

505
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,470
And all that does is confuse people.
So religion,

506
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,423
religious belief is primarily about 
morality and morality is about how to 

507
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:24,384
act and religious symbolism is about how
to construe the world as a forum to act 

508
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,044
Ian.

509
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,543
And that's what you,
you have to solve that problem because 

510
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,063
the big pro biggest problem you have in 
your life and the biggest problem you 

511
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:39,420
always will have is how the hell should 
yakked.

512
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,330
And you know that actually might be the 
fundamental question of existence to,

513
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,830
to the degree that action is the primary
reality.

514
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,870
Now you know,
if you're a materialist,

515
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:49,704
you don't really think that way because 
you think of the objective world 

516
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,460
stripped of its subjective importance as
the ground of reality,

517
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,623
but it's not the ground of reality.
The ground of reality is whether or not 

518
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:03,780
you survive and reproduce,
at least from a Darwinian perspective.

519
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,770
And that means that the most important 
element of reality is how you act.

520
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,330
That determines whether or not you're 
going to be selected,

521
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:13,850
so to speak,
for reproduction.

522
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,783
People are like evaluating each other.
On the basis of their fitness for 

523
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:20,100
reproduction nonstop.

524
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,280
It's like almost all of social congress 
has to do with that.

525
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,100
You know,
men organize themselves into very strict

526
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:26,934
dominance hierarchies by competing with 
one another and women peel the men off 

527
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:31,224
the tall.
And almost everything that you're doing 

528
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:37,230
in your day to day interactions with 
other human beings is an element of that

529
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:41,310
fundamental process.
So that's all action oriented.

530
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,880
So,
so it's very much important to get these

531
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:45,714
things right.
So I'm going to tell you how I piece 

532
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:48,804
this together to some degree.
And so we're going to start with a 

533
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,890
hypothesis.
We'll take a look at this.

534
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,143
There we go.
So one of the things you might ask is 

535
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,770
what do our immediate mammalian 
relatives,

536
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,113
how do they conceptualize the world?
And so we're going to assume that those 

537
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:11,370
are higher order primates because you 
know,

538
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,413
the evidence seems to suggest that we're
relatively genetically similar to 

539
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:18,900
chimpanzees in particular and also to 
Bonobos,

540
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:20,820
which are more or less a fordham of 
chimpanzee.

541
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,653
Although their behavior differs.
And it looks like we diverged from the 

542
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:29,820
precursor to chimpanzees,
Bonobos and human beings about 7 million

543
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:32,280
years ago.
So we didn't come from chimps,

544
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,203
chimps,
Bonobos and us came from something that 

545
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:38,550
was the precursor to all three.
And we know,

546
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,073
you can calculate how similar you are 
from a genetic perspective to another 

547
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:44,794
organism by measuring,
if you split your DNA into its it into 

548
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:48,584
its halves,
and then you mix those Dna halves with 

549
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:53,080
the DNA,
how's of another animal,

550
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,033
they'll join up.
And the more related you are to that 

551
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:57,634
animal,
the more energy it takes to pry them 

552
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,410
apart once they've joined up because 
they're a tighter match.

553
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:03,930
And so it turns out that we're,
you know,

554
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,970
extraordinarily tightly matched with 
chimpanzees.

555
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,470
So,
um,

556
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,740
so when you know,
you're wondering why you're so erratic,

557
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,750
it's an uncontrollable and 
unpredictable.

558
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:14,584
It's because you're basically a 
chimpanzee that's been driven insane by 

559
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:18,490
self awareness.

560
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,481
So,
you know,

561
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:21,610
what the hell do you expect from 
something like that?

562
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,440
You know,
it's amazing that we can even all sit in

563
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:26,590
this room together.
So anyways,

564
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,980
you know,
you might ask,

565
00:30:27,981 --> 00:30:32,110
well what it creatures like that no,
and one of the,

566
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,920
one of the things that we've been able 
to determine our,

567
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,850
some of the precursors or associates of 
of cortical development of rain size and

568
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,983
there's various things that seem to be 
tightly associated with the development 

569
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:45,184
of larger brains,
but one of them in primates in 

570
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:51,340
particular is size of group.
So the bigger your group,

571
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:52,174
the more you have to keep track of the 
more social information you'll have to 

572
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:55,714
keep track of it.
And if that's driving brain development 

573
00:30:58,211 --> 00:30:59,044
at least in part because it's certainly 
not the whole story if it's driving 

574
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:02,674
behavior in part,
one of the things that that implies is 

575
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:05,464
that one of the most important sources 
of information that you have to contend 

576
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:13,000
with if you're a social pride,
nate is the social structure.

577
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,373
And so what you can infer from that is 
that your brain is primarily set up to 

578
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,043
assess social information.
Now you can take that a little bit 

579
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:24,424
farther and then you might think,
well that means that may imply that the 

580
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:29,950
primary categories that you use 
naturally.

581
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,963
So to speak,
to understand the world are in fact 

582
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,710
social categories.
And then you could think,

583
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:36,700
well,
you know,

584
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,563
we've,
we've elaborated our cognitive systems 

585
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:43,330
up into the abstract far farther than 
our primate relatives have.

586
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,990
But because evolution is a conservative 
process,

587
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,020
new structures have their roots in old 
structures,

588
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:50,854
right?
It's a necessary part of evolution 

589
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:57,091
because once an organism walks down the 
certain psychophysiological road,

590
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:59,980
in some sense it's destined by that 
road,

591
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:04,210
which is why you have the same basic 
bodily platform as virtually,

592
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,770
well,
not only mammals,

593
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,570
vertebrates in general,
you know,

594
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,040
four legs,
two eyes.

595
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,010
It's a very,
very standard form.

596
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,660
So,
you know,

597
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,400
once it's developed,
that's it.

598
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,000
That's the platform upon which further 
variation takes place.

599
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,640
Now you might ask,
well,

600
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,440
first of all,
think,

601
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,160
think of your own situation in 
relationship to the primates situation.

602
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,353
How much of your time during the day are
you spending interacting with other 

603
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:32,824
people in one form or another?
Now let's assume that that also means 

604
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,470
books,
movies,

605
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,090
all the artificial representations of 
people.

606
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:44,120
We're going to consider those 
representations of people as well.

607
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,040
And so then you might think,
well,

608
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,053
not when you're asleep except you're 
dreaming and you're almost inevitably 

609
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,220
dreaming of people.
But when you're away,

610
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,260
well,
what is it said?

611
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:59,290
80% is 90% I mean it depends to some 
degree on how extroverted you are.

612
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,003
Like if you're sufficiently extroverted,
you're going to try to drive it up to a 

613
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,870
hundred percent you know?
And if you're really introverted,

614
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:06,591
maybe you,
you know,

615
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:07,424
you'd go hide in the closet now and then
because he can't stand being around 

616
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:09,800
people.

617
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,633
But nonetheless,
most of your environment is a social 

618
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:15,780
environment,
you know,

619
00:33:15,781 --> 00:33:19,550
and like we like to think of the 
environment has a forest or a landscape,

620
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:20,384
something like that.
But the environment is actually the 

621
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:25,490
niche in which you live and the human 
niche is highly social.

622
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,930
And then you add to that the fact that 
we're pair bonding creatures and we have

623
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:30,764
very long lasting relationships and our 
familial relationships are 

624
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:34,574
extraordinarily long lasting as well.
Plus our period of dependency is 

625
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,830
extraordinarily long and,
and,

626
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,290
and,
and serious.

627
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,910
So,
you know,

628
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:48,530
we're for all day for the all the ideas,
mostly western ideas about,

629
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:49,364
you know,
radical individualism were unbelievably 

630
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,340
social creatures and we can't really 
survive outside of a social context.

631
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,683
And what that implies is that the 
fundamental categories of our 

632
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,404
perception,
our likely social and that we've taken 

633
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:07,400
those fundamental categories and applied
them to other things.

634
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,503
So then imagine here's some of the 
things that we know that that higher 

635
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:15,860
order primates can track from,
they can track dominance.

636
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,760
So you know,
primates live in hierarchies,

637
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:22,750
there's a female hierarchy and a male 
hierarchy in it,

638
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:23,584
you know,
and the nature of those hierarchies 

639
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:25,214
depends on the pricing.
But there are hierarchies and the 

640
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:28,544
hierarchies are extraordinarily 
important because if you're at the 

641
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:33,680
bottom of a hierarchy and you're a 
social primate,

642
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,440
like you're a whipping boy,
you're going to get kicked around,

643
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,270
your children are going to get kicked 
around.

644
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,210
If an f a disease comes whipping through
your,

645
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,283
your tribe or your truth,
then if you're at the bottom of the 

646
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:46,094
hierarchy,
you're the one that's going to die 

647
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:50,510
because you're already stressed and full
of parasites and poorly nourished.

648
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:53,690
And you don't have a good place to live 
and so you're going to get wiped off the

649
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,200
map.

650
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,020
And even if you don't get killed by some
disease,

651
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:59,660
if we track your life expectancy across 
time,

652
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,400
if you're at the bottom of the 
hierarchy,

653
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:04,820
you're going to die way earlier and 
you're going to be old,

654
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:05,654
much younger than the people or the 
creatures that are at the top because 

655
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:09,524
the ones at the top get the best of 
everything and the ones at the bottom 

656
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:15,170
don't.
And so it turns out that your,

657
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,090
your place of,
of,

658
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,013
of position in the dominants heart,
he's an unbelievably important 

659
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,300
determinant of your probability of 
reproductions,

660
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,143
especially if you're male.
Most females reproduce regardless of 

661
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:32,630
where they are in the dominant search.
But that isn't the case with males.

662
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:33,464
What happens in males as he gets 
something more like a prieto 

663
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:35,834
distribution where there's a few males 
at the top are unbelievably successful 

664
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,140
and then half the males at the bottom 
who are not successful at all.

665
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,180
And so that's one of the,
you know,

666
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,014
that's one of the chronic stressors that
civilized societies have to deal with 

667
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,930
because
well,

668
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,950
for obvious reasons,
so,

669
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,213
so it turns out that primates are very,
very sensitive to dominance hierarchy 

670
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,593
structure and they know who's at their 
level and they know who's below their 

671
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:06,990
level and they know who's above.
And they track that across time and they

672
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:11,220
track it across families and sometimes 
they track it across generations because

673
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:13,680
it can last generations,
dozen human beings,

674
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:14,514
it doesn't chimpanzees.
So our brains are pre wired for 

675
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:18,630
dominance,
hierarchy,

676
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,110
comprehension,
and okay,

677
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:24,360
so that's one domain,
the dominance hierarchy.

678
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:26,670
Now you can think about that in a 
variety of different ways.

679
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:29,880
You can think about that as the social 
organization.

680
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,480
You can think about that as the nature 
of the tribe.

681
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,200
You can think about that as the state or
the nation or the people.

682
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,810
All of those things are dominance,
hierarchy variants.

683
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:40,644
In some sense.
You can think about that as the father 

684
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,443
and or you could even think about that 
as God the father with God being the 

685
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:50,790
thing that's at the top of the 
hierarchy.

686
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,624
In some sense,
and I think part of what religious 

687
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:54,094
idiation actually does is take the idea 
of the thing that's at the top of the 

688
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:59,184
hierarchy,
whatever that is and make it into a day 

689
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,900
Auntie.
Now the rate,

690
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,203
we know that people are much more likely
to imitate those who are close to the 

691
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:10,074
top of the hierarchy because they want 
to pull in the behaviors and the 

692
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:13,074
attitudes and the ideas that made those 
people successful than you might think 

693
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:17,094
with regards to human beings.
That because we're extraordinarily 

694
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:21,900
intelligent and very much able to 
abstract that,

695
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:22,734
what we can do is we can look across 
dominance hierarchies because there are 

696
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:29,790
multiple sorts of dominance hierarchies 
among human beings and we can say,

697
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:30,624
okay,
well this person's at the top here and 

698
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:33,564
then this person's at the top here and 
this person's at the top here and all 

699
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,953
those talk people share things in common
that make them the top and then we can 

700
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:47,190
abstract out what the top means and we 
can say that's the top thing.

701
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,713
And I think that's partly what people 
are doing in the multigenerational 

702
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:52,434
process that they use to extract out 
religiously significant figures of 

703
00:37:57,001 --> 00:38:00,870
adulation and admiration.
So they're like the best of all possible

704
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:03,420
people across all possible 
circumstances.

705
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,700
Okay.
But we'll leave that aside for a moment.

706
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,743
It looks like the fundamental symbolic 
structures that people use to represent 

707
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,230
the structure of the dominance hierarchy
are paternal.

708
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,500
So the dominance hierarchy is like the 
great father.

709
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,753
And I think part of the reason for that 
is that among human beings and among 

710
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:23,130
chimpanzees,
although it's not so true with Barnabas,

711
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,160
the male dominance hierarchy is the 
dominant hierarchy.

712
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,653
And you know,
this is a claim even that feminists 

713
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:29,281
make,
right?

714
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:30,114
Because the feminists say that well,
that our culture is basically a 

715
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:37,540
patriarchal and you know,
they're not very happy about that.

716
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,400
But that's a whole different issue.
Okay,

717
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:44,620
so one idea.

718
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,383
Okay.

719
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,260
Now the other thing you can think about 
here,

720
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:55,094
isn't it?

721
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,643
Your brain has got to be organized so 
that it's capable of understanding the 

722
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:05,160
things that are most constant about the 
environment,

723
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,870
right?
And you might think,

724
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:07,704
well,
the things that are the most constant 

725
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:11,130
are the most real.
That's a way of defining real.

726
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,400
It lasts a long time and it's evident 
everywhere.

727
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,080
Okay.
So then you might think,

728
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:18,420
well,
what are the most real things that human

729
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:20,310
beings have to deal with?
You know,

730
00:39:20,311 --> 00:39:21,100
and,
and one,

731
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,933
one answer to that as well.
There are certain kinds of objective 

732
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:27,090
realities that are the most real.
So you might say,

733
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:27,924
well,
things like trees are extraordinarily 

734
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:30,354
real.
But one of the things I'd like to point 

735
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:35,430
out to you is that despite the fact that
trees are quite real,

736
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,503
they're not as real as dominance 
hierarchies because dominance 

737
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:39,774
hierarchies were around for a couple of 
a hundred million years before there 

738
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,660
were trees.

739
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,063
And so what,
there have been dominant turkeys around 

740
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:50,190
for 400 million years long before there 
were vertebrates have are tight.

741
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,443
And so the dominance hierarchy is an 
extraordinarily constant feature of 

742
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:55,164
life.
And part of the reason that we're wired 

743
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:59,120
up to be able to detect variations in 
dominance,

744
00:39:59,121 --> 00:39:59,954
hierarchy status is because that,
that the fact of that structure is 

745
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:06,480
constant across all times.
In all places.

746
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,003
And so it's built right into our nervous
systems and the fact that we share the 

747
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:12,054
ability to assess our dominance 
hierarchy position with crustaceans and 

748
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:17,874
that this and which have a very simple 
nervous system and the fact that the 

749
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:24,690
same pharmacological substances work on 
crustaceans that work on us for the same

750
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:26,760
reasons,
at least with regards to dominance,

751
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:27,594
archi indicates that the dominants 
hierarchy counter that you have 

752
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,000
functioning at the very base of your 
brain,

753
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:33,834
so to speak,
is an unbelievably potent mechanism and 

754
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:38,010
you're using it all the time.

755
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,700
One example is,
you know when you might ask yourself why

756
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:46,230
people are so obsessed with fashion and 
why fashions have to change every year.

757
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,363
And part of the reason for that is that 
by attending to fashion and keeping up 

758
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:51,564
or being even on the event and guard,
you show that you're ahead of the curve 

759
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,480
and the curve is always changing,
right?

760
00:40:57,481 --> 00:41:01,350
It's like a technological curve.
You have to stay ahead of of the,

761
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,290
it isn't so much that you mastered the 
technology,

762
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,124
it's that you stay ahead of the 
technology and master the new and that 

763
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:11,370
indicates that your conscious and alive 
and aware and capable of competing.

764
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:13,440
And that's one of the things that makes 
you more attractive,

765
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,573
at least in principle as a mate or at 
least more competitive with the other 

766
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:22,380
creatures with whom you're competing for
the attention of potential mates.

767
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,203
So that's just another indication of 
exactly how possessed you are by the 

768
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:29,970
operation of these deep seated 
biological systems.

769
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,020
And we know,
for example,

770
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:31,854
that there's very,
very little difference between a severe 

771
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:38,720
clinical depression and a very severe 
dominance defeat.

772
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,720
It's the same biological process.
Fundamentally,

773
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:42,554
what happens often with people who are 
clinically depressed is that there's 

774
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,643
self assessed dominance is much lower 
than their actual competence and it's 

775
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:52,064
actually the gap between their 
competence and their and their self 

776
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,640
worth assessment that constitutes the 
pathology.

777
00:41:59,210 --> 00:41:59,820
So,
you know,

778
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,210
so you have someone,
when I assess people for depression,

779
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,290
I say well look,
you know,

780
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,710
do you have a job,
a good job?

781
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,270
You know,
do you have,

782
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,370
you have a family,
do you have an intimate partner?

783
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:12,500
Do you have interests in various things 
in your life,

784
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:13,820
you know,
outside of your work.

785
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,080
Um,
you know,

786
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:16,850
do you have the sort of education that 
you want?

787
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:19,610
How's your physical health?
Do you have a drug and alcohol problem?

788
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,620
And if the answer to all those is the 
proper answer and they still feel really

789
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:25,454
terrible than you might think,
oh well that person suffering from 

790
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:28,214
clinical depression because they're self
assessed dominant status is not in 

791
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,830
keeping with their actual social status.
You know,

792
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:34,664
as opposed to people who come in and you
ask them the same questions and it's 

793
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:40,100
like their families completely insane.
They're alienated from them.

794
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,143
You know,
they had a brain injury when they were 

795
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:44,930
four because their father hit them 
against the wall.

796
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,230
They've got no education at all.
They've got an alcohol problem.

797
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,243
You know,
they'd been unemployed for seven years 

798
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,120
and they have a personality disorder.
It's like,

799
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,290
well,
they feel terrible,

800
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:57,920
but they're not depressed.
They just have terrible lives,

801
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,503
you know?
And it's not like you're not going to 

802
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:01,094
suffer if you have a terrible life.
But if I give someone like that an 

803
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:06,530
antidepressant or suggest that they take
one,

804
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,693
you know,
it might stop them from cutting the 

805
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:09,434
risks,
but the probability that it's really 

806
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:11,174
going to improve their situation is 
relatively low because like what the 

807
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:16,280
hell are you going to do with that?
It's just too overwhelming a problem.

808
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:18,650
Do you even address?
All right,

809
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:19,484
so it looks like the dominance hierarchy
as such seems to be represented by 

810
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:24,464
masculine symbols.
And it's something to keep in mind when 

811
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:27,194
you watch movies because symbols are 
spoken sessions especially that are 

812
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:32,690
associated with the father.
Like the king for example,

813
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,973
are,
are representations of the dominant 

814
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:38,030
structure.
So,

815
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,270
so that's one fundamental symbol.
Um,

816
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,780
let's look at another here.

817
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,290
All right,
so this is a rather complicated shift in

818
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,850
argumentation.
So,

819
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,720
so perhaps you can,
except for a minute,

820
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,500
the association between the dominance 
hierarchy and culture.

821
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,650
You see how those are the same thing?
Or at least that there are similar,

822
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,530
our cultures actually made up of a 
variety of overlapping,

823
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:13,250
dominant.
Sorry.

824
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,083
He's right.
Because different professions and 

825
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:16,244
different specialties have their own 
dominance hierarchies in their sort of 

826
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:21,350
integrated into a metta higher.
But so,

827
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,243
but regardless,
the culture is a dormant entire 

828
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:26,750
hierarchy,
a complex dominance,

829
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,490
Herc.
And so then you might ask yourself,

830
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,920
well,
what exactly makes up the culture?

831
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,143
What is it that we're talking about when
we're talking about the culture and the 

832
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:37,770
dominance hierarchy?
And so that,

833
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:38,604
that,
that leads into questions like what 

834
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:43,260
exactly constitutes a law,
you know,

835
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:45,330
so we have laws and you might think,
well,

836
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,620
what does it mean that there's a law?
Well,

837
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:51,240
we can,
we can look at the obvious things.

838
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,610
There's a rule of some sort that's being
written down.

839
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,790
That's one.
There's a rule of it's been written down

840
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:01,020
that if you transgress against,
you'll be tracked down and punished.

841
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,200
That's another example of a law.
Another example is while it's a custom,

842
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,780
right,
most of the things that we have is laws,

843
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,290
our customs that people have adopted,
at least in principle,

844
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:14,124
to regulate our interactions so that the
probability of mutual cooperation is 

845
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:20,310
high and the probability of mutual 
aggression is low.

846
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,690
And so you might say,
well,

847
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:24,330
why do we all go forward on a green 
light?

848
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,540
That's arbitrary.
Why is that a law?

849
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,583
And the answer is well,
because everybody decided that that 

850
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:33,000
would be a law and then they decided 
they would act it out.

851
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,343
So it's a costume and you can see why 
it's an extraordinarily useful custom 

852
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:39,510
because if we didn't have it,
then we'd be crashing into each other at

853
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:42,240
every intersection and none of our 
vehicles would be good for anything.

854
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:43,643
So that's another example of a law.
Some of you think about a law as a set 

855
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:48,354
of customers,
then you start to see the law as as the 

856
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:54,360
codafide version of a behavioral 
contract,

857
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,673
right?
There's ways that we have all agreed to 

858
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:57,834
act,
or even if we have a degree act that 

859
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:00,324
way,
we've agreed that there should be a 

860
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:04,050
structure that describes how you should 
act.

861
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,760
And that's what the culture is.
You know,

862
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:08,670
unless you're a nihilist or an anarchist
or a criminal or,

863
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:09,743
or a terrorist or something like that,
you basically accept the fact that this 

864
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:15,990
structure has to exist and then you try 
to position yourself within it.

865
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,240
Okay.
So then you can think,

866
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:19,074
well,
the culture and the dominance hierarchy 

867
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,800
is,
is two things at the same time,

868
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:26,070
or maybe even three things.
One is it's the way you act.

869
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,640
So when you say that you're a citizen of
a given country,

870
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,103
what that essentially means is that you 
imitate the body of laws that that 

871
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:35,610
country has erected.

872
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,180
You're a behavioral manifestation of 
those rules,

873
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,163
roughly speaking or reverse.
You could say the law is a codafide 

874
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:46,740
representation of the way everybody in 
the culture is behaving.

875
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,230
There's like a dyadic interaction,
right?

876
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,453
And so the law and the culture is 
actually a pattern of behaviors and 

877
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:57,060
expectations around those behaviors that
everyone shares.

878
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,523
And you could also say it's the 
cumulative knowledge that the culture 

879
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:02,694
shares.
So the culture as a whole has a body of 

880
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:05,364
knowledge,
some of which is our objective and some 

881
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:07,674
of which is moral and behavioral.
And you as a fragment of that also have 

882
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,920
have that at least in fragmentary form,
right?

883
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:16,500
You're a partial representation of the 
entire culture.

884
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,830
That would be something similar to 
Freud's idea of the Super Ego,

885
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:21,683
right?
Because for Freud there was an end and 

886
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:25,800
an ego and the superego and they had was
basically,

887
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,740
you know,
biology and its ability to control you.

888
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:34,120
And the ego was poor little you.
And the Super Ego was the terrible force

889
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:34,954
of culture,
crushing the little ego between the 

890
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:42,010
terrible force of biology and itself.
And so the Super Ego in some senses,

891
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,873
culture,
and that's represented by masculinity 

892
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,110
now or by,
by,

893
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,160
by the far to figured most generally 
speaking.

894
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,580
Now you could also imagine the culture 
as the collection of all knowledge.

895
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:55,773
Now that's fine.
Now then you got to think about what 

896
00:47:57,761 --> 00:48:00,610
knowledge is.
And that's a tough thing to get a handle

897
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,310
on.
So because there's different definitions

898
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:04,144
of knowledge.
We in many technical situations in our 

899
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:09,454
culture,
we privilege factual knowledge and we 

900
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:14,080
think of that as knowledge.
So for example,

901
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:15,820
if you're going to be an engineer or a 
physicist,

902
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,040
someone who's really dealing with 
things,

903
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,113
there are certain rules that apply to 
the operation of things and you have to 

904
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:23,020
know what those are.

905
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,130
And those don't necessarily have much to
do with how you behave.

906
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,353
You know,
if you're an engineer and you go to 

907
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:30,094
work,
you work with things and you have to 

908
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:32,044
know how the things work.
Now you also have to be part of a 

909
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:35,044
culture because if you're not,
you're going to not get along with the 

910
00:48:36,491 --> 00:48:38,620
rest of the engineers and they're going 
to toss you out.

911
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,320
So you have to have both forms of 
knowledge.

912
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,393
But we're not interested in in the 
moment precisely about the factual 

913
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:45,904
knowledge.
We're more interested in the knowledge 

914
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:49,720
that makes you acceptable other human 
beings.

915
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:53,470
And that enables you,
while you're operating in your own life,

916
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,453
to negotiate the social structure in 
such a way that you can be successful 

917
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,660
and successful would mean well,
you get to live.

918
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:02,943
That would be one definition.
There's some probability that you might 

919
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:07,570
find an intimate partner.

920
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,583
That's another element of success.
You're not suffering to the point where 

921
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:13,720
your own existence is intolerable,
you know,

922
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:14,554
and you're going to survive for some 
prolonged period of time with some 

923
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,930
amount of security.
And so that's what you're,

924
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,370
you know,
that's what you're trying to do.

925
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:24,400
And I would say to the degree that 
you're well inculturated,

926
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,653
which is that you're a good 
representation of your culturals 

927
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,353
cultures,
knowledge in so far as it's irrelevant 

928
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:31,024
behaviorally,
then you're much more likely to be 

929
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:33,790
successful.
Okay.

930
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:34,624
So we're going to,
we're going to equate that form of 

931
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:41,140
knowledge with the possibility of 
succeeding that makes you,

932
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:42,690
well,
you could call,

933
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,563
you could call it a no,
you could call it emotional 

934
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:46,534
intelligence,
although I never would call it that 

935
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:51,790
because there's actually no such thing.
But it's more,

936
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,530
it's knowledge about how to act,
you know?

937
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,990
And it's,
it's very,

938
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:00,190
very important that knowledge.

939
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,350
So just think about what you're all 
doing in this class,

940
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:04,540
right?
Most of you don't know each other.

941
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,640
There's maybe 200 people in this class.
Three of you are pretty damn crazy,

942
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:11,650
really.
You know,

943
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:14,260
and,
and probably about 10 of you are like on

944
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,610
the edge.
So,

945
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:18,130
but there you all are sitting there 
peacefully,

946
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,993
right?
You're following a rule code and you're 

947
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:22,510
really following it.
First of all,

948
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:24,850
you're all sitting in your own chair,
right?

949
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:26,620
You're not sitting on the lap of someone
names,

950
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,550
right?
And that makes you laugh,

951
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:30,320
right?
Because what would happen if someone did

952
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:31,760
that?
What would happen?

953
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,201
Well,
you know,

954
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:34,034
a little flurry would break out because 
it's all of a sudden the primate is 

955
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:38,270
doing something that a primates not 
supposed to do.

956
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,650
And that opens up an area of,
of,

957
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,300
of the unexpected and the crazy,
right?

958
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:47,690
And God only knows what's going to 
happen when a little spot opens up where

959
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:49,730
the unexpected and crazy emerges.

960
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,920
You know,
we don't like those spots.

961
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,430
And you can,
you can see this in your own behavior.

962
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:55,280
So,
for example,

963
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,140
if you're walking down bloor street and 
you happen to come across someone who is

964
00:50:59,141 --> 00:50:59,974
self evidently homeless and they're 
wandering down the street and they're 

965
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:04,850
gesturing and they're talking to 
themselves,

966
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,500
there's a bunch of things you're going 
to do.

967
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,873
The first thing is,
is you're going to glance and look away 

968
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,023
and then you're going to make a 
relatively wide birth around the person 

969
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:16,610
and you're going to try not to make eye 
contact generally speaking.

970
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,980
And the reason for that,
think about that.

971
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:24,220
The reason for that is the space that 
that person in habits is undetermined by

972
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:26,750
cultural agreement,
right?

973
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,733
You don't know what the person will do.
And so all you do is walk around that 

974
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,990
space because God only knows what 
happened.

975
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,093
What might happen if you don't,
probably nothing because the person is 

976
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:39,350
preoccupied by whatever demons happened 
to be chasing them,

977
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:41,660
but you're not going to take that 
chance.

978
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,540
And so you all come in here and I mean 
look,

979
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:46,730
look you're,
you're pretty much all dressed the same,

980
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,230
you know,
roughly speaking,

981
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,380
acceptable variation,
but nothing outlandish.

982
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:54,290
So you get to be individual but not 
peculiar.

983
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,910
I think
so far it looks okay.

984
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,133
Right?
And you know where you're supposed to 

985
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:02,720
set.
And I bet you how many of you sat in the

986
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:05,960
same seat you sat in the first day.
Yeah.

987
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:07,610
So,
so a good proportion of view.

988
00:52:07,611 --> 00:52:09,500
How many didn't?
Okay.

989
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,960
Well you will assume cause,
cause you,

990
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:12,680
you'll love it.
I'll keep,

991
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,540
you'll have established your little 
territory,

992
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,730
you know,
and it will be,

993
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:20,420
it will be familiar to you and you'll 
gravitate towards it.

994
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,600
And you'll be happy about that because 
you'll start to become familiarized with

995
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:26,900
the people in your immediate vicinity.
And they didn't kill you the first time.

996
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,300
So they might not kill you the second 
time.

997
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,740
Right?
And so,

998
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,090
and you're all participating in a,
in a kind of collective drama,

999
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,360
right?
So what's the nature of this room?

1000
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,470
What does it look like?
What's it called?

1001
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,160
It's a lecture theater.
Right?

1002
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:50,390
Why?
Because there's a drama going on,

1003
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:52,460
right?
And you're the audience.

1004
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:57,200
And I'm hypothetically supposed to be 
providing the drama and we all know that

1005
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,870
because that's how the room is set up.
And when you come in here,

1006
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:01,730
you will obey the room.
You do what it tells you.

1007
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,090
There's chairs and you sit in them.
And when I'm talking,

1008
00:53:05,091 --> 00:53:06,590
generally speaking,
you don't,

1009
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,013
maybe you want to,
hopefully if I'm speaking properly then 

1010
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:13,250
you don't care.
Because if you're happy,

1011
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:14,084
listen and the rule is you're supposed 
to look at me and listen and you're all 

1012
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:17,324
following that rule.
And you know all of that is because 

1013
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:24,371
you're very much inculturated and you're
sane enough to follow the damn rules.

1014
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,520
And one of the things you might think 
about this,

1015
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:30,000
and this is where I thought the 
psychoanalysts kind of went astray,

1016
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,223
is that the psychoanalysts tended to 
think that you were saying if your 

1017
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:40,170
interior psychological structures were 
integrated and well put together,

1018
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:43,860
so your psyche was sort of something 
inside your head,

1019
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,750
roughly speaking and sanity was 
something that was an individual issue.

1020
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,750
But I think you know another way of 
looking at that at that,

1021
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:53,730
and it's a more powerful way of looking 
at it,

1022
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:56,850
I think,
is that you're hardly self regulatory at

1023
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:59,610
all.
All you have to do is behave well enough

1024
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:04,200
so other people can stand being around 
you and you can outsource the problem of

1025
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:05,034
your own sanity.
Because as soon as you get a little 

1026
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,040
weird,
if you have people around you,

1027
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:08,874
they'll just tell you.
And so you don't have to remember how 

1028
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:11,430
not to be weird.

1029
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,640
You just have to pay enough attention to
other people around you.

1030
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,653
So that when they indicate by not 
listening to you are by not laughing at 

1031
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:21,630
your jokes are by raising an eyebrow or 
by saying something smart about what you

1032
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:26,610
just did that you stop and reconsider 
and go on in your same manner.

1033
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,420
So it's also why people who are 
tremendously isolated often,

1034
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,040
you know,
there's a loop there,

1035
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,290
they're a little queer to begin with,
so to speak,

1036
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:35,124
because you know there's something wrong
with their ability to behave and then 

1037
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:42,730
they get isolated and things just go 
seriously astray as a,

1038
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,340
as a consequence of that.
So anyways,

1039
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:45,174
the point I'm trying to make is that a 
lot of your knowledge is actually 

1040
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:50,280
knowledge about how to behave.
Right?

1041
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:51,114
And that's the sort of knowledge that's 
really critical for psychological 

1042
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:54,500
stability.
It's,

1043
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:57,960
it's not related in any real sense to 
the world,

1044
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,750
to the knowledge you have about the 
structure of the objective world.

1045
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:01,823
And you kind of know that because 
animals are perfectly capable of 

1046
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:07,350
surviving even complex animals like 
chimpanzees,

1047
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,393
what?
They don't know a damn thing about the 

1048
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:10,950
objective world,
right?

1049
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,430
And their primary reality is social.
Okay?

1050
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:19,020
So one domain of symbolic representation
is the dominance hierarchy.

1051
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:22,200
And culturally I said that was 
associated with the maternal and there's

1052
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:24,150
reasons for that.
Now here's,

1053
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:26,580
here's another thing that needs to be 
conceptualized.

1054
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,583
Okay?

1055
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,993
When you're walking down bloor street 
and you make a detour around the person 

1056
00:55:39,261 --> 00:55:42,530
who happens to be talking to themselves,
where are they?

1057
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,590
Okay?

1058
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,290
Because wherever they are,
that's not the same place you are.

1059
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:48,723
If it was the same place,
you wouldn't have any trouble walking 

1060
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:53,860
right by them wherever they are,
that's somewhere seriously different.

1061
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,473
Now,
it turns out that we also have the 

1062
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:58,024
capacity to represent that.
And I would say an easy way to think 

1063
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:02,674
about that is that we have,
there are two domains that are 

1064
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,494
characteristic to experience and one 
domain is the domain of the known and 

1065
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:13,390
the domain of the known is where when 
you act in a certain way,

1066
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:16,390
what you want to happen happens.
Got It.

1067
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,673
And the reason that's the known is 
because if you act in a certain way and 

1068
00:56:20,381 --> 00:56:22,990
you get what you want,
that means that you know what you're,

1069
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,440
it's actually the definition of knowing 
what you're doing.

1070
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:27,380
Yeah.

1071
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,213
And that that's a different definition.
Then I know a fact about the object of 

1072
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:32,360
world,
you know,

1073
00:56:32,361 --> 00:56:33,194
so if you tell someone to joke or you 
tell a group of people a joke and you 

1074
00:56:35,841 --> 00:56:36,674
know,
they laugh and maybe they want another 

1075
00:56:37,641 --> 00:56:38,241
joke,
it's like,

1076
00:56:38,241 --> 00:56:39,950
good for you.
You know what you're doing.

1077
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,850
But if you tell them a joke and they 
sorta,

1078
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,540
you know,
look on easy and glance at each other,

1079
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:45,374
well you know,
it's time to rethink your sense of 

1080
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:47,294
humor.
And what you just learned is that 

1081
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,323
there's some mismatch between the manner
in which you can figure social reality 

1082
00:56:53,421 --> 00:56:54,254
and the social reality itself.
Now imagine what happens if you do tell 

1083
00:56:57,531 --> 00:57:00,560
a joke or maybe a couple of jokes and 
they flopped badly.

1084
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:05,000
How do you feel when that happens?
If you have any sense?

1085
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:10,030
How do you feel?
Embarrassed.

1086
00:57:10,061 --> 00:57:10,701
Yes.
Yes.

1087
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:12,940
So maybe you turned red for example.
What else?

1088
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,590
What might happen if you feel 
embarrassed?

1089
00:57:14,591 --> 00:57:15,161
What?
What would,

1090
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:16,030
what would you do?

1091
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:17,450
Okay.

1092
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:18,470
Yeah.
Salesmen jokes.

1093
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,210
Well hopefully,
right?

1094
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:20,991
It's like,
you know,

1095
00:57:20,991 --> 00:57:23,270
that's right.
You'd reevaluate your knowledge and,

1096
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:25,340
and you might think,
well what the Hell is wrong with me?

1097
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,530
Or You might think what the Hell is 
wrong with them?

1098
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,960
Which I would say is not a good starting
point.

1099
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,030
Yeah,
seriously though.

1100
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:32,864
You know,
cause you got to watch that because if 

1101
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:36,560
it's 10 people and you,
maybe you're right,

1102
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,143
maybe you are funny,
but if all 10 of them think you're not 

1103
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,180
well either you're not funny or you're 
telling your jokes to the wrong people.

1104
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,373
Right.
And sometimes it is the case that it's 

1105
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,170
everyone else.
That's got the problem,

1106
00:57:48,171 --> 00:57:49,004
but that's definitely not the first 
hypothesis that you might want to 

1107
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:52,790
generate.
Okay.

1108
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:57,791
So there's a place that as a place that 
exists that manifests itself when things

1109
00:57:59,331 --> 00:58:00,164
that you don't want or expect happen.
And I would consider that unknown and 

1110
00:58:05,561 --> 00:58:06,394
not known as a complicated place because
it's a place where unexpected things 

1111
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:09,784
happen and that's also symbolically 
represented and that's generally 

1112
00:58:13,181 --> 00:58:15,850
symbolically represented by feminine 
figures.

1113
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,283
Now the reasons for that is 
extraordinarily complicated and it's 

1114
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:21,610
going to take a very long time to 
explain it.

1115
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,330
Partly it's because of the masculine has
a symbolic realm is already used up.

1116
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:26,223
That's the dominance hierarchy.
And because we're basically social 

1117
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:32,080
cognitive organisms,
we're going to use

1118
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,400
okay

1119
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,150
representations that are basically 
human.

1120
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:39,200
Okay.

1121
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,410
In order to start representing things 
that aren't precisely human.

1122
00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:46,190
Because we have to start somewhere.
We have to start with our basic primate,

1123
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,293
primate cognitive system.
And it's not like chimpanzees have 

1124
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:51,590
culture,
you know,

1125
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:53,390
they have dominance hierarchies and 
troops.

1126
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,433
We have dominance hierarchies and troops
and culture and we have to represent 

1127
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:58,454
that some way.
And the way we represent it is by using 

1128
00:59:00,441 --> 00:59:02,390
the same systems that we were 
representing,

1129
00:59:02,391 --> 00:59:03,224
the simple structures with,
but generalizing with them to encompass 

1130
00:59:07,551 --> 00:59:08,130
broader.

1131
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:10,200
So no woman them.
So,

1132
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,533
so

1133
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,360
things that are permanent across time,

1134
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,240
things you know or the fact that there 
are things that you know,

1135
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,453
things that you don't know or the fact 
that there are things that you don't 

1136
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:26,324
know that's permanent.
And then there's one other thing across 

1137
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:30,590
time that's permanent.
You,

1138
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,140
the fact that there's an I in the 
equation,

1139
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,460
right?
So you think,

1140
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:35,294
well what are people's experiential 
fields fundamentally composed of places 

1141
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:44,180
you're secure in and that you 
understand.

1142
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,193
So that's your territory.
And your territory is a very complex 

1143
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,254
thing.
It might even be an ideological 

1144
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:50,840
territory.
Your territory,

1145
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:54,230
things that you don't understand,
that's not your territory,

1146
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:55,064
that's unexplored territory and you 
don't know what the hell is going on 

1147
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:58,520
there.
And that's the unknown.

1148
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,880
And then the last common element is you.
And so basic symbolic structures tend to

1149
01:00:06,361 --> 01:00:11,361
represent those elements of reality 
known and the unknown.

1150
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,140
And the thing that mediates between 
them.

1151
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,183
And the thing that mediates between them
is you or more precisely the thing that 

1152
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:19,710
mediates between them as your individual
consciousness.

1153
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,740
And that's like mediating between chaos 
and order.

1154
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,650
If you look up at the,
at the screen there,

1155
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,990
look at the the Christian image,

1156
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,030
John the left

1157
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:34,983
that's called the open virgin and there 
there are quite a few statues of this 

1158
01:00:39,371 --> 01:00:43,690
sort that were created in medieval 
Europe and the 13th 14th century.

1159
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:45,423
And uh,
I wanna Sorta tell you what that 

1160
01:00:47,681 --> 01:00:48,514
sculpture means using the analytic 
Schema that I just laid out for you so 

1161
01:00:55,631 --> 01:00:58,660
that you can get a sense of how this 
symbolic representation works.

1162
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,913
Now,
and this is a strange representation 

1163
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:02,674
from a Christian perspective because 
while the representation is the Virgin 

1164
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,371
Mary,
right,

1165
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,204
that's the superordinate figure,
the female and inside that is God the 

1166
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:14,930
father and inside that is Christ.
All right?

1167
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:15,993
Now the reason it's a strange Christian 
representation is that it's rare to see 

1168
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:25,411
Mary represented as a figure that 
superordinate to God and well,

1169
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,913
we'll just leave that aside for now.
I think part of the reason that that 

1170
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:33,490
happens at that happened for these 
sculptors is because they were trying to

1171
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:37,690
express the relationship between these 
three fundamental elements in a way that

1172
01:01:37,691 --> 01:01:40,540
was slightly different than the 
canonical Christian representation.

1173
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:43,450
But here's how to read it.
Well,

1174
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:46,780
the outside,
that's the unknown.

1175
01:01:46,781 --> 01:01:48,970
That's the mother of all things.
Now you might say,

1176
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:49,804
well,
why is the unknown the mother of all 

1177
01:01:50,741 --> 01:01:52,840
things?
Well,

1178
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,213
where does new information come from?
New information comes from what you 

1179
01:01:58,031 --> 01:02:00,400
don't know.
You already know what you know.

1180
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,860
Everything new comes from what you don't
know.

1181
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,950
And so what you don't know is 
terrifying,

1182
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:09,610
certainly because God only knows what's 
going to happen when you encounter it,

1183
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,400
but it's also unbelievably potentially 
productive.

1184
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:13,323
In fact,
you might think of it as potential now 

1185
01:02:15,401 --> 01:02:16,234
known his potential itself.
And so you need to know how to deal 

1186
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:21,390
with,
because potential manifest itself in all

1187
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:23,190
sorts of places that you wouldn't 
necessarily,

1188
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,560
uh,
technically you wouldn't expect.

1189
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,633
It's almost by definition.
So you have the unknown on the very 

1190
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:33,870
outside.
And then inside that you have culture.

1191
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:36,690
It's like,
and so that's like nature and culture as

1192
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:37,524
well,
but it's like unknown territory and 

1193
01:02:38,931 --> 01:02:42,990
known territory.
And then inside the culture holding,

1194
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,900
holding you up so to speak,
is the individual.

1195
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,520
And you might say,
well,

1196
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,450
why in this representation is the 
individual crucified?

1197
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:54,150
And the answer to that is quite straight
forward.

1198
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,530
Life is mostly suffering.
And there's more to it though than that.

1199
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,633
The other element to it,
and this is part of this as part of the 

1200
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:06,570
complex representational system that 
underlies the symbolic representation of

1201
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:07,404
the individuals,
the individual is also something that 

1202
01:03:09,061 --> 01:03:09,894
can die and be reborn.
And that's symbolic representation 

1203
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,340
already showed you in the figure of 
Jonah,

1204
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,233
right?
Because the idea was there that some 

1205
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:18,720
terrible things swallowed this creature 
up,

1206
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,260
pulled it down into the depths and then 
let it reemerge.

1207
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,260
And I would say that's happened to you 
people many times already,

1208
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:30,261
even though you probably don't know it.
So think back when your experience,

1209
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:30,990
you know,
so,

1210
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:33,540
so let's lay out a couple of things that
everybody knows about.

1211
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,553
Someone close to you died,
someone close to you got a serious 

1212
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:39,600
illness,
you got a serious illness,

1213
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:44,360
you are completely heartbroken because 
it relationship failed catastrophic.

1214
01:03:44,361 --> 01:03:46,350
Lee,
you were betrayed by a friend.

1215
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,020
Well,
I'm sure that for most of you at least,

1216
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:54,410
well let's find out how many people in 
this room have had at least one of those

1217
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:56,010
things happen to them.

1218
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:57,940
Okay.

1219
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,780
Right,
right.

1220
01:03:58,781 --> 01:03:59,614
And are,
is there anybody in here who's got off 

1221
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:03,130
free from that so far?

1222
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,080
Oh Wow.
That stuff's good.

1223
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:07,700
That's amazing.
But you can see how,

1224
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,440
you know,
unbelievably rare that is,

1225
01:04:09,441 --> 01:04:10,274
I'm sure you must have had some other 
terrible thing happened to you with any 

1226
01:04:11,961 --> 01:04:12,950
luck.
So,

1227
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:15,080
so,
okay,

1228
01:04:15,081 --> 01:04:18,440
so you are,
you perfectly well understand what those

1229
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:20,870
experiences are like.
So then the question is

1230
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,150
where do you go with an experience like 
that occurs?

1231
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,800
And you might think,
well what do you mean?

1232
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:29,510
Where do you go?
You're in the same place.

1233
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:30,680
And I would say to you,
well no,

1234
01:04:30,681 --> 01:04:34,130
it depends pretty much on exactly what 
you mean by a place.

1235
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:35,983
You know,

1236
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:39,263
places are times too,
and you can be one person at one moment 

1237
01:04:41,731 --> 01:04:42,564
in the same place and a completely 
different person in the next moment in 

1238
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:46,074
the same place.
And that means you're really not in the 

1239
01:04:47,371 --> 01:04:50,550
same place at all.
And when something comes along and pulls

1240
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:52,830
the rug out from underneath you,
when you fall,

1241
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,330
when you fall into is the unknown.
And that's a completely different place.

1242
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,940
And that's the underworld of classical 
mythology.

1243
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,223
And it's also the unconscious.
And part of the reason that it's the 

1244
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:04,584
unconscious so complicated when the rug 
is pulled out from underneath you and 

1245
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:12,930
you're somewhere you don't want to be 
and didn't expect and didn't like,

1246
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,243
what starts to structure how you respond
is the fundamental biological systems 

1247
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:19,870
that make up the substrata of your 
psyche.

1248
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:23,530
So for example,
the first thing that might vital curry's

1249
01:05:23,531 --> 01:05:25,600
that you experience it as a terrible 
shock.

1250
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:27,183
And that's a physiological response.
And then maybe right afterwards you're 

1251
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:30,454
angry or you're afraid or you're 
confused or you're depressed or you 

1252
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:35,380
know,
it's another emotional response.

1253
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,393
And then you start to imagine 
alternative scenarios are reasons why 

1254
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:39,844
this thing might have occurred.
There's a whole set of processes that 

1255
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,893
are automatically undertaken when you 
encounter something that's outside the 

1256
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:49,150
realm of your expectation and your 
desire.

1257
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:51,280
And if you understand that,
you see,

1258
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,114
if you understand that,
and this is why I've told you all these 

1259
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:54,394
complicated things today,
if you understand that that's a 

1260
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:57,454
different place and that you cycle 
through that place and then back up to 

1261
01:06:01,151 --> 01:06:01,984
normal reality and through that place 
and then back up to normal reality 

1262
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:09,400
multiple times throughout your life,
you can see that one,

1263
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:10,743
it's inevitable that the individual is 
something that suffers to the 

1264
01:06:14,621 --> 01:06:15,454
individual,
is something that can suffer and then 

1265
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:19,450
reconstitute itself as a consequence of 
that suffering.

1266
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:23,500
It doesn't necessarily happen,
you know now and then something can come

1267
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:26,890
along and take you off at the knees and 
you just never get back up.

1268
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:28,623
But the general human experiences that 
you learn as a consequence of your 

1269
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:32,374
failures,
and the reason for that is that the 

1270
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:38,290
place that you go when you fail has a 
tremendous amount of information in it.

1271
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,041
So,
for example,

1272
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:42,730
it might be that if you were betrayed in
a relationship that you're just too damn

1273
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:46,690
naive and there's a lot of things that 
you should have paid attention to in the

1274
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:49,090
world.
And maybe even within the person,

1275
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:50,463
the person who you are attracted to with
regards to their character or your own 

1276
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:55,840
character that you should have known 
more about.

1277
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:57,580
And if you would have known more about 
it,

1278
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:00,250
well that would have been a particular 
hole you wouldn't have stepped in.

1279
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,870
You know?
And so the,

1280
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:05,530
so the appropriate reaction to a 
catastrophic failure,

1281
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:06,364
and this isn't always possible,
is to react as how you're going to 

1282
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:10,594
react,
which is usually it was shock and 

1283
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:12,634
dismay.
And then to learn from the experience 

1284
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:15,514
and to gather whatever information there
is in the failures so that you can 

1285
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:19,564
extract out that information and rebuild
yourself out of it and restructure your 

1286
01:07:23,381 --> 01:07:25,750
conception of the world.
So it's richer and more dynamic.

1287
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,310
Now let,
let me just give you an example of that.

1288
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,900
Remember the Hobbit,
right?

1289
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:37,953
I don't know.
He spent a couple of hundred million 

1290
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,413
dollars on that movie and you know,
it was written in the 1960s but it was 

1291
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:44,464
based on very,
very old stories including some of the 

1292
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:50,080
north sagginess.
Remember the Hobbit at the beginning?

1293
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:52,600
I think we established that that was 
Bilbo,

1294
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:53,823
right?
So he lives in this little area called 

1295
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:56,284
the shier that's really protected and 
he's kind of a little guy and all the 

1296
01:07:59,381 --> 01:08:00,214
people in the shire kind of naive,
it turns out in the Lord of the rings 

1297
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:03,364
that they're actually protected.
There's these people called striders 

1298
01:08:06,101 --> 01:08:10,300
that walk around the border who happened
to be the sons of ancient kings who keep

1299
01:08:10,301 --> 01:08:13,510
all the bad guys away and the bloody 
hobbits don't even know it.

1300
01:08:13,511 --> 01:08:15,710
And they're even kind of contemptuous of
striders.

1301
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:16,544
But they're keeping these hobbits so 
that they can be naive and self 

1302
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,530
satisfied and somewhat ignorant and you 
know,

1303
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:25,520
a bit on the arrogant side without even 
knowing that they're being protected.

1304
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:27,200
Okay,
well that's you.

1305
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:29,540
That's why you were hooked into the 
story right off the bat.

1306
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:33,290
And then they extract out one guy from 
this whole scenario who's,

1307
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:34,124
you know,
got a little bit more going for them 

1308
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:35,624
than the typical hobbit.
And he wants to go outside of this 

1309
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:39,710
paradise,
so to speak,

1310
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,753
to encounter the actual world.
And it's so interesting because what's 

1311
01:08:43,521 --> 01:08:45,290
his,
what's his role?

1312
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,650
What do they hire him as a thief?
Yeah.

1313
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:49,251
You think,
Geez,

1314
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:52,010
this is pretty weird disguise going on 
this developmental quest,

1315
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:54,110
you know,
and he's going to turn into a hero.

1316
01:08:54,111 --> 01:08:58,040
And what does he start by doing?
He starts by becoming a criminal.

1317
01:08:58,730 --> 01:08:59,660
Right?
But that's,

1318
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:02,020
that seems to be part of the story.
It's actually part of their,

1319
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:04,070
his heroic transformation.
You know,

1320
01:09:04,071 --> 01:09:08,990
one of the things you said about heroic 
transformations was that the first thing

1321
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,690
that happens when you put your self out 
of side,

1322
01:09:11,691 --> 01:09:14,180
your zone of comfort,
if you do that voluntarily,

1323
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,313
is that you encounter your shadow,
which is the part of you that is 

1324
01:09:17,781 --> 01:09:21,320
fundamentally in some sense,
antisocial and criminal.

1325
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,040
And then you extract from that element 
of yourself,

1326
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:28,100
those personality attributes you need to
survive when you're outside,

1327
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:29,870
where everything is comfortable and 
predictable.

1328
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:34,550
And then what happens with bill bill 
while he encounters a dragon,

1329
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:35,413
right?
That's the dragon we talked about 

1330
01:09:36,351 --> 01:09:37,184
already.
That's the thing that swallows you up 

1331
01:09:38,391 --> 01:09:40,460
when you don't know where you are.
And he had,

1332
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:42,620
and he gets a treasure as a consequence 
of that.

1333
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:44,091
Well,
you see,

1334
01:09:44,091 --> 01:09:47,270
what the story means is that if you go 
outside your zone of comfort,

1335
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:49,220
if you go outside of what you 
understand,

1336
01:09:49,221 --> 01:09:50,054
and you do that voluntarily,
and you develop the skills that you've 

1337
01:09:53,001 --> 01:09:53,834
rejected,
that are necessary for your proper 

1338
01:09:56,031 --> 01:09:56,864
survival as an integrated human being,
you can encounter the thing that most 

1339
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:00,944
frightens you,
and you can extract something of value 

1340
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:06,170
as a consequence.
And that's the human story.

1341
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:11,410
That's the fundamental story of mankind,
because we're always the thing that goes

1342
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:12,404
outside of what we understand to 
confront what we don't understand that 

1343
01:10:15,441 --> 01:10:18,980
frightens us so that we can get whatever
that thing has.

1344
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,563
And so that's part of the symbolic 
representations that you need to 

1345
01:10:22,671 --> 01:10:23,504
understand in order for us to continue 
to develop our investigation of 

1346
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,660
phenomena like unconscious symbolism.

1347
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:35,850
So that's that.
See you next [inaudible].
