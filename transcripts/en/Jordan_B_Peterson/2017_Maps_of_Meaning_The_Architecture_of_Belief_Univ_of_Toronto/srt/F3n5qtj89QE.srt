1
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,560
Alright,
so I want to go through a lot of 

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,660
material today and hopefully I've 
hopefully that'll work out.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,320
It should,
so so far what we've been doing is 

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,960
laying out an argument that you inhabit 
what you might describe as a frame of 

5
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:36,631
reference or a story or that you're 
occupied by sequential subpersonalities.

6
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:44,191
That's another reasonable way of 
thinking about it might be the most 

7
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:44,191
reasonable way of thinking about it 
really,

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,200
and that these frames of reference or 
subpersonalities have a point of view 

9
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:54,541
and to source associated thoughts and 
associated memories and that most 

10
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:59,800
importantly perhaps as well as directing
your behavior and emotions.

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,430
They also structure your perceptions and
I think that's the most critical.

12
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,420
That's the most critically important 
realization about the frames that you 

13
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,860
bring to bear on the world because they.

14
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,950
It's through them that the world 
manifests itself and what that means to 

15
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,740
some degree is that you,
you,

16
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,260
you have an indeterminant role to play 
as a consequence of your moral choices.

17
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:28,410
Because these are essentially value 
based structures.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,780
As a consequence of your moral choices.
You determined to do an indeterminant 

19
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,761
degree.
The manner in which the world manifests 

20
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:41,191
itself to you,
so in that sense you're a cocreator of 

21
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:44,641
your own being and then you're also a 
cocreator through your action and your 

22
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:48,520
communication for the being of other 
people as well and and,

23
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,670
and,
and for the external world in so far as 

24
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,011
you act upon it.
So it's a nontrivial realization too to 

25
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,650
understand that to what degree your 
value structures filter the world for 

26
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:07,441
you and shape it.
And so we've been talking so far about 

27
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:10,591
the structure of that world and I,
I introduced some neurophysiological 

28
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:11,110
ideas last time.

29
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,020
They got the idea being that you come 
into the world obviously embodied with,

30
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,300
with a set of inbuilt,
we'll call them subpersonalities at 

31
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,300
hand.
Most of them,

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,250
those are regulated by very archaic,
ancient brain systems that you share 

33
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:30,010
with many other creatures on the 
evolutionary chain,

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,300
which is partly why you can communicate 
with and understand other creatures.

35
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:37,690
Because if you didn't share that 
underlying biological structure,

36
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,470
they would be opaque to you.
In the same way that perhaps an octopus 

37
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,630
is relatively opaque to you.
You know you,

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,160
you can't understand it because you 
don't share an embodied platform and its

39
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,400
experiences,
therefore entirely foreign to you,

40
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:56,401
but you share your embodied platform,
certainly very specifically with all 

41
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:00,430
mammals and of course you understand 
mammals quite well,

42
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:05,431
but you can even really understand 
blizzards to some degree and especially 

43
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:09,661
the more social ones and so there's this
tremendous degree of inbuilt biological 

44
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:14,821
structure and biological commonality and
we talked about it most particularly in 

45
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:17,450
reference to the Hypothalamus,
which seems to be the the,

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,480
the built in initial subpersonality 
generator or something like that and the

47
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:27,481
hypothalamus is responsible for 
regulating what you might regard as the 

48
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,280
most fundamental biological elements of 
behavior.

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,140
The things that the systems that not 
only keep you alive,

50
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,260
which is obviously very important,
but also impel you to do such things as 

51
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,031
defend yourself.
Obviously part of survival and also to 

52
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:48,421
reproduce and to explore and the 
exploration elements quite interesting 

53
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:52,321
because you think of that as a very 
sophisticated form of behavior and it 

54
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:55,771
is,
but it's rooted in an unbelievably 

55
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,991
archaic neurophysiology.
So the hypothalamus roughly sets you 

56
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:03,160
into motivated frames and then when 
those frames either fail or when they're

57
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,500
all acquiescent because they'd been 
satiated,

58
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:10,501
it pops you into an exploratory state of
mind and you wander around exploring 

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,090
foraging for information,
roughly speaking,

60
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:18,091
so that you can update all the 
subpersonalities that you use to to 

61
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,550
organize your perceptions and frame your
emotions and so forth.

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Now the so the hypothalamus throws up 
these frames that makes you hungry,

63
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,640
it makes you thirsty,
it makes you defensively aggressive.

64
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,850
It helps regulate your temperature 
through behavior and all of those 

65
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,540
things.
Now the problem with that is that it's a

66
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,420
set of impulsive unit dimensional 
systems.

67
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,630
Each one operating in the moment and 
each one only concerned with the 

68
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,630
satiation of its particular aim will 
say.

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,960
And the problem with that is that while 
you live for more than the moment you 

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,800
live across many moments,
you stretch yourself across time.

71
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,810
And we know human beings know that they 
stretch across time and so actually have

72
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:06,811
to consider not only the organization of
their behavior in the short term,

73
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,940
but also the organization of their 
behavior.

74
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:14,941
In the short term so that it also works 
across weeks and across months and 

75
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:18,961
across years and maybe even for longer 
spans of time than that and also equally

76
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:24,211
and similarly it has to work across 
people and one of the things that's kind

77
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:29,281
of interesting about that is there 
actually isn't much difference between 

78
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:33,750
establishing a value structure that 
works for you now and next week and next

79
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,790
month and into the future and 
establishing a value structure that 

80
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,881
works for you and other people 
simultaneously because you could say 

81
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:45,121
that whoever you are in a year is sort 
of like another person and so in so far 

82
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:50,050
as you can organize yourself so that 
other people find what you're doing,

83
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,180
let's say acceptable and valuable.

84
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,480
You're also organizing yourself so that 
perhaps you're acting in the best 

85
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,310
interests of your future self and so

86
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,870
then you might say,
well,

87
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,060
if the hypothalamus can,
can,

88
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,280
can,
can organize your,

89
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,340
your,
your being such that you can satiate 

90
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:13,040
satisfy your most basic needs.
Why do you need the rest of the brain?

91
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,930
And answer to that is,
well,

92
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,230
it looks like it's to solve the problem 
of more complex forms of being so these,

93
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,780
these fundamental biological subsystems 
have to interact with each other in a 

94
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,300
productive way.
They can't just cycle unit dimensionally

95
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:34,301
from motivated state to motivated state.
It's not a very effective solution and 

96
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:38,981
not only that,
you have to learn to operate in a world 

97
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:39,520
with time and with other people and so 
that makes the,

98
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,450
the,
the,

99
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,910
the adaptation problem much,
much more complex.

100
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:46,430
And it's for that reason as far as I can
tell enough,

101
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,810
no doubt for other reasons as well that 
there's,

102
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,040
there is utility in the provision of 
extra subcortical and cortical 

103
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,190
resources.

104
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,190
And I think the right way to think about
the cortex in some ways is actually as 

105
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,210
living space for the hypothalamus and 
the subcortical structures.

106
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:06,350
So you know what happens when you're,
when you develop as a young child,

107
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,510
especially in the very early stages of 
development,

108
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,610
the underlying subcortical systems,
including the systems for the census,

109
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,830
more or less compete for Don Dominion 
over the cortical territory.

110
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,190
So for example,
if you take a kitten and you closed one 

111
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,970
of its eyes shortly after birth and you 
leave it covered for a number of months,

112
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,270
what will happen is the,
the remaining I will invade both 

113
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,700
hemispheres,
visual representation systems so that it

114
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:39,701
becomes this angle remaining eye becomes
much more acute and more critically 

115
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:41,270
dominant,
like an invader,

116
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,520
really like an invader.
Then the other one does.

117
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:48,521
And then if you uncover the other eye,
the cat after a critical period of 

118
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:49,010
development that cat will never learn to
see out of that eye.

119
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,710
And so,
you know,

120
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,420
you've got these underlying biological 
systems,

121
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:57,320
motivational and sensory,
and they're looking to expand themselves

122
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,130
as the organism manifests itself in the 
world.

123
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:04,910
And it does that by occupying cortical 
territory in a competitive process.

124
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,010
So for example,
if you're deaf,

125
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:08,240
your,
your,

126
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,260
your,
uh,

127
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,440
your visual cortex will become occupied 
by auditory and tactile process because 

128
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,720
why not?
You know what I mean?

129
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:20,620
You can basically see with your hands,
you know,

130
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,010
and you can,
you can.

131
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,300
Well,
I wouldn't say it's not so easy to hear 

132
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,300
with your eyes.
That's harder,

133
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,490
although you can hear to some degree 
with touch,

134
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,320
right,
because you can feel vibration.

135
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,090
All of your senses overlap to a 
substantial degree and if one of them is

136
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:37,130
missing,
it's perfectly reasonable for the others

137
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:42,131
to occupy the territory that's,
that would otherwise be given over to 

138
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:46,601
that sense.
And this actually has some practical 

139
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:46,601
implications.

140
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:50,080
Even so silent reading is actually a 
relatively new ability,

141
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,980
evolutionarily speaking.
I'm certainly.

142
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,990
Literacy is a relatively new invention 
from an evolutionary perspective about 

143
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,281
two to silent read is to use your eyes 
as ears so you know when you read 

144
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,070
silently you could hear the word,
so to speak in your head.

145
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,340
And the reason for that as it turns out,
is that the part of the brain that you 

146
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,701
use to read silently with is right 
between the visual and the auditory 

147
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:17,310
cortex.
This right where they overlap.

148
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,440
So you are literally literally,
you are using your eyes,

149
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,150
ears and so that's quite the thing that 
you can.

150
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,970
You can figure out how to do that.
So anyways,

151
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:32,790
so you can think about these 
hypothalamic systems being in place more

152
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:37,791
or less ready to go at birth and then 
having to organize themselves into a 

153
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,331
sophisticated and integrated single ego 
that acts across time and in the social 

154
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:42,450
environment.

155
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,480
And you know,
when Piaget originally started talking 

156
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,961
about child development,
he regarded the child as something that 

157
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:54,240
was born into the world with just a set 
of very primordial reflexes.

158
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,140
Mostly sucking reflex is and some 
primary motor reflexes.

159
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,680
He was a very much a constructionist,
but I would say,

160
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,660
you know,
had he been alive now,

161
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:06,600
his constructionism,
would it be modified and modified by the

162
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:11,601
relevant neurophysiological data showing
that there's a lot more built into us 

163
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:16,401
right from the beginning.
Then Piaget expected you still might 

164
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:17,250
need experienced to catalyze the 
development,

165
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:22,251
but obviously children are born with the
ability to hear and to see and to sense 

166
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:27,291
with touch and they're hungry and tired 
and angry and like they have the whole 

167
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:32,181
range of emotions at hand and they also 
come into the world with their 

168
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:35,580
motivation already in place.
Otherwise you wouldn't be able to form a

169
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:36,540
relationship with them.

170
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,540
And that's modified by the development 
of the higher cortical systems through 

171
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,131
play and through social negotiation,
but the biology is there to begin with 

172
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:46,950
and so that's.
That's a.

173
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,340
that's a good way to think about it with
regards to understanding how these,

174
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,250
how both,
how the fundamental biological systems 

175
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,941
operate and how they manifest themselves
in in personality and in story because 

176
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:05,400
you do that all the time.
You tell a story about how you got angry

177
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,910
and it's basically a story about being 
dominated by a particular kind of 

178
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,550
subpersonality which would be 
hypothalamic and exactly how you 

179
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,240
manifested that in what the consequences
were.

180
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,760
And you know I was very mad at this 
person,

181
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,580
but I knew I couldn't get too upset 
because.

182
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,880
And that's a good story.
That indicates both highly motivated 

183
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,411
nature of the original response tendency
and then your immediate proclivity to 

184
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:34,431
have to figure out how to negotiate that
expression within the social space so 

185
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:37,500
that the medium to longterm consequences
are positive rather than negative.

186
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,920
And people are very interested in such 
bits of information.

187
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:45,921
She sent such units of information 
because we need to know how to conduct 

188
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:50,841
ourselves in complex environments and so
if someone's willing to share their 

189
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,770
experience and they can narrate it in an
interesting story,

190
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,960
we're absolutely more than happy to 
listen because in some sense we're 

191
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,651
assembling our identities out of those 
stories and then you can think that 

192
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:05,460
there are patterns across stories,
which is really a useful thing to 

193
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,121
understand because what that gives you 
real insight into what constitutes an 

194
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:13,321
archetype,
because an archetype is what's common 

195
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:14,680
across sets of stories.
That might be one way of looking at it.

196
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:19,681
So an archetype is like a Meta story and
so what part of what we're going to turn

197
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:24,851
to now in this discussion is a 
description of certain metta stories and

198
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,610
there's a particular Metta story that 
I'm most interested in.

199
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,640
That's the story about how stories 
transformed themselves and so that's 

200
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,470
that I think is the most fundamental 
story that that,

201
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,070
that characterizes human beings.
There is the story I was,

202
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:46,570
here I am implemented some behaviors,
and I went there.

203
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,390
There was better than here.
That's the fundamental unit,

204
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:54,391
but the thing about structures like that
is that they may work in one situation 

205
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,510
and not in another or at one time and 
not in another and thus they have to be 

206
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,261
modified and it was partly for this 
reason that piaget has his career as a 

207
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:09,781
developmental psychologist progressed,
started to understand that it was more 

208
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:13,711
important,
not so much to understand the given 

209
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:16,800
structure of a knowledge structure,
but to understand the manner in which 

210
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,251
knowledge structures transformed and 
that was partly partly illustrated in 

211
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:23,140
his description of stage theory because 
stages,

212
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:28,141
we're really movement from one set of 
axiomatic presuppositions.

213
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,690
That through through,
through with which the child was 

214
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,991
structuring the world into a state where
that system failed because it wasn't 

215
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:41,821
sufficiently comprehensive and then into
the development of a new stage that 

216
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:47,521
could do everything.
The previous stage could plus account 

217
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:47,830
for all the things that the previous 
stage couldn't.

218
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,310
So that's also why Piaget believed that 
knowledge actually accumulated because 

219
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,170
each time there was a transformation,
the new structure could had a wider 

220
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:00,820
range of application than the previous 
structure.

221
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:05,821
Even though it kept all the advantages 
of the previous structure and so that's 

222
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:08,761
a good way of.
That's a good way of conceptualizing 

223
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:10,030
progress because it's not that easy.
If you're a relativist.

224
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,060
Fundamentally you don't believe in 
difference between knowledge structure 

225
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,431
say,
and you certainly don't believe in the 

226
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:19,801
idea of progress,
but if you think about a more 

227
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:22,651
sophisticated structure as being able to
do more things properly,

228
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:28,141
then you can certainly map out progress 
with no problem and you know you know 

229
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:30,670
that because you see people operating 
the world who are less competent,

230
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,240
generally speaking and more competent 
generally speaking,

231
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:37,240
and there doesn't seem to be much debate
about that.

232
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,910
You can recognize people like that very,
very easily.

233
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,980
So.
So that's the basic structure and we've 

234
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,851
talked about that at length and I 
suggested that while you're occupying a 

235
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:50,440
structure like that,
the world manifests itself to you not as

236
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:53,540
objects,
but as number one.

237
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,040
Things to ignore,
which is the major category.

238
00:14:56,041 --> 00:15:01,041
I was talking to some guy yesterday who 
is working pinky was in San Diego on 

239
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,830
artificial intelligence and neural 
networks and he.

240
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:08,831
He was working with someone who's 
actually started to a neural network 

241
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:12,760
work.
We'll learn how to weight certain 

242
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,620
stimulus features,
let's say in order to identify an image,

243
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:20,621
so the thing will be trained up on a 
whole set of diverse images and it 

244
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:22,490
learns through feedback to discriminate 
between them,

245
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,670
but the problem with the neural network 
is that it's not easy to understand 

246
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,581
what's actually going on inside of them 
because it sells itself generated so we 

247
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,120
could easily end up,
for example,

248
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,440
creating fully conscious machines and 
not understanding at all how they work.

249
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,990
That's the most likely outcome in my 
estimation.

250
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:42,800
But this guy was working with another 
guy who had figured out how to model the

251
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:47,150
weights and one of the things he told me
was that a tremendous amount of what the

252
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:49,580
neural network is doing is learning 
what's not relevant.

253
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,820
Right?
Which is exactly what.

254
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,790
And these,
by the way,

255
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:57,791
these neural network models produce 
output that's analogous to the output 

256
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,360
that's produced by sections of cortical 
tissue.

257
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,990
It's not identical,
but so partly they make the same kind of

258
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:07,991
mistakes,
which is an indication that they're 

259
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:09,851
functioning in the same way,
so one of the things that have neural 

260
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:13,331
net does when you're training it is 
learned to figure out which things it 

261
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:15,260
can ignore and that's mostly what you're
doing is what can be ignored.

262
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,560
And that's a tremendous realization too 
because it.

263
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,890
It highlights again how important the 
structure within which you exist,

264
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,830
what,
how importantly the structure within 

265
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,991
which you exist determines what 
manifests itself to you as you move 

266
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,771
through the world because you ignore 
almost everything so you ignore almost 

267
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:39,521
everything,
but then you concentrate on things that 

268
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:41,651
move you along your way or obstacles 
that get in your way and those things 

269
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:43,010
have emotional significance there.

270
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,010
Valence,
and the reason their valence is because 

271
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,530
there are conceptualized in relationship
to the journey.

272
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,040
You know,
if you run across a tool or something 

273
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,040
positive,
an opportunity we could say,

274
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,110
which is like an abstract tool,
then that moves you forward and the fact

275
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:00,950
that it's moving you forward is signaled
by the incentive reward system.

276
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,740
Dopaminergic mediated incentive reward 
system.

277
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,980
That's grounded in the Hypothalamus,
the same system that you use when you 

278
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,641
explore the same system that's activated
by psychomotor stimulants like cocaine 

279
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,210
and heroin and most of the drugs that 
people abuse,

280
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,810
that that system indicates to you that 
this entity is non ignorable because 

281
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:27,371
it's positively,
functionally related to the 

282
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:27,980
transformation of the world that you're 
attempting to accomplish,

283
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,810
so that makes you happy.
It makes you that,

284
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,100
that that provides you with with hope 
and incentive to move forward.

285
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,380
If fundamental,
motivating force of life for human 

286
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,440
beings with the possible exception,
say of aggression and sexuality,

287
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,470
which I would say operate much more 
sporadically.

288
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,710
This is pretty much continual and then 
of course the negative emotions are 

289
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,531
generated when you encounter something 
that gets in the way which can require a

290
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:57,060
small detour,
let's say,

291
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,360
or can blow apart the frame that you're 
inhabiting completely.

292
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,680
And part of what we're trying to do is 
understand how you compute,

293
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,960
how emotional to get about about certain
classes of events.

294
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:14,370
And the reason that it's so complicated 
is because often when you run into a.

295
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,100
When you run into a tool or an 
opportunity,

296
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:22,310
generally speaking,
it's not too hard to compute how useful 

297
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,641
it is,
although sometimes something can happen 

298
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:28,071
to you.
Like let's say you win a lottery where 

299
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:30,141
the possibility space is so great that 
it's an indefinite positive 

300
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,290
significance.
You know,

301
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,660
when you're going to be overwhelmed by 
that sort of thing.

302
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,940
It's pretty rare that something like 
that happens,

303
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,430
but it does happen to it.

304
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Maybe it happens when someone that 
you're desperately chasing for Amaris 

305
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,191
purposes agrees to go out with you.
That's another place where that sort of 

306
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,210
excitement occurs.
It seems to occur to football players,

307
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,440
you know,
when they make a touchdown on tv too,

308
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,330
because they do their little touchdown 
dance around like mad dogs and you know,

309
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:57,480
scientists never do that when they get 
out of paper published.

310
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:02,481
So there's something about scoring a 
goal that's really got that incentive 

311
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:02,481
reward blast,
you know.

312
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,390
So anyhow,
um,

313
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,180
the positive emotion systems are 
operating roughly speaking because you 

314
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,920
have encountered something that moves 
you forward on your path.

315
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:17,280
And we could say that given as we've 
discussed,

316
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,480
that your,
your value structure is a nested entity,

317
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,400
right?
With small goals,

318
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:26,130
nested inside larger goals or small 
personalities,

319
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:31,131
nested inside of larger personalities,
a positive thing that's really positive 

320
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:34,470
has implications for what you're doing 
right now that are positive but also has

321
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:37,440
positive implications higher up the 
abstraction chain,

322
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,150
you know.

323
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,160
So for example,
let's say you study really hard for an 

324
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,580
exam and you get a really good grade on 
it and you're surprised,

325
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,180
you think,
well,

326
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,820
that's extraordinarily useful.
I passed the grade,

327
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,490
I passed the exam,
I did well in the course,

328
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:53,400
but that means that maybe I'm a better 
student than I thought,

329
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,140
and given what I'm aiming for in the 
future,

330
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:58,200
maybe I'm a more competent person that I
had believed.

331
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:03,201
And so you can see that the positive 
emotion with echo through those levels 

332
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,460
of analysis because it has implications 
on each level.

333
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,110
Now you're also trying,
when you encounter something negative to

334
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,380
constrain its propagation across those 
levels,

335
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:18,381
because let's say you study really hard 
and you fail a dismally and so then you 

336
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:18,780
think,
well,

337
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,400
I,
I messed up this course,

338
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,980
I've messed up this exam,
I messed up this course.

339
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,110
I'm not as good as student as I think I 
am.

340
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,840
Maybe I'm a failure as a person and 
that'll.

341
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,030
That can take you out completely.
Right,

342
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,060
and of course there are more.
There are certainly more traumatic 

343
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,181
events that can be fall you than that a 
typical one that really will wipe 

344
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:42,681
someone out.
Imagine someone who's naive and 

345
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:43,410
dependent and over sheltered.
No,

346
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:45,990
and they and so they're off into the 
world,

347
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:49,030
although they're not prepared it and you
know they're,

348
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,150
they're axiomatic presuppositions aren't
sophisticated enough to allow for the 

349
00:20:55,571 --> 00:21:00,571
existence of radical uncertainty or 
malevolence and then one day they're 

350
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:01,350
attacked when they're,
maybe they're out,

351
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,910
they get mugged or maybe they get raped 
or something worse,

352
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,970
and they develop posttraumatic stress 
disorder from that.

353
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:10,780
And the reason for that is that the 
event is so anomalous,

354
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:15,781
especially combined with its malevolence
that it demolishes the interpretation 

355
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:20,290
frames from the local level all the way 
out to the superordinate level,

356
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,500
and then the person is cast into this 
chaotic state and they're terrified and 

357
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,091
angry and vengeful and and paralyzed and
depressed and and all of those things 

358
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,390
simultaneously.

359
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,180
And maybe they never put the pieces back
together,

360
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,790
right?
They descend into chaos and that's that.

361
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,970
And if you're in a situation like that 
long enough,

362
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,770
you know the cortisol that's produced 
can produce permanent neurophysiological

363
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,110
changes,
shrinkage of the hippocampus,

364
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,470
which is the part of the brain that 
moves information from short term 

365
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,711
attention to longterm storage,
shrinkage of the hippocampus and growth 

366
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:59,821
of the Amygdala,
which is something that seems to tag 

367
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,480
stimuli roughly speaking with emotional 
significance,

368
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:03,730
more or less permanently,
right?

369
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:06,130
Because if you really encountered 
something traumatic,

370
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,790
the hippocampus restricts information 
with regards to its application in this 

371
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,670
certain time and place.
So it's sort of situation specific.

372
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,340
But if you encounter something truly 
dangerous,

373
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,890
your brain is set up so that you will be
afraid of it.

374
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,920
Rep,
regardless of context,

375
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,760
so it's called the Amygdala,
can peruse context,

376
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:30,910
independent fears and those are those 
are basically,

377
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:33,070
while they can be part of posttraumatic 
stress disorder,

378
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,450
they can be part of a,
a very,

379
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:38,200
very serious phobia and so you can't 
contextualize them.

380
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,350
What you really do with someone who has 
a problem like that as you try to walk 

381
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,551
them through a recontextualization 
process so you know maybe if they're 

382
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:48,100
afraid of snakes,
so afraid of them,

383
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:51,520
they can't even really think of snakes.
You have the well first,

384
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:54,820
maybe you have them sit for one second 
and think of a cartoon snake,

385
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,090
you know,
and what happens is their brain notices 

386
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,251
that they can hold that image and 
nothing negative happens and so then 

387
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:05,731
it's that in some sense it's built in 
inhibitory structure that partially that

388
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:09,670
partially inhibits which is what 
inhibitory structures do.

389
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:14,671
That partially inhibits the otherwise 
context independent fear that would 

390
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:18,661
constitute the phobia.
And so you basically build up contexts 

391
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:22,681
of safety around the phobia until the 
context signifies lack of danger in the 

392
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:25,510
person can progress forward if they're 
really damaged.

393
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:30,511
It's really hard to do that,
especially if the trauma was really 

394
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:30,511
severe,
so okay,

395
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:33,670
so you see you don't see irrelevant 
things.

396
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,880
That's most things you do.
See things that move you forward and you

397
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:41,881
do see things that get in your way and 
in the class of things that get in your 

398
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:45,950
way are in determinant occurrences,
novel or anomalous occurrences,

399
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,100
and almost everything that gets in your 
way is in some sense a novel occurrence 

400
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,030
because you usually structure your 
behavior so that you don't go anywhere 

401
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,170
where something wildly anomalous is 
likely to occur.

402
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,470
So,
so not if you encountered an obstacle to

403
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:05,471
things happening at the same time and 
one is that your movement forward to 

404
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:06,980
your specific goal or sets of goals is 
blocked.

405
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,400
But the second thing that happens is 
you're faced with a mystery and the 

406
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,700
mystery is this thing wasn't supposed to
exist,

407
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:18,701
but it does exist.
So what implication does that have for 

408
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:18,701
everything?
I think,

409
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,330
and that's very,
very hard on people.

410
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,510
They do not like that at all and no 
wonder because it's,

411
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,990
it's,
it's the constrained chaos that's 

412
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,501
underneath everything inhibited by your 
contextual knowledge that suddenly 

413
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,690
popped its head up into your world.
It's like it's like the shark in the 

414
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,740
movie jaws,
which is of course a mythological story.

415
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,860
It's exactly that and,
and,

416
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:44,750
and it's,
it's exactly what that movie signified,

417
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,200
a safe vacation paradise all of a sudden
threatened by some subterranean thing 

418
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:55,781
that can pull you down and,
and that destroys the peace and the 

419
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:57,260
harmony of that particular community to 
dragon story.

420
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:58,270
It's a hero myth.
It's,

421
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,980
it's the story that people have been 
telling forever.

422
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,060
So,
so,

423
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:08,061
and what you can think,
you can think of that thing that 

424
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:08,480
re-emerges,
that shark that rises up from the depths

425
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:12,020
or that whale or that dragon or that 
Predator or,

426
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,290
or the foreign invader for that matter 
or the barbarian,

427
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,060
they all fit into the same category.

428
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,360
That's what had been deemed irrelevant 
suddenly manifesting itself.

429
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,020
And when you think about how much is 
deemed irrelevant,

430
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,480
the fact that it's suddenly manifest 
itself,

431
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,320
that's exactly the purpose for the 
reason for the,

432
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,970
for the trauma,
it's like,

433
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,660
well,
I've,

434
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,940
I've eradicated from my 
conceptualizations,

435
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:40,100
99 point nine,
nine percent of everything.

436
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,740
It's zeroed out and all of a sudden I've
made a mistake,

437
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,390
bang,
I don't know where I am.

438
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Well,
what's relevant when you don't know 

439
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:49,720
where you are.
And the answer to that is,

440
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,980
since you don't know everything is 
relevant and you can imagine the sort of

441
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,320
terror that people who experienced 
paranoid schizophrenia are living in 

442
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,341
perennially because what happens to them
is precisely that they undergo 

443
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:05,570
neurophysiological transformations that 
makes everything,

444
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:10,571
that they once dependent on disappear 
and everything comes back is relevant 

445
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,060
and that puts them in the early stages 
of schizophrenia.

446
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,700
That's extraordinarily stressful,
neurophysiologically.

447
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,940
So they're overwhelmed with cortisol and
their brains do deteriorate as a 

448
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,180
consequence of that is just too much so 
on,

449
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,830
surprisingly right?
Because you can't deal with.

450
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,740
You can hardly deal with anything,
let alone with everything.

451
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,810
Now and often,
what you see,

452
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,470
and it's rarely conceptualized this way 
in the training of,

453
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,500
of of clinical therapists,
but often what you see when you are 

454
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,020
dealing with people who are in crisis 
isn't people who have a mental illness.

455
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,670
In fact,
in my experience,

456
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:52,671
that's actually quite rare.
What's far more common is that the 

457
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:56,151
person that you're talking to has become
overwhelmed by catastrophe so their life

458
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:00,810
has fallen apart in some way that makes 
what they're doing actually impossible.

459
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,840
You know,
so maybe someone very close to them in 

460
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
their family that they were depending on
has developed a very serious illness and

461
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:10,310
that's throwing their entire financial 
state into utter chaos.

462
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Or maybe they've developed a condition 
that makes it impossible for them to 

463
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:15,680
work.
Or you know you can.

464
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,000
You can imagine the potential range of 
catastrophes and they're coming to see 

465
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,120
you because they're anxious and 
depressed.

466
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,300
But the reason they're anxious and 
depressed is because everything they 

467
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,541
have ignored has popped its head back up
and is hell bent on their destruction.

468
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And often you see people who are being 
attacked by five or six of these 

469
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,301
monsters out at the same time and it 
isn't their mental illness that stops 

470
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:39,930
them from being able to deal with it,
although that,

471
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,960
you know,
whatever weaknesses you have are going 

472
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,361
to interfere.
It's the fact that what they're facing 

473
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:47,670
is no damn joke.
And if you were facing it,

474
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,700
you'd feel exactly the same way.
So then you're trying to come up with 

475
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,050
practical solutions to these 
tremendously complex problems.

476
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,200
And that's a very,
a very well,

477
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,810
it's extraordinarily difficult.
Generally speaking,

478
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:05,811
people often don't come to a therapist 
until they've exhausted their entire 

479
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,640
range of resources.
They cannot figure out what to do.

480
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,650
And so,
you know,

481
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:15,651
in a situation like that you can 
administer antidepressants and maybe 

482
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:17,040
that'll help the person increase their 
stress resistance.

483
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,650
But as a,
uh,

484
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,720
and it may be that because they're 
depressed and have been brought down,

485
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:26,721
that they are in fact exaggerated the 
danger of some of the smaller monsters 

486
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:30,771
that are after them.
But making the person more stress 

487
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:31,080
resilient doesn't give them,
for example,

488
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:36,081
a new job.
And it certainly doesn't bring back the 

489
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,721
person they've been living with for two 
years who has a degenerating 

490
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:39,390
neurological disease or some form of 
cancer.

491
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,900
Like these things are major.
You know,

492
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,180
I often see people who while they were 
in a relationship,

493
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,920
maybe they're rather isolated,
older,

494
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:52,010
older people,
one of the partners is dying in their 

495
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,190
entire financial situation has become 
catastrophic.

496
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,970
It's like that's not a mental illness 
man.

497
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,030
I mean they may have got into that 
situation because of one inadequacy or 

498
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,300
another,
but you don't even want to push that too

499
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:08,301
far because that sort of thing can 
happen to anyone and and will in fact 

500
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:12,531
happen to most people in one form or 
another at least at some point in their 

501
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:16,251
lives.
So you want to be damned prepared for 

502
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:16,251
that.
You want to be prepared for that because

503
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,240
it's bitter and harsh and anxiety 
provoking and painful.

504
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,000
But if you're not ready that it's also 
hell.

505
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,590
And often you can stop things from 
becoming hell even though you can't stop

506
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:31,890
them from being bitter and painful and 
anxiety provoking and all of that.

507
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,400
You can at least delimit the catastrophe
enough.

508
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:38,160
So that it doesn't permanently bring you
in,

509
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:41,010
the people around you down.
And that's not so bad,

510
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,230
right?

511
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:46,230
That's a hell of.
Or at least it's a lot better than the 

512
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,290
alternative.
So this is the problem.

513
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:50,080
You know,
things object things are obstacles.

514
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,000
Well,
how big is the obstacle?

515
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:55,270
It's the same.
It's the same question is how big is the

516
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:58,000
Predator that's lurking outside the door
of our cave?

517
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,570
It's exactly the same problem except 
construct,

518
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,280
conceptualized abstractly,
and,

519
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:08,310
and I would say exactly the same systems
that you're distant ancestors used to 

520
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:13,291
conceptualize the lurking Predator are 
the systems that are activated now when 

521
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:17,080
you encounter the reemergence of all the
monsters that you've ignored,

522
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,290
it's the same neurological platform you 
think,

523
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,460
well,
how could it be otherwise?

524
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:25,240
Because evolution is a conservative 
process.

525
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,230
Everything about you is built on an 
ancient foundations,

526
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:30,400
right?
Very little new.

527
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,220
Certainly very little radically new 
comes into existence.

528
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:36,820
It's mostly tinkering with structures 
that have been around forever.

529
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,530
Like your body plan,
for example.

530
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:41,380
That's unbelievably old.
I mean you share that with.

531
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,630
You share that with lizards,
roughly speaking.

532
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,660
So it's incredibly ancient.
So you know when you share a bilateral 

533
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,900
symmetry,
even with most invertebrates,

534
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,620
so those,
those things are extraordinarily old and

535
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,150
so for our,
for our ancestors,

536
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,660
what was down out of the tree,
let's say down in the grass,

537
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:04,090
that was the thing that lurked in the 
unknown.

538
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Well for us,
the idea of the unknown has become much 

539
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,971
more abstractly conceptualized like we 
can think of the unknown as such things 

540
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:16,450
we don't know and so then we can think 
of the abstract Predator and abstract.

541
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:21,451
Predator is the thing that lurks in the 
unknown that always confronts us now 

542
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:25,921
because people are strange and complex 
creatures and because we're partly 

543
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:30,690
predators and partly prey animals,
we don't only conceptualize the thing 

544
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,090
that lurks in the unknown as a,
as a devouring predator.

545
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:39,150
We also conceptualize it as something 
that offers possibility it because we've

546
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:43,060
learned that if we go into the unknown,
we can find things that we need for,

547
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,100
for,
for now and for the medium and for the 

548
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,041
long term.
It can be beneficial for us to confront 

549
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,070
the things that we don't know.
And that's human beings.

550
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:53,050
In a nutshell.
That's what we do,

551
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,330
and so that's the basis,
that's the,

552
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,360
that's why I believe that's the most 
archetypal story because it 

553
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,051
fundamentally characterizes our motive 
being in the world where information 

554
00:32:04,051 --> 00:32:04,810
foragers,
we'd go out into the unknown,

555
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:08,050
that terrifying unknown and we gather 
things of value.

556
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,160
It's not much different than squirrels 
foraging for nuts really,

557
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,850
you know,
it's,

558
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,860
it's,
and we use the exactly the same 

559
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,310
biological systems to go out and forage 
for information that squirrels use when 

560
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:25,171
they go out and forage for nuts.
So I guess the system developed in part 

561
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,290
because we were fruit eaters as well and
so we found trees that had fruit in them

562
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,430
and learn where they were and how to 
gather them.

563
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:40,490
And then you see a tight relationship 
there between and food,

564
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,850
right.
There's almost no difference between 

565
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:45,850
eating and knowing where the food is and
as soon as the.

566
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:50,841
So our systems of knowing where things 
are grew massively and so that turned us

567
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:53,240
into the kind of abstract creatures that
we are.

568
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,770
So we're always looking for ways of 
producing more of what we need.

569
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,950
That's a good way of thinking about it.
And we do that abstractly,

570
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:06,430
so alright,
so when you encounter something that's 

571
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,150
anomalous,
something unexpected,

572
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:13,750
so oh,
you're in a relationship that you're not

573
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,070
that happy about,
it's a good example,

574
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,060
and the person that you're with is 
suddenly much colder to you than usual.

575
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,150
Okay?
Now the question is,

576
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,730
is that good news or bad news?
And the answer is,

577
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:30,731
well,
it's good news in so far as you're not 

578
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:30,731
that happy with the relationship,
so it's.

579
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:34,430
And it's bad news in so far as you want 
the relationship to continue and so very

580
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:37,700
frequently it's the case that you're 
somewhat ambivalent about the frame that

581
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:38,450
you inhabit.

582
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,510
And so anomalous information has a 
twofold meaning.

583
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:42,050
It's like,
well,

584
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,240
now I can finally get out of this.
That's one way of thinking about it.

585
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:50,241
And,
and if the person is particularly cold 

586
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:50,241
and distant to you and maybe even 
insulting,

587
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:55,570
then half of you is going to be very 
upset because this is happening and the 

588
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,690
other half is roughly speaking,
is going to be saying,

589
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:58,760
oh,
this is just the opportunity I wanted.

590
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,790
And what that means is you're in your 
frame.

591
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,880
That constitutes the relationship.
Let's say in the story you've laid out 

592
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,781
about it,
that novel event occurs and it produces 

593
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:14,270
activation in two competing systems.
One is the positive system that explores

594
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:19,271
for new opportunities and the other is 
the threat system that paralyzes you 

595
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:23,180
because your current mode of 
conceptualization is no longer valid and

596
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:28,181
so it normally has this deeply 
ambivalent nature and one of the things 

597
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:33,641
that I've tried to understand for a long
time is how you compute that and it 

598
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:37,151
seems to be that you need to consider it
in relationship to this hierarchical 

599
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:39,710
value structure that we've talked about 
before.

600
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,710
So you might say that imagine your 
nervous system is tuned so that if 

601
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:48,620
anomalous things happen at high 
resolution levels,

602
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
you,
you produce a very small amount of 

603
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,050
negative emotion and a comparatively 
large amount of curiosity.

604
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,190
Because the thing that's being 
threatened by the anomalous event isn't 

605
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,360
that big.
And so the.

606
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,980
The possibility that information looks 
there.

607
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,870
That might be useful as high compared to
the threat.

608
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,440
Whereas generally speaking,
if you encounter something,

609
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,970
maybe you know,
maybe you go into a store one day and on

610
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:19,760
a whim,
you shoplift something.

611
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,650
In a fit of stupid impulsivity and you 
get caught at,

612
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,390
happened to,
uh,

613
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,650
there was an NDP member of parliament 20
years ago who did exactly that.

614
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:33,260
He only had a pretty good reputation.
He went into a department store,

615
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,360
swiped something,
some gloves or something.

616
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:37,740
I don't even remember what it was and 
caught.

617
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,490
It's like,
well,

618
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,780
you know,
that's sufficiently anomalous behavior 

619
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,030
to or occurrence to make you question 
whether or not you're actually a good 

620
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,050
person.
And so it's,

621
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,940
it's almost as if at the higher 
resolution levels of the value structure

622
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:55,941
of something anomalous occurs,
then it's either neutral or tilted 

623
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:59,901
slightly towards positive and at the 
higher levels and the more abstract and 

624
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,470
comprehensive levers.
If something anomalous happens,

625
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:06,670
then it,
it's more likely to blow out large 

626
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,171
portions of your,
of the systems you use to organize the 

627
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:12,681
world.
It's going to be experienced as 

628
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:12,681
negative.
And partly what you're trying to do when

629
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:16,281
something anomalous occurs is to do a 
search up and down this value of 

630
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:19,431
structure.
You have an argument with someone that 

631
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:19,431
you love,
well,

632
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:22,491
what does that mean?
Maybe you're arguing about how you 

633
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:23,520
interact with each other.
When one of you comes home,

634
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,730
you'd like a kiss and a hug at the door 
and they've just assumed sit there and 

635
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,330
watch tv,
so you have an argument about that.

636
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,710
Okay.
What is the argument mean?

637
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,950
Does it mean that some little thing has 
to be adjusted at the level of micro 

638
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,701
detail or does it mean you know the 
person that you've tangled up your life 

639
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:45,021
with really doesn't care for you at all 
and there's a complete jerk and you 

640
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:47,901
should leave?
While a big part of the argument is 

641
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:48,270
going to be how do we construe the 
occurrence?

642
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,500
How do we construe the occurrence?
Is it a major event or a minor event?

643
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:57,890
And my advice would be unless there's 
strong reason,

644
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,980
presume it's a minor event and start 
operating at that level because 

645
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,690
otherwise every argument becomes a 
catastrophe and if that's the case,

646
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,750
you actually can't solve any problems.
You won't be able to discuss anything.

647
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:14,751
Right?
Because as soon as you bring up an 

648
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:14,751
anomaly,
something unpleasant,

649
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:18,530
the other person,
we'll assume that everything's over and 

650
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,920
get so shorted out that you won't be 
able to talk with them.

651
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,120
So those are the sort of people who will
cry if you bring up anything negative.

652
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,420
Right?
And so they,

653
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,470
they're threatened by their,
their value might say their value 

654
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,470
structure,
so fragile,

655
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,360
highly constructed,
and maybe they're not standing on enough

656
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,970
pillars so that anything you tossed at 
them,

657
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:40,971
that's a question is enough to shake the
entire structure to its foundations or 

658
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:42,270
maybe they're acting that out just to 
manipulate you.

659
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:45,000
That's another option.
So in many ways,

660
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:50,001
partly what you seem to be doing when 
you're thinking about something is to 

661
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:54,890
shift your frames of reference up and 
down your value hierarchy to constrain 

662
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:59,451
the occurrence and to determine the 
degree to which it's positive and the 

663
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:03,621
degree to which it's negative.
It's also complicated too because 

664
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:07,490
whether something is positive or 
negative depends on the frame of 

665
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:07,710
reference that you bring to bear on it.
Right?

666
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:10,350
And so that's why I was saying earlier 
about the relationship.

667
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:15,351
If you're ambivalent about the 
relationship and something negative 

668
00:38:15,351 --> 00:38:15,351
happens,
you know something disruptive,

669
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,570
it's certainly possible to adopt a frame
of reference almost immediately that 

670
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,180
makes that into something positive.
You say,

671
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,860
well,
I'm was done with this anyways.

672
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,980
I'm glad you said that because it gives 
me the excuse I needed to terminate 

673
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,760
this,
and so it's such a.

674
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,780
it's a very strange thing that you can 
shift the emotional valence of almost 

675
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,890
anything,
almost anything.

676
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,160
By shifting your frame

677
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,630
of reference,
there are boundaries.

678
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,840
You can teach animals pleasure to 
electric shocks,

679
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,780
painful electric shocks if you pair them
reliably,

680
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,050
lead with the provision of something 
intensely rewarding cocaine,

681
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:52,960
for example,
or or hypothalamic stimulation,

682
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:57,640
they can learn to associate pain with 
something good and respond positively to

683
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:02,641
it to work for it.
So when you see this in you even a 

684
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:02,800
little bit,
some of you have no doubt.

685
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:06,490
Learn to eat foods that aren't really 
edible like all of us are a good example

686
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:07,990
of that,
or coffee.

687
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,740
They're bitter and generally speaking,
better.

688
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,090
Poisonous things tend to be bitter and 
people don't really like bitter things,

689
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,990
but if you train yourself you can get to
the point where I,

690
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,860
I taught my daughter how to eat olives 
when she was very young and I,

691
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,360
I bet her,
I think,

692
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,020
I think she was only three.
I better that she couldn't eat 20 all of

693
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,260
over the next week or something.

694
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,200
She'd always respond to a challenge and 
so,

695
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:33,490
you know,
the first three olives,

696
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:38,491
it was not a fun experience for her 
because it faced a kids have a lot of 

697
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:42,091
taste buds.
Her face would get all crinkled up and 

698
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:43,570
she just wasn't enjoying it now.
But I paid for that desperately later in

699
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:48,571
my life because I used to go to this 
specialty shop and buy these 

700
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:48,630
particularly good spicy olives,
you know,

701
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:53,850
by the court.
And if they were in the fridge she'd 

702
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:53,850
come home and just devoured the entire 
court.

703
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,130
Like a,
like a,

704
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,310
like a,
like I'm a mad believe mic.

705
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,520
I mean on all of us for God's sake.
And so then I never got any of them so 

706
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,520
it serves me.
Right,

707
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,260
exactly.
But the point is you can rewire yourself

708
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:09,580
quite completely by placing negative 
things in a positive context.

709
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,700
And the degree to which you can do that 
is quite remarkable.

710
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,590
You know,
you,

711
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,680
you can't.
There seems to be limits beyond which 

712
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,120
your ability to turn pain into pleasure,
for example,

713
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:20,550
is compromised.
Um,

714
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:25,890
I don't think anybody's ever going to 
learn how to associate being seriously 

715
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,220
burnt by something hot with something 
pleasurable,

716
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:27,700
right?
There's,

717
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,040
and I don't know how the system is 
exactly adjust themselves so that there 

718
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,390
are limits to,
you know,

719
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:38,580
how you can transform an emotional 
stimulus because you can transform them 

720
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,301
quite quite remarkably.
But obviously there's some boundaries 

721
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:43,030
that we don't understand very well.
So.

722
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,010
All right,
so no.

723
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:50,011
So roughly speaking,
we could say that the degree to which 

724
00:40:50,011 --> 00:40:53,101
something is experienced as utter chaos 
is proportionate to the level of the 

725
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:59,611
value hierarchy that that anomalous 
event is construed or experience to 

726
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:04,621
disrupt.
And you really see this happening and 

727
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:05,650
people who are depressed because you 
might think,

728
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,740
here's another way of thinking about it.

729
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,800
You might think,
well,

730
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,660
I'm,
am I a good cook?

731
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,670
You're asking yourself,
you fail.

732
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,110
At cooking something so you think,
well,

733
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,470
am I capable of completing a meal and 
you might say,

734
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:21,250
well,
if if all you've done is a set the table

735
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:26,251
badly,
probably the right thing to do is to 

736
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:29,161
learn how to set the table and not to 
question your ability to complete a 

737
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:30,820
meal.
So then you might say,

738
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:35,821
okay,
well when should you move up one level 

739
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:35,821
competence of one level of abstraction?
We might say,

740
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:39,350
well imagine there's five things that 
you need to do at this level in order to

741
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:43,160
successfully complete that level.
So you have to cut vegetables,

742
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:48,161
you have to set the table,
you have to do the dishes in order to 

743
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:48,950
complete a meal,
and so you break six dishes,

744
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,640
you burn the soup and I don't know,
but you sat the table property.

745
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,170
You got two out of three wrong,
or maybe at that point it started.

746
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,770
It's time to start wondering if you're 
actually capable of completing a meal,

747
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:09,370
but you don't want to jump from a single
mistake at the higher level to the to 

748
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:11,760
the or at the.
Sorry.

749
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,780
At the higher resolution level.
You don't want to jump from a single 

750
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,591
mistake at that level to the next level,
and the reason for that is that you'll 

751
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:20,591
get a cascade,
oh,

752
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:25,511
I set the table badly error.
That means I can't complete a meal 

753
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:29,890
error.
That means I can't take care of my 

754
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,410
family error.
That means I'm not a good parent error.

755
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,560
That means I'm not a good person.
That's what happens to depressed people 

756
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,790
and I think what happens is their 
serotonin levels fall right fall like,

757
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:45,610
like serotonin levels fall.
If you're brought down a dominance 

758
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,851
hierarchy,
now we already know that if you live at 

759
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:50,861
the bottom of the dominance hierarchy,
you live where it's dangerous and the 

760
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:53,390
reason for that is everything around you
is already not good and you don't have a

761
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:58,391
lot of social support,
so you're sort of clinging desperately 

762
00:42:58,391 --> 00:43:01,420
to the underside of life,
and what that means is you probably 

763
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,420
can't even afford a single mistake.

764
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,800
Your serotonin levels fall and that 
allows error signals to propagate up the

765
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:10,190
value system so that every little thing 
becomes a catastrophe.

766
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:15,340
Now that in itself is a catastrophe 
because if you're living at the bottom 

767
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,420
of the dominance hierarchy and you're 
already super stressed,

768
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:22,690
the additional stress that you're likely
to experience as a consequence of an 

769
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,620
additional error is going to be maybe 
push you over the limits,

770
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:27,740
but the thing is is that it is dangerous
there.

771
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,190
Now,
what seems to happen to people who are 

772
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,111
depressed is that their serotonin levels
fall roughly speaking as if they 

773
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:38,930
plummeted down a dominance hierarchy 
without have actually having plumbing to

774
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:42,800
download it,
so they're still competent,

775
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:44,600
capable,
ensconced in their,

776
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,910
in their relatively productive 
environment,

777
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:50,630
but they're reacting as if every little 
thing has become a catastrophe.

778
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:56,020
And so partly what happens is if you 
provide people with Serotonin reuptake 

779
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,951
inhibitors,
is that the propagation of negative 

780
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:02,951
emotion across these levels of value 
hierarchy seems to be reduced.

781
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,020
So maybe then it takes,
if it takes two errors at this level to 

782
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,741
trigger off an error message at that 
level while you're in a lot better 

783
00:44:11,741 --> 00:44:11,741
shape,
right?

784
00:44:11,741 --> 00:44:12,920
That's,
it's like a definition of resilience.

785
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,270
So now you can also do that with people 
cognitively to some degree.

786
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:22,271
You know,
because maybe somebody will come to you 

787
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:23,270
in therapy and say,
I had a bad day at work,

788
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,210
my boss hates me.
I'm going to lose my job,

789
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:27,890
and then my marriage is going to 
dissolve,

790
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,560
and so you walk them through it at a 
micro level.

791
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:34,270
Okay,
what exactly happened to you at work and

792
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,630
then they lay out the specific story.
You say,

793
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:38,640
well,
what are the multiple ways that might be

794
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:43,641
interpreted and is it,
is there some possibility that it's not 

795
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:44,760
the catastrophe that you're envisioning?
Right?

796
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:49,680
You get them to contextualize it and 
help them build out up micro defenses.

797
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:51,240
That might be one way of thinking about 
it.

798
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,420
A lot of people who are prone to 
depression are not good at defending 

799
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:56,420
themselves,
right?

800
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,771
They don't have at hand the mechanisms 
to forgive themselves or even really to 

801
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:03,660
understand their own failure or even 
more importantly sometimes

802
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,420
they unwrap,
likely underestimate.

803
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:12,570
They radically overestimate their own 
incompetence and radically overestimate 

804
00:45:12,581 --> 00:45:17,581
the competence of everyone else,
and so that's also another reason why 

805
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:20,260
it's sometimes useful for people to seek
therapy because they'll come in and say,

806
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:25,740
well,
I'm anxious and nervous and you know I 

807
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,590
have this amount of negative emotion and
I make these sorts of mistakes,

808
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,650
and you listen and you think,
yeah,

809
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,760
so does everybody else that that's par 
for the course,

810
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:39,060
but there are so isolated and so afraid 
of the things that have been happening 

811
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,081
to them and so unwilling to expose 
themselves to social evaluation that 

812
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:47,701
they never really communicate with 
anyone else and find out that the level 

813
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:52,441
of misery that characterized as their 
existence is pretty much normal and 

814
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:56,431
average,
and so just helping people learn that 

815
00:45:56,431 --> 00:45:59,740
can often be of tremendous advantage to 
the because the real issue isn't 

816
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,410
precisely whether or not you're a good 
person.

817
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,020
That's an absolute idea,
right?

818
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:05,740
You could say,
well,

819
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:08,230
are you good person compared to the 
absolute ideal?

820
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:11,950
And the answer to that is no,
but it's also not exactly.

821
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,580
It's not a useful comparison across most
situations.

822
00:46:15,581 --> 00:46:17,290
What you really want to know is,
well,

823
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,750
how do you stack up against other 
people?

824
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,290
You know,
if you're a.

825
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:26,730
If you're at your job,
the issue isn't whether or not you're 

826
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,731
competent.
The issue is whether you're competent 

827
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:32,550
compared to the other people around you 
who are supposed to be doing the same 

828
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,180
thing because in an absolute sense 
you're completely incompetent,

829
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,660
but in a relative sense,
you might be at the top of the pack or 

830
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:39,660
even in the middle,
and that's generally okay.

831
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:45,090
So,
and if you don't know what the relative 

832
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:45,090
status is,
that's not good at all.

833
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:49,380
So alright,
now if so,

834
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:53,860
here's a way of thinking about it.
Let's say

835
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,070
you're in a class,
it's near the beginning of the semester.

836
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,280
You write an exam or you handed in an 
essay and you don't get the mark that 

837
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,280
you desired.
Okay?

838
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,110
So what are your options?
Well,

839
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,290
one option would be,
so you've hit an anomaly.

840
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,840
Things didn't happen the way you wanted 
them to happen,

841
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,850
and so maybe you say,
Geez,

842
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,860
that was a boring and stupid class.
Anyways,

843
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:22,010
this gives me an excuse to get out.
And so that's not such a negative thing 

844
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,790
or you think,
oh well I really better buckle down and 

845
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,040
study and you decide to stay in the 
class.

846
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,830
So basically what you've done is 
maintained your framework.

847
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,420
I'm going to work through this class,
but you're,

848
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,240
you're,
you've decided to modify some of the sub

849
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:37,150
routines that make up that frame.
You say,

850
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:42,151
well I should study more next time or I 
have to prioritize this class compared 

851
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:45,781
to other classes.
So it's a micro alteration within the 

852
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:48,780
overarching framework.
But another thing you can do is say to 

853
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:50,890
hell with the class.
I just won't,

854
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:51,910
I'll just drop it.

855
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,970
And so the advantage to that is problem 
gone.

856
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:02,180
The disadvantages,
well now you have a different problem 

857
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:02,180
which is okay,
fine,

858
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,351
you drop the class,
do you have another class that you can 

859
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:08,571
replace it with?
Is that a good way of dealing with a 

860
00:48:08,571 --> 00:48:08,571
micro failure,
you know,

861
00:48:08,571 --> 00:48:13,161
to move up a level of analysis and 
throughout the whole frame because you 

862
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:17,301
could also say,
well maybe I should just drop out of 

863
00:48:17,301 --> 00:48:17,301
university and maybe I should go hang 
myself.

864
00:48:17,301 --> 00:48:17,960
You know,
that's.

865
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,590
Well,
it's the same line of logic,

866
00:48:19,591 --> 00:48:23,670
it's just taken up to a higher degree of
abstraction and so generally speaking,

867
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:29,060
you don't want to solve a problem by 
moving up a level in wiping out the 

868
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,980
frame within which the problem was 
experienced.

869
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,140
Do you want to do that carefully?
Because in principle,

870
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,260
the frame that you were working within 
had already,

871
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,050
you'd already assigned value to it and 
worked at it.

872
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:45,051
You've already invested in it.
It's a big sacrifice to blow out the 

873
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:45,300
whole frame.
Now sometimes you can do it.

874
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,880
So anyways,
what happens is,

875
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:52,881
well,
you get the bad grade and you're upset 

876
00:48:52,881 --> 00:48:56,001
about it,
and so you've been plunged from your 

877
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:56,430
happy,
satiated state,

878
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:59,040
let's say,
into a state of relative chaos,

879
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,050
and the chaos is,
oh,

880
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:06,590
I hit an obstacle,
I didn't expect it and now I don't know 

881
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:09,651
what to do,
and so what does it mean to not know 

882
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:09,651
what to do?
Well,

883
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:10,590
okay,

884
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:15,810
it can mean I need to study harder.
It can mean I should drop this course.

885
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:18,890
It can mean I should major in a 
different subject.

886
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,980
I mean maybe I shouldn't be in 
university.

887
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,730
It could mean maybe my future plans have
been formulated badly.

888
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:29,731
It can mean my future plans have been 
formulated badly because I don't 

889
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:31,870
understand myself very well and I've 
been telling lies about my past.

890
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,900
Right?
The thing can really expand on you and 

891
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,351
that's what the chaotic domain is.
That's the real manifestation of those 

892
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,650
things that you had considered 
irrelevant,

893
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,710
right?
Because when you go to pickup the exam,

894
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,850
you've got your identity as a competent 
student intact.

895
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:52,860
You're not questioning whether you 
should be in the course or whether you 

896
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,980
should be in that major or whether you 
should be in university.

897
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:59,010
None of that.
That's all in the implicitly accepted 

898
00:49:59,010 --> 00:49:59,790
category and as soon as the anomalous 
event,

899
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:03,160
he merges all of those things that you 
had rendered.

900
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,160
Axiomatic start to become questionable 
and that's like the shark coming up out,

901
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,650
coming up from the depths to pull you 
down.

902
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,610
And that's the classic way of of 
representing that and symbolizing it.

903
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,640
That's Jonah and the whale for example.
So it's something is manifested itself 

904
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,280
from the deep unknown and pulls you 
under like an alligator at a,

905
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:29,340
at a waterhole,
which is I'm sure one of the sources 

906
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,220
from which we derived that particular 
kind of mythological representation,

907
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:33,890
because you could imagine that when we 
were on the Velt,

908
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:39,130
after living on trees,
we had to go down to the dam waterholes 

909
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,310
and you've,
you've watched enough nature programs to

910
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:42,920
know what a denial crocodile can do to a
water buffalo.

911
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:46,250
It's not pretty.
And so to go down to the water,

912
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,400
the chaotic water and the source of all 
life as well,

913
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:54,430
right,
is to risk and encounter with the 

914
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:54,430
terrible thing that lurks in the depths.

915
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,300
And so we use that as a central metaphor
for,

916
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,600
for,
for mapping those sorts of things that 

917
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:01,820
have happened to us in a much more 
abstract space.

918
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,820
And you know that because one of the 
things you're going to do,

919
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,190
let's say that the,
the,

920
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:13,260
the professor,
there's a professor obviously who gave 

921
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,180
you the bad grade.
Okay?

922
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:19,181
So one logical presupposition is that 
you're in some sense insufficient in 

923
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:25,061
relationship to the course,
but another logical and instantaneous 

924
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:29,891
categorization is to throw that person 
into the category of malevolent 

925
00:51:29,891 --> 00:51:31,520
Predator.
And you'll do that by becoming upset and

926
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:35,840
cursing the person in your imagination.
Cursing is exactly right,

927
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:40,841
and I can tell you why,
so I don't know if I told you this or 

928
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:43,250
not,
but primates of various sorts.

929
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:46,580
Like vervet monkeys have Predator alarm 
cries.

930
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,800
They have one.
If you look across a vast array of 

931
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,100
predators are primates.

932
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,740
They have one for things that attack 
from the sky.

933
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,040
And so those would be predatory birds.
They have one for like cats that 

934
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,091
climbing into the trees to get you.
And that means hit the hit the little 

935
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:07,841
branches because the cat can't be out 
there and they have one for a things 

936
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:10,670
that Russell through the grass snakes 
for example.

937
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,210
And so each of those produces a 
distinctive alarm cry.

938
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,630
And so that's the same alarm.
That alarm Christ system is the same 

939
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:24,881
system that we use to swear with you 
short got her old words.

940
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,010
So they're archaic words because short 
words tend to be very,

941
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:33,011
very old and so that's,
and we have a separate system that 

942
00:52:33,011 --> 00:52:36,970
others,
those sorts of vocalizations and that's 

943
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:36,970
the system that's disinhibited and two 
reps,

944
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:42,070
which is why people with tourette swear.
And so when you curse the professor for 

945
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,020
giving you the bad grade,
you are using the same bloody linguistic

946
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:50,021
system that your ancestors used to 
categorize snakes in the grass or 

947
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:51,680
predators that sweep swooped down from 
the sky.

948
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,540
It's very,
very interesting.

949
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,060
So when people regard that,
it's quite rude,

950
00:52:56,061 --> 00:52:56,660
right?
If you,

951
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:00,860
if you swear at someone,
then they'll be taken aback by that they

952
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:04,370
considered insulting to be thrown into 
the arbitrary Predator category.

953
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:08,840
And so that also turns the world into a 
good versus evil story very rapidly with

954
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:11,330
the,
with the oppressive person who's judging

955
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:16,331
you,
playing the role of malevolent Predator 

956
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:19,451
and you playing the role of innocent,
innocent pray essentially very,

957
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:23,450
very easy for that to happen.
So,

958
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:27,870
okay,
so where's my little clicker?

959
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,400
So if the anomaly,
if you can't can,

960
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,310
you might say,
okay,

961
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:43,311
so you're thinking through the fact that
you didn't get a good mark on the exam 

962
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:45,620
and you think,
oh,

963
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:50,040
I don't know what I can do about that 
because I've already got six classes say

964
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,530
or seven.
Maybe you're overloaded,

965
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,770
you're working part time,
you're studying as hard as you can,

966
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,870
and so you try to do a micro

967
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,180
six,
rearranging your priorities,

968
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,480
concentrating more on your studies,
but maybe you're already operating at 

969
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,301
top capacity and it's not easy.
It's not straightforward for you to 

970
00:54:10,301 --> 00:54:14,471
calculate how you might reconstruct your
micro priority so the problem goes away.

971
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:20,020
So it's under those circumstances that 
it's reasonable to pop up one level of 

972
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:20,120
abstraction and to say,
okay,

973
00:54:20,121 --> 00:54:23,690
I have to give something up.
That's a sacrificial motifs.

974
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:26,570
I have to sacrifice something.
What's it going to be?

975
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Well,
maybe you can't afford to have the part 

976
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:31,700
time job even though that's going to put
you under financial stress.

977
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,880
Or maybe you have to hire a tutor even 
though that's going to put you under 

978
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,001
financial stress.
Or maybe you have to drop out of the 

979
00:54:40,001 --> 00:54:42,611
chorus and only takes six,
even though that's going to say delay 

980
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:43,400
your graduation for one semester.
They're gonna.

981
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:48,430
There's going to be costs,
but so what's happening when you're 

982
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,900
thrown into the chaotic state by the 
anomaly is that the problem space,

983
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:55,020
Matt magnifies itself and you have to do
a microanalysis,

984
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,750
which is the best place to start.

985
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,620
Let's look at fixing things that are 
subordinate to this frame,

986
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,650
but you may have to leap up a level or 
two and fix something.

987
00:55:03,651 --> 00:55:08,651
It's Super Ordinance,
so it may be the case that you failed 

988
00:55:08,651 --> 00:55:11,561
two classes and your parent,
one of your parents develops a very 

989
00:55:11,561 --> 00:55:12,290
fatal disease and so you have to go home
and take care of them.

990
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:12,920
It's like,
okay,

991
00:55:12,921 --> 00:55:14,480
fine.
Too much chaos.

992
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:16,610
Bang,
you're done with your university career.

993
00:55:16,611 --> 00:55:18,830
For now,
you have to go up a number of levels,

994
00:55:18,831 --> 00:55:23,030
blow apart that frame,
and that'll alleviate the problem.

995
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:28,031
Even though it by,
by letting all the snakes out of the 

996
00:55:28,031 --> 00:55:28,280
basket,
it causes all sorts of other problems.

997
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:29,300
You're going to have to think,
okay,

998
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:32,720
well what am I going to do instead?
What does this mean for my future and so

999
00:55:32,721 --> 00:55:34,730
forth,
so there's a cost.

1000
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,610
There's definite cost to moving up the 
abstraction hierarchy,

1001
00:55:37,611 --> 00:55:42,611
but the reason that a sufficient to 
normally put places you in chaos is 

1002
00:55:42,611 --> 00:55:47,501
because it makes all sorts of things 
that you've already considered alive 

1003
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:50,560
again,
and that can be extraordinarily chaotic 

1004
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,550
and so you,
the anomaly knocks you flat.

1005
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:57,550
You can sustain the frame anymore.
You plunge into a chaotic state and you 

1006
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:02,351
know your life.
Your whole life is a sequence of those 

1007
00:56:02,351 --> 00:56:02,840
things at a micro level and at a macro 
level,

1008
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,660
you know every time you encounter 
something you don't understand.

1009
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:11,000
You have to retool the framework of 
interpretation that you were using prior

1010
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:16,001
to encountering that.
Now sometimes it's just a small 

1011
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:16,310
modification,
like at least in principle when you were

1012
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:21,311
in a class and you're learning things,
you're undoing what you already knew and

1013
00:56:21,981 --> 00:56:24,400
reese and sewing back together 
constantly,

1014
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:28,210
but it's at a small enough level so that
maybe it only feels exhilarating,

1015
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:33,710
right?
You're releasing just enough novelty to 

1016
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:37,740
activate your exploratory systems 
because there's value in the 

1017
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,880
information,
but not enough to knock you flat and you

1018
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:44,881
know,
one of the things that's interesting 

1019
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:46,471
about the whole safe space phenomenon is
that people differ in the thresh hold 

1020
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,800
that they have with regards to the 
receipt of anomalous information.

1021
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,270
You know,
and and if you're,

1022
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:57,330
especially if you're a naive person and 
the sheltered person to be exposed to 

1023
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:01,291
anything that has a hint of real 
malevolence in it might be enough to 

1024
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:04,291
destabilize you quite badly and that's a
real problem if you're pursuing 

1025
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:08,610
education in history or literature 
because history and literature is 

1026
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:12,241
nothing but a sequence of absolute moral
catastrophes thrown at you one after the

1027
00:57:12,551 --> 00:57:17,551
other,
so you have to be pretty solid to be 

1028
00:57:17,551 --> 00:57:17,551
able to withstand that.

1029
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,760
So you collapsed from your stable state 
into an unstable state and that's where 

1030
00:57:28,891 --> 00:57:33,891
everything comes up to haunt you.
Now it can really be bad in a chaotic 

1031
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:37,620
state because this often also happens to
people who are depressed,

1032
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,800
but it can happen to people under normal
circumstances too.

1033
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:42,300
It's like,
well,

1034
00:57:42,301 --> 00:57:46,290
let's say you've been happily married or
you think you were happily married,

1035
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:49,350
and then one day you come home and your 
partner is gone.

1036
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,060
Well then what do you think?
Well,

1037
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:58,120
you think mlevel and Predator,
that's one thing you think useless.

1038
00:57:58,161 --> 00:58:00,080
You.
That's another thing.

1039
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:00,890
You think

1040
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,760
the past is unstable.
The president is unstable and the future

1041
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:07,710
is unstable.
That's another thing,

1042
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,540
but then things can really get out of 
hand.

1043
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:11,370
So then you're just in chaos,
let's say,

1044
00:58:11,371 --> 00:58:16,371
but then you start thinking at 3:00
in the morning about all the stupid 

1045
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:19,260
things you've done in your life that led
you to this point and that can just take

1046
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:24,261
you completely apart because you know,
if you go back over your past 

1047
00:58:24,261 --> 00:58:24,261
experiences,
your,

1048
00:58:24,261 --> 00:58:29,060
it's easy for you to remember because 
people do remember these things where 

1049
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:29,610
you made errors,
right?

1050
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,880
And maybe you're not torturing yourself 
to begin with about the specific errors 

1051
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,990
that you made in that relationship.
Although you probably will,

1052
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,190
you know,
you'll think,

1053
00:58:38,191 --> 00:58:39,150
oh well,
you know,

1054
00:58:39,151 --> 00:58:42,150
I kind of knew this was coming and then 
your mind will say,

1055
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:47,151
well,
you kind of knew when it started and 

1056
00:58:47,151 --> 00:58:47,151
then it'll tell you,
well,

1057
00:58:47,151 --> 00:58:48,540
maybe you should have done this back 
then and you actually knew it and you'll

1058
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:48,950
think,
yeah,

1059
00:58:48,951 --> 00:58:50,790
I actually did know it and I didn't do 
it.

1060
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:55,790
And then that'll trigger off a whole 
host of other memories about just 

1061
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:58,950
exactly what you knew and didn't act on 
and that'll trigger off a bunch of other

1062
00:58:58,951 --> 00:59:03,030
memories about stupid things that you've
made and mistakes that you've hidden and

1063
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:08,031
make you question just exactly what sort
of creature you are and why all your,

1064
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,870
how all your moral insufficiencies 
defined by yourself have led you to this

1065
00:59:12,871 --> 00:59:17,871
dismal state.
And there's very little difference 

1066
00:59:17,871 --> 00:59:20,151
between that and hell.
And so there's a mythology of the 

1067
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:20,151
underworld,
right?

1068
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:24,411
The underworld is partly a place of and,
and that's a place where people go when 

1069
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:29,051
things fall apart.
But part of that is there's a 

1070
00:59:29,051 --> 00:59:31,331
subdivision in chaos,
the tail and that subdivision is the 

1071
00:59:31,331 --> 00:59:34,781
place that you go.
When you take yourself apart because of 

1072
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:34,781
your recognition of your own moral 
failings,

1073
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:39,260
now that can be useful because maybe you
have some things to learn and likely you

1074
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:44,261
do,
but it can also be something that's so 

1075
00:59:44,261 --> 00:59:46,100
devastating that you just can't recover 
from so because you may conclude,

1076
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:51,101
well,
the reason my relationship collapsed 

1077
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:54,610
precipitously is because I'm so blind in
malevolent that there's absolutely no 

1078
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:59,141
hope for my recovery,
and you know sometimes that's actually 

1079
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:01,010
true,
so distinguishing you never know,

1080
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:01,370
right?

1081
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,940
Is when things happen to you that aren't
what you want or expect.

1082
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:08,330
It's an open question,
how much you're responsible for it.

1083
01:00:08,331 --> 01:00:13,331
Now,
a conscientious person under those 

1084
01:00:13,331 --> 01:00:13,400
circumstances,
we'll just take themselves apart because

1085
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:17,930
the conscientious person is liable to 
presume that if something bad happens to

1086
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:22,931
them,
it's because they did something wrong 

1087
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:23,870
and you can see that's useful.
If something bad happened to you because

1088
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:27,500
you did something wrong and you can 
learn what you did wrong and fix it,

1089
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,930
then the bad thing won't happen to you 
again.

1090
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,390
So Hooray.
It's a wonderful way of thinking,

1091
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,720
but it's very tricky because there is a 
random element to life and sometimes you

1092
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:42,971
get knocked flat by circumstances that 
are really beyond any reasonable 

1093
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:45,830
person's control and this happens to 
conscientious people.

1094
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:48,650
For example,
when they get laid off on mass at work,

1095
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,420
you know their company starts to fail.

1096
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:53,990
The thousand people are laid off sort of
arbitrarily.

1097
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:59,050
Some of those people are truly 
industrious and conscientious even 

1098
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:03,071
though there is very little relationship
between their work habits and the 

1099
01:01:03,071 --> 01:01:04,820
consequences for their job can 
continuity.

1100
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:10,030
They'll go home and brood about it and 
take themselves apart and those are the 

1101
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:13,511
people who end up catastrophic,
really depressed because they can't 

1102
01:01:13,511 --> 01:01:16,190
stand not being in a situation where 
they're functional and productive.

1103
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:19,340
So nasty.
So you know,

1104
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:19,940
it's,
it's a,

1105
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,790
it's a cognitive response that can be 
very useful,

1106
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:28,150
but it's actually only useful when it is
what you did that resulted in that end 

1107
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:33,130
and not merely the blind random forces 
of nature happening to focus on you.

1108
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,940
And that's also a problematic issue too 
because you know there's actually some 

1109
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:45,170
relief and concluding that it's your 
fault because the alternative is that it

1110
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:47,000
just happened,
right?

1111
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,240
And that means that there are whole 
swaths of terrible things that might 

1112
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,450
happen to you that are completely beyond
your control.

1113
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,460
So it's not like deciding that you 
weren't at fault leaves you in leaves,

1114
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:00,350
you sitting pretty.
It just says,

1115
01:02:00,351 --> 01:02:05,351
well,
you weren't brought to your knees 

1116
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:05,660
because of your own stupidity and 
malevolence.

1117
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:10,661
Instead you were brought to your knees 
by the absolute uncaring forces of 

1118
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:11,480
society and nature.
It's like,

1119
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:15,470
well,
that's not much of a constellation.

1120
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:20,530
I wouldn't say.
Although sometimes it's exactly the 

1121
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:20,530
right thing to conclude and

1122
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:25,040
it is part of,
I think being mature to understand that 

1123
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,401
you are prey to random forces and you 
need to be able to distinguish between 

1124
01:02:28,401 --> 01:02:31,350
when you're at fault from something and 
when something just happened to you.

1125
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:36,620
And I would also say that the right rule
of thumb is to start with the assumption

1126
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:41,811
that something just happened to you and 
only then start to investigate the 

1127
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:44,250
degree to which you had something to do 
with it.

1128
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,350
Situational analysis,
first,

1129
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,660
personal analysis.
Second,

1130
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,900
it's safer because if you start with the
first one,

1131
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,080
you'll take yourself apart morally,
continually.

1132
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:59,010
And that's very,
very,

1133
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,660
very,
very stressful.

1134
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,200
You should leave that for emergencies.
So okay,

1135
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:08,850
so down you are in chaos,
right?

1136
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,400
And so that's part of the classic human 
story.

1137
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:16,401
That classic human story is I was going 
from point a to point B and I wanted to 

1138
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:18,600
get to point b and here's how I did it.

1139
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,600
But then along the way something popped 
up unexpectedly and stopped me and it 

1140
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:27,000
threw me for a loop.
It,

1141
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:32,210
everything fell apart.
That's another metaphorical way of 

1142
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:35,541
representing it.
Everything fell apart and I didn't know 

1143
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:35,541
up from down,
right?

1144
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:40,460
I lost myself.
It was like I was wandering in a desert 

1145
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:44,750
and that it lasted for years.
And that's a situation where people are 

1146
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,740
also likely to turn into such things as 
alcohol and other drugs,

1147
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:51,950
alcohol,
particular to being a good one because 

1148
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,550
it suppresses anxiety and increases 
incentive reward,

1149
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:58,970
and so down there in a chaotic state,
you can medicate yourself and you'll be 

1150
01:03:58,970 --> 01:03:59,970
inclined to to you think,
well,

1151
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:01,680
there's no hope for the future.
For example,

1152
01:04:01,681 --> 01:04:05,130
I can't see any way out of this.
While under those circumstances,

1153
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:08,670
what else do you have to turn to?
So very.

1154
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:12,810
That's to be in the belly of the whale.
That's another way of thinking about it.

1155
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:16,380
You Remember in the Pinocchio Story,
that's where Japan Eto ended up,

1156
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:20,580
and that was because he had severed his 
relationship with the exploratory hero.

1157
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:22,950
That was.
That was Pinocchio,

1158
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:27,951
or lost the relationship.
You could call that an involuntary 

1159
01:04:30,651 --> 01:04:33,740
encountered with the dragon of chaos 
out.

1160
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,760
Really what it is is that,
and that's it's.

1161
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,860
It's your home happy and the Predator 
invades your layer.

1162
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:41,020
That's the story of

1163
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,640
the garden of Eden.
God,

1164
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:50,250
it's the story of the garden of Eden.
There's no place that's so safe that 

1165
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:50,670
there isn't a snake in it,
right?

1166
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
It's the fundamental story of mankind,
even God himself can't define a space so

1167
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:59,970
tightly and absolutely that a Predator 
can't.

1168
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,720
The Predator of the unknown can't make 
itself manifest within.

1169
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,340
Now,
I read a book here a while back

1170
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:13,160
on dragons was only a week or two ago.
I just found this book.

1171
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:16,470
It was published in 2002 and the,
Oh,

1172
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,250
it's an book.
It's flawed,

1173
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:21,160
but it's an interesting book.
I'll find the name of it for you,

1174
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:26,670
but they,
the person who wrote this book was very 

1175
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:30,721
interested in the fact that 
representations of dragons can be found 

1176
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:30,721
worldwide.
Really,

1177
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:34,120
like no matter where you go,
that representation seems to exist.

1178
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:37,090
It's the wings.
It's the winged legged serpent,

1179
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:41,320
and he was very interested in trying to 
puzzle out why and he had an interesting

1180
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,780
hypothesis and I do believe there's some
truth to it.

1181
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,320
He said like in the case of the vervet 
monkeys,

1182
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:50,770
that there were three class of predators
on tree dwelling primates,

1183
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:56,310
winged bodied like a cat,
because cats in particular like to eat 

1184
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:03,070
tree dwelling primates and snakes.
So you might think,

1185
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:06,880
well,
cats,

1186
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:13,050
birds of prey and predatory and snakes 
are all different,

1187
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,540
but then you might think,
well what do you mean by different?

1188
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:21,540
Exactly.
Because categories are constructed in 

1189
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,150
relationship to their functional 
significance.

1190
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,600
They're all the same if the categories,
things that eat you if you're not 

1191
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,141
careful,
and so there's absolutely no reason for 

1192
01:06:31,141 --> 01:06:34,141
human beings not to have produced a 
category that's an exemplar of things 

1193
01:06:34,141 --> 01:06:38,440
that eat you if you're not careful.
And so it's an amalgam snake,

1194
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:43,000
predatory cat,
predatory bird,

1195
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,690
winged serpent with lakes,
right?

1196
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,600
And often it has claws.
You see the clause on it,

1197
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:55,290
on this one are like telethons and 
they're often like that in dragon 

1198
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,230
representations or sometimes they're 
more like the claws of predators,

1199
01:06:59,231 --> 01:07:01,330
but the talent representation is quite 
common.

1200
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,810
Often like this one,
the thing has two legs,

1201
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:10,080
like a bird.
Not always because sometimes dragons 

1202
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:10,080
don't have any legs at all.
They're.

1203
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,610
They're mostly snakes with wings and 
sometimes they have four legs,

1204
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:18,090
but they often also have two legs and so
you think you need a representation of 

1205
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:20,230
Predator.

1206
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:25,350
You don't need a differentiated 
representation precisely of type of 

1207
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:25,350
Predator.
That would come second.

1208
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,970
You know,
it's like the kid who points out the cat

1209
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,940
little kid points at the cat walking 
down the street says doggy.

1210
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,370
It's like,
that's not a dog.

1211
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:33,940
It's like,
no,

1212
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:35,140
no,
that's not right.

1213
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:40,960
The child's use of dog isn't 
representation of dog.

1214
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:45,990
It's representation of four legged pedal
entity and cat is an exemplar of that 

1215
01:07:46,691 --> 01:07:51,691
category and so his dog and so it bunny 
rabbit for that matter and you might 

1216
01:07:51,691 --> 01:07:51,691
say,
well,

1217
01:07:51,691 --> 01:07:55,420
so that's the category of pet and it's a
perfectly reasonable category.

1218
01:07:55,421 --> 01:07:58,200
You could say you should differentiate 
it into bunny rabbit,

1219
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:03,210
dog and cat because there's important 
information lost in the low 

1220
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:07,591
representation representation of pet,
but there's a bloody useful information 

1221
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:12,751
conserved now,
so that's the wall garden and the dragon

1222
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:18,241
of chaos.
I'm going to tell you something 

1223
01:08:18,241 --> 01:08:18,241
interesting about genesis,
about the story in genesis.

1224
01:08:18,241 --> 01:08:19,280
This took me like 30 years to figure 
out.

1225
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:21,530
I could not figure it out for the 
longest period of time.

1226
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:27,010
It's a segue,
but it'll give you an idea of how these 

1227
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:27,260
things operate across vast spans of 
time,

1228
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,960
so in the,
in the garden of Eden,

1229
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,280
Adam and Eve,
right?

1230
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:36,080
The primordial human beings and there's 
a walled garden.

1231
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:38,600
That's paradise.
Paradise means walled garden.

1232
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:43,601
An Eden means well watered place and so 
there's this idea that the proper 

1233
01:08:43,601 --> 01:08:46,910
habitat of human beings is an amalgam of
social structure and now and nature,

1234
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,280
and that's exactly right because that's 
what we live in,

1235
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,480
right?
We live in a.

1236
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,680
We never live in nature and we never 
live in society.

1237
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,470
We live in an amalgam of society and 
nature.

1238
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,750
That's the human environment.
So it's a walled garden.

1239
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:05,290
All right,
and so it's a productive well-watered 

1240
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:05,360
place where we could thrive.

1241
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:10,390
It's safe,
and it's ruled over by a father figure 

1242
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:11,510
in this particular,
in this particular story,

1243
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:14,690
and that's like the.
You could think about that as the spirit

1244
01:09:14,691 --> 01:09:19,691
of civilization.
That's at least one way of considering 

1245
01:09:19,691 --> 01:09:22,391
it so well.
There's a snake in the garden and it's 

1246
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,030
there.
Unbeknownst to God,

1247
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:28,750
roughly speaking,
although he's.

1248
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:33,790
He knows everything,
so I guess he probably knows about the 

1249
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:35,981
snake to and he tells Adam and Eve not 
to interact with it and find and they 

1250
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,970
do,
and the snake wakes them up,

1251
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
right,
because when they interact with the 

1252
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,591
snake,
they're given a fruit that opens their 

1253
01:09:44,591 --> 01:09:45,950
eyes and makes them aware that they're 
naked and vulnerable and then dooms them

1254
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:49,130
to work well.
I'll tell you the whole story much later

1255
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,750
in the course,
but I want to give you an overview of it

1256
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:55,751
now,
but then there's this really strange 

1257
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:58,001
idea that developed over the course of 
the development of not only Christianity

1258
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:03,281
but Judaism and and a number of other 
religions that fed into the mainstream 

1259
01:10:03,281 --> 01:10:05,210
of Christian ideas including 
zoroastrianism.

1260
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:10,660
There's an idea that that emerged across
a very long period of time that the 

1261
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,890
snake in the garden was the same as 
Satan.

1262
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:17,910
The source of all evil,
and as I've been trying to figure out 

1263
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:21,041
for the longest period of time,
why in the world the manifestation of 

1264
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:22,700
what's essentially a representation of a
predator.

1265
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:27,500
So that's the snake and the snake is 
associated with trees.

1266
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,250
Well,
yes.

1267
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,310
The reason for that in all likelihood is
that we dwelt in trees,

1268
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:34,220
right,
and snakes like trees and they're around

1269
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:39,221
trees and they can climb trees and,
and the snake was a typical Predator on 

1270
01:10:39,221 --> 01:10:40,310
our,
on our ancient relatives,

1271
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:41,750
but.
And so that's fine.

1272
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:44,570
So you can see that that representation 
makes perfect sense.

1273
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,550
There's predators that lurk in the 
garden.

1274
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,920
Yes.
Obviously if you interact with them,

1275
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:50,150
they wake you up.
Well,

1276
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:53,480
they better wake you up because if they 
don't wake you up when you interact with

1277
01:10:53,481 --> 01:10:54,740
them,
then you get eaten.

1278
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:58,670
So it's probably just as well to wake up
even though there's painful consequences

1279
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:02,850
associated with becoming conscious.
And that manifests itself immediately in

1280
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,520
the story of,
of,

1281
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,260
of,
of Adam and eve,

1282
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:09,000
but then there's this weird association.
It's,

1283
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,110
it's very undeveloped in the biblical 
stories that,

1284
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,940
that,
that are part and parcel of this line of

1285
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:19,941
thinking.
It was more like a consequence of a 

1286
01:11:19,941 --> 01:11:20,130
cloud of mythological stories that 
surrounded it.

1287
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:25,460
But the reason for that I think is,
is that imagine that what human beings 

1288
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,660
we're trying to puzzle out was the 
nature of the Predator.

1289
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,030
Okay.
So on one level of analysis,

1290
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:33,240
the Predator is the thing that slinks 
along the ground and the threatens you,

1291
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:36,360
and also it's the thing that's your 
mortal enemy and that wakes you up.

1292
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:41,720
But then that's one conceptualization of
Predator and fair enough you can 

1293
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,830
identify it and you can take 
precautionary measures,

1294
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:49,070
but a better conceptualization of 
Predator might be where does it come 

1295
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:49,070
from?

1296
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:54,500
Let's say it's a snake,
while there's a layer of snake 

1297
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,301
somewhere.
And so if we want to get rid of the 

1298
01:11:57,301 --> 01:11:59,391
snake,
we shouldn't be conceptualizing it as a 

1299
01:11:59,391 --> 01:12:02,301
snake,
we should be conceptualizing it as one 

1300
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:04,920
manifestation of a layer of snakes.
And what we should do is go down,

1301
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:07,950
follow the damn snake,
wherever it goes and find it's layer and

1302
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:10,410
wipe out all of the snakes.
And that's,

1303
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,510
that's a more abstract representation,
right?

1304
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:15,750
It's not Predator anymore,
it's the source of predation.

1305
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:20,280
And so if you want to solve the Predator
problem permanently,

1306
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,180
you don't kill the snake,
you get rid of all the snakes.

1307
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,290
Okay?
So fine.

1308
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:30,350
So and people are pretty damn good at 
that and that's why you have stories of 

1309
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:33,980
people like St Patrick who chased all 
the snakes out of Ireland and all sorts 

1310
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:37,260
of saints were snake eradication saints 
and well,

1311
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,060
there's a variety of reasons for that.

1312
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,350
But then you might think,
okay,

1313
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,950
well the worst Predator is the layer of 
snakes,

1314
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,150
right?
But then you might think,

1315
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:50,151
well wait a minute,
the worst Predator isn't the layer of 

1316
01:12:50,151 --> 01:12:52,731
snakes.
Maybe the worst Predator is the enemies 

1317
01:12:52,731 --> 01:12:53,490
that come to attack us.
And those are human enemies.

1318
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:56,490
And so what we do is we defend ourselves
against the human enemies.

1319
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:59,270
We put walls around our cities,
we fortify our,

1320
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:02,040
our land,
and we defend ourselves against the evil

1321
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:06,270
that's lurking in other people's hearts.
And so that's like a higher order snake.

1322
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,580
And then we build these walls around us 
and what's inside gets larger and larger

1323
01:13:11,581 --> 01:13:14,640
and larger.
And then what happens is the snake start

1324
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:17,360
popping up inside the cities because you
know,

1325
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,960
we pushed all the.
We've,

1326
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:23,580
we've protected ourselves from all the 
evil that lurks outside,

1327
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,680
but we've now created a space where that
evil can manifest itself inside.

1328
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:33,860
So there's criminals inside the city and
there's people who want to bring you 

1329
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,350
down and there's malevolence within the 
city,

1330
01:13:34,351 --> 01:13:38,100
not only outside,
so then there's the problem of the snake

1331
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:41,910
that's closer to you,
and then there's the ultimate problem,

1332
01:13:41,911 --> 01:13:43,740
which is the snake that lives in your 
heart,

1333
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:49,730
right?
And that each individual's capacity for 

1334
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:52,191
evil,
and then now that was conceptualized as 

1335
01:13:52,191 --> 01:13:52,191
a transcendent spirit.
Right?

1336
01:13:52,191 --> 01:13:56,640
So that's the spirit of Satan who's the 
WHO's the adversary of the hero,

1337
01:13:57,150 --> 01:14:02,150
the adversary of the hero,
and that's why there's an association 

1338
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:05,391
between the snake in the garden.
And this is great series of mythologies 

1339
01:14:05,391 --> 01:14:09,441
about the existence of evil itself.
It's a consequence of our continued 

1340
01:14:09,441 --> 01:14:12,280
capacity to abstract.
We started using the Predator detection

1341
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,280
system to detect snakes and maybe no 
predatory cats and maybe birds of prey 

1342
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,810
and all that,
but that didn't solve the bloody problem

1343
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:25,260
because just because you hid from the 
predatory bird today didn't mean the 

1344
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,621
bloody thing wasn't going to be back 
tomorrow and tomorrow starts to matter 

1345
01:14:28,621 --> 01:14:29,950
as you get smarter,
and then once you're on that pathway and

1346
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:33,250
you starting to think about abstractly 
about the Predator,

1347
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,260
the nature of what constitutes the 
Predator starts to become because you're

1348
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:40,810
trying to solve that across all 
situations similar,

1349
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:47,250
it starts to become very much more 
abstract and it ends up being something 

1350
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:50,341
like a personality,
like an eternal personality and in the 

1351
01:14:50,341 --> 01:14:52,300
internal personality that has its effect
on everyone all the time.

1352
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:58,020
So and it's so.
It's so interesting to see those ideas 

1353
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,950
because they basically evolved.
People did not understand those ideas as

1354
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:01,300
they produced them.
Right?

1355
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:06,301
It was all put forward in a massive 
mythological context and in a rich story

1356
01:15:07,311 --> 01:15:10,630
context,
and the stories were as conscious as the

1357
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:15,631
information got.
It was never articulated past the level 

1358
01:15:15,631 --> 01:15:15,631
of story.

1359
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:19,440
So remarkable.
Absolutely remarkable.

1360
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,840
Okay,
so let's take a break for 15 minutes.

1361
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,980
Now we're going to make things 
complicated.

1362
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:32,810
So this I showed you this map before and
I wanted to.

1363
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:38,780
I produced this map because I,
I was trying to understand the 

1364
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:41,160
fundamental substructure of the 
mythological world.

1365
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:46,220
I think that's the right way of thinking
about it and I'm not claiming that this 

1366
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:50,061
is the only way it can be represented 
because I know full well that it can be 

1367
01:15:50,061 --> 01:15:51,690
represented other ways,
but it's a pretty good schema.

1368
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,440
And so the idea it maps onto.
Yeah,

1369
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:01,320
it maps onto this idea,
so you can imagine that when you're here

1370
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,140
you're unexplored territory.
Okay,

1371
01:16:04,141 --> 01:16:05,970
so explored territory.
You can.

1372
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:10,980
The explored territory in an archaic way
is the fires at the center,

1373
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:17,540
the campfire and the tribal boundary 
surrounds that space and that's safe 

1374
01:16:20,251 --> 01:16:21,450
space.
Okay,

1375
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:26,451
so it's a place in nature obviously 
within which there's a pyramid and 

1376
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:29,490
there's a fire at the center of the 
pyramid,

1377
01:16:29,491 --> 01:16:31,260
and the pyramid is the dominance 
hierarchy,

1378
01:16:31,261 --> 01:16:34,320
the social dominance hierarchy,
and that's where people live.

1379
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,960
That's the world.
And so you could say,

1380
01:16:36,961 --> 01:16:40,260
well that's circumscribes space where 
you understand.

1381
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:43,170
See,
it's the explored territory,

1382
01:16:43,171 --> 01:16:48,171
not only because you understand the 
natural world that prevails there and 

1383
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:58,190
the cumulative effort of all of your 
compatriots keeps all the terrible 

1384
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:02,211
animals at bay so it's actually safe 
from a natural perspective and you 

1385
01:17:02,211 --> 01:17:04,290
understand it,
so it's explored when you're there,

1386
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:08,820
you're safe and good things happen to 
you mostly and then not a but a,

1387
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:12,680
but it isn't just the natural space 
construed as the environment.

1388
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:17,681
It's the natural space construed of the 
relationship between you and all the 

1389
01:17:17,681 --> 01:17:19,370
other primates that inhabit that space,
which is also.

1390
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:24,500
It's so society obviously,
but it's also part of nature and so that

1391
01:17:25,221 --> 01:17:30,221
explored territory is your understanding
of the natural world and the social 

1392
01:17:34,431 --> 01:17:39,431
world,
but more importantly the concordance of 

1393
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:40,310
your understanding with what's happening
in that space.

1394
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,550
So like take this place,
for example,

1395
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:48,551
right now,
every one of you has expectations about 

1396
01:17:48,551 --> 01:17:51,791
what's going to happen in this classroom
and you bring those and their desires 

1397
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:54,800
actually did not merely expectations 
because it's goal directed and you bring

1398
01:17:54,801 --> 01:17:59,801
those with you into the classroom and as
long as what's happening is in 

1399
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:03,341
concordance with those desires,
then you're safe and calm and maybe at 

1400
01:18:03,341 --> 01:18:05,420
least mildly interested,
which would be the point,

1401
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,900
right?
So it's explored territory because what 

1402
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:14,591
you understand matches what's happening 
and that's a place and it's a place that

1403
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:19,691
you strive to be and you strive to 
maintain and maybe you even strive to 

1404
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:25,361
expand,
which which is a slightly different 

1405
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:25,361
thing,
but you certainly strive to maintain it.

1406
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:26,180
That's this,
that's one place.

1407
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:29,450
Then there's another place which is 
where you end up with that doesn't work,

1408
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,450
and you can think about that as well.

1409
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:34,490
You know in the lion king,
for example,

1410
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:39,550
when when Mufasa Mufasa brings Simba up 
to the top of pride rock just when the 

1411
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:48,221
sun is either rising or setting,
and so they're on top of the rock and 

1412
01:18:48,221 --> 01:18:52,121
the top of the rock is lit and they're 
sitting up the top in the light and 

1413
01:18:52,121 --> 01:18:56,981
Mufasa tells Simba that his territory is
everything that the light touches and 

1414
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:00,800
everything that the light touches is 
everything that you've understood.

1415
01:19:00,801 --> 01:19:05,801
It's everything that your capacity for 
illumination and enlightenment has 

1416
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:09,830
turned into a habitable space,
and so you're the king of that domain,

1417
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:12,320
right?
Especially in so far as you're guided by

1418
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:17,321
the light.
That's what that little scene meant and 

1419
01:19:17,321 --> 01:19:20,141
move fasa tells Simba not to go out 
beyond where the light has touched into 

1420
01:19:20,151 --> 01:19:24,110
the dark territories and that's where 
the elephant graveyard is in that story.

1421
01:19:24,111 --> 01:19:27,920
Right?
And move our Simba and Nala go out there

1422
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:30,290
because of course,
as soon as you tell a human being not to

1423
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:35,291
do something,
those little lions being human beings 

1424
01:19:35,291 --> 01:19:36,980
after all,
they immediately run off and do it,

1425
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:38,480
and that's an echo of the story.

1426
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,370
Say in in,
in Genesis,

1427
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:45,400
where God tells Adam and eve not to eat 
the apple and this the first thing they 

1428
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,220
immediately do because if you want 
someone not to do something,

1429
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:51,550
you first specify what it is that they 
shouldn't do and then give them some 

1430
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,170
sort of incomprehensible reason for why 
they shouldn't do it,

1431
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:56,630
and they'll just do it instantly because
that's what we're like,

1432
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:02,020
right?
That's the way the Catholics are 

1433
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,350
convinced that people suffer from 
original sin and it's a very intelligent

1434
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:06,590
way of looking at things.
Although it also has its problems.

1435
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:08,310
So anyways,
there's the.

1436
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:13,580
There's the known territory and then 
outside of that there's unknown 

1437
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,720
territory and those are the most 
fundamental elements of existence.

1438
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:20,721
There's the place you are when you know 
what's going on and there's the place 

1439
01:20:20,721 --> 01:20:24,561
you are when you don't know what's going
on and that can be mapped onto 

1440
01:20:24,561 --> 01:20:24,561
geographic territory.

1441
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:27,540
If you go on beyond the borders of your 
society,

1442
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:32,630
then you're in unknown territory,
but it can also be mapped conceptually 

1443
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:33,030
so that,
for example,

1444
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:37,800
we're all sitting in this room and 
someone leaps in with a weapon.

1445
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:43,740
It's like this was known territory a 
second ago and now it's not known 

1446
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:46,860
territory at all,
even though you'd say,

1447
01:20:46,861 --> 01:20:48,420
well,
many things have remained the same.

1448
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:48,930
It's like,
yeah,

1449
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:51,090
but all the relevant things have 
suddenly changed.

1450
01:20:51,091 --> 01:20:56,091
Right,
and so part of the way of 

1451
01:20:56,091 --> 01:20:57,711
conceptualizing that is that you can,
you can manifest a geographic 

1452
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:02,910
transformation by moving from genuine 
geographic,

1453
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:05,340
explored territory into genuine 
geographic,

1454
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:10,341
unexplored territory,
but you can do that in time as well 

1455
01:21:10,341 --> 01:21:14,300
because we exist in time as well as 
space and so a space that's stable and 

1456
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:19,470
unchanging can be transformed into 
something completely other than it is by

1457
01:21:19,471 --> 01:21:23,190
the movement forward of time so well.

1458
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:28,430
So why am I telling you that?
It's because we've mapped the idea of 

1459
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:37,820
the difference in space between the 
known and the unknown to the difference 

1460
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:42,360
in time between a place that works now 
at a place that no longer works,

1461
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,480
even though it's the same place.
It's the same thing.

1462
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,410
It's just extended across time.
All right,

1463
01:21:48,411 --> 01:21:53,411
and so that's order versus chaos and 
that's the chaos that can manifest 

1464
01:21:53,411 --> 01:21:58,011
itself within the order.
The thing that's represented in the Yin 

1465
01:21:58,011 --> 01:21:58,011
and Yang symbol,
right,

1466
01:21:58,011 --> 01:22:01,140
because you see the Black Paisley with 
the white and the White Paisley with the

1467
01:22:01,141 --> 01:22:06,141
black.in
that order can turn into chaos at a 

1468
01:22:06,141 --> 01:22:08,961
moment's notice and in the same way 
chaos can turn to order in a moments 

1469
01:22:08,961 --> 01:22:13,191
notice at a moment's notice,
and so we're trying to map the geography

1470
01:22:13,651 --> 01:22:15,240
onto the,
onto the APP,

1471
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:20,300
onto something that's more abstract and 
comprehensive and and and we do that 

1472
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:24,561
using conceptual schemes that we evolved
over vast spans of time and have just 

1473
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:31,131
moved up one level of obstruction,
known territory or what's exploring 

1474
01:22:31,131 --> 01:22:33,360
unknown territory or what's not 
explored.

1475
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:37,380
The trans transformation or the 
disillusion of one into the other,

1476
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:40,710
and then the reconstitution of that.
That's when an election does,

1477
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:42,000
right?
It's like,

1478
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:47,001
okay,
we have our leader who's the person at 

1479
01:22:47,001 --> 01:22:51,141
the top of the dominance hierarchy and 
defines the nature of this particular 

1480
01:22:51,141 --> 01:22:52,260
structure.
There's an election.

1481
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:55,860
It's regulated chaos.
No one knows what's going to happen.

1482
01:22:55,861 --> 01:22:58,290
It's the death of the old king.
Bang.

1483
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:03,440
We go into a chaotic state.
Everyone argues for awhile and then out 

1484
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,350
of that argument they produce a 
consensus and Poof,

1485
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:07,300
we're in a new state,
right?

1486
01:23:07,301 --> 01:23:08,830
That's the Metta story,
right?

1487
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:10,540
Order,
chaos order,

1488
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,240
but it's partial order,
chaos,

1489
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,760
reconstituted,
and revivified order.

1490
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,120
That's the thing is that this order is 
better than that order,

1491
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:23,650
so there's progress and that's partly 
why I think the idea of moral relativism

1492
01:23:23,651 --> 01:23:28,651
is wrong.
There's progress in moral order and it 

1493
01:23:28,651 --> 01:23:31,180
was defined property by piaget.
The new moral order does everything.

1494
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:36,181
The other boral,
the old moral order did and some 

1495
01:23:36,181 --> 01:23:36,880
additional things.
That's what constitutes progress.

1496
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:42,360
Now here's a,
here's a strange idea and we'll talk 

1497
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,660
about this more as we progress through 
the class.

1498
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:45,580
What's the ultimate in order?

1499
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:48,810
Well,
it's not there,

1500
01:23:48,811 --> 01:23:53,811
so obviously because it can collapse and
it's not this because it can collapse 

1501
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:56,680
and so then you think,
well,

1502
01:23:56,681 --> 01:23:58,960
there's no ultimate order even though 
there's progression,

1503
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,960
but then you have to move it up.
One level of abstraction.

1504
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:07,480
What's the ultimate order doing this 
willingness to do that?

1505
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:10,660
That's the ultimate order,
right?

1506
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:15,661
It's order at a different level of 
analysis and you can see that's what's 

1507
01:24:15,661 --> 01:24:18,280
represented in that idea.
That's what that idea means.

1508
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:23,050
That's the phoenix.
The Phoenix is something that lives ages

1509
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:28,051
and then allows itself to be consumed by
fire and then reemerge us and they 

1510
01:24:28,051 --> 01:24:32,610
pulled.
Phoenix gets old and Burns and the new 

1511
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:36,721
phoenix reemergence,
and so the real phoenix is the thing 

1512
01:24:36,721 --> 01:24:37,240
that's constant across those 
transformations.

1513
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:41,560
That's the union self.
That's what he meant.

1514
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:47,010
The self is the element of the psyche 
that remains intact across 

1515
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:48,580
transformations.
Yeah.

1516
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,760
Yeah.
It's a bloody amazing idea.

1517
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:55,300
That's for sure,
and you can think about that.

1518
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,730
That's why you haven't claimed,
for example,

1519
01:24:57,731 --> 01:25:02,731
in ion primarily that Christ was a 
symbol of the self that was his

1520
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,800
consequence of decades of meditation on 
the structure of Christianity because 

1521
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:16,590
it's the dying and resurrecting part of 
the psyche that remains constant across 

1522
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:20,870
the transformation.
So the ultimate order isn't to identify 

1523
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:26,281
with this.
That's your current state of being and 

1524
01:25:26,281 --> 01:25:27,820
it isn't identified with that because,
well,

1525
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:32,500
you can't by definition and it isn't 
even to identify with that.

1526
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:36,460
It's to let these things go as they need
to go.

1527
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:41,520
That's a sacrifice and to allow this 
continual process of transformation to 

1528
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,261
occur,
and part of that is the admission that 

1529
01:25:46,261 --> 01:25:49,141
you're wrong,
and so partly what you're doing is at 

1530
01:25:49,141 --> 01:25:52,591
micro levels and macro levels where are 
you not what you could be and when you 

1531
01:25:53,321 --> 01:25:58,321
realize that it'll take you apart a 
little bit and burn you down to your 

1532
01:25:58,321 --> 01:26:01,000
core a little bit and then allow you to 
regenerate.

1533
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:05,360
And if you do that continually,
the everything that you don't need burns

1534
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:05,750
away.

1535
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:10,120
Right?
And that's what this means.

1536
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:16,400
You remember in Harry Potter,
you may remember that Harry goes down,

1537
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,760
so in the second volume and in the 
second movie,

1538
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:25,480
Harry's at Harvard,
so it's the school where you learn how 

1539
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:25,480
to be magic because that's what you 
really are,

1540
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,530
and there's something that threatens the
school.

1541
01:26:27,531 --> 01:26:29,390
Well,
part of what threatens the school.

1542
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:30,890
Evil,
right?

1543
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:32,210
Voldemort.
That's one thing,

1544
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:37,480
but at the same time,
it's also the snake that lurks 

1545
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,821
underneath.
It's the basilisk that threatens the 

1546
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:40,850
school,
and so the Basilisk is the dragon,

1547
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:45,851
and when the bassline looks at you,
then you're paralyzed because you're a 

1548
01:26:45,851 --> 01:26:48,380
prey animal and if a Predator captures 
you in its gaze,

1549
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:53,950
you freeze,
and the reason you freeze is because 

1550
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:56,111
your body reacts to the Predator as 
something that should turn you to stone.

1551
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:00,000
Sorry about that.

1552
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,640
So what do you do about the basilisk?
Well,

1553
01:27:05,641 --> 01:27:10,641
one thing you do is you run and hide,
but the other thing you do is go 

1554
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:12,600
confronted and it slayer and that's what
Harry Potter does now.

1555
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:15,780
And what's interesting about him is he's
also touched by evil,

1556
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:20,810
right?
And that means that he's an embodiment 

1557
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:23,421
of what you would regard as someone 
who's integrated the shadow and without 

1558
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:25,530
that capacity isn't able to communicate,
say with snakes.

1559
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,170
And that's not so good because since 
there are snakes,

1560
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,260
it's not such a bad idea to know how to 
communicate with them and he goes down 

1561
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:37,281
into the underground,
right into the chaotic domain that's 

1562
01:27:37,281 --> 01:27:37,920
underneath the school in order to find 
the snake.

1563
01:27:37,921 --> 01:27:38,790
And it's layer.
Now,

1564
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:41,490
if I remember correctly,
you can you tell me if I'm wrong,

1565
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,880
it doesn't really go down through a 
bathroom through a toilet.

1566
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:45,720
Right?

1567
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:50,750
Well,
so that's an indication of the union 

1568
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:53,120
dictum that where are you,
what you most what you need most is to 

1569
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,741
be found where you least want to look.
I had a client once who actually had a 

1570
01:27:57,741 --> 01:28:01,221
dream like that.
He dreamt that he had to go into the 

1571
01:28:01,221 --> 01:28:02,390
underground world through an outhouse.
Right.

1572
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:07,640
Was very,
very interesting and it was an 

1573
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,010
elaboration of precisely this theme.
It's what you've thrown away as of 

1574
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:13,971
little value to you and maybe what you 
hate and hold in contempt and fear is 

1575
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:18,651
exactly what you have to face if you 
want to go down to the place where the 

1576
01:28:18,651 --> 01:28:19,920
transformations occur.
So what happens in Harry Potter,

1577
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:25,220
while this Bass licks his wandering 
around paralyzing everyone who isn't 

1578
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:28,110
able to communicate with snakes and he 
doesn't fight the bast list precisely.

1579
01:28:28,111 --> 01:28:30,600
He goes down into its layers,
the underground world,

1580
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:35,660
and that what what down there is that 
snake has got a generic Vra,

1581
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:37,320
right?
His girlfriend,

1582
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:38,220
that's her name,
right?

1583
01:28:38,221 --> 01:28:39,000
It's a,
it's a,

1584
01:28:39,001 --> 01:28:44,001
it's a variant of Virginia that's a 
variant of virgin and the snake always 

1585
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:45,270
has a virgin.
That's one of its characteristics,

1586
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,590
right?
Like gold.

1587
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:49,320
He goes down there to rescue her.
What happens to him?

1588
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,820
He gets bit and he's going to die.
So what happens?

1589
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:58,710
The Phoenix comes along and cries tears 
into his wounds and charism,

1590
01:28:59,330 --> 01:28:59,990
and that's

1591
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:07,090
so the idea is that what saves you in 
the encounter with the snake is your 

1592
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:11,750
capacity to let things go and die and 
come back to life.

1593
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:12,590
Right.

1594
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:16,460
It's so interesting a that,
that,

1595
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:21,290
that story is told in that way,
in that series of volumes because the,

1596
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,310
the,
the,

1597
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:27,400
the,
the plot structure is perfect in a 

1598
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:27,950
mythological sense.
It's exactly right.

1599
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:32,090
And the Phoenix APP actually happens to 
be the pat of the main wizard,

1600
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:34,280
which is also perfect.
It's exactly right.

1601
01:29:34,281 --> 01:29:36,320
So you know,
what's his name now?

1602
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:37,790
Who?
Dumbledore.

1603
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:38,750
Yeah.
He's basically,

1604
01:29:38,751 --> 01:29:42,230
for all intents and purposes,
God the father and his pat,

1605
01:29:42,231 --> 01:29:43,130
his,
his,

1606
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:47,480
his close ally is the thing that can die
and that transforms.

1607
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,840
Well.
You can see the echoes of Christian 

1608
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:52,840
thought in that,
but that isn't exactly right.

1609
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:57,470
It's the Christian thought and the 
mythological substructure upon which the

1610
01:29:57,471 --> 01:30:02,471
Harry Potter volume is based,
are drawing from the same underlying 

1611
01:30:02,471 --> 01:30:05,831
pool of ideas and symbols and they're 
universally accessible and you can tell 

1612
01:30:06,291 --> 01:30:11,291
that because if they weren't,
that book wouldn't have sold how many 

1613
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:14,651
million copies,
how many million copies did itself and 

1614
01:30:14,651 --> 01:30:17,981
the movies.
It's unbelievably overwhelmingly 

1615
01:30:17,981 --> 01:30:19,790
powerful.
She got kids to read 600 page books,

1616
01:30:19,791 --> 01:30:22,220
like multiple volumes lining up for 
them.

1617
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:27,170
You got to ask yourself why silly 
stories about magical orphans.

1618
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:28,160
It's like,
well,

1619
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:33,310
maybe not.
Maybe people aren't so stupid and 

1620
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:35,390
certainly if they happen to be reading 
relatively complex books,

1621
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:39,470
attributing that to stupidity seems to 
be rather counterproductive.

1622
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:52,390
Alright,
so that's the chaotic domain.

1623
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:56,420
Now we got to think about the chaotic 
domain for a minute.

1624
01:30:57,230 --> 01:31:02,230
The chaotic domain is where you don't 
know what's going to happen and anything

1625
01:31:02,241 --> 01:31:03,590
could happen.
Positive or negative,

1626
01:31:03,650 --> 01:31:08,650
anything can happen,
and so you can think about the chaotic 

1627
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:11,240
domain as the birthplace of order.
It's the place from which order emerges.

1628
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:12,280
Well,
it's,

1629
01:31:12,281 --> 01:31:13,790
it's,
it can in some sense.

1630
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:18,930
You remember what happens in Pinocchio,
so Pinocchio goes down into the depths 

1631
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:24,760
and the and then into the whale to 
rescue his father.

1632
01:31:24,761 --> 01:31:26,740
He goes to the most frightening place 
possible.

1633
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
He tests himself against it and he 
rescues his father and he brings him up 

1634
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,421
to the surface,
but the consequence of that is that he 

1635
01:31:36,421 --> 01:31:36,850
dies,
but what dies is the stupid puppet,

1636
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,750
and so the question is,
well,

1637
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:42,360
to the degree that you're a stupid 
puppet,

1638
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:47,630
are you willing to let that die?
And the answer to that is it depends on 

1639
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:52,221
the degree to which you're actually a 
stupid puppet because the more that's 

1640
01:31:52,221 --> 01:31:56,181
true,
the more of you has to die and it's not 

1641
01:31:56,181 --> 01:32:00,020
something trivial.
That's why these myths insist upon the 

1642
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:03,291
horror of the thing that lurks,
so to speak is that that death might be 

1643
01:32:03,291 --> 01:32:06,430
enough to actually kill you if you're 
not properly prepared for it.

1644
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,370
And that's what happens to people who 
are extraordinarily traumatized,

1645
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:14,371
for example.
It's like huge parts of them are killed 

1646
01:32:14,371 --> 01:32:14,890
and,
and they often don't recover.

1647
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:17,470
So it's no joke.
Well,

1648
01:32:17,471 --> 01:32:20,230
and then of course this is often acted 
out in the real world too,

1649
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:25,231
if you know this can happen on a 
psychological basis and so your own 

1650
01:32:25,231 --> 01:32:29,380
psychological experiences can be enough 
to radically disrupt and hurt you,

1651
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:34,620
but it can be worked out in the real 
world too because if you're wandering 

1652
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:37,771
around naively with your eyes closed and
you run into someone who's really 

1653
01:32:37,771 --> 01:32:41,401
psychopathic,
they'll take you apart and you'll have 

1654
01:32:41,401 --> 01:32:42,930
no defense against it whatsoever because
you're too blinded,

1655
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:47,940
naive,
and if you encounter someone like that 

1656
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:47,940
and they leave you in the ashes,
which they might,

1657
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,990
it certainly possible that you'll never 
recover from it.

1658
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:53,560
You just will not be able to handle the 
aftermath,

1659
01:32:53,561 --> 01:32:58,561
but also you won't be able to handle the
fact that something like that could 

1660
01:32:58,561 --> 01:33:01,861
actually happen,
and that's really the nature of of 

1661
01:33:01,861 --> 01:33:05,280
trauma.
You cannot believe that that could 

1662
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,040
actually happen and that's an encounter.
It's almost always,

1663
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:09,250
and this has been the case,
certainly be my clinical experience.

1664
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:14,920
What traumatizes people is malevolence.
It's not tragedy,

1665
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:18,580
although tragedy can traumatize people 
if it's severe enough,

1666
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,430
but generally no people can withstand 
tragedy.

1667
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:27,360
They are done in by real malevolence and
so sometimes it's the realization of 

1668
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:30,910
their own malevolence that does the men,
but when that isn't the case,

1669
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,660
they encounter someone who's out there 
in the world who's actually operating to

1670
01:33:34,661 --> 01:33:39,661
hurt them and so and if the person is 
psychopathic enough and this is actually

1671
01:33:39,911 --> 01:33:44,230
goes beyond pure psychopathy because at 
least the psychopath has the sense to be

1672
01:33:44,231 --> 01:33:45,160
self interested.

1673
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:50,370
You can go far farther than that where 
you're perfectly willing to hurt 

1674
01:33:50,370 --> 01:33:52,480
yourself as long as you hurt the other 
person at the same time and that's where

1675
01:33:52,481 --> 01:33:57,481
you go.
When you're doing something like 

1676
01:33:57,481 --> 01:33:59,071
conjuring up the idea that you might 
shoot up a school because those people 

1677
01:33:59,071 --> 01:34:00,190
always killed themselves at the end and 
you might think,

1678
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:05,191
well,
why don't they just save everyone a lot 

1679
01:34:05,191 --> 01:34:05,191
of trouble and killed themselves at the 
beginning?

1680
01:34:05,191 --> 01:34:05,830
Well,
that wouldn't exactly be the point.

1681
01:34:05,831 --> 01:34:09,460
What they what they want to say.
His life means nothing to me.

1682
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:14,730
Nothing,
but I'm perfectly willing to make as 

1683
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:16,330
many people as I possibly can suffer 
before I demonstrate that.

1684
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:20,620
And so that's a step past psychopathy,
and if you encounter that in someone,

1685
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:25,870
it's or in yourself,
that's going to be a deeply unsettling 

1686
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:29,281
experience.
An idea behind many of these stories is 

1687
01:34:29,281 --> 01:34:32,461
that you cannot figure out what to do 
about that before you haven't 

1688
01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:32,461
encountered like that.

1689
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,950
And if you think about that properly,
that's,

1690
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:38,890
that's as horrifying and experience as 
you could imagine,

1691
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,690
right?
It's precisely that.

1692
01:34:40,691 --> 01:34:43,060
It's as horrifying and experience as you
could imagine.

1693
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:48,610
So all right,
so back this chaos.

1694
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:53,611
This is the birthplace of things.
That's why often it's represented as 

1695
01:34:53,861 --> 01:34:58,010
feminine because feminine things are the
of things.

1696
01:34:58,011 --> 01:34:58,880
Now again,
you know,

1697
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:04,300
people are stuck with the necessity of 
interpreting their experience through 

1698
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:09,560
the biological platform of 
interpretation that they evolved.

1699
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,060
And so we could say,
well,

1700
01:35:11,061 --> 01:35:12,770
we,
we recognize feminine,

1701
01:35:12,771 --> 01:35:15,400
we recognize masculine,
we recognize parent,

1702
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:16,860
we recognize child,
and that's,

1703
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,110
that's ancient,
right?

1704
01:35:18,111 --> 01:35:23,111
That's as ancient as mammals.
And so those are fundamental social 

1705
01:35:23,111 --> 01:35:27,521
cognitive categories.
And we had to exploit those categories 

1706
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:29,180
to represent the world.
Beyond that,

1707
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:31,790
when we started to be able to represent 
the world beyond that,

1708
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,500
you as a,
just as a primate,

1709
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:37,400
like a chimpanzee or a tree dwelling 
primary to complex primate,

1710
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:39,410
almost all of their categories are 
social,

1711
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:40,940
cognitive,
right?

1712
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:45,970
Why?
Because they live in complex social 

1713
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:47,891
environments and there's a relationship 
between the size of the social 

1714
01:35:47,891 --> 01:35:49,790
environment that a primate inhabits and 
it's brain size.

1715
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:51,920
The bigger the brain,
the larger the environment,

1716
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,780
and you could think there's a loop 
there,

1717
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:55,700
right?
If your brain's too small,

1718
01:35:55,701 --> 01:36:00,701
you can't handle the larger environment,
so the environment grows and it selects 

1719
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:03,740
for people,
for creatures that are complex enough to

1720
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:08,741
compute the environment,
and then that gives us selective 

1721
01:36:08,741 --> 01:36:11,291
advantage to creatures that are acute it
or are sharp enough to compute the 

1722
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:14,500
environment and so there's more of them 
and it loops and the brain grows and and

1723
01:36:14,501 --> 01:36:17,270
it's not the only thing driving the 
evolution of the brain among primates,

1724
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:19,100
but it's.
It's a primary source.

1725
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:24,940
So we have those categories to begin 
with and then we have to view the world 

1726
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:27,350
as it manifests itself outside those 
primary categories.

1727
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:32,351
Through the lens of those categories,
and so what happens is we use the 

1728
01:36:32,351 --> 01:36:35,951
symbolism of of sex differentiation and 
the symbolism of parent child 

1729
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:41,291
relationships to to begin to account for
the manner in which the world manifests 

1730
01:36:41,811 --> 01:36:44,420
itself masculine.
Why?

1731
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:45,770
Well,
that's the patriarchy,

1732
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,420
chaos,
feminine.

1733
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:48,560
Why?
Well,

1734
01:36:48,561 --> 01:36:51,710
partly it's conceived of in opposition 
to the patriarchy,

1735
01:36:51,711 --> 01:36:54,920
but more importantly,
it's the thing from which order rises,

1736
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:58,700
so it's perfectly reasonable to consider
it feminine and then order again,

1737
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:00,260
and then the question is,
well,

1738
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:05,850
you have order,
father,

1739
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:07,530
chaos,
mother,

1740
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:10,980
and then you have this,
this transformational process.

1741
01:37:10,981 --> 01:37:15,981
Well,
that's the mythological hero and those 

1742
01:37:15,981 --> 01:37:15,981
are the three fundamental characters of 
mythology,

1743
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,740
individual culture,
nature,

1744
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:21,780
right?
It's the universal world,

1745
01:37:21,781 --> 01:37:24,780
and then that's differentiated.
Further positive individual,

1746
01:37:24,810 --> 01:37:26,270
negative,
individual heroin,

1747
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:29,310
adversary,
tyrant and wise king.

1748
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:35,790
The destructive element of nature and 
the creative element of nature and and 

1749
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:36,580
those are perfectly reasonable 
categories.

1750
01:37:36,581 --> 01:37:41,581
They,
they do a lovely job of actually 

1751
01:37:41,581 --> 01:37:45,540
representing how the world does manifest
itself to us in the domains that are 

1752
01:37:45,971 --> 01:37:50,971
permanent.
There's always a conscious observer 

1753
01:37:50,971 --> 01:37:50,971
who's ambivalent about the nature of the
world.

1754
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:55,830
There's always a social structure that's
half tyrannical and half order producing

1755
01:37:55,950 --> 01:38:00,120
and there's always the nature that gives
rise to everything and that destroys it.

1756
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:05,121
At the same time always it's permanent 
and so that's another reason it's so 

1757
01:38:05,821 --> 01:38:10,821
interesting.
That's another reason why the 

1758
01:38:10,821 --> 01:38:12,501
mythological representations or hyper 
real because they think what makes 

1759
01:38:13,351 --> 01:38:16,620
something real.
Let's say protons are real.

1760
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:21,270
Why?
Because at one level of analysis,

1761
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:23,310
every single thing is made out of 
protons,

1762
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:26,970
so you can use it as an explanatory 
tool.

1763
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,000
The concept,
you can use it as an explanatory tool 

1764
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,140
for every possible situation and it's 
true across all possible spans of time.

1765
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:39,350
Although protons do decay,
but it takes billions and billions of 

1766
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:40,110
years,
so real means works now.

1767
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:43,920
It works forever,
applies now and applies everywhere.

1768
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,040
Well,
that's exactly what this map means.

1769
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:52,100
It's that there's always an observer.
There's always a framework of 

1770
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,580
interpretation and there's always that 
which is being observed.

1771
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:57,630
There's always the the individual,
there's always the social environment,

1772
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:03,320
the dominance hierarchy,
and there's always the nature that 

1773
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:03,720
exists outside of that.
There's always the knower,

1774
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:06,240
the known and the unknown always.

1775
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:10,200
So then the question is,
well,

1776
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:15,201
how do those things interrelate while 
you differentiate them into their 

1777
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:17,580
positive and negative elements because 
there's always the positive and negative

1778
01:39:17,581 --> 01:39:22,581
element and then you tell stories about 
how the different categories interact 

1779
01:39:22,581 --> 01:39:24,780
and that's what the stories do and the 
more mythological the story,

1780
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:30,020
the more that underlying Schema is self 
evident in the,

1781
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:35,950
in the,
in the plot and you especially see that 

1782
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:39,111
I think in stories for children and 
maybe that's because children can't 

1783
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:44,820
understand stories unless they're 
archetipal like blatantly archetipal and

1784
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:45,840
that would make sense,
right?

1785
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:50,841
Because the stories have to appeal to 
the instinctive knowledge of the child 

1786
01:39:50,841 --> 01:39:52,230
or the child wouldn't be able to 
comprehend them.

1787
01:39:52,231 --> 01:39:57,231
And so I saw this quite dramatically 
with my own kids watching them watch 

1788
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:59,370
Disney movies.
For example.

1789
01:39:59,371 --> 01:40:04,290
My Son was absolutely obsessed with 
Pinocchio and particularly obsessed with

1790
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:09,291
the scene where Pinocchio and and his 
father are escaping from the whale and 

1791
01:40:09,291 --> 01:40:12,510
the whale turns into this sort of smoke 
belching locomotive thing that's chasing

1792
01:40:12,511 --> 01:40:13,170
them through the water.

1793
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:16,950
He would rewind that and watch it and 
rewind it and watch it and rewind it and

1794
01:40:16,951 --> 01:40:21,951
watch it like over and over and over.
You think what the hell's that kid up 

1795
01:40:21,951 --> 01:40:22,200
to?
Well,

1796
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,000
you know,
it took us what,

1797
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:27,270
six hours to do a brief run through 
through Pinocchio.

1798
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:32,271
Still by still.
There's a lot of information in that 

1799
01:40:32,271 --> 01:40:34,851
movie.
A tremendous amount of information and 

1800
01:40:34,851 --> 01:40:36,540
then with the kids trying to do is to 
incorporate it to,

1801
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:41,100
to understand it,
to embody it and that's all happening in

1802
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:43,620
some sense.
I would say unconsciously it's like it's

1803
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:47,400
unconscious in that he couldn't 
articulate what he was doing and neither

1804
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:52,401
could anyone else,
but that doesn't mean he wasn't doing 

1805
01:40:52,401 --> 01:40:53,710
something.
He was definitely something.

1806
01:40:53,711 --> 01:40:58,711
He was doing the same thing that enabled
my nephew to put on the night suit when 

1807
01:41:00,131 --> 01:41:03,520
he did that little night hat and the 
sword and figure out how to go after the

1808
01:41:03,521 --> 01:41:04,810
great dragon of chaos.

1809
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:08,920
And so I wanted to tell you a little bit
more about this idea of chaos.

1810
01:41:08,921 --> 01:41:13,921
So here's the Schema of have the 
architectural son and we'll get to why 

1811
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:19,740
it's masculine and not feminine,
and that's also taken me a long time to 

1812
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,420
crack because the women in this class 
have always asked me,

1813
01:41:22,421 --> 01:41:27,421
well,
the hero and mythological stories is 

1814
01:41:27,421 --> 01:41:27,421
male.
Where does that leave women?

1815
01:41:27,421 --> 01:41:28,620
And I never knew what to say about that 
exactly.

1816
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,880
You can look at sleeping beauty,
for example,

1817
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:35,470
that that that story and sleeping beauty
is raised rescued by a prince,

1818
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:39,310
and you can think of that prince at two 
levels of analysis simultaneously.

1819
01:41:39,311 --> 01:41:42,550
You can think about it as an actual mail
who plays that role,

1820
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:47,170
but you can also think about it as the 
exploratory and exploratory,

1821
01:41:47,171 --> 01:41:52,171
assertive and courageous part of the 
feminine psyche that's necessary to 

1822
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:57,360
bring unconsciousness up into 
consciousness and the story works 

1823
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,150
perfectly across both those levels of 
analysis.

1824
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:00,130
So,
so and that is.

1825
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:03,270
That is the classic way I would say,
of,

1826
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:06,730
of explaining this particular mode of 
representation,

1827
01:42:06,731 --> 01:42:09,790
but it came to my attention.
This was so interesting.

1828
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:12,280
This is.
This is what triggered this for me.

1829
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:15,670
Finally,
I was reading this book called a billion

1830
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:20,671
wicked thoughts that was written by a 
bunch of engineers at Google and they 

1831
01:42:20,671 --> 01:42:24,331
were looking at billions of search,
billions of google searches and you 

1832
01:42:25,031 --> 01:42:30,031
know,
there's no shortage of pornography on 

1833
01:42:30,031 --> 01:42:32,281
the Internet and it and there's much 
less by proportion than there was when 

1834
01:42:32,281 --> 01:42:35,881
the Internet was first invented and it's
so interesting because it actually 

1835
01:42:35,881 --> 01:42:39,361
turned out that one of the things that 
drove the development of the Internet 

1836
01:42:39,361 --> 01:42:43,561
and the technology was the proclivity of
young men to search out sexually 

1837
01:42:43,561 --> 01:42:47,971
provocative images.
That was what was at the forefront of 

1838
01:42:47,971 --> 01:42:48,250
the development of the nets.
Extraordinarily interesting.

1839
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:53,670
They were motivated to.
They were motivated to use it for that 

1840
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:55,750
purpose and that provided the platform 
from which it emerged.

1841
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,700
Amazing.
Anyways,

1842
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:03,630
the Google engineers looked at 
pornographic search processes and then 

1843
01:43:04,091 --> 01:43:09,091
segregated male searches from female 
searches and what they found was that 

1844
01:43:09,091 --> 01:43:10,360
the mail search scout images,
price surprise,

1845
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:12,430
no one,
no one considers that,

1846
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:14,170
you know,
particularly interesting.

1847
01:43:14,171 --> 01:43:17,740
But the female searched out literary 
representations of pornography.

1848
01:43:17,741 --> 01:43:22,741
It was written.
And so I can give you an example of 

1849
01:43:22,741 --> 01:43:23,140
that.
If you know about harlequin romances,

1850
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:26,080
does everybody still know about those?
Anybody not know about those?

1851
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:31,710
Okay,
well there are mass market romances and 

1852
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:33,390
have a very stereotypical type and 
they're.

1853
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:38,460
The original ones were pretty harmless 
in terms of no violence and no real 

1854
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:42,511
sexual contact con content,
but that was 40 years ago and they've 

1855
01:43:42,511 --> 01:43:47,131
differentiated tremendously and now 
there's hardcore harlequin romances and 

1856
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:50,050
with,
with particularly garish covers and then

1857
01:43:50,051 --> 01:43:55,051
there's the old more tame basic sexless 
and aggression list.

1858
01:43:55,811 --> 01:43:59,330
Romance is where everything is implied 
and not explicit,

1859
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,980
but the explicit ones exist.

1860
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:07,910
So they did a plot analysis of the 
typical pornographic female fantasy.

1861
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:10,490
Well,
and it was so.

1862
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:12,650
It's so comical because engineers did 
this.

1863
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:16,250
Social scientists would never do this 
because they'd be probably too concerned

1864
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:18,260
about the ethics of it or some damn 
thing,

1865
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,570
but engineers,
you know,

1866
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:24,580
they'll just plow ahead with no concern 
whatsoever for such things and they 

1867
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:26,720
actually discover things that way.
And so they,

1868
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:31,900
they discovered the basic plot of the 
female pornographic literary product and

1869
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:38,380
they identified.
So basically what happened was that a 

1870
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:42,310
innocent well meaning an attractive 
young woman encounters a male who's a 

1871
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:47,261
bit of a monster and the monster is five
types of classic male monster for all 

1872
01:44:47,261 --> 01:44:51,200
your males who want to know this is what
you can become a vampire.

1873
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:53,270
That's a good one.
We're a wolf,

1874
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:58,550
billionaire.
Pirate and surgeon.

1875
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:01,640
Okay.
So that's very interesting because.

1876
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:03,890
Well first of all there's a dominance 
thing.

1877
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,410
There's a.
Now you're actually blushing.

1878
01:45:06,411 --> 01:45:08,150
You know,
you're actually blushing about that.

1879
01:45:08,151 --> 01:45:09,380
That's very,
very funny.

1880
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:13,370
So sorry to point it out,
but it's so comical,

1881
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:14,230
you know.
Yeah,

1882
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,170
I know.
I know.

1883
01:45:15,171 --> 01:45:17,330
It's so funny.
I was reading this,

1884
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:19,520
I was reading this.
It was just cracking me up.

1885
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:20,600
I thought,
oh my God,

1886
01:45:20,601 --> 01:45:22,910
really?
Pirate Vampire,

1887
01:45:22,911 --> 01:45:26,390
all of that explains it.
What about all these damn vampire shows,

1888
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:30,140
right there are so popular online.
They're so popular on Netflix.

1889
01:45:30,141 --> 01:45:31,610
Oh yes.
And then there's the werewolf.

1890
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:34,250
There's nothing sexier than a werewolf 
apparently,

1891
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,590
but I mean,
so there's predatory dope.

1892
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:38,780
There's predatory dominance that's 
implicit in that,

1893
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:40,190
right?
With a billionaire,

1894
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:43,280
it's more abstract,
but clearly that's an indication of very

1895
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:45,770
high success in the male dominance 
hierarchy,

1896
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:50,771
so but there's this desire for 
aggression that's in that are real 

1897
01:45:50,771 --> 01:45:51,140
aggression,
right,

1898
01:45:51,230 --> 01:45:53,570
and it's not surprising to me,
to me at all,

1899
01:45:53,571 --> 01:45:58,571
it makes perfect sense,
but what about the basic plot is that 

1900
01:45:58,571 --> 01:46:02,981
the woman encounters this mysterious and
aggressive male and teams.

1901
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,530
That's the female hero myth as far as I 
can tell,

1902
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:14,120
it's beauty and the beast and so it's 
because,

1903
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:20,080
well,
there's no fun in taming someone who's 

1904
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,031
already tame and what makes you think 
you really want someone who's many 

1905
01:46:22,031 --> 01:46:22,100
anyways.
There's no interest in that.

1906
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:24,170
Plus when,
when,

1907
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:29,590
when chaos manifests itself,
what makes you think that someone team 

1908
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:33,881
is going to be good for anything and 
it's a real question and so that 

1909
01:46:33,881 --> 01:46:36,620
aggression is absolutely vital.
It's absolutely necessary,

1910
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:40,640
but because it's incredibly dangerous,
which of course it is,

1911
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:45,410
it has to be civilized and so what 
happens is that the archetypal female in

1912
01:46:45,411 --> 01:46:49,040
these pornographic romances,
seduces and tames,

1913
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:53,220
aggressive male,
and that's her encounter with chaos.

1914
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:54,480
Now it's more,
it's more,

1915
01:46:55,690 --> 01:47:00,690
of course females,
they're more complicated and that's 

1916
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:03,321
exactly how it is and it's no wonder 
because there their lives are more 

1917
01:47:03,321 --> 01:47:03,321
complicated,
but okay,

1918
01:47:03,321 --> 01:47:05,050
so back to this,
so.

1919
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:11,160
So this map isn't predicated on the 
beauty and beast story and I don't know 

1920
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:12,720
what to do about that at the moment,
but whatever.

1921
01:47:12,721 --> 01:47:17,721
We're going to go with this map for the 
time being because it's been the 

1922
01:47:17,721 --> 01:47:20,181
dominant one.
You have the archetypical son whose 

1923
01:47:20,181 --> 01:47:20,460
hero,
an adversary that's cane versus able,

1924
01:47:20,461 --> 01:47:25,461
for example,
a table versus cane hero versus 

1925
01:47:25,461 --> 01:47:29,100
adversary and then that that that Dyad,
that hostile brothers,

1926
01:47:29,101 --> 01:47:31,770
that's the Motif,
mythological motif that that lays out.

1927
01:47:31,771 --> 01:47:36,600
It's a very common mythological motif 
that's nested inside the social order of

1928
01:47:36,601 --> 01:47:41,601
order versus tyranny and that's nested 
inside the destruction and creation of 

1929
01:47:41,601 --> 01:47:46,221
nature.
And then all of that is nested inside 

1930
01:47:46,221 --> 01:47:49,250
the dragon of chaos.
And so it's interesting because you say 

1931
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:54,590
this is you have the the entity that 
knows and that's the hero,

1932
01:47:57,811 --> 01:48:02,811
and then you have the structure within 
which that entity is operating and then 

1933
01:48:02,811 --> 01:48:05,160
you have the unknown.
It's the sun,

1934
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:06,630
it's the father.
It's the mother,

1935
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:11,660
the mother stands for chaos,
but outside of that there's this 

1936
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:14,430
additional chaos that's paradoxical and 
you might say,

1937
01:48:14,431 --> 01:48:19,431
well,
why do you need to have two kinds of 

1938
01:48:19,431 --> 01:48:19,431
chaos?

1939
01:48:19,431 --> 01:48:21,610
And that's where things get ridiculously
complicated.

1940
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:27,680
The little or chaos is what's defined in
relationship to what you already know,

1941
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:32,860
so it's manageable in some sense.
It's that which combined with what you 

1942
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:37,181
already know can bring something forth 
that there's a sexual metaphor in that 

1943
01:48:37,181 --> 01:48:38,120
you take what you know.
You take something you don't know,

1944
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:43,270
you put them together.
This isn't enough to overwhelm this and 

1945
01:48:43,270 --> 01:48:46,751
this isn't enough to suppress this.
The two come together in a creative 

1946
01:48:46,751 --> 01:48:49,580
union and something new is born from it,
so that's the Holy Father,

1947
01:48:49,581 --> 01:48:52,250
the holy mother bang and the hero that 
emerges out of that.

1948
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:57,610
Okay,
but then there's the chaos that so 

1949
01:48:57,610 --> 01:48:59,411
overwhelming that it just demolishes 
everything and it's the ultimate source 

1950
01:48:59,411 --> 01:49:04,181
of what's known and what's unknown in 
relationship to what's known and the 

1951
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:09,250
knower itself,
and that's symbolized by this dragon of 

1952
01:49:10,081 --> 01:49:12,090
chaos,
and I'm going to show you another way of

1953
01:49:12,091 --> 01:49:16,740
thinking about it.
It's the most primordial of symbols.

1954
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:24,240
Here's the PSG and idea.
Child occupies a circumscribed domain of

1955
01:49:24,241 --> 01:49:29,241
knowledge.
The child applies that domain of 

1956
01:49:29,241 --> 01:49:29,520
knowledge to the world.
Generally that works.

1957
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:32,640
Sometimes it doesn't.
Something unexpected happens,

1958
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:38,480
okay,
and that that unexpected thing can be 

1959
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,600
different.
Cataclysmic significance.

1960
01:49:39,601 --> 01:49:44,601
Let's say if it's too overwhelming,
the child will just cry and then the 

1961
01:49:44,601 --> 01:49:45,990
parent comes in and fixes up the 
anomalous thing,

1962
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:50,380
but the child's and playing,
you know,

1963
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:55,410
pushes his food off the table or pushes 
the spoon off the table and watches it 

1964
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:59,041
fall and is playing and he's playing at 
the edge of order and chaos trying to 

1965
01:49:59,041 --> 01:50:03,930
expand his knowledge domains at the rate
that is most palatable to him.

1966
01:50:04,141 --> 01:50:04,600
We'll say,

1967
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:12,550
so what's happening precisely?
Well,

1968
01:50:12,551 --> 01:50:17,551
you can say that the child is in a 
specific place and is doing a specific 

1969
01:50:17,551 --> 01:50:21,031
thing with the specific outcome or you 
can generalize from that and you can 

1970
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:21,031
say,
well,

1971
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:24,781
the child is occupying a structured is 
occupying a structure,

1972
01:50:25,151 --> 01:50:30,151
a cognitive structure,
and there's that which is outside the 

1973
01:50:30,151 --> 01:50:31,660
cognitive structure and then you might 
say,

1974
01:50:31,661 --> 01:50:35,560
well how do you conceptualize that?
Which is outside the cognitive structure

1975
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:41,070
and now answer to that is you can't 
because it's outside the cognitive 

1976
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:44,161
structure,
but it still exists and so here's a way 

1977
01:50:44,161 --> 01:50:44,161
of conceptualizing it.

1978
01:50:47,530 --> 01:50:52,530
What's outside?
The cognitive structure is latent 

1979
01:50:52,530 --> 01:50:56,341
information.
It's a domain of latent information and 

1980
01:50:56,471 --> 01:51:00,100
information means in formation,
right?

1981
01:51:00,101 --> 01:51:03,160
And so what you're trying to do when you
go beyond your knowledge structure is to

1982
01:51:03,161 --> 01:51:08,161
look for new regularities in the 
environment that you can map and 

1983
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:09,310
incorporate them into your,
into your structure,

1984
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:15,060
but that that domain of and information,
that's chaos itself and that's what's 

1985
01:51:15,421 --> 01:51:18,850
symbolized by the dragon of chaos.
That's why its Predator,

1986
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:24,000
multidimensional Predator plus thing 
that holds treasure at the same time 

1987
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,990
because in order for us to guard 
ourselves,

1988
01:51:25,991 --> 01:51:30,991
here's a way of thinking about it.
In order for us to guard ourselves 

1989
01:51:30,991 --> 01:51:33,841
properly against the internal eternal 
existence of the absolute unknown,

1990
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:38,770
we had to conceptualize it first.
I can say absolute unknown.

1991
01:51:38,771 --> 01:51:39,320
It's like,
well,

1992
01:51:39,321 --> 01:51:44,321
car.
Do you think that's such a strange 

1993
01:51:44,321 --> 01:51:46,561
category?
It's the category of all things that 

1994
01:51:46,561 --> 01:51:46,561
have not yet been categorized.

1995
01:51:46,561 --> 01:51:49,780
It's like zero.
It's like the antithesis of zero.

1996
01:51:49,781 --> 01:51:52,690
It took people a long time to come up 
with the idea of zero.

1997
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:55,600
It's such,
it's the category that contains nothing.

1998
01:51:55,750 --> 01:52:00,750
Well,
what do you need a category like that 

1999
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:00,750
for well to do mathematics?
As it turns out,

2000
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:05,250
this category is the category of all 
things that have not yet been mastered 

2001
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:08,770
and your job is to be a master of the 
category of all things that have not yet

2002
01:52:08,771 --> 01:52:12,040
been mastered and you're not going to do
that until you can conceptualize it.

2003
01:52:12,041 --> 01:52:17,020
You conceptualize it with the gold 
hoarding,

2004
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:22,680
Metta Predator,
because that's your opponent and your 

2005
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,610
job is not to.
Your job is to know how to confront that

2006
01:52:24,611 --> 01:52:29,611
continually and to extract out from it 
what it holds is value and that's the 

2007
01:52:29,611 --> 01:52:32,320
permanent solution to the problem 
because it's never going to go away,

2008
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:32,650
right?

2009
01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:36,520
It's an eternal thing.
All you can do is master it the same way

2010
01:52:36,521 --> 01:52:41,521
that a surfer masters await you,
master it in the process of mastering 

2011
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:46,621
it.
There is no solution to the problem 

2012
01:52:46,621 --> 01:52:46,700
except the solution of continual 
mastery,

2013
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:51,080
and so that's what you are.
You're shaped transforming wizard.

2014
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:56,290
That's doing its best to keep up with 
the continual transformation of that 

2015
01:52:56,290 --> 01:52:59,981
which you do not yet understand,
and I think there's absolutely no 

2016
01:52:59,981 --> 01:53:03,491
difference between that by the way,
and this thing that women chase in their

2017
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:06,530
pornographic fantasies.
It's the same thing.

2018
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:08,460
It's the same thing,
the word wall,

2019
01:53:08,461 --> 01:53:10,310
so good example of that,
and the vampire,

2020
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:12,340
right?
There's,

2021
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:17,360
there's this capacity for what's normal 
to transform into something that's 

2022
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:21,041
extraordinarily aggressive and to 
manifest mastery as a consequence of 

2023
01:53:21,041 --> 01:53:24,581
that.
So it's the transforming spirit and it 

2024
01:53:24,581 --> 01:53:27,791
can transform itself and it without 
bound and certainly in directions that 

2025
01:53:27,791 --> 01:53:30,590
aren't socially acceptable.

2026
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:32,330
Let's say there's A.
There's a,

2027
01:53:32,331 --> 01:53:37,331
there's a line you want to be able to 
push and that's again why in in the 

2028
01:53:37,331 --> 01:53:37,331
Harry Potter stories,
Harry,

2029
01:53:37,490 --> 01:53:42,490
first of all is touched by evil and 
second is always breaking rules 

2030
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:42,490
constantly,
right?

2031
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:47,320
And he's the most favored.
So interesting because he's the most 

2032
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:49,070
favored of Dumbledore,
precisely because he knows when to break

2033
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:54,071
rules.
And so it's so interesting because 

2034
01:53:54,071 --> 01:53:54,071
double door,
of course,

2035
01:53:54,071 --> 01:53:57,371
is the spirit of,
let's call it the patriarchy for all 

2036
01:53:57,371 --> 01:54:00,461
intents and purposes,
and his favorite is that child that 

2037
01:54:00,461 --> 01:54:03,290
refer refuses to abide by the rules of 
the patriarchy,

2038
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:05,690
but only under the proper circumstances,
right?

2039
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:10,760
You don't sacrifice the old rule unless 
you have a reason for doing so.

2040
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:16,600
The thing you're doing has to be better 
than the thing that you would be 

2041
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,920
compelled to do by the old rule.
And then you have to dare to do it.

2042
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:19,850
And you'd say,
well,

2043
01:54:19,851 --> 01:54:22,670
you're not going to do that unless 
you're already touched to some degree by

2044
01:54:22,671 --> 01:54:26,000
the spirit of the snake.
And that's exactly right.

2045
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:28,490
See,

2046
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:34,940
okay,
here's another way of thinking about it.

2047
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:41,450
The winged reptile is a thing of the 
earth and a thing of the sky.

2048
01:54:41,451 --> 01:54:45,230
So you could think about it as a thing 
of matter and to thing of spirit.

2049
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,210
Okay?
So then the question is,

2050
01:54:47,211 --> 01:54:48,620
well,
what exactly does that mean?

2051
01:54:48,621 --> 01:54:51,560
It's a symbol of the union of spirit and
matter.

2052
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,690
Okay,
so what's matter?

2053
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:55,430
Well,
the world,

2054
01:54:55,790 --> 01:54:58,190
but it isn't just the world.
It's also what matters.

2055
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,070
And what spirit?
Well,

2056
01:55:01,071 --> 01:55:06,020
it's the thing that flies free of the 
material world that's above the ground,

2057
01:55:06,021 --> 01:55:11,021
that's,
that's in the theoretical space that's 

2058
01:55:11,021 --> 01:55:11,021
up in heaven,
but it's also whatever it is in us,

2059
01:55:11,021 --> 01:55:12,980
that psyche or spirit,
okay,

2060
01:55:12,981 --> 01:55:13,940
so then you might say,
well,

2061
01:55:13,941 --> 01:55:15,320
what's the origin of that

2062
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:17,750
chaos?

2063
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:23,960
And we can actually,
I don't want to put that out as a 

2064
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:26,331
metaphysical proposition.
I want to put it out as an extension of 

2065
01:55:26,331 --> 01:55:26,760
what we've been saying.
So the child,

2066
01:55:27,570 --> 01:55:32,570
the child bootstraps itself up from 
nothing roughly speaking right through 

2067
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:37,011
its developmental process is the merges,
has a fully fledged nervous system and 

2068
01:55:37,011 --> 01:55:40,650
it produces cognitive structures within 
which it exists and views the world.

2069
01:55:40,651 --> 01:55:45,651
But there's something outside of the 
cognitive structures and that's this 

2070
01:55:45,651 --> 01:55:49,101
latent information will say,
well then we could say that latent 

2071
01:55:49,101 --> 01:55:50,970
information is properly conceptualized 
as matter and spirit.

2072
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:53,610
Why?
Because when you investigate it,

2073
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:58,670
when you interact with it,
you parse it into the world and into 

2074
01:55:58,670 --> 01:56:03,081
you.
That's what it means to be informed by 

2075
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:03,570
your contact with the unknown.
It informs you.

2076
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:06,930
It makes you more than you are,
and so it's like your extra.

2077
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:11,340
That's the resource you're extracting 
from the absolute unknown.

2078
01:56:11,341 --> 01:56:14,190
It's the information that allows you to 
reconstitute your being.

2079
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:17,910
At the same time you differentiate your 
knowledge of the world,

2080
01:56:18,210 --> 01:56:23,210
so matter emerges from the latent 
information and what matters and you 

2081
01:56:23,791 --> 01:56:25,920
emerge from the latent information in 
this,

2082
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:30,180
this dialogical process that involves 
your continual exploration.

2083
01:56:30,181 --> 01:56:31,920
You build yourself and you build the 
world,

2084
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:36,540
and so the dragon of chaos,
the wing dragon of chaos that guards the

2085
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:40,830
gold is the latest information that when
you explore,

2086
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:43,440
enables you to build yourself and to 
differentiate the world.

2087
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,280
I'll tell you a story,
Dan.

2088
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:46,650
This.

2089
01:56:49,970 --> 01:56:53,690
This is one of the great stories of 
mankind and it's not.

2090
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:56,270
This isn't the only variant of this 
story.

2091
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:58,610
There's many variants of it,
but,

2092
01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:03,820
but this variant is useful for,
for our purposes.

2093
01:57:05,410 --> 01:57:07,810
That's a story I stumbled across a long 
time ago.

2094
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:13,150
I'm going to tell you the second story 
first because I don't have the energy to

2095
01:57:13,151 --> 01:57:18,151
tell you the first story.
So this is a story that the ancient 

2096
01:57:18,151 --> 01:57:21,940
Egyptians predicated their society on.
And to understand this story,

2097
01:57:21,941 --> 01:57:26,941
the first thing you have to know is what
the characters were in these characters 

2098
01:57:26,941 --> 01:57:26,941
were gods.
There's four of them.

2099
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:30,010
Although the Egyptians had far more than
four gods.

2100
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:35,310
You might think of these as the central 
Gods and you might think what is the 

2101
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:36,520
central God?
And then you might think,

2102
01:57:36,521 --> 01:57:41,521
well,
imagine that the gods compete for 

2103
01:57:41,521 --> 01:57:43,201
dominance across time in people's 
imaginations and some gods when they 

2104
01:57:44,921 --> 01:57:48,100
occupied the primary position of 
dominance in the hierarchy,

2105
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:53,280
in the dominance hierarchy of gods.
And those are ideals and ideals compete 

2106
01:57:53,650 --> 01:57:56,470
across time for dominance and their 
embodied.

2107
01:57:56,860 --> 01:58:00,340
And so when diverse tribal people come 
together,

2108
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:04,900
they throw all their gods into the ring 
and they fight across time and something

2109
01:58:04,901 --> 01:58:09,901
emerges as a victor.
And that's the emergence of monotheism 

2110
01:58:09,901 --> 01:58:13,621
out of polytheism.
And it parallels the development of a 

2111
01:58:13,851 --> 01:58:18,851
unified morality in within each of us as
we develop across time and the the god 

2112
01:58:24,131 --> 01:58:27,850
that emerges as dominant across time 
bears a substantial,

2113
01:58:27,851 --> 01:58:30,190
represent a substantial

2114
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:36,460
resemblance.
Imagine you have a set of gods in this 

2115
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:37,430
locale that are competing across time 
and something emerges as dominant,

2116
01:58:37,670 --> 01:58:40,970
and then over here you have another set 
of gods that compete across time,

2117
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:46,110
dominance and something emerges.
You'll see major commonalities across 

2118
01:58:46,110 --> 01:58:48,940
the two things that emerge and the 
reason for that is because the emergent,

2119
01:58:49,070 --> 01:58:54,070
the process of emergence that gives rise
to both of them is similar in both 

2120
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:55,390
situations,
and that's part of what accounts for the

2121
01:58:55,391 --> 01:59:00,391
cross cultural similarity of high order 
religious ideas.

2122
01:59:01,370 --> 01:59:02,380
All right.
Anyways,

2123
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:04,690
you need to know the characters.
Oh,

2124
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:09,780
Cyrus Cyrus is the old king.
He's Dumbledore.

2125
01:59:11,051 --> 01:59:13,180
For all intents and purposes,
he's the old king.

2126
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:18,660
He's the.
He's the spirit that established the 

2127
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:19,000
Egyptian state.
When he was young,

2128
01:59:19,001 --> 01:59:22,300
he was a great hero,
but now he's old and he's willing.

2129
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:26,010
He's archaic and he's willfully blind.
That's Cyrus.

2130
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:31,800
He has a brother Seth.
Seth is set and set is Satan because the

2131
01:59:32,651 --> 01:59:37,540
word Satan comes from the word Seth and 
set via the Coptic Christians.

2132
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:38,830
So,
so.

2133
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:42,610
So he's a precursor to the western idea 
of Satan.

2134
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:46,720
You have isis.
Isis is queen of the underworld,

2135
01:59:46,721 --> 01:59:51,721
and Isis was the goddess of a religious 
structure that prevailed across 

2136
01:59:53,831 --> 01:59:58,300
thousands and thousands of years.
Isis and you have horace.

2137
01:59:58,750 --> 02:00:01,990
Horace is a Falcon,
and the Egyptian,

2138
02:00:01,991 --> 02:00:06,991
I.
everyone's knows that I write with the 

2139
02:00:06,991 --> 02:00:07,150
open pupil.
That's horace.

2140
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:10,840
And Horace is a falcon because falcons 
can see way better.

2141
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:15,900
They can see better than us.
They can see better than anything else 

2142
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:16,090
except for perhaps eagles.
And they fly above everything.

2143
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:20,410
Zazu in lion king is horace,
right?

2144
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:25,440
And [inaudible] Fossa is Cyrus and scar 
is seth.

2145
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:32,280
And there's no specific representation 
of Isis,

2146
02:00:32,281 --> 02:00:36,780
but the closest there is in that story 
is probably the queen of the hyenas.

2147
02:00:36,781 --> 02:00:39,510
That's played by a,
the actress.

2148
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,020
Um Hm.
Yes.

2149
02:00:43,021 --> 02:00:44,370
Whoopi Goldberg.
That's right.

2150
02:00:44,371 --> 02:00:45,220
That's right.
Because she.

2151
02:00:45,450 --> 02:00:48,120
They inhabit.
She's like the queen of the underworld,

2152
02:00:48,121 --> 02:00:53,121
right?
She's the queen of the hyenas that live 

2153
02:00:53,121 --> 02:00:53,121
out in among the death.
But okay.

2154
02:00:53,121 --> 02:00:56,070
Anyways,
Seth Osiris,

2155
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:56,940
seth,

2156
02:00:58,890 --> 02:01:00,120
Isis,
and horace.

2157
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:03,380
Here's how the story goes.
Well,

2158
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:06,210
cirrus is a great cake.
He established the Egyptian state.

2159
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,880
You could think about him as the 
embodiment of the,

2160
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:13,940
of Egyptian custom and tradition.
You can think about a as the thing that 

2161
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:15,090
the pyramid represents.
All right,

2162
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:18,240
but he was great when he was young,
but he's not young anymore.

2163
02:01:18,241 --> 02:01:23,241
He's old and he's willfully blind,
and what that means is that he doesn't 

2164
02:01:23,241 --> 02:01:25,320
see what he could see.
He refuses to see what he could see.

2165
02:01:25,470 --> 02:01:26,240
Why is,
oh,

2166
02:01:26,241 --> 02:01:29,580
cirrus old and willfully blind because 
that's what culture is.

2167
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:35,300
It's a paternal spirit that's old and 
willfully blind and it's always that 

2168
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:35,310
way,
always that way,

2169
02:01:35,311 --> 02:01:38,100
and the reason for that is because it's 
a construction of the dad.

2170
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:40,220
The Dad aren't alive,
they can't,

2171
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:44,120
so they're out of date.
They can't update themselves anymore and

2172
02:01:44,121 --> 02:01:49,121
you inhabit their corpse and that's 
actually what happens in an earlier 

2173
02:01:49,121 --> 02:01:52,211
story that I'll tell you next week,
that early Mesopotamian gods inhabited 

2174
02:01:52,281 --> 02:01:55,680
the corpse of their father,
roughly speaking anyway.

2175
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:56,410
So,
oh,

2176
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:59,990
Cyrus was great and when he was young,
but he wasn't young anymore.

2177
02:01:59,991 --> 02:02:04,991
He's old and he's willfully blind.
He won't look where he knows he should 

2178
02:02:04,991 --> 02:02:08,291
look.
He doesn't have the energy or maybe he 

2179
02:02:08,291 --> 02:02:10,091
doesn't have the spirit.
His brother Seth is not a good guy and 

2180
02:02:10,091 --> 02:02:14,871
no cyrus knows it,
but he underestimates his malevolence 

2181
02:02:14,871 --> 02:02:15,830
and power,
and so seth wants to rule the kingdom.

2182
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:18,020
So what does that mean?
It's easy.

2183
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:23,170
Every stable society is,
is threatened by willful blindness and 

2184
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:27,980
malevolence always.
Every bureaucracy has that proclivity to

2185
02:02:27,981 --> 02:02:32,981
stagnate and to become blind.
That's why corporations die all the 

2186
02:02:32,981 --> 02:02:36,791
time.
That's why a fortune 500 company only 

2187
02:02:36,791 --> 02:02:37,730
last 30 years.
It's why we have to have elections.

2188
02:02:37,731 --> 02:02:41,600
It's to stop the Dad from staying in 
control for too long.

2189
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:47,680
Seth Cyrus turns a blind eye to seth.
Seth is happy about that same thing 

2190
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,710
happens in the lion king,
roughly speaking.

2191
02:02:49,130 --> 02:02:52,730
Seth one day waits for a cyrus to make a
mistake and to be weak,

2192
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:58,000
and he attacks him and he chops it up 
into pieces and he distributed to the 

2193
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,020
pieces across the entire Egyptian state.
In fact,

2194
02:03:00,021 --> 02:03:03,260
the Egyptians regarded their provinces 
as pieces of,

2195
02:03:03,261 --> 02:03:04,400
oh,
Cyrus's body.

2196
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:10,240
Okay,
so now you can kill or cyrus because 

2197
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:10,700
he's a god.
And why is he god a God?

2198
02:03:10,701 --> 02:03:15,530
Because he represents the spirit of 
structure and there's always structure.

2199
02:03:15,531 --> 02:03:18,530
It can't be destroyed.
It always reconstitutes itself.

2200
02:03:18,531 --> 02:03:23,531
It can be hurt and broken into pieces,
which is exactly what happens to a 

2201
02:03:23,531 --> 02:03:24,440
cyrus.
Things fall apart.

2202
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:29,800
Why?
Because they get old and because 

2203
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,220
malevolence undermines them.
That's what the Egyptians were trying to

2204
02:03:31,221 --> 02:03:32,120
sort out.
Okay,

2205
02:03:32,121 --> 02:03:34,710
so seth distributes is.
Oh,

2206
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:38,540
cyrus all over Egypt.
So he can't get himself back together.

2207
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:44,380
Right?
Things fall apart and they can't be 

2208
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:44,380
brought back together.

2209
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:44,930
But the spirit of Vocera still lives in 
the pieces.

2210
02:03:45,290 --> 02:03:47,900
So what happens?
Orders demolished.

2211
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:50,420
What would you expect?
Chaos emerges.

2212
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:53,660
That's isis.
Isis is queen of the underworld.

2213
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:57,740
She's Cyrus's wife,
order and chaos.

2214
02:03:57,741 --> 02:04:00,980
Just like the Yin and the Yang order 
collapses.

2215
02:04:00,981 --> 02:04:04,310
Up comes the queen of the underworld.
She's looking for order.

2216
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:06,950
Chaos cries out for order.
She's looking for order.

2217
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:09,920
She goes all around Egypt trying to put 
our.

2218
02:04:09,921 --> 02:04:13,220
So Cyrus back together.
It's a state of chaos.

2219
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:16,580
She finds this fellas.
She makes herself pregnant with it.

2220
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:18,620
And what does that mean?
Well,

2221
02:04:18,621 --> 02:04:22,610
it means it's like it's like Japan in 
the belly of the whale.

2222
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:26,240
That thing has the potential to reemerge
this.

2223
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:28,880
The thing that collapses into its 
pieces,

2224
02:04:28,881 --> 02:04:33,881
it's still alive.
It can unite with the chaos and produce 

2225
02:04:33,881 --> 02:04:38,261
something new.
That's the story of the disillusion of 

2226
02:04:38,261 --> 02:04:39,330
structure into chaos and then it's 
reverification.

2227
02:04:40,930 --> 02:04:43,680
Isis makes herself pregnant.
She goes back down to the underworld.

2228
02:04:43,681 --> 02:04:47,600
She gives birth to horace.
Horace is the Egyptian I show.

2229
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:50,610
He's the son of the great father and the
great mother.

2230
02:04:50,611 --> 02:04:52,050
He's a.
he's a mess.

2231
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:53,490
Cyanic figure,
and in fact,

2232
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:58,730
much of the mythology that described 
horace was extracted without much 

2233
02:04:59,251 --> 02:05:01,920
modification and then attributed to 
Christ.

2234
02:05:01,921 --> 02:05:04,560
Very much memory and you can read about 
the parallels.

2235
02:05:04,570 --> 02:05:09,570
You read about it online if you want.
There's any number of parallels and of 

2236
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:12,060
course there is a mythology that the 
Jews came out of Egypt and of course the

2237
02:05:12,061 --> 02:05:17,061
Christians emerged from the juice and so
there was a tremendous influence of 

2238
02:05:17,061 --> 02:05:20,751
Egyptian thinking on the development of 
these later ideas and you see pictures 

2239
02:05:20,751 --> 02:05:25,431
of Isis with horace on her lap that are 
virtually identical in content and form 

2240
02:05:25,431 --> 02:05:28,170
to the later pictures of Mary with the 
infant Christ.

2241
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:31,140
But that's the holy mother of God in the
hero.

2242
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:35,070
It's not a Christian motif,
it's far deeper than a Christian motif.

2243
02:05:35,071 --> 02:05:37,530
It's a human motif,
so isis,

2244
02:05:37,531 --> 02:05:40,500
queen of the underworld gives birth to 
horace,

2245
02:05:40,501 --> 02:05:44,580
and horace grows up outside the kingdom.
Why in underworld?

2246
02:05:44,790 --> 02:05:49,790
Because that's what human beings do.
You're alienated from your culture 

2247
02:05:49,790 --> 02:05:52,590
always why?
It's old and dead and corrupt,

2248
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:55,200
and so that leaves you growing up in 
chaos.

2249
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:58,830
What would you call alienated from your 
fundamental culture?

2250
02:05:59,430 --> 02:06:02,970
That's the story of adolescence.
Horace grows up.

2251
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:05,990
He can see that's what differentiates 
them from,

2252
02:06:05,991 --> 02:06:06,530
oh,
Cyrus,

2253
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:09,840
that's why he's a falcon.
He goes and has a fight with seth,

2254
02:06:09,841 --> 02:06:14,841
and now the difference between Osiris 
and Horus is that horse does not 

2255
02:06:14,841 --> 02:06:16,290
underestimate seth.
He knows exactly what he's up against.

2256
02:06:16,330 --> 02:06:19,860
He goes and has a terrible battle with 
him trying to get his kingdom back.

2257
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:24,980
Something else that's echoed in the lion
king story and well horus and or seth or

2258
02:06:26,191 --> 02:06:28,740
fighting seth terrorists out one of his 
eyes.

2259
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:30,300
Now,
why?

2260
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:34,380
Because Seth is the embodiment of 
destruction and malevolence,

2261
02:06:34,381 --> 02:06:38,760
and no matter how conscious you are,
if you encounter that even voluntarily,

2262
02:06:38,761 --> 02:06:43,761
the probability that it's going to 
damage your consciousness is 

2263
02:06:43,761 --> 02:06:46,170
extraordinarily high.
That's white people don't do it,

2264
02:06:47,190 --> 02:06:52,190
so the eyes torn out,
but seth is defeated and Horace banishes

2265
02:06:52,501 --> 02:06:54,270
him to the nether regions of the 
kingdom.

2266
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:56,280
You can't kill them.
Why?

2267
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:00,750
Because the malevolent destructive 
forest to threatened states never dies.

2268
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:05,670
It's always there.
You can only remove it temporarily.

2269
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:08,850
Now,
horace is King Pharaoh,

2270
02:07:08,910 --> 02:07:12,150
King God.
He's got his eyes and so you think,

2271
02:07:12,151 --> 02:07:17,151
well,
he's going to just pop that back in his 

2272
02:07:17,151 --> 02:07:17,151
hand and then he's going to be able to 
lead.

2273
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:20,280
He's going to be able to take his place 
at the upper most pantheon,

2274
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:24,870
pantheon of gods properly,
but that isn't what he does.

2275
02:07:25,650 --> 02:07:28,440
He takes his eye and he goes back to the
underworld.

2276
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:33,890
Just like Pinocchio,
going into the depths to rescue Japan 

2277
02:07:33,890 --> 02:07:34,200
Eto and down there is the spirit of 
Cyrus who's,

2278
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:37,690
who's extend as a kind of half dad 
ghost.

2279
02:07:40,170 --> 02:07:40,870
It gives us.
Oh,

2280
02:07:40,910 --> 02:07:44,770
Cyrus's,
I now will cyrus can see.

2281
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:49,990
So what does that mean?
You go down into the chaotic,

2282
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:55,230
when threatened by malevolence,
even to the point of damage to your 

2283
02:07:55,781 --> 02:08:00,781
consciousness.
You go down into the chaos and you find 

2284
02:08:00,781 --> 02:08:04,231
the dead spirit of your tradition and 
you give it vision and so provided with 

2285
02:08:06,041 --> 02:08:11,041
vision or Cyrus regenerates and then 
Osiris and horus go back up to to to the

2286
02:08:11,321 --> 02:08:16,321
world linked together and rule jointly,
and the Egyptians believed that the 

2287
02:08:18,881 --> 02:08:23,881
Pharaoh who had an immortal spirit was 
the embodiment of the conjunction of 

2288
02:08:24,371 --> 02:08:27,700
Horus and Osiris,
and that's what gave him sovereignty.

2289
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:30,460
So you think about how brilliant that 
is.

2290
02:08:30,461 --> 02:08:33,520
The Egyptians are trying to puzzle out 
who should lead,

2291
02:08:34,090 --> 02:08:36,190
who should be pharaoh and what do you 
have to be?

2292
02:08:36,191 --> 02:08:38,620
If you're going to be pharaoh in order 
for things to work,

2293
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:45,030
you have to be awake to malevolence and 
chaos and you have to embody your 

2294
02:08:46,481 --> 02:08:51,481
tradition and that puts you at the 
highest pinnacle of the dominant 

2295
02:08:51,481 --> 02:08:51,670
structure.

2296
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:55,720
It's and that's the same as.
It's the same thing.

2297
02:08:56,020 --> 02:09:01,020
It's the same thing as the battle 
between the gods across centuries or 

2298
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:05,290
Ian's and the emergence of the highest 
possible moral virtue.

2299
02:09:05,291 --> 02:09:10,291
As a consequence of that competition,
it's the eye on the top of the pyramid,

2300
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:12,430
right?
It's,

2301
02:09:12,690 --> 02:09:15,040
you know,
in the Washington monument there's a cap

2302
02:09:15,041 --> 02:09:17,490
on the Washington monument,
the protopic,

2303
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:20,680
The Washington monument is a pyramid.
At the top of the pyramid is a cap.

2304
02:09:20,681 --> 02:09:24,100
It's made out of aluminum,
and the reason it's made out of aluminum

2305
02:09:24,101 --> 02:09:25,990
is because when they made the Washington
monument,

2306
02:09:25,991 --> 02:09:29,470
it was the most valuable metal known,
and so what does it mean?

2307
02:09:29,770 --> 02:09:32,710
It means there's a pyramid and there's 
something at the top of it,

2308
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:37,740
but the thing that's taught at the top 
of the pyramid isn't the same as the 

2309
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:38,710
rest of the pyramid.
That's the thing.

2310
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:41,380
The pyramid exists.
There's a dominance hierarchy.

2311
02:09:41,381 --> 02:09:46,381
Something climbs up to the top,
but it's not just at the top of one 

2312
02:09:46,381 --> 02:09:47,590
pyramid.
It's at the top of all of them.

2313
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:51,700
The thing that rises to the top of any 
given pyramid is the same thing that can

2314
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:56,701
dominate all pyramids.
It isn't good enough to be the best at a

2315
02:09:57,431 --> 02:10:02,431
dominance hierarchy.
What do you want to be is the best at 

2316
02:10:02,431 --> 02:10:03,280
the set of all possible dominance 
hierarchies.

2317
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:09,720
Right?
And that's the thing that's gold at the 

2318
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:09,720
top of the pyramid,
and that's the eye.

2319
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:11,620
That's what the Egyptians figured out.
And what does that mean?

2320
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:16,360
It means the thing that puts you at the 
top is attention.

2321
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:19,390
Pay Attention,
keep your eyes open.

2322
02:10:19,391 --> 02:10:22,990
It's not the same as thinking.
It's not the same thing.

2323
02:10:23,890 --> 02:10:28,890
It's like watching.
And the thing about human beings is we 

2324
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:32,971
can see,
we can see better than any other 

2325
02:10:32,971 --> 02:10:36,001
creature except birds of prey.
And so our capacity to see is in fact 

2326
02:10:37,521 --> 02:10:40,550
what we'll use in the world.
Our brains are actually organized around

2327
02:10:40,551 --> 02:10:42,080
vision.
Unlike most animals,

2328
02:10:42,081 --> 02:10:44,450
their brains are organized around smell,
not us.

2329
02:10:45,290 --> 02:10:50,290
We can see we stand upright so we can 
see a long distance and in our ability 

2330
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:52,340
to see is what saves us and what saves 
our communities.

2331
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:55,940
And that's what these stories are trying
to portray.

2332
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,510
You might say,
well why didn't people just say so?

2333
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:02,120
An answer to that is because they didn't
know

2334
02:11:03,730 --> 02:11:06,880
it took a long time to figure it out 
forever.

2335
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:11,930
It's taken forever to figure it out.
It's,

2336
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:17,200
it's part of what I hoped when I wrote 
this book and part of the reason that 

2337
02:11:17,391 --> 02:11:22,391
I'm teaching it is because it seems to 
me that it would be useful for everyone 

2338
02:11:22,391 --> 02:11:25,640
to actually understand this instead of 
just having it told as a story.

2339
02:11:25,641 --> 02:11:26,570
It's like,
that's great,

2340
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:27,380
man.
Yes,

2341
02:11:27,410 --> 02:11:31,010
you need the story,
but why not also just understand it

2342
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:33,370
so

2343
02:11:35,950 --> 02:11:37,330
well,
so that's what we're trying to do.

2344
02:11:37,690 --> 02:11:39,010
We're trying to understand this,

2345
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:40,900
so

2346
02:11:42,770 --> 02:11:43,940
that's good enough for today.
