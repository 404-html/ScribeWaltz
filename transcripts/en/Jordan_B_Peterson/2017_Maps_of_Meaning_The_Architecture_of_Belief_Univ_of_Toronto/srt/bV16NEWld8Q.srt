1
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:15,310
So I hope we can.
My plan is to finish this today.

2
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,330
So,
and then we'll go into the more concrete

3
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:24,331
details now that you've got some sense 
of the way that a narrative like this 

4
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:25,510
can unfold.
So if you remember,

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,830
we were just leaving this terrible 
little bar,

6
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:33,730
which I think was called the red lobster
or something like that where the Fox and

7
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:38,731
the cat had met the coachman and the 
coachman is obviously someone who takes 

8
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:39,900
you somewhere.
Um,

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,490
it takes you on a trip.
And the coachman basically revealed 

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,120
himself first.
He kind of looks like a,

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,210
I guess a somewhat jolly old man,
although his expression doesn't 

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,860
precisely read as Jolie.
And then he reveals himself as something

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,110
positively say tannic and that's enough 
to terrify these two bit thugs,

14
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:05,830
the Fox and the cat who think they're 
tough but really are tough at all.

15
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,540
And so they see at some point what 
they're really tangled up in.

16
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:15,541
And I think I mentioned to you that that
was something akin young had this idea 

17
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,250
that people's shadows reach all the way 
down to hell,

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,390
which is a very frightening concept.
And what he meant by that is,

19
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:25,960
is that if you take a look at the 
impulses that drive you,

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,080
that are actually malevolent,
if you can admit to such impulses that 

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,720
if you basically follow those all the 
way down to their origin,

22
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:39,721
you find some very nasty things.
And what you find down there basically 

23
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:42,991
is what allies you with people who've 
done terrible things and that that's not

24
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,430
a very pleasant experience,
I would say.

25
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:53,431
Although one thing that's worth thinking
about is that it is something that can 

26
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:57,010
protect you against being very,
very badly hurt.

27
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,670
Because one of the things that 
characterizes people who develop 

28
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,931
posttraumatic stress disorder is that 
they're often naive and then they 

29
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:09,430
encounter something that's really not 
within their framework of thinking.

30
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,300
And it's usually something bad.
And because there,

31
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,470
there isn't anything in their 
philosophy,

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,110
their way of looking at the world that 
has prepared them for that,

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,440
they ended up fragmented and devastated.
And so it's actually protective to you.

34
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:28,411
If you can figure out what your,
what your full range of capabilities is,

35
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,350
because that can help you understand 
other people a lot better.

36
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,820
And,
and,

37
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:38,821
uh,
to be wiser and more careful in your 

38
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:38,821
actions.
It's also useful,

39
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:43,381
I think,
if you want to convince yourself to act 

40
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,160
properly because if you regard yourself 
as harmless,

41
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,790
which is a big mistake,
then nothing you can do is really that 

42
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,640
bad,
right?

43
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,670
Because you're harmless after all.
But if you understand that you're 

44
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,641
seriously not harmless,
then that can make you a lot more 

45
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:00,870
careful with yourself.
And I would say that,

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,610
that that's especially true.
Maybe when you're dealing,

47
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,980
when you have kids and you start dealing
with your kids.

48
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,670
If you know that what you're capable of 
because you're human,

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,390
then that can motivate you to be much 
more careful with what you say and do.

50
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:18,130
And I don't mean cautious.
I don't mean timid.

51
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,900
I don't.
I don't mean any of that.

52
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:23,920
I just mean that you want to keep things
pristine between you and your children,

53
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:28,921
let's say,
because that way they're on your good 

54
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:31,561
side and you want them on your good side
because children who get on their 

55
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,210
parents bad side suffer very badly for 
it.

56
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,760
And sometimes it's because they're 
literally abused,

57
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,890
but more often it's because they get,
while they get abused,

58
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:44,350
let's say,
or neglected in much more subtle ways.

59
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,580
And you're definitely capable of that.
I mean all you have to do is think about

60
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,060
the way that you've interacted with 
someone that you've decided to not like 

61
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,460
or maybe someone you genuinely don't 
like,

62
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:59,461
you know,
and that can range from just not paying 

63
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:02,131
any attention to them,
especially if they're doing something 

64
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:02,740
good to really pursuing them and making 
their life miserable.

65
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:07,741
And you can certainly do that with your 
family members and you can do that with 

66
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:09,370
your intimate partners and you can do 
that with your friends and you can do it

67
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,070
with yourself.
And so it's really worth knowing that.

68
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,910
So.
Well the Fox thinks he's a royal rule 

69
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:23,641
breaker,
but he's really just a two bit thug and 

70
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:23,641
this is where he,
he learns that.

71
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:28,500
So sorry,
I have a new phone and I'm kind of 

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,120
stupid with.
It's still so.

73
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,220
Well,
hypothetically,

74
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:37,690
that'll work,
but it probably won't.

75
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,310
Anyways.
The coach ones got these guys in his 

76
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,140
grasp now regardless.
And partly because they're already down 

77
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,801
this road and they can't back off and 
partly because he also offers them more 

78
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,270
money than they've seen before.
And so as bad as they are,

79
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:57,100
they're going to get worse.
Many of you,

80
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:02,101
I presume,
have seen breaking bad and that's a 

81
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,131
really good example of the,
of the incorporation at least in part or

82
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:08,200
maybe the possession by the shadow from 
the Union perspective,

83
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:13,201
right?
Because you have this ordinary high 

84
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:14,200
school teacher who really thinks that 
he's an ax and his family as well.

85
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,930
You know,
like your typical persona,

86
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,450
roughly speaking,
he's just a normal guy.

87
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,260
But part of the reason that he's a 
normal guy is because he actually hasn't

88
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,320
been put in abnormal circumstances.
And then all of a sudden he is.

89
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,360
And he has a genuine moral conundrum,
right?

90
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,760
He's going to die of lung cancer and 
his.

91
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,790
He has a son who's got a lot of health 
problems and he's terrified that he's 

92
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,980
going to leave his wife and his child 
behind with nothing.

93
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,910
And then of course as the story.
And so he decides to do something that 

94
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,630
temporarily,
that he regards as what they would 

95
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,380
normally regard as reprehensible.
And of course he just gets tangled up in

96
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:52,330
that.
But then as the story unfolds,

97
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:57,331
you see that there's,
it's more complicated because it's not 

98
00:05:57,331 --> 00:05:57,331
that he was just innocent,
good,

99
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,350
and he decided to turn bad.
He's also very resentful and angry and 

100
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,401
it's partly because he's a bit of a 
pushover at the beginning or maybe more 

101
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:09,790
than a bit of a pushover.
And also that he didn't really fulfill 

102
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:09,810
his own potential and that,
you know,

103
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,860
he had friends who walk down the 
entrepreneurial path and maybe they 

104
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,320
weren't quite fair to him,
but whatever.

105
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,530
He ends up not very successful as a high
school teacher.

106
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:26,531
So he's really angry about that.
And so there's more motivation for him 

107
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:30,790
opening up the door to,
to the terrible elements of his 

108
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,740
personality than just the fact that he's
got good motivations to do so.

109
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,240
And that,
that unfolds,

110
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,270
you know?
And so you see that warps and twists and

111
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:43,271
is resentful.
Character increasingly manifest 

112
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,050
themselves as he walks down this road to
really total brutality.

113
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,860
And it,
it's,

114
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,150
it's,
it's quite good.

115
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,210
Um,
there's a book called ordinary men 

116
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,150
that's a lot like that.
I don't think I've mentioned that to you

117
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,580
before,
but ordinary men is a book about,

118
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,360
it's the best book of it's type.
Maybe it's the only book of its type.

119
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,960
It's possible,
but it's plotted much like breaking bad 

120
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,601
in some sense.
It's a story about these German 

121
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:10,841
policemen in early stages of World War 
II and they were guys who were old 

122
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:16,841
enough to be raised in Germany really 
before the hitlarian propaganda came out

123
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,020
in full force,
you know,

124
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:23,021
if you were a teenager,
say in the 19 thirties you are going to 

125
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:25,541
be pulled right into the propaganda 
machine and maybe you were part of the 

126
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:25,541
Hitler youth and like you were raised in
that,

127
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:30,191
you know,
but if you were older than you were 

128
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,000
raised before that and you're not as 
amenable to propaganda once you're older

129
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:32,470
than about.

130
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,750
While I would say about 22 or something 
like that.

131
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,580
It's,
it's pretty young actually.

132
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,910
If you're gonna make a soldier,
you have to get a soldier young because 

133
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,160
once people are in their early twenties,
say they're kind of,

134
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,100
they already have their personality 
developed.

135
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,580
Anyways,
these policemen were sent into Poland 

136
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,420
after the Germans marched through and 
uh,

137
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:59,170
you know,
it was wartime and there is this 

138
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,380
hypothesis in Germany that the Jews in 
particular,

139
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:05,381
we're operating as a fifth column and 
undermining the German war effort 

140
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:08,471
because of course the Germans blamed the
Jews and a variety of other people for 

141
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,550
actually setting up the conditions that 
made the war necessary.

142
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,560
And so when the police were sent into 
Poland,

143
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,580
they were also required to make peace 
roughly speaking.

144
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:21,581
And so they started up by.
They started out by rounding up all the 

145
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:26,140
Jewish men between 18 and 65 and 
gathering them in in stadiums and then 

146
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,080
shipping them off on the trains.

147
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,480
But that isn't where they ended.
They ended in,

148
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,430
in very,
very dark place.

149
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:36,431
I mean,
these guys were going out in the field 

150
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:39,161
with naked pregnant women and shooting 
them in the back of the head by the end 

151
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:40,190
of their training.
And what's really interesting about that

152
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,191
is that is that their commander told 
them that they could go home at any 

153
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,600
time.
So this is,

154
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,630
this is not one of those examples of 
people following orders and the reason 

155
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,840
they didn't,
roughly speaking,

156
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:58,841
there's many reasons,
but one of the reasons they didn't is 

157
00:08:58,841 --> 00:08:58,841
because they didn't think it was 
comradely,

158
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:03,550
so to speak,
to leave their guys they were working 

159
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:03,780
with to do all the dirty work and run 
off,

160
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,420
you know.
And that's really,

161
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,500
that's really an interesting fact,
you know,

162
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:10,230
because you in,
in different circumstances,

163
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,300
you wouldn't think about that as 
reprehensible,

164
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,080
right?
You'd think,

165
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:18,081
well that's part of teamwork and under 
rough circumstances and that's at least 

166
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:18,900
in part how they viewed it.

167
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,900
And they were also made physically ill 
multiple times physically and 

168
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,290
psychologically ill by the things that 
they had to do.

169
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,430
But they kept doing them anyways.
So it's one step at a time.

170
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,230
And that's the thing is that you end up 
in very bad places one step at a time.

171
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:37,770
So you got to watch those steps.
Anyways.

172
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,210
Pinocchio has now decided after his 
latest misadventure to return to the 

173
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,190
proper pathway,
he's off to school again and uh,

174
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,630
he's still pretty naive,
although perhaps not as much so as he 

175
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,181
was before.
And so he decides that he's going to do 

176
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:56,181
things right.
He's going to go get educated,

177
00:09:56,181 --> 00:10:00,191
he's going back to school,
he's going to take the conventional 

178
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:01,470
route to discipline and do and be a good
boy roughly speaking.

179
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,820
And so he's off to school.
And the Fox waylay them.

180
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,040
Again.
This is a really interesting scene.

181
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,240
Took me quite a long time to unpack this
too.

182
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:17,241
And so the Fox first of all starts out 
by acting like he's sympathetic again,

183
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,720
sympathetic towards Pinocchio.
And so he's empathetic,

184
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:26,721
you could say.
And so this is an interesting analysis 

185
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,590
of empathy.
So what happens is,

186
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:33,591
is the Fox Convinces Pinocchio through a
variety of maneuvers that he's actually 

187
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,180
not feeling very well,
that he's sick.

188
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,370
He really convinces him that he's a 
victim.

189
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,820
And one of the things,
I had a graduate student named Maya 

190
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,450
chicken who who had worked with the UN 
and in Bosnia and she had toured some of

191
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:53,991
the mass grave sites there and we wrote 
a paper one time called you can either 

192
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,800
remember nor forget what you don't 
understand,

193
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,360
and it was a paper about the idea,
for example,

194
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:05,361
it was partly about the idea that we 
should never forget the Holocaust and 

195
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:08,590
that the idea there is that what we 
should never forget it and we shouldn't 

196
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:08,590
repeat it,
but the thing is,

197
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,680
if you don't understand how those things
come about,

198
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,150
you can't really remember them.

199
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,150
Right?
You think about them as a set of 

200
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,741
historical facts,
but that's not the kind of remembering 

201
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:22,611
that actually makes any difference.
You have to understand the causal 

202
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:25,881
pathways.
You have to understand how a society 

203
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:26,370
would transform in that manner.
And more importantly,

204
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:30,150
you have to understand the role of the 
individuals within that society.

205
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,540
Unless you're going to assume that 
they're so completely unlike you,

206
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:38,541
that there's no connection whatsoever.
In which case you haven't remembered it 

207
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,201
at all.
You haven't learned anything at all 

208
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,361
because the right lesson from what 
happened in the 20th century is this is 

209
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:48,321
what human beings are like.
That's the correct blessing and you can 

210
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:48,690
say,
well,

211
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,350
not me,

212
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,050
but you should,
but probably you too.

213
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,080
That's the thing probably and probably 
me to at least under normal 

214
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,020
circumstances.
Anyways,

215
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,580
the Fox Convinces Pinocchio that he's 
sick.

216
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,920
He performs a lot of tricks to do this.
Now you could say that Pinocchio is 

217
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,440
susceptible to this because maybe 
they're still part of him that's looking

218
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:22,180
for the easy way out,
and so one of the things that Maya and I

219
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:27,181
found when we were writing this paper,
we were looking at the discourse that 

220
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:30,241
precedes genocide in genocidal states 
and the enhancement of a sense of 

221
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:32,800
victimization on the part of one of the 
groups.

222
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,260
Usually the group that's going to commit
the genocide.

223
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:36,810
First of all,
their senses,

224
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,120
their sense of being victims is much 
heightened by the demagogues who are 

225
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,750
trying to stir up this sort of hatred.
So they basically say,

226
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:48,751
look,
you've been oppressed in a variety of 

227
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:51,001
ways and these are the people who did it
and they're not going to stop doing it 

228
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:51,580
and this time we're going to get them 
before they get us.

229
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,300
It's something like that.
And so there's something very 

230
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,730
pathological about the enhancement of 
victimization,

231
00:12:57,731 --> 00:12:58,980
which is well,

232
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,170
see that the problem as far as I'm 
concerned with it is it's not.

233
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,060
It's not thought through very well 
because there's.

234
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,180
There's a point that's being made and 
the point is that people have been 

235
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,840
oppressed and they suffer and that's 
true that point,

236
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,950
but that's.
But then the proper framework from 

237
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:34,561
within which to interpret that I believe
is that that's characteristic of life.

238
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,950
You can't take it personally in some 
sense and you can divide the world 

239
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,541
neatly into perpetrators and victims and
you certainly can't divide the world 

240
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,810
neatly into perpetrators and victims and
then assume that you're only in the 

241
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,411
victim class and then assume that that 
gives you certain access to certain 

242
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,950
forms of redress.
Let's say it gets dangerous very rapidly

243
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,530
if you do that sort of thing.
So for example,

244
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,380
one of the things that characterized the
Soviet Union,

245
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,110
and this was particularly true in the 19
twenties,

246
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:10,111
but,
but afterwards is so the Soviets were 

247
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:12,040
very much enamored of the idea of class 
guilt.

248
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,970
So for example,
although it wasn't only about 40 years 

249
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,190
previously that the serfs had been 
emancipated,

250
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,930
they weren't much more than slaves.
Right.

251
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:25,000
And so that was the bulk of the Russian 
population.

252
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,700
They were bought and sold along with the
land.

253
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,200
So they had been emancipated and some of
them,

254
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,410
many of them had turned into independent
farmers and some of them had become 

255
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,210
reasonably prosperous because at least 
in principle I presumed a certain 

256
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,651
proportion of them from being crooked,
but I presume a larger proportion from 

257
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:50,281
actually being able to raise food.
And of course at that time the bulk of 

258
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:55,140
the Russian food was produced by these 
relatively successful peasant farmers 

259
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,870
and relatively successful would mean 
maybe they had a brick house or 

260
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,111
something and maybe they had a couple of
cows and maybe they were able to hire a 

261
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:05,111
few people.
And so,

262
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:09,980
you know,
it wasn't like they were massive land 

263
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:09,980
owners or anything.

264
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,190
But I've talked to you a little bit 
about the preto principle and the notion

265
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:18,191
that in any domain of activity,
a small proportion of people ended up 

266
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:19,040
producing most of what's in that domain 
of activity.

267
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,510
The same was true in Russia with regards
to these peasant farmers.

268
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,630
Some of them were extraordinarily 
efficient and they produced most of 

269
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,110
Russia's food.
When the communists came in,

270
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,740
they described those,
those land holders as parasites 

271
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,241
essentially predicated on the Marxist 
idea that if someone had extracted 

272
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:45,641
profit from an enterprise that they had 
basically stolen that profit from from,

273
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,530
from the people say that they had 
employed or otherwise oppressed.

274
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,650
And so you could be a member of the Ku 
lack,

275
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,610
k u,
l a,

276
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:53,570
c,
a k,

277
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,800
k,
u l a k.

278
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:59,801
You can be a member of the Kulak class.
And then because you were a member of 

279
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:01,400
that class,
you are automatically guilty.

280
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,430
And so what happened was,
and you got to think this through to 

281
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,921
really understand what happened.
So what happened was the intellectual 

282
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:12,820
communists were sent out in cadres out 
into these little towns to find people 

283
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:18,371
who would help them round up the Kulaks.
Now you've got to think about what a 

284
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:22,241
small town is like because so imagine 
you're in a town and there's three or 

285
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:26,561
four people or maybe 10 people or 
something like that who are a little 

286
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:28,480
more successful than everyone else,
and a certain number of people are going

287
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:31,370
to be fine with that and maybe even 
happy about it because they regard those

288
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:33,320
people as particularly productive and 
you know,

289
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:36,680
as stalwart members of the community,
regardless of their flaws.

290
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,690
But there's gonna be some people who are
not happy about it at all that are going

291
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:42,860
to be very resentful about that and 
jealous.

292
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,310
And so those are going to be people 
whose characters I would say are of the 

293
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,851
less positive type.
And so when the intellectuals came in 

294
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:55,601
and described the reason that these 
people should be treated as parasites 

295
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:59,861
and profiteers,
then it was the resentful minority in 

296
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:02,891
those towns.
And that would be the kind of guy that 

297
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,661
hangs around in the bar all the time and
is completely unconscientious and fails 

298
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:06,050
at everything and then blames everyone 
else for it.

299
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,120
The intellectuals came in and said,
here's this is unfair that this happened

300
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:16,121
to you.
You've actually been victimized and now 

301
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:16,121
it's your opportunity to go have your 
revenge.

302
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:19,280
And so that's exactly what happened.
Now in some of the villages,

303
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,700
some of sometimes the peasants would 
actually surround the that the,

304
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,760
the,
the farmsteads have these more 

305
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:28,760
successful people and try to defend 
them.

306
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,810
But that never worked out for very long.

307
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,810
And so then these mobs,
these angry mobs would go into the farm 

308
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,040
houses and strip the place right down to
nothing.

309
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,340
And they pack these people up and sent 
them on trains with no food at out to 

310
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,060
Siberia where there was no place to 
live.

311
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,120
And so that they were packed into 
houses,

312
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,160
you know,
maybe they had a square meter each to 

313
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,160
live in.
And all the children died of typhoid.

314
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,280
And,
and,

315
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,460
and many of them froze to death.
Many,

316
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,740
many people died.
Millions of people died.

317
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,890
As a consequence of the Deq lack,
ization had least in,

318
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:04,580
in as a consequence of its total effect.
So what happened then was that a,

319
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,450
there wasn't any food produced and so 
then 6 million Ukrainian starve to death

320
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:15,300
in the 19 twenties,
which is something you never hear about,

321
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,100
right?
You never hear about that.

322
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,430
Why do you never hear about that?
That's a question worth asking.

323
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,440
You know,
it was an absolute catastrophe.

324
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,590
They used to.
So these people were starving.

325
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,140
Break to the point of cannibalism,
right?

326
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:33,141
I mean it was ugly.
It was ugly as anything you could 

327
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:33,250
possibly imagine if you were a mother 
and.

328
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,660
And so you're supposed to handle your 
grain into the central committee,

329
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,290
mostly for distribution into the cities.
You didn't get to keep any for yourself.

330
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,450
And so maybe then afterwards,
if you were a mother,

331
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:47,451
you'd go out in the fields that had 
already been harvested and you pick up 

332
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:51,030
individual grains of wheat and if you 
didn't turn those in nature,

333
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,890
that was death for you.
So that's how far it was pushed so.

334
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,170
Well.
So that's a little story about how 

335
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,261
victimization,
how the idea of victimization and 

336
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:06,960
perpetration can get out of hand 
extraordinarily rapidly.

337
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,310
And so whenever people are beating the 
victim drum,

338
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,790
you know,
they'll cover that up with,

339
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,100
with,
uh,

340
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,850
empathy.
Roughly speaking,

341
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,010
we're speaking on behalf of the 
oppressed.

342
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:25,011
It's like maybe you are,
but maybe you're no saint because you 

343
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:29,031
know,
you're so sure that you're a saint and 

344
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:29,280
you're only speaking from the position 
of good.

345
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,100
It's highly unlikely.
Anyway,

346
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:34,380
so Pinocchio is enticed into believing 
that he's a victim.

347
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:39,381
Now,
the logical part of that is that it is 

348
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:43,141
the case that you know,
you can make a very strong case that 

349
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,720
every human being is in some sense 
involved in a tragic enterprise,

350
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,020
right?
Because you're biologically vulnerable.

351
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,570
You're not what you could be as a 
biological specimen,

352
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,600
right?
You're full of imperfections and plus 

353
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,060
you're going to be sick and those you 
love are going to be sick and everything

354
00:19:57,061 --> 00:20:02,061
ends up in death.
And so that there's a very tragic 

355
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:02,640
element to that.
And then by the same token,

356
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,470
you're also subject to the theoretical 
aspect of your culture,

357
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,860
right?

358
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,610
Because it's forcing you to be a certain
way all the time,

359
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,880
it socialization does that you're 
required to modify your own intrinsic 

360
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,521
nature in order to come into conformity 
with the broader community and you can 

361
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:25,100
think about that from the Piagetian 
sense,

362
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,180
which is the socialization makes you a 
more and more sophisticated person and,

363
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,230
and there's some truth in that,
but you can also be subject just to 

364
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,230
tyranny,
you know,

365
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,600
and you see,
I see people in my practice,

366
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:41,601
for example,
who've had very tyrannical fathers for 

367
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:44,451
example.
Sometimes they have to radical mothers 

368
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,000
as well,
but they're not so much encouraged to,

369
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,150
to integrate properly into social 
community as they are harassed and 

370
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,090
abused and made to feel insufficient and
you know,

371
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,780
basically subject to tyranny.
And so it's quite an.

372
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,270
And that's true of everyone to some 
degree,

373
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,460
you know,
you,

374
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,010
you come to university and there's a 
tyrannical aspect to it.

375
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,070
You're in.
Especially in a big institution like 

376
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,351
this,
you're not really marked out as an 

377
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:10,351
individual in any sense.
You know,

378
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:12,790
you're,
you're a number along with 60,000

379
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:17,791
other people and you know,
there there's something cold and 

380
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,091
impersonal about that which is well 
represented in the design of this 

381
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:21,520
classroom.
Say and,

382
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,580
but by the same token,
you know that the university provides 

383
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,080
you with an identity while you're 
exploring an intellectual landscape.

384
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:34,081
You know,
you have a lot of freedom compared to 

385
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:37,741
the vast majority of people.
Perhaps you don't have as much freedom 

386
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:40,840
as you might if you compared it to some 
utopia notion of freedom,

387
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:45,841
but in any real world sense,
you're unbelievably well protected by 

388
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:49,621
the university partly because it stamps 
you with the identity student,

389
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,200
which is a respectable identity and so 
you can go off and educate yourself as 

390
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,200
much as you can.

391
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,570
Well,
and everyone in society says that's 

392
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,731
okay.
They carve out a protected space for 

393
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:04,711
you.
So at the same time as you're being 

394
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:04,711
tyrannized by the institution and,
and,

395
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,890
and forced in some ways also to adopt 
the viewpoints,

396
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,390
say of the professors,
depending on the professor,

397
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,800
you're also the beneficiary of that.
Just like you're the beneficiary of this

398
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,530
huge industrial infrastructure that 
underlies everything.

399
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:19,150
We do,
so anyways,

400
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,870
the fact that your life is tragic 
necessarily and that you are subject to 

401
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:29,110
oppression makes the victimization story
really easy to swallow,

402
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,950
but then there's dark side of that too,
and this is actually what happens with 

403
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,851
Pinocchio.
So what happens here is that he's told 

404
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:43,670
that he's ill and convinced that these 
ill and they do use trickery and and and

405
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,810
so again,
you could look at him in some sense as 

406
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,000
an innocent victim,
but the innocence,

407
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,820
the filmmakers do a good job of hedging 
against the innocent interpretation 

408
00:22:55,871 --> 00:23:00,871
because what he's offered and accepts 
because these ale is an easy way out and

409
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:06,820
so what the Fox basically tells him is 
that he needs to have a vacation because

410
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,920
he's sick and he can go off to pleasure 
island,

411
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,840
which is this place of impulsivity.

412
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,020
Roughly speaking in and whim.
It's like reversion to being two years 

413
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,501
old in some sense,
and that he really needs that because 

414
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:20,890
otherwise he's not going to be able to 
live property.

415
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,540
He's not going to be able to recover his
health.

416
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:27,541
And so what Pinocchio is offered is the 
opportunity to abandoned responsibility.

417
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,420
As a reward for adopting the guys that 
victim and that's really worth thinking 

418
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:41,671
about because one of the things I've 
thought about for a long time is that 

419
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,860
I've been trying to figure out what 
gives people's lives meaning and tragedy

420
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,950
gives life its negative meaning and 
nobody disputes that.

421
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:53,951
Even if you're nihilistic,
you're not going to dispute the fact 

422
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:53,951
that tragedy gives life negative 
meaning.

423
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,850
So when.
Now let's say that life is meaningless.

424
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,480
That isn't exactly what they mean.
They mean that life is suffering,

425
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,690
but there isn't anything transcendent 
about it that you could set against that

426
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,260
suffering that's nihilism.
It's not that life is meaningless,

427
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,410
that would just be neutral.
It's like no one believes that and they 

428
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:11,930
certainly don't act like they believe 
it.

429
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,330
If you look at it technically and we 
will as we progress through this class,

430
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:22,670
that in order to have any positive 
meaning in your life,

431
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,300
you have to identify the goal and you 
have to be working towards it and there 

432
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,600
is a technical reason for that.
And the technical reason,

433
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:35,601
as far as I can tell is that the 
circuitry that produces the kind of 

434
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,921
positive emotion that people really like
is only activated when you noticed that 

435
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:44,051
your peers,
when you're proceeding towards a goal 

436
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:46,250
that you value,
and so that means that if you don't have

437
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,600
a goal that you value,
you can't have any positive emotion.

438
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:53,601
So technically that's the incentive 
reward system and it's the underlying 

439
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:56,330
circuitry is dopaminergic and would not 
circuitry is activated.

440
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:58,580
Then it's part of the exploratory 
circuit.

441
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,580
It makes you,
it gives you the sense of being actively

442
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:04,830
engaged in something worthwhile and 
that's you know,

443
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,800
you,
you tend to think of positive emotion is

444
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:11,801
something produced by reward,
but there's two kinds of positive 

445
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:11,801
emotion.

446
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,790
One is the reward that's associated with
satiation and that's conservatory 

447
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,020
reward.
And that's the reward you get when 

448
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,671
you're hungry and you eat.
But the thing about eating when you're 

449
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:24,140
hungry is that it destroys the framework
within which you are operating,

450
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:29,141
right?
It's time to eat what you eat and then 

451
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:31,751
that frameworks no longer relevant.
So the consumer story reward eliminates 

452
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:32,780
the value of framework.
And then you're stuck with what,

453
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:37,781
what are you going to do next?
And so the conservatory reward has with 

454
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:41,600
its own problems.
But the incentive reward is constantly 

455
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,861
what keeps you moving forward and 
incentive reward because it's still 

456
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:45,860
open.
Jack also is analgesic,

457
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,890
literally analgesics.
So if you're in pain,

458
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,530
you take opiates and that will cut the 
pain,

459
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:56,531
but so well psychomotor stimulants like 
cocaine or amphetamines and so it's 

460
00:25:56,781 --> 00:26:00,410
literally the case that if you're 
engaged in something that's engaging and

461
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:03,200
you're working towards a goal that 
you're going to feel less pain.

462
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,660
And you can see this happening with 
athletes who you know,

463
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,690
they'll break their thumb or something 
or maybe sometimes even the rankl and 

464
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,691
they'll keep playing the game.
Of course afterwards they're suffering 

465
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:14,210
like mad,
but the fact that they're so filled with

466
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,240
goal directed enthusiasm means that 
whether pain systems are in some sense 

467
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:24,431
shut off.
So that's an interesting thing because 

468
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:26,210
what it suggests,
I mean then you could imagine,

469
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,360
I might say,
well how happy you are you that you've 

470
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,540
made a certain amount of progress.
And if you think about it,

471
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:33,500
what you'd say is.
Well,

472
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:38,501
it depends on how much progress and in 
relationship to what so hypothetically 

473
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:43,931
you're going to be happier if you've 
made quite a bit of progress towards a 

474
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:46,721
really important goal and then you have 
to think through what it means for a 

475
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:48,270
goal to be really important because 
that's not obvious.

476
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,420
Now you could say you're in this class 
and you're listening to some information

477
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,210
and maybe there's two reasons for that.
You might find the information 

478
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:03,081
interesting per se,
but let's forget about that for a 

479
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:03,690
minute.
You need to listen to the information so

480
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:07,260
that you can do well on the assignment 
so that you can do well in the class.

481
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,860
You need to do well in your classes so 
that you can finish up your degree.

482
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,070
You need to finish up your degree so 
that you can find your place in the 

483
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,651
world.
You need to do that so that you're 

484
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:20,601
financially stable and maybe you can 
start a family and have a life and 

485
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:21,870
that's all part of being a good person.
Something like that.

486
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,320
And so that's a hierarchy of goals and 
you might say that being a good person 

487
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,230
would be the thing,
however vaguely thought through.

488
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,230
That's at the top of that hierarchy.
And then when you're doing things that 

489
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,100
serve that,
that ultimate purpose,

490
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,280
then you're going to find those more 
meaningful and that meaning is actually 

491
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,131
produced as a consequence of the 
engagement of this exploratory circuit 

492
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,340
that's nested write down in your 
hypothalamus.

493
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,230
It's really,
really old.

494
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,720
It's as old as thirst and it's as old as
hunger.

495
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,750
It's really an old system.
And so you want to have that thing 

496
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,840
activated.
I mean at least from a,

497
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,590
from a,
from a a while.

498
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,480
It isn't only from it he dominic point 
of view,

499
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,220
you know,
it isn't a matter of being happy.

500
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:07,980
It's the wrong way of thinking about.
It's much more complicated than that.

501
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,210
It's,
yes,

502
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,840
that was actually.
I was just about to ask that.

503
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:14,060
Let's bring up like,
yeah,

504
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,890
because I'm just trying to understand 
this,

505
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,920
I guess not relationship,
but the differentiation between hedonism

506
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:28,921
and satiation and you like going back to
when you mentioned that it's not that 

507
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:32,240
life is meaningless,
but he didn't.

508
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:37,310
Them isn't exactly like it's not 
satiation because at that point people 

509
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,080
are just doing what they're doing for 
the sake of doing.

510
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,440
It's not just for activation of the dove
and the dove into men are just started 

511
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:46,220
dumping them in their job

512
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,030
system.
Um,

513
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,790
so I'm just trying to understand.
Well,

514
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:56,791
what I would say,
we're going to go into that a lot once 

515
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,130
we're done this like a lot,
but I'll,

516
00:28:58,131 --> 00:28:59,560
I'll,
I'll go over it briefly.

517
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:03,620
I mean it's not merely hedonism because 
there is an analgesic and,

518
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,960
and also a fear reducing element to 
pursuing the proper path.

519
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,790
Right?
So there's control of negative emotion,

520
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:15,270
but there's not just control of negative
emotion and generation of positive 

521
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,571
emotion in the immediate future,
which is kind of what you'd think about 

522
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:18,571
with regards to hedonism.
Actually,

523
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:19,930
Pinocchio takes a,
he dawning route next.

524
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,870
The problem with the he dornoch route is
that.

525
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,720
So the pursuit of pure happiness,
let's say,

526
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:30,721
is that what makes you happy in the next
minute might not be something that will 

527
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:32,050
make you happy in the next hour.
Well,

528
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:35,170
you know that there's this car comic.
What's his name?

529
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,470
They called them Katie,
the one liners you talked about drinking

530
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:39,310
wine.
He said,

531
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,890
don't you know that's going to cause a 
hangover?

532
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,650
He,
yeah,

533
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,710
at the end,
but the beginning of middle are 

534
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,440
excellent and so that's really the 
problem with hedonism,

535
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:52,441
right?
Is that to pursue something that makes 

536
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:56,491
you happy in the immediate present risk,
sacrificing your well many things,

537
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:00,870
but at least let's say your hedonism in 
the medium to longterm.

538
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,700
And of course that is one of the major 
problems with drug use.

539
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,730
And alcohol is a really good example of 
that because whatever he don't it kick 

540
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,481
you might get from it that moment at 
night you're going to pay for almost 

541
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,880
completely or maybe even more so because
the next day you're much more jittery 

542
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:23,341
and anxious and that's a.
that's a direct consequence of 

543
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:23,341
withdrawing from the drug.
So when you're in,

544
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,870
when you have a hangover,
you're in alcohol withdrawal,

545
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,100
so that's how fast you,
you get roughly speaking,

546
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,730
addicted to it,
and so if you take another drink when 

547
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:35,730
you're hung over,
it'll cure it,

548
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,720
but it's not a very useful care because 
all you do is push the inevitable 

549
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,450
hangover one more step into the future.

550
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,720
And so part of the problem with the 
hedonic answer is happy when exactly and

551
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:51,811
over what period of time and also who's 
happy because maybe something makes you 

552
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:52,210
happy,
but makes your family miserable.

553
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,620
Now you could say,
well,

554
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:56,230
I don't care,
but you do care if you have to live with

555
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,270
your family because they're going to 
take it out on you.

556
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,740
So,
so the,

557
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,670
the impulsive hedonism,
which is also fostered,

558
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:08,671
say by a positive emotion,
it tends to put people into a state of 

559
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:12,300
the pursuit of short term hedonism.
It's not a good longterm or medium to 

560
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:17,371
longterm solution.
I actually think that's why people 

561
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:18,340
evolved conscientiousness,
right?

562
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:23,341
Because conscientiousness is not happy.
Conscientious people aren't 

563
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:24,940
conscientious because it makes them 
happy.

564
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,050
We're starting to think that they're 
conscientious because they actually feel

565
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:31,030
terrible if they're just sitting around 
doing nothing,

566
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,320
and so it's a way of staving off stress.

567
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,810
The stress that's related to enforce 
leisure,

568
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:38,920
something like that.
You know,

569
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:42,100
you if you know industrious people,
some of you will have,

570
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,220
some of you are industrious,
some of you will have industrious 

571
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,740
parents.
They just can't sit around and do 

572
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:49,740
nothing.
They have to be working.

573
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:49,740
They don't feel good unless they're 
working.

574
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:55,170
So what thing about conscientiousness is
that it involves continual sacrifice,

575
00:31:55,481 --> 00:32:00,481
right?
You're doing difficult things in the 

576
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:01,921
present,
hypothetically to make the future 

577
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:01,921
better,
but that's not driven by hedonism,

578
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:06,511
by any stretch of the imagination and 
conscientiousness is actually a pretty 

579
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:09,661
good predictor of longterm life success 
in stable societies because there's also

580
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:13,720
no point in being conscientious and 
saving things up and storing things.

581
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,750
If a bunch of thugs are going to just 
come in randomly and and take it all 

582
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,380
away.
So conscientiousness actually only works

583
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:23,920
intelligently and societies that have 
some medium to longterm stability,

584
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,440
you know,
because you can get wiped out by 

585
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,751
hyperinflation too because 
hyperinflation kills off the 

586
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:30,751
conscientious people.

587
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:32,680
The people who accrue debts are thrilled
with hyperinflation,

588
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:34,300
kicks in because it wipes out their 
debts.

589
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:39,301
But of course those debts are the things
they owed to people who were 

590
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:40,310
conscientious enough to save.
So anyways,

591
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:44,240
Pinocchio was transformed into a victim 
and he's offered this,

592
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:47,540
he's offered this identity and he takes 
it.

593
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,570
Now,
it's partly because he's deceived and 

594
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,910
manipulated,
but it's also partly because the fox 

595
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,761
offers him the abandonment of 
responsibility as payment for as payment

596
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:04,661
for adopting the victim identity.
So this is where his own lack of 

597
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:05,840
morality,
let's say,

598
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:10,841
because this is all about Pinocchio.
Development as a character plays a role 

599
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:15,041
in his demise.
So if I'm a victim than everyone else 

600
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:18,770
owes me something and I don't have to 
take any responsibility.

601
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:22,250
And so one of the things I've wondered,
here's something to think about.

602
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,480
It might be that the sense of meaning 
that life can provide to you is 

603
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,920
proportionate to the amount of 
responsibility you decide to take on.

604
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,830
Not that'd be very strange if it was the
case,

605
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:38,831
you know,
because responsibility of course is a 

606
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:40,541
kind of weight obviously,
and it's difficult to take on 

607
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,571
responsibility,
but if any positive emotion that you 

608
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:48,071
feel and your control of anxiety and the
control over pain is dependent on the 

609
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:53,240
activation of these systems that watch 
you move towards a desired goal,

610
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,950
then the more complete and weighty the 
goal is,

611
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:03,250
the more kicked there's going to be in 
the observation that you're moving 

612
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:03,250
towards it.
And I,

613
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,410
you know,
you kind of already know this because 

614
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,290
you'll,
you'll have observed in your own life 

615
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:10,290
that when you're engaged in something 
that you believe in,

616
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,900
that the time passes properly.
You know,

617
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:19,990
you can see this even if you're.
Maybe you're reading a paper and it's 

618
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,531
actually related in some intelligible 
manner to something that you want to 

619
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:23,531
learn.

620
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:26,150
So even though it's difficult,
you get engaged in it,

621
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:29,720
you can remember it better.
You can process it better and you don't.

622
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,900
You're not so likely to fall asleep and 
you're not so likely to want to find 

623
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,081
distractions.
All of that you can get into it and it 

624
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:41,891
would be very interesting if that was 
proportionate to the degree of 

625
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:44,891
responsibility that you're willing to 
shoulder and I think you can make a 

626
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:45,770
strong case for that.
I've also often wondered,

627
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,090
imagine you could offer people a choice.
Here's the choice.

628
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:50,900
You could say,
well,

629
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,920
your life isn't meaningful.
Denialists have got it right.

630
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:57,860
There's no meaning in your life and 
because of that,

631
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:02,861
there's no reason for you to accept any 
responsibility so you can live a 

632
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:06,650
responsibility free life and maybe one 
of the impulsive pleasure seeking better

633
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:09,890
responsibility for free life,
but the price you pay is that it doesn't

634
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:10,790
get to be meaningful.

635
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,190
Or you could say to someone,
no,

636
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,220
we're going to do the opposite.
We're going to say you can live a 

637
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,220
meaningful life,
but it's only gonna.

638
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:23,140
Be as meaningful as the amount of 
responsibility that you're willing to 

639
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,270
bear.
And then you might say,

640
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,890
well,
what would people choose?

641
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,250
Because everybody also always makes 
noises about wanting to have a 

642
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,910
meaningful life.
But if the price you pay for that is the

643
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:36,911
adoption of responsibility,
that it's not so obvious that people 

644
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:39,911
would choose meaning over,
no over pointless pursuits if they had 

645
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:44,340
to,
if the benefit they got for choosing the

646
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:49,341
pointless pursuits was that they really 
didn't have to care about anything they 

647
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:49,341
ever did,
right?

648
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:54,140
Snow responsibility,
and that's really what Pinocchio is 

649
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,140
offered and that's what the coachman 
offers them.

650
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,900
And that's interesting because know so 
far it's been the Fox and the and the 

651
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,800
cat,
and they were kind of to bid hoods and 

652
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,531
so the pathological pathway that they 
offer Pinocchio is not the worst of the 

653
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:11,931
pathological pathways,
but here at least as far as the 

654
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:15,381
imagination,
the collective imagination that created 

655
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,811
this movie is concerned is this is where
you get to the most pathological form 

656
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:19,290
of,
let's call it temptation,

657
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:24,410
and that's the temptation to engage in,
to abandoned responsibility and to 

658
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:29,931
engage in impulsive pleasure seeking 
short term pleasure seeking.

659
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,690
So here's the Fox pretending to be a 
Doctor Investigating Pinocchio's illness

660
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:42,591
and he makes some notes,
which is all just meaningless scribble,

661
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,640
right?
It's like white noise and it doesn't 

662
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,091
matter that the arguments that he's 
making is are completely incoherent and 

663
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:54,180
it doesn't matter that he actually 
doesn't know anything.

664
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:59,181
He what he's selling is easy to buy and 
so Pinocchio buys it and by the end of 

665
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,920
the conversation with the Fox,
he's pretty convinced that he's useless 

666
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,250
and it needs a vacation.
No,

667
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,540
this is anita postage inedible situation
as well.

668
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,720
Charlie touched on the other lecture 
mean

669
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,960
hmm,

670
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,680
that's fair.
Let's imagine that you have a child that

671
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,860
is a little on the neurotic side,
so high negative emotion and maybe one 

672
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,410
that's also a little bit on the east 
side,

673
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:32,520
so has a variety of,
let's say relatively minor ailments,

674
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:37,521
but the ailments nonetheless.
So what that means as a parent will say,

675
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:39,510
mother,
for this example,

676
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:41,190
because I want to use the eatable 
example,

677
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,180
you have to make a decision all the time
about exactly how you're going to treat 

678
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,330
that child.
One decision is,

679
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,440
well,
I'm not gonna.

680
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,320
You don't have to go to school today 
because you're not feeling well.

681
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,920
It's like

682
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,840
fair enough,
but you make the same decision the next 

683
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,890
day and do you make the same decision 
the next day and let's imagine that you 

684
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:09,210
enable the child to avoid responsibility
as a consequence of capitalizing on 

685
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,251
their illness.
Well then that's not going to be very 

686
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:14,490
good for the child.
The rule within a sickly child has to be

687
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:19,491
something like,
I'm going to push you right to your 

688
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:21,741
limit because otherwise,
how is the person going to figure out 

689
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:26,271
what they can do?
And if they can't figure out what they 

690
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:26,271
can do,
then you're not going to be able to make

691
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:29,790
their way in the world at all.
And then that gets muddied very badly.

692
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,850
If you're not exactly sure that you want
them to make their way in the world.

693
00:38:32,851 --> 00:38:35,320
You know,
maybe you're just as happy because you'd

694
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:40,321
be sitting at home alone if your child 
was there with you and maybe you'd be 

695
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:44,851
just as happy at some level if they 
never grew up at all because then they 

696
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:45,880
won't leave.
And so,

697
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:49,030
and maybe that's because you have a 
terrible marriage and your lonesome.

698
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:54,090
You know,
maybe it's an abusive marriage and your 

699
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,191
husband has chased away all your friends
so you don't have anything at all and 

700
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:59,851
maybe that's because he didn't stand up 
for yourself very well apart from the 

701
00:38:59,851 --> 00:38:59,851
fact that he was,
you know,

702
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,860
tyrannical and is central nature and so 
then all those little warps in bands in 

703
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:07,840
your psyche are going to manifest 
themselves.

704
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:09,700
Right,
right.

705
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:12,100
In the background of every single one of
those decisions.

706
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,470
My daughter had a lot of illnesses when 
she was an adolescent and they were very

707
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:23,610
serious and it was very difficult to 
figure out what to do about that because

708
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,850
you couldn't exactly applied normative 
rules.

709
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:31,851
Right.
And we always had to figure out if she 

710
00:39:31,851 --> 00:39:31,851
was

711
00:39:31,851 --> 00:39:35,150
communicating her symptoms to us,
how seriously to take those.

712
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,990
And the answer was the least amount of 
serious possible.

713
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,530
It's something like that because we 
needed to do and she needed to know what

714
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:47,780
she could do in spite of the fact that 
she had problems.

715
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,780
And one of the things I really tried to 
instill in her,

716
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:56,590
and I think it worked,
is that you don't ever want to use it 

717
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,290
your illness as an excuse for not doing 
anything.

718
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,210
Not Consciously.
You know,

719
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,100
sometimes you might not know,
I'm not feeling well.

720
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,900
What can I do?
What you don't know,

721
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:07,901
right?
Because sometimes when you're not 

722
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:07,901
feeling well,
you can do more than you think.

723
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:08,510
And sometimes you can do less than you 
think.

724
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,450
It's not like it's obvious,
but sometimes it's obvious.

725
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,030
You know this little temptation flits 
through your mind and you think,

726
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:15,980
well,
I don't really want to do what I'm doing

727
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,620
today and I'm not feeling very well so I
don't have to do it.

728
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:23,830
You do that 100 times,
then you don't know how sick you are 

729
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,561
anymore and then you're.
Then you're in real trouble because not 

730
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:27,350
only are you sick,
but you actually have.

731
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,410
You've muddied the waters and so you 
have both problems then is you're 

732
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,971
actually ill and you've betrayed 
yourself by using that as an excuse not 

733
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:42,940
to pursue your responsibilities and not.
I think if you do both of those,

734
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,870
both of those things happened to you at 
the same time.

735
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:49,871
You're in real trouble.
It's really hard not to have that 

736
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:50,270
happen.
So anyways,

737
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,420
Pinocchio gets enticed into believing 
that he's the victim.

738
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:59,170
The fact that he's insufficient is used 
as an excuse by the Fox and the and the 

739
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:04,160
cat to offer him a trip to pleasure 
island,

740
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,220
and this is I think where the movie gets
particularly dark and so off they go 

741
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,220
singing away.

742
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:14,260
They have to carry them.
So you could say in some sense he's 

743
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,030
carried by societal pathology and his 
own trouble.

744
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,870
He's carried like a puppet off to 
pleasure island.

745
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,330
And so the cricket,
the cricket is again left behind.

746
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,880
He's not the world's best conscience at 
this point,

747
00:41:28,881 --> 00:41:33,881
so we don't do it.
Goes off to meet the coachman and the 

748
00:41:33,881 --> 00:41:37,211
coachman has already said he's 
collecting bad little boys and he's,

749
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,040
he's,
he's got them on the coach.

750
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:45,041
They're all delinquent types here.
The ticket on the coach was the ace of 

751
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:49,181
spades,
which is what Pinocchio is holding and 

752
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:50,570
he's with this character here called 
lamp wick.

753
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,910
That's an interesting name.
So he's the,

754
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:58,360
he's the thing that Burns in the middle 
of a light lamp wick and that's 

755
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,570
interesting because it's a play on 
Lucifer.

756
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:04,310
Lucifer means bringer of light.
And so lamp wick is a play on that.

757
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,910
And lamb pork is really a nasty piece of
work.

758
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:12,170
He's got this false arrogance about him.
He's got this like cynical voice,

759
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:14,240
really deeply cynical voice and he's 
only,

760
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,040
I don't know how old he is supposed to 
be in this,

761
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:20,670
maybe 12 or something like that are 13.
And so he's one of those kids who's,

762
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,670
who's become prematurely cynical.

763
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,880
I'll tell you a story about that.
So I used to live in Montreal.

764
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,580
Um,
I lived in a poor neighborhood and uh,

765
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:39,220
one day I was out in the back alley 
building a fence because I was putting 

766
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,771
little fence around my,
my little tiny backyard and there was a 

767
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:44,510
house across the alley down the street a
ways where there is a lot of,

768
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,890
like not good partying.
Lot of bikers are hanging around there.

769
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,860
And I knew there was a little kid that 
lived there as well.

770
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,990
Anyways,
I was out there in the back alley,

771
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:59,020
pounding away on my fence and these 
little kids came up and they were 

772
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,020
little.
They were like three and four years old.

773
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,160
Hey.
And they spoke a Jew.

774
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:06,161
All right?
Kinda a really heavily accented 

775
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:09,911
Quebecois French and so on.
My French isn't good so I could hardly 

776
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:11,390
understand them,
but they were what they were watching me

777
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:14,170
hammer and they got a little closer and 
they had one,

778
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,360
one kid who was clearly the leader had a
real scowl on his face.

779
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:22,990
And so they were watching and I kind of 
motioned to one of them that they could 

780
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,010
use the hammer and that kid said,
uh,

781
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,400
and I,
I'm gonna mangle this,

782
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:27,380
but he says you have olay or something 
like that.

783
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:31,580
And what it meant is I'll steal that.
And so I thought,

784
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:36,670
you know,
and then he came over and he tugged on 

785
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,201
it and he wanted me to take it and he 
was quite angry and while I was wasn't 

786
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:38,600
gonna let them take it.
And then so,

787
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,990
so I couldn't engage them.
I couldn't get them to play,

788
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:47,050
you know?
And his buddies were sort of hanging 

789
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:47,150
around behind him and they wouldn't come
and play because he wouldn't.

790
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,480
And so he was hostile right away to me.
And then so the finance piece was laying

791
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:58,010
out in the La and these little monsters 
started running across it,

792
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,490
which I thought was really remarkable,
you know?

793
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:05,770
But it was terrible at the same time 
because they were really little kids 

794
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,910
that shouldn't be happening when you're 
like three or four if that's happening 

795
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,910
at that age.
Things are not good.

796
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,980
And so that kid was already like,
seriously not happy with the world and 

797
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:20,530
you know,
I'd been studying antisocial behavior 

798
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,530
for a long time by that point.
And I knew that the kids who are 

799
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,591
destined to jail later in their lives,
our kids who are rough and tough when 

800
00:44:26,591 --> 00:44:29,570
they're two years old but then don't get
socialized or maybe worse,

801
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:32,340
they get anti socialized.
Which exactly what happened to this kid.

802
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:37,341
He'd obviously been ignored and abused.
Certainly no one had ever played with 

803
00:44:38,111 --> 00:44:40,680
them in any real way because he,
he wouldn't play.

804
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:45,710
And it's not good.
If a kid is that little and you can't 

805
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,860
get them to play,
something's gone seriously wrong because

806
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:49,290
there are so playful at that age that 
like,

807
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:51,310
it's like 90 percent of them anyway.

808
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,370
So they were running back and forth on 
this fence.

809
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:54,950
I thought stomping on it,
you know,

810
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,790
and I was right there.
I thought,

811
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,260
well,
I.

812
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,760
First of all,
I thought that was remarkable,

813
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,490
but I also thought it was absolutely 
horrifying because,

814
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,130
you know,
in some sense I could see where this kid

815
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:08,940
was headed and why at that early stage 
in his life it's really,

816
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,180
it's not a pleasant thing to behold.
You know,

817
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,950
like there was nothing that could be 
done about it.

818
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:15,990
And that's Kinda what this lamp wick is 
like.

819
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:20,991
He's prematurely cynical.
This kid was already cynical and he was 

820
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:21,420
like four years old.
You know,

821
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,120
most kids don't get cynical till they're
teenagers,

822
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,760
you know?
And then often they don't get completely

823
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:29,160
cynical and usually they more or less 
grow out of it.

824
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,070
But he had,
it happened him much earlier.

825
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,660
So this lamp,
what character he'd already,

826
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:38,130
he's already decided that he knows 
everything that everyone else is.

827
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:43,430
His opinion is worth nothing and that 
there's nothing in culture society that 

828
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,770
holds any use utility whatsoever for 
someone like him.

829
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,980
Now you can imagine developing that way 
if you were raised in a family where 

830
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,810
people were generally generally lying to
you and that they randomly treated you 

831
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:01,041
or neglected you and that you couldn't 
discern anything about them that was 

832
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:02,220
admirable or positive,
you know,

833
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:07,790
of course you'd assume that the whole 
structure is corrupt and that you had to

834
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:10,230
take care of yourself and no one else 
will not.

835
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:13,080
Of course not everyone assumes that 
under those situations,

836
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,150
I shouldn't say of course,
but it's a.

837
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,390
But it's a logical set of conclusions.
So,

838
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,260
and of course it's proportionate to some
degree to how much abuse you take.

839
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Although there are lots of stories of 
people who've been terribly abused as 

840
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:27,930
children who grew up to be,
you know,

841
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,760
kind,
remarkable,

842
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,480
responsible,
thoughtful people who were absolutely 

843
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,930
opposed to abuse instead of propagating 
it.

844
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,470
There's no direct causal pathway.
Anyways.

845
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:43,410
Lamp Wick is pretty happy to be on this,
uh,

846
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,910
on this coach way to pleasure island,
which has heard about.

847
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:48,570
He said,
well,

848
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,570
it's all you can eat.
It's all you can smoke if you don't have

849
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:53,550
to do any work and you can do anything 
you want.

850
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,010
So you might say,
well,

851
00:46:56,011 --> 00:47:01,011
it's too good to be true like the 
gingerbread house in the Hansel and 

852
00:47:01,011 --> 00:47:01,050
Gretel story.
Right?

853
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,360
And kids are lost.
There's a gingerbread house,

854
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,410
it's a house which is something they 
need and it's made out of cookies.

855
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,200
It looks like it's a little bit too good
to be true.

856
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,440
And of course in the house there's a,
the negative part of that,

857
00:47:13,441 --> 00:47:16,050
which is the old witch who wants to eat 
children.

858
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:21,590
And that's a story about what happens to
people if they're offered more than they

859
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:23,910
should be offered.

860
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,960
So anyways,
lamp wick is firing off a.

861
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,340
He has a little slingshot and he's 
firing off pebbles at the horses who are

862
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,980
pulling the carriage.
And that's just kind of the guy that he 

863
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,640
is.
So he takes Pinocchio under his wing and

864
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,300
the cricket is down there in the dust.
He's caught back up to the carriage,

865
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:47,680
but he's,
uh,

866
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,350
he's in,
he's having a rough time at this point.

867
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,950
This is also a story to some degree 
about the transition into adolescence.

868
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,800
No,
because adolescence is a time people are

869
00:47:56,801 --> 00:48:00,550
still pretty impulsive and their view is
quite short term and they're more likely

870
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:03,520
to pursue immediate pleasures and,
and all of that.

871
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:07,450
And now it can get really out of hand.
So anyways,

872
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,410
they separate from the mainland and go 
on a boat.

873
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,070
And so they're off to pleasure island 
dark place.

874
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:21,540
And uh,
the coachman opens the gates and lets 

875
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,380
the delinquents into pleasure island and
they basically have a riot.

876
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:32,220
And this is pleasure island here.
Uh,

877
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,570
it's full of amusement park rides.
And you know,

878
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,200
one of the things that's kind of 
interesting about horror movies you,

879
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,400
I'm sure you've noticed this,
is that they're often sat at amusement 

880
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,580
parks and clowns are often characters of
horror.

881
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:51,530
We'll leave the clowns aside for now,
but the amusement park thing that's 

882
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,631
pretty interesting.
It's like why in the world would an 

883
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,551
amusement park be a place of horror?
And the first question might be,

884
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:01,860
well have you ever been to an amusement 
park because there is something about 

885
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,410
them that's really,
they have a dark side,

886
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,480
clear dark side,
and part of it is that people with 

887
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,621
nothing better to do or spending money 
stupidly and they're being fleeced by 

888
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:16,300
the people who operate the,
the amusement park,

889
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:21,780
you know,
and they have let's say a 

890
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,610
stereotypically dark reputation and 
they're moving around all the time,

891
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:30,100
which is also something that psychopaths
do and all they're doing is moving from 

892
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,230
community to community and taking the 
money from the rubes fundamentally.

893
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,740
And so the amusement park,
well if you walk through an amusement 

894
00:49:38,711 --> 00:49:43,711
park without sort of thing in mind,
maybe that's also coloring your vision 

895
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:46,420
of course,
but it's something that you can see very

896
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:51,421
immediately.
So there's something about them that's 

897
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:51,421
sort of deeply sad,
but there's also that under,

898
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:55,681
there's an underlying horror that 
characterizes them that it's easy for 

899
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:58,840
horror movie or horror novel writers to 
immediately expand upon.

900
00:49:58,841 --> 00:50:01,870
And there's something about it that that
makes sense to people.

901
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,250
So it's too easy.
Maybe that's.

902
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,740
And it's also all short term 
gratification.

903
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,590
That's the other thing,
so you spend your money very rapidly and

904
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,370
it's gone.
Yep.

905
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:19,360
Yes,
exactly.

906
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:24,361
Well,
that's the impulsive element that the 

907
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:26,040
comment was,
it's a celebration of of meanings 

908
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,040
divorced from reality.
Yeah.

909
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,040
That's.
Well,

910
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,380
it's also outside of reality,
right?

911
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:32,381
That's why it's on an island.
It's a separate universe and it's a 

912
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:36,671
universe where nothing that's happening 
is connected to anything outside and 

913
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,430
you're spending your hard earned money,
let's say,

914
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,450
but it isn't that much.
It's certainly not an investment.

915
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,370
It's not that much different than 
burning it.

916
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,280
What is because of course you get some 
pleasure out of it,

917
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:46,550
but.

918
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:47,690
But

919
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,430
it isn't going with their.
Everyday is probably not the wisest move

920
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:57,431
that you could make.
So the animators do a good job of,

921
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:00,630
of

922
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,730
while I'm presenting the,
what would you call it?

923
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,760
The enforced hedonism.
I guess I would say of a place like 

924
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,551
that.
This is a place where you're going to 

925
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:13,551
have fun.
That's what it's for.

926
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:15,420
So anyways,
lamp wick,

927
00:51:15,421 --> 00:51:19,500
who's got this very arrogant look on his
face and this kind of structure.

928
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,480
It's a.
it's a bravado.

929
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,480
That's what that's called.
It's a false confidence and it's,

930
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:29,540
it's,
it's the sort of thing that people do 

931
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,371
when they're trying to impress upon 
others that they're high in the 

932
00:51:31,371 --> 00:51:31,470
dominance hierarchy,
but really they're not.

933
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,930
So it's a mimicry of,
of dominance,

934
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,500
but it's something that can,
that can be intimidating.

935
00:51:37,501 --> 00:51:38,430
There's no doubt about it.

936
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,380
Um,

937
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,880
I had a friend,
he,

938
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,490
he,
he,

939
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,470
he didn't come to a good end.
This,

940
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,560
this person who was a real good friend 
of mine when I was in junior high and 

941
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,690
high school and he was kind of crazy and
uh,

942
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:01,210
he was tall.
He was about six foot seven and he was 

943
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:02,630
pretty thin and we used to go up to the 
bar now and then.

944
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:05,350
And in many of the bars that we were in 
were in,

945
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:10,390
lived in this little town.
There were bullies and these were guys 

946
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,140
and I worked in the bars and I used to 
watch these guys and they'd basically,

947
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,440
there was a handful of them in town,
pretty psychopathic types,

948
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:20,950
and they'd go to the bar and all they do
is sit there and wait for someone to 

949
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,801
come in who they could beat up and they 
knew who it was as soon as they walked 

950
00:52:23,801 --> 00:52:23,801
in.

951
00:52:23,801 --> 00:52:23,990
That's actually why they were at the 
bar.

952
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,560
And so they'd wait until someone came in
who didn't look very confident and who 

953
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,040
could likely be intimidated by,
by this sort of thing.

954
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:34,520
And then they'd tell him to come outside
for a fight.

955
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:39,521
And if they didn't,
well then they of course make fun of 

956
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:39,521
them.
And if they did well,

957
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:41,960
generally they beat them up.
My friend kind of caught onto this trick

958
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:46,961
and he started going to bars and every 
time that someone like that came near 

959
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:47,660
him,
he'd go outside and fight with them.

960
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:52,780
And one of the things he observed right 
away is that almost inevitably when he 

961
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,320
went outside with them,
they'd shake hands and make friends.

962
00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:00,340
So as soon as he,
and it was really remarkable watching 

963
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,681
him because he wasn't,
he wasn't a particularly physically 

964
00:53:02,681 --> 00:53:03,380
powerful person,
although he was extraordinarily tall,

965
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,740
but he had started to play this game and
he did it for a long time and I don't 

966
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,580
remember him ever actually having to 
fight.

967
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:16,090
He just stared them down fundamentally.
So it was very interesting thing to 

968
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:17,320
watch,
but it,

969
00:53:17,321 --> 00:53:22,321
it,
it was an indication to me of exactly 

970
00:53:22,321 --> 00:53:23,300
how shallow this kind of bravado 
bullying actually is.

971
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:28,870
But people don't.
People don't find that out because they 

972
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,270
won't stand up and it's not surprising,
but

973
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:37,740
anyways,
they load up on Food Pinocchio's 

974
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,380
carrying a Pi and an ice cream cone 
simultaneously and then they're off to 

975
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,130
have a fight and lamp says something 
like,

976
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:48,780
it's good to punch someone in the nose 
sometimes just for the heck of it.

977
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,350
And so Pinocchio adopts this struct and 
then they go to the rough house.

978
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,700
And then in the next scene you see this 
model home up for destruction.

979
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:59,160
It's quite an interesting scene.
Symbolically.

980
00:53:59,161 --> 00:53:59,520
See,

981
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:06,660
in the middle of this house here,
there's a stain glass window that has a 

982
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,770
Mandela on it.
We'll see it more clearly in a minute.

983
00:54:08,771 --> 00:54:11,950
And Amanda Mandela is a sacred symbol of
the self.

984
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,020
That's,
that's the union interpretation.

985
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,660
It's a symbol.
It's very difficult to describe,

986
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:17,740
but it's,
it's a symbol.

987
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,820
Music is a Mandela except it's played 
out across time.

988
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,460
So you could say that that thing is the 
same as music,

989
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,400
but it's Kinda like a slice of music.
It's,

990
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,210
it's,
it's the same idea.

991
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:33,211
You know,
sometimes you see those slow motion or 

992
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:35,830
sped up motion videos of a flower 
unfolding that's the same.

993
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:40,980
It's the same idea.
You can imagine that being set to music 

994
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,681
and somehow that would make sense.
And the Mandela as like a symbol of the 

995
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:47,041
unfolding of being and,
or the source of meaning or something 

996
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:49,120
like that.
And it's also a symbol of the self.

997
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:54,370
I'm from the union perspective.
And so there you see it more clearly.

998
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,500
The kids are starting to burn this place
and,

999
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,070
and trash it and they're dragging a 
grand piano down the,

1000
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,540
down the stairs.
Uh,

1001
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:06,810
the destruction of high culture,
about which they're nothing but cynical 

1002
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,080
because they don't believe that hard 
work and sacrifice can,

1003
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:13,530
can produce something of any value and 
they want to bring it down and destroy 

1004
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:13,690
it.
And that's partly because

1005
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,700
can see this in the story of Cain and 
Abel.

1006
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,980
Table is hard working and everyone likes
him and he makes the proper sacrifices.

1007
00:55:23,981 --> 00:55:28,981
And so his life goes really well.
And that's part of the reason that cain 

1008
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:30,100
hates him and he's jealous and 
resentful.

1009
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:32,410
But worse than that,
if you're around someone,

1010
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:35,650
if you're not doing very well,
especially if that's your own fault.

1011
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,370
If you're not doing very well and you're
around someone who's doing very well,

1012
00:55:39,371 --> 00:55:44,371
it's very painful because the mere fact 
of there being judges you and so it's 

1013
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:50,161
very easy to want to destroy that,
to destroy that ideal so that you don't 

1014
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:54,121
have to live with the terrible 
consequences of seeing it embodied in 

1015
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:57,361
front of you.
And so part of the reason that people 

1016
00:55:57,361 --> 00:56:02,261
want to tear things down is so that they
don't have anything to contrast 

1017
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:06,491
themselves against and to feel bad.
And that's exactly what's happening 

1018
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:09,251
here.
The kids are destroying all of this 

1019
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:12,160
culture,
roughly speaking because it judges them 

1020
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,110
the fact that it exists,
judges them.

1021
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:19,290
And I've often thought this about 
Michelangelo Statue of David,

1022
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,170
which is this heroic.
So David was a shepherd,

1023
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:23,980
obviously it

1024
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,610
doesn't sound like much,
but back in those times being a shepherd

1025
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:32,611
was a big deal because there were lions 
and you had a slingshot and so like you 

1026
00:56:32,611 --> 00:56:35,200
got to defend your sheep from lions with
a slingshot.

1027
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:39,370
So you weren't exactly this 19th century
English guy dressed in a,

1028
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,080
you know,
fairly blue suit.

1029
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:46,530
You were tough as a bloody well as 
someone who would go after lion with a 

1030
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,830
slingshot.
It's no joke.

1031
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,350
Anyways,
the statue is very heroic and you know,

1032
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:51,400
when you look at that,
you think,

1033
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:54,160
well that's the possibility of,
of humankind.

1034
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,620
But by the same token,
it's also what you're not.

1035
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,390
And so as well as being an ideal,
it's a judge and every ideal is a judge.

1036
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,590
So yes.

1037
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,050
Yep.
So you're,

1038
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:13,210
you're using that as an example to 
illustrate becoming fitter as a result 

1039
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,000
of not being able to achieve.
Sure.

1040
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:24,010
A status as a result,
success even faster as a result of hard 

1041
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:24,890
work,
but in the example of Canaan,

1042
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:25,410
April.
Yeah,

1043
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,710
like one was a shepherd and there was a 
farmer and the one who knows no one is.

1044
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:31,470
Yes,
that's right.

1045
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,900
Yes.
Who was the shepherd?

1046
00:57:32,901 --> 00:57:34,680
Was the one who was favorite,
right.

1047
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:40,450
Was that a result of the hard work or 
was that a result of good question?

1048
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,280
The stories as well.
That's a good question.

1049
00:57:43,281 --> 00:57:48,281
Those stories are very,
very complicated and the story is very 

1050
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:51,080
ambivalent about whether Kane is not 
rewarded because he makes bad sacrifices

1051
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:54,720
are because God's just in a bad mood and
I like that.

1052
00:57:55,130 --> 00:58:00,130
If you read the story,
I've read multiple translations of the 

1053
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,210
story.
When cain comes to God to complain,

1054
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:04,700
God basically tells him,
look,

1055
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:10,030
buddy,
before you go about criticizing the 

1056
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:13,511
structure of reality,
you should look to your own 

1057
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:13,511
inadequacies.

1058
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:16,630
He says,
Sin Crouches at your door like a 

1059
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,301
predatory sexually aroused animal,
and you invited it in to have its way 

1060
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:23,921
with you.
And something has emerged as a 

1061
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:26,111
consequence.
So be bothered me about my creation 

1062
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:29,141
before you look to yourself.
So there's a very strong hint that the 

1063
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:33,851
reason that God has not favored cane 
sacrifices because they weren't a 

1064
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:36,130
particularly good quality,
so but that,

1065
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:41,190
but it is ambivalent in the story and 
there is the shepherd versus farmer 

1066
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,250
Motif as well and of course that Motif 
runs through the whole entire corpus of 

1067
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,090
stories to some degree,
especially the shepherd motif.

1068
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:52,630
So it's only about a paragraph long,
that whole story and it packs all that 

1069
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,210
into that tiny little amount of space.
But the,

1070
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:00,500
the idea that cain kills able to get rid
of his ideal and also to punish God.

1071
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,870
Roughly speaking.
It's a brilliant story.

1072
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:08,620
I mean these guys who go around shooting
up high schools are shooting up high 

1073
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,140
schools in particular,
but there are definitely out for revenge

1074
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:17,200
and what their revenging themselves 
against or to who is not exactly clear 

1075
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,010
anyways.
So these kids are just tearing down this

1076
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:24,011
model.
Home tearing Western civilization I 

1077
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:26,030
suppose is another way of looking at or 
just tearing down civilization period.

1078
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,280
And Pinocchio Pinocchio's having a 
pretty good time.

1079
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:31,160
He's got his ax and he's looking a 
little malevolent level in there.

1080
00:59:31,161 --> 00:59:34,190
And,
and happy to be destroying things,

1081
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:36,470
which is of course a pretty simple thing
to do.

1082
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:41,740
So there's that image that I told you 
about the Mandela that's a flower in 

1083
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,540
this image.
And so what happens is that,

1084
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:49,610
uh,
I think it's lamp life throws a brick 

1085
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:50,080
through it.
And so what that means symbolically,

1086
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:54,350
this the self is a symbol of your 
potential among very many other things.

1087
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,070
But by engaging in this sort of 
impulsive,

1088
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:00,020
destructive activity,
lamp,

1089
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:00,830
Wick,
and Pinocchio,

1090
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,440
or making it impossible for them to 
further their development.

1091
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,540
And they're doing that to some degree 
consciously,

1092
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:10,541
you know,
they basically say to hell with it and 

1093
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:11,900
toss a brick through this highest ideal,
the thing through which light shines.

1094
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:15,470
So also that hearkens back to the,
to the stars.

1095
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,040
Well,
so anyways,

1096
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,640
the coachman is paying attention to all 
this and he's actually pretty happy 

1097
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,941
about the fact that these boys are so 
involved in their stupid amusements 

1098
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:28,280
that,
um,

1099
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,060
that they're not paying any attention to
what's actually going on.

1100
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,340
And he calls these people out of the 
darkness,

1101
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:37,520
these creatures out of the darkness.
So you get these black,

1102
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:42,610
you can hardly see them there,
but there are black cloak figures with 

1103
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,880
glowing eyes and there are shutting the 
door of the,

1104
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,040
of the amusement park.

1105
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:52,030
That's very interesting.
It's an extraordinarily interesting 

1106
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:52,030
happening.
It's like,

1107
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,240
okay.
So all of a sudden the amusement park is

1108
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:58,241
associate.
We already know that the coachman is up 

1109
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:00,161
to no good,
but now he's got these minions that are 

1110
01:01:00,161 --> 01:01:02,860
faceless and in some sense they're 
clearly creatures of the night and 

1111
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,010
they're up to no good.
And so you have the sense that,

1112
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:08,240
that the boys are being offered bread,
bread and circuses,

1113
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:10,370
roughly speaking,
but there's something,

1114
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,360
there's a real reason for it.
There's a manipulative reason for it.

1115
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,280
They're being enticed into a trap and 
uh,

1116
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:21,790
the doors are closed and these 
underground beings are involved in the 

1117
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:22,300
plot.
And,

1118
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:24,920
and obviously the coach went understands
this perfectly well.

1119
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:29,921
And so one of the ways to understand 
this is to think about what totalitarian

1120
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:33,950
states have to offer their populous and 
what they offered them.

1121
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:36,020
And this happened particularly as Rome 
declined.

1122
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:39,650
Let's say that's where the term bread 
and circuses originally came from,

1123
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:44,651
is that as the situation regenerates,
then people have to be offered stupid 

1124
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:50,111
amusements more and more frequently in 
order to for them to ignore what's 

1125
01:01:50,111 --> 01:01:54,701
actually going on in the background and 
you know a war can be that kind of 

1126
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:56,600
stupid amusement.
Anyways.

1127
01:01:56,601 --> 01:02:01,601
The next later that night,
the entire place is completely 

1128
01:02:01,601 --> 01:02:04,271
devastated and all we see as the 
wreckage of everything that was there 

1129
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:08,111
before and again in the cricket has got 
separated from Pinocchio and so he's 

1130
01:02:08,111 --> 01:02:10,670
trying to find a mentor.
Pinocchio ends up in this.

1131
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,420
This bar that's shaped like an eight 
ball,

1132
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:19,590
eight ball is kind of the random ball in
in pool and anyways,

1133
01:02:19,591 --> 01:02:20,130
he's inside

1134
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:25,130
the eight ball and he's shooting pool 
with with lamp wick and that's just 

1135
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,950
another indication of wasting his time.
Basically.

1136
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:33,050
You can see in the forefront there,
there's some cards for gambling and so 

1137
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,180
he's engaged in these sort of a,
you might say pointless.

1138
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,720
He don't want it pursuits and he's a 
enticing Pinocchio along the same route 

1139
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:47,511
and so he teaches him to smoke first.
That doesn't go very well,

1140
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
so Pinocchio takes a huge drag on a 
cigar and it just about kills them and 

1141
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:56,610
uh,
wouldn't amp quick asks him how he likes

1142
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:58,230
it.
He shakes his head and says,

1143
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:59,180
you know,
that it's really,

1144
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:04,220
it was really quite good,
but he's so sick that he can hardly 

1145
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,371
stand up and he's hallucinating double 
balls on the pool table and then the 

1146
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:12,261
cricket shows up and stands on the eight
ball and kind of gives one of those 

1147
01:03:12,261 --> 01:03:12,261
declamatory speeches again,
you know,

1148
01:03:12,261 --> 01:03:17,190
because he still hasn't quite figured 
out that standing up proud and spouting 

1149
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:21,870
off the rules isn't exactly the right 
way for the conscience to behave.

1150
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:26,010
And a lamp wick picks him up by the 
scruff of the neck,

1151
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,110
roughly speaking.
First of all,

1152
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:33,111
I asked who he is.
So obviously he's divorced from his own 

1153
01:03:33,111 --> 01:03:36,771
conscience and then makes fun of 
Pinocchio for paying attention to this 

1154
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,821
little bug.
And that's kind of a nice indication of 

1155
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:41,480
what happens in adolescence,
you know,

1156
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:45,480
because of course,
as children move away from their parents

1157
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:50,481
and into their groups,
especially when the groups are 

1158
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:53,601
misbehaving,
often what happens is that the other 

1159
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:56,511
members of the group will torture a 
person who isn't willing to try 

1160
01:03:56,511 --> 01:04:00,081
something dangerous or foolish by making
fun of the fact that they're too 

1161
01:04:00,081 --> 01:04:05,040
attached to their conscience.
And there's a positive element to that 

1162
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,340
because you shouldn't take some risks 
when you're a teenager and also later in

1163
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:10,650
life.
And so if you won't take any risks,

1164
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:11,970
there's actually something wrong with 
you.

1165
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,670
But there's a negative element in that.
Well,

1166
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:20,450
you know,
teenagers do all sorts of stupid things 

1167
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:21,270
and perhaps it's amazing that we all 
lived through it actually,

1168
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:25,050
as far as I'm concerned.
Some people take extraordinary risks,

1169
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:29,490
extraordinary risks,
and they don't make it through at all.

1170
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:34,230
Or they end up in the permanently 
antisocial population.

1171
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:35,660
And then they're,
you know,

1172
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,880
basically career criminals,
five percent of the criminals commit 95 

1173
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:44,190
percent of the crimes.
It's another prieto distribution.

1174
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:49,850
So anyways,
lamp isn't going to listen to Pinocchio 

1175
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:55,430
or to the cricket,
he laughs out of him with his kind of 

1176
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,000
breaking laugh,
which is some foreshadowing and uh,

1177
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:01,610
the cricket gets all upset,
puts his coat on backwards and ends up 

1178
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:04,980
dumped down a pool table hole and uh,
otherwise abused.

1179
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:09,981
And so he stomps on out of their details
Pinocchio that he can take care of 

1180
01:05:09,981 --> 01:05:10,170
himself and he stomps on out of there.

1181
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:15,410
And so Pinocchio is left without the 
guidance of conscience and the cricket 

1182
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:16,680
is trying to figure out how to get off 
pleasure island,

1183
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:21,820
but he goes through the gates and he 
sees what's actually going on.

1184
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:28,130
And what's going on is that the coach 
when has this like slave boat down in 

1185
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:31,800
the bowels of the island and he's got 
all these,

1186
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,120
these black suited minions with glowing 
eyes working for him and they're 

1187
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:41,581
rounding up what looked like donkeys.
And so there are beasts of burden,

1188
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:47,041
right?
And so there's an idea here that if you 

1189
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:49,681
produce,
if you pursue impulsive pleasure to the 

1190
01:05:49,681 --> 01:05:50,170
detriment of the development of your 
character,

1191
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,150
you're going to end up a beast of 
burden.

1192
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:56,290
You're going to end up a slave to a 
tyrant and that's exactly right,

1193
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:59,080
and so anyways,
other cricket doesn't.

1194
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:02,110
You can see one of those black suited 
horrors here,

1195
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:08,190
hauling donkeys out of this crate and 
one of them has a hat on and they looked

1196
01:06:08,371 --> 01:06:11,350
very sad and they're in different crates
and one of them says,

1197
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:14,290
sold to the salt mines and one says sold
to the circus,

1198
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:18,880
and so they're shipped off to be to be 
slaves roughly speaking,

1199
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:23,610
and they look very sad and then one of 
them gets hauled out of a crate and he's

1200
01:06:23,611 --> 01:06:24,340
still got a hat.

1201
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:27,670
He has a hat on and a sweater and he can
still talk.

1202
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:33,090
He's a boy.
It turns out that's been half 

1203
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,920
transformed into a jackass,
a jackass prior to being enslaved.

1204
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:40,921
And so that's.
That's another thing that's quite 

1205
01:06:40,921 --> 01:06:40,921
interesting about the story.
You know,

1206
01:06:40,921 --> 01:06:40,921
it,
it.

1207
01:06:40,921 --> 01:06:44,880
It also makes the case that if you 
replace your voice with stupid brain,

1208
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:50,370
that the probability that you're going 
to become enslaved by a tyrant is 

1209
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:54,151
extraordinarily high and I always can't 
help but think about idiot idiot logs in

1210
01:06:55,121 --> 01:07:00,121
that manner.
No Solzhenitsyn wrote about the radical 

1211
01:07:00,121 --> 01:07:02,020
left ideologues that got thrown in the 
Gulag archipelago,

1212
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,970
you know,
so they were part party stalwarts.

1213
01:07:03,971 --> 01:07:08,971
This happened to a lot of people,
true believers who are vacuumed up by 

1214
01:07:08,971 --> 01:07:10,990
this machine and thrown in,
thrown into the Gulag anyways.

1215
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:16,410
And he said that those people suffered 
in some ways more than everyone else 

1216
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:17,590
because what did he say?

1217
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:20,020
They were bit by the beloved hand that 
fed them.

1218
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,180
And so the first while when they were in
the camps,

1219
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:27,210
Solzhenitsyn really didn't know what to 
do with people like that because on the 

1220
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,821
one hand while they were in the camps 
and wasn't that awful and they'd been 

1221
01:07:29,821 --> 01:07:30,280
torn away from their families and you 
know,

1222
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:34,330
stripped of all their identity and their
status and so that's pretty rough.

1223
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:37,090
But on other hand they were writing 
letters,

1224
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:42,120
protesting their innocence and assuming 
that everyone else in the camp was 

1225
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,181
guilty but they were innocent and they 
were still strident believers in the 

1226
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:47,340
communist process.
And so you know,

1227
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:50,890
it was a conundrum here,
they are being terribly punished,

1228
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:54,490
but by the same token there are also the
perpetrators have their own device,

1229
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:57,910
so how do you deal with them?
And they used to play comrades,

1230
01:07:57,911 --> 01:08:02,050
he said they used to play comrades with 
people like that and invite them into an

1231
01:08:02,051 --> 01:08:07,051
ideological discussion about the camp 
situation and the situation in the 

1232
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:10,891
country as a whole and let them rattle 
out their ideological justification for 

1233
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:17,210
everything that had happened in trying 
to make them parody themselves.

1234
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:22,510
Roughly speaking,
it was a rough game and units and also 

1235
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:22,510
concluded that

1236
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:30,700
there is no helping someone like that 
when they were still ensconced inside 

1237
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:35,021
that brain ideology.
You can predict everything they were 

1238
01:08:35,021 --> 01:08:35,450
going to say.
It's like someone had a crank,

1239
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,960
you could just crank it and out would 
come the proper ideological formulas.

1240
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:41,180
But then he realized that as soon as 
they,

1241
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,640
let's call it,
repented of that and started to realize 

1242
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,410
they're their own role in it or the era 
of the system,

1243
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:51,590
then he would start communicating with 
them.

1244
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,910
You know,
as if they were people who who you could

1245
01:08:55,911 --> 01:08:57,500
communicate with.
Yeah.

1246
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:00,020
So that was very interesting as far as 
I'm concerned.

1247
01:09:00,021 --> 01:09:02,630
Anyways,
this kid is still a little bit human.

1248
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:07,631
He starts to cry for his mom and the 
coachman basically throws them back into

1249
01:09:07,671 --> 01:09:09,530
the crate and says that he's not ready 
yet.

1250
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,300
And the reason for that is that he could
still,

1251
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,210
he still had the power of independent 
speech.

1252
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:19,630
You remember right at the beginning of 
the movie when the mouth was painted on 

1253
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:22,520
Pinocchio,
we saw that mask that was really glaring

1254
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:27,521
at the process and I said that character
recurs continually throughout the movie 

1255
01:09:27,521 --> 01:09:31,631
and is a good example of that because 
the coach is the enemy of anything that 

1256
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:33,570
has its own voice.
So he's the anti Japan.

1257
01:09:33,571 --> 01:09:35,030
Oh,
that's a good way of thinking about it.

1258
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,030
He's the tyrannical aspect of the 
culture.

1259
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:42,830
But as in so far as one of these,
mostly donkey's,

1260
01:09:42,831 --> 01:09:47,630
mostly Jack assets can still talk then 
they're not completely fit for slavery.

1261
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:53,410
And you remember,
this movie was also being made at about 

1262
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:53,410
the same time that,
um,

1263
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,150
the Nazi transformation of Germany was 
taking place.

1264
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:59,120
And so all these terrible underground 
things,

1265
01:09:59,180 --> 01:09:59,930
you know,
this,

1266
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:04,990
this process whereby people were being 
reduced to two ideological slave say and

1267
01:10:06,771 --> 01:10:10,760
in this terrible process that was all 
playing out in Europe in a very big way.

1268
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:14,510
And it's not like people weren't aware 
of that,

1269
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:16,460
you know,
it was in there.

1270
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:17,720
So

1271
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,280
anyways,
the donkey's,

1272
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:27,690
the jackasses that can still talk,
her crying and complaining and repenting

1273
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:32,160
and the coachman turns into a full Kyron
again and cracks the whip,

1274
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:33,540
if I remember correctly,
and says,

1275
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:35,640
you've had your fun and now you're going
to pay for it.

1276
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:39,270
So the cricket gets word of all this.
He gets wind of it.

1277
01:10:39,271 --> 01:10:44,271
He starts to understand what's happened 
is that all these bad kids were enticed 

1278
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:46,170
out onto this island so that they could 
be enslaved.

1279
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,130
And he's really taken aback by that to 
say the least,

1280
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:53,970
but he realizes what's going on.
So He runs back to find Pinocchio.

1281
01:10:53,971 --> 01:10:58,971
And then the scene switches back to the 
eight ball bar where I'm lamp wick is 

1282
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:03,210
drinking beer and complaining about what
the conscience said,

1283
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:05,250
you know,
because he's kind of guilty and ashamed,

1284
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:07,440
but he won't admit it because he doesn't
admit anything.

1285
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,440
He knows everything.
He's not going to admit anything about 

1286
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,481
himself that isn't perfect.
He's a real totalitarian training and he

1287
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:18,030
drinks this beer and he's laughing about
the conscience and putting them down.

1288
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,710
And then he says,
well,

1289
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,640
what?
What is,

1290
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,110
what does he say?
Exactly?

1291
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,170
What does he think?
I am a jackass or something like that.

1292
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,550
Maybe that's not the words.
Exactly.

1293
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:30,720
And then he grows these,
these ears from Pinocchio,

1294
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:34,020
sees that and immediately takes a look 
at the beer and stops drinking it.

1295
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:38,130
And then lamp,
quick transforms one more time.

1296
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:40,230
And his face turns into the face of a 
donkey.

1297
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:42,360
And he's laughing still.
And then his,

1298
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,280
his hands.
Oh yes.

1299
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:46,830
He laughs suddenly starts to bray like 
a,

1300
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:49,050
like a jackass.
And he's horrified by that.

1301
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:53,580
And then Pinocchio laughs and the brain 
comes out as well.

1302
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:58,581
And so now they're absolutely horrified 
and lamp luck actually figures out 

1303
01:11:58,581 --> 01:11:58,581
what's going on.

1304
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:02,810
He figures out that he's been tricked 
and that he's transforming and he's 

1305
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:04,950
completely horrified by it.
He becomes conscious of what's happening

1306
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:09,951
to them.
And there's one particularly I would 

1307
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,291
say,
dramatic scene where his hands have 

1308
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,470
transformed in hooves and he's kicking 
and,

1309
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,730
and,
and,

1310
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,880
and a leaping around the room and panic 
and he comes up to a mirror and sees 

1311
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,471
himself as a Jack Ass.
And then he turns around and breaks the 

1312
01:12:24,471 --> 01:12:24,471
mirror.
And so,

1313
01:12:24,471 --> 01:12:25,020
you know,
he's self conscious for a moment.

1314
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:30,021
Then he destroys his capacity for self 
consciousness that he transforms 

1315
01:12:30,021 --> 01:12:33,531
entirely into a jackass.
He's farther down the road than 

1316
01:12:33,531 --> 01:12:36,651
Pinocchio and he comes crawling to 
Pinocchio to save him and asks that the 

1317
01:12:36,651 --> 01:12:39,060
conscience comes back so that he can get
out of this.

1318
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:44,061
But of course it's a bit too late.
And so then UN occhio grows jackass ears

1319
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,000
and he's absolutely terrified by it as 
well.

1320
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:51,710
He knows what's coming and the cricut 
comes back and,

1321
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:54,060
and guides them off.
Pleasure island.

1322
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,860
And so then they end up on a cliff 
because this is an island after all,

1323
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:03,980
and they have to jump into the unknown,
right out of this impulsive adolescent,

1324
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:09,570
he dominic playground into the unknown.
And that's how they escape.

1325
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,660
So that's the first time that Pinocchio 
has to leave,

1326
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:18,860
that,
that this is the first scene where he 

1327
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,910
has to jump into the water to make a 
clean break from something pathological.

1328
01:13:20,911 --> 01:13:25,911
So tyranny,
you see this echoed you see echoes of 

1329
01:13:25,911 --> 01:13:26,880
this in the story of Moses leading his 
people from,

1330
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:30,240
from Egypt.
Because Moses is a master of water,

1331
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:35,780
right?
If he hits this rock with a stick and 

1332
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,751
water comes out of it and he's floating 
on water when he's an infant and he 

1333
01:13:38,751 --> 01:13:42,771
parts the Red Sea.
And so he's a master of water and 

1334
01:13:42,771 --> 01:13:42,771
transformation.

1335
01:13:42,771 --> 01:13:43,170
And the Pharaoh is in the Pharaoh's 
kingdom,

1336
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:46,500
is represented as a desert stone,
roughly speaking.

1337
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:49,500
And so the idea there is that,
well,

1338
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:53,580
the kingdom is solid ground,
but it can be a tyranny.

1339
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:57,390
And the water is chaos,
but it can be the thing that you have to

1340
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:59,610
leap into to free yourself from the 
tyranny.

1341
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:02,100
It's not like in the Moses story that 
that comes easy,

1342
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:07,101
right?
Because the the Hebrews leave Israel 

1343
01:14:07,101 --> 01:14:09,951
with or leave Egypt,
which is a terrible tyranny and you 

1344
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:09,951
think,
well that's good.

1345
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:11,500
They've escaped from the tyranny,
but that isn't what happens.

1346
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,040
They escaped

1347
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,780
from the tyranny of the actually end up 
somewhere,

1348
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:18,040
arguably worse because they're wandering
around in the desert for 40 years.

1349
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:23,550
And that's.
It's a brilliant element of that story 

1350
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,210
because it states clearly that when you 
go from a bad place to a better place,

1351
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:29,290
you go to a worst place first and that's
a great.

1352
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:34,650
It's a great thing to know because it 
also tells you why you might be 

1353
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,000
unwilling to take the next step.
You know you're aiming up,

1354
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:42,030
but in order to aim up,
you have to let go of something you 

1355
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:43,930
already have and then that'll put you 
into a state of chaos.

1356
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:47,950
And unless you're willing to undergo 
that intermediary state of chaos and you

1357
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:50,830
might not recover from it,
you're not going to get to the next,

1358
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,720
you're not going to get to the next 
level.

1359
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,240
So.
So that's rough.

1360
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,170
Well,
so Pinocchio,

1361
01:14:56,171 --> 01:15:01,171
he decides that chaos is better than 
tyranny and guided by his conscience 

1362
01:15:01,171 --> 01:15:04,861
jumps into the water and then we don't 
see anything happening in the water in 

1363
01:15:04,861 --> 01:15:07,630
this particular scene,
they come back to shore,

1364
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:13,320
all half drowned and an exhausted by 
their adventure and they go back home.

1365
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,960
And I think maybe we'll take a break 
now.

1366
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,890
Let's see.
This is a good time to take a break.

1367
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,720
One 30.
Perfect.

1368
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,210
So let's break for 15 minutes.
Okay.

1369
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:30,040
Alright.
Alright.

1370
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:35,100
So Carl Jung talked about this 
phenomena.

1371
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,780
He cried phenomenon.
He

1372
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:50,440
described as a retrogressive restoration
of the persona.

1373
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:57,450
And so it's a complicated idea,
but basically what it means is that 

1374
01:15:57,450 --> 01:16:00,970
sometimes you take a leap forward and 
you learn some things,

1375
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:05,971
but you can't catalyze a new identity.
So you try to go back and hide in your 

1376
01:16:05,971 --> 01:16:09,661
old identity and that actually doesn't 
work because while things have changed 

1377
01:16:11,711 --> 01:16:16,711
and you've learned something and that 
isn't who you are anymore and so it's 

1378
01:16:16,711 --> 01:16:20,581
like you have to cut part parts of 
yourself off in a destructive manner to 

1379
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:25,171
fit back into the person that you were.
Now What happens here is that Pinocchio 

1380
01:16:25,171 --> 01:16:29,610
escapes from this tyrannical situation 
and undergoes this descend into chaos,

1381
01:16:30,971 --> 01:16:35,971
but he tries to go back home.
He tries to go back to what he was and 

1382
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:38,410
he can't do that anymore as far there 
isn't at home anymore.

1383
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:43,540
And so.
So when he goes home,

1384
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,730
he finds that there's no home there.

1385
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:51,550
Now this happens to people sometimes in 
soft and a shock to them.

1386
01:16:51,551 --> 01:16:55,660
So one of the things I've noticed about 
Peter Pan type,

1387
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:01,000
I'm going to speak about men here 
because I've observed it more in men,

1388
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:06,460
is that they often stay under the thumb 
of their father and you think,

1389
01:17:06,461 --> 01:17:11,461
well why would someone do that?
Because it means they're subject to the 

1390
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:15,911
tyrannical judgment of their father.
They're always concerned about what 

1391
01:17:15,911 --> 01:17:18,911
their father would think or whether 
their father approves of it and so 

1392
01:17:18,911 --> 01:17:19,880
forth,
and you think,

1393
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:24,881
well,
that's got to be an unpleasant place to 

1394
01:17:24,881 --> 01:17:26,120
be.
Why would you do that?

1395
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:31,280
One of the things that I've suggested to
my clients and to other people sometimes

1396
01:17:31,281 --> 01:17:34,170
is that here's a weird little exercise 
that you can undertake.

1397
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:39,171
A little thought experiment.
So you have your parents and of course 

1398
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:45,521
your parents have friends who are about 
their age and maybe some of them are 

1399
01:17:45,521 --> 01:17:45,770
people you only know peripherally.

1400
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,840
And I might ask you,
well,

1401
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:53,550
do you care more about what your parents
think than you care about what these 

1402
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:54,470
peripheral people who know your parents 
think?

1403
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,690
And then the answer to that is,
well,

1404
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:59,540
of course.
And then the question that arises out of

1405
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:04,450
that is why.
I mean,

1406
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:09,460
for someone else,
your parents are the peripheral people 

1407
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:09,460
and their parents are central.
Like,

1408
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:14,530
why is it logical that your parents make
opinion makes any difference to you than

1409
01:18:14,901 --> 01:18:16,220
the appearance,
than the,

1410
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,240
uh,
uh,

1411
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:21,890
the opinion of some randomly selected 
people who are approximately that age.

1412
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:27,520
Why is it the case that you would 
consider that they would know more than 

1413
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:27,520
someone else?
I mean,

1414
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,160
I know they know you better and fair 
enough,

1415
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:33,161
but that that's not the point.
And then another point there is that to 

1416
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:38,291
the degree that your parents opinion 
about you matters more than some 

1417
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:39,950
randomly selected,
people have approximately the same age.

1418
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:41,510
Young would say,
well,

1419
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:46,930
you haven't exactly separated out the 
God the image from your parents and so 

1420
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,160
you're still under that,
that combination.

1421
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:52,490
It's like a complicated thing to talk 
about,

1422
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:57,110
but think about the Harry Potter series.
Harry has two sets of parents,

1423
01:18:57,111 --> 01:19:02,111
right?
He's got the dearsley parents and then 

1424
01:19:02,111 --> 01:19:03,851
he's got these like magical parents that
sort of float behind and he should know 

1425
01:19:03,851 --> 01:19:05,930
the difference between them.
They shouldn't be one in the same.

1426
01:19:05,931 --> 01:19:08,840
They're not for him and it's like,
well,

1427
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:13,841
you have your parents and you have 
nature and culture as parents and you 

1428
01:19:13,841 --> 01:19:14,990
shouldn't be thinking that your parents 
are nature and culture as well.

1429
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:20,200
It shouldn't have final dominion over 
you means that you're not an individual 

1430
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:20,270
yet.
If that's the case.

1431
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:21,800
Freud said,
for example,

1432
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:22,370
that,
no,

1433
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,580
no,
no one could be a man in les.

1434
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:28,100
His father had died and young said,
yes,

1435
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:30,320
but that death can take place 
symbolically.

1436
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:33,020
Okay,
so there's that part of the idea,

1437
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:38,021
and then another part of the idea is one
of the times in your life when you 

1438
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:43,571
actually realize that you're an 
individual is when you'll go and ask 

1439
01:19:43,571 --> 01:19:47,291
your parents something and you'll 
realize they actually don't know any 

1440
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:48,290
more about what you should do.
Then you do,

1441
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
and that sucks and that's partly why 
people are often willing to maintain a 

1442
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,550
tyrant slave relationship with their 
father.

1443
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:00,560
It's like on the one hand,
you have to be inferior in a 

1444
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,391
relationship like that.
You know you've always got the judge 

1445
01:20:04,391 --> 01:20:04,391
watching you,
but another hand,

1446
01:20:04,391 --> 01:20:05,900
there's always someone who knows what to
do.

1447
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:10,530
There's always standing between you and 
the unknown that you can go ask,

1448
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:11,910
what should I do?
Well,

1449
01:20:11,911 --> 01:20:16,911
at some point you'll realize that the 
reason you can't ask that anymore is 

1450
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:17,460
because they actually don't know any 
more than you do,

1451
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,840
and then that's a pain like that.

1452
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:24,980
That is a symbolic death.
Now it's also when you establish a more 

1453
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,340
individual relationship with your 
parents,

1454
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:31,430
it's at that point that you could 
conceivably start taking care of them 

1455
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:32,610
instead of the reverse and that's a time
that should come,

1456
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:37,260
but you have to let that image of 
perfection go and that exposes you.

1457
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:39,330
Well,
that's what happens here.

1458
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:44,480
You know,
Pinocchio goes home and he wants things 

1459
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,261
to be the way they were and he wants to 
stay under the careful care of the 

1460
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:51,090
benevolent father,
but that's no longer possible.

1461
01:20:51,091 --> 01:20:56,091
He's past that point and that's why the 
father has disappeared and so Japan has 

1462
01:20:57,031 --> 01:21:00,020
gone off to look for Pinocchio because 
he also needs the sun.

1463
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:03,150
But,
but in any case,

1464
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:08,151
the house is abandoned and so then we 
see inside the house that everything's 

1465
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:12,660
covered with cobwebs and everything's 
gone in Pinocchio and the cricket sit on

1466
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:14,160
the steps and they're very concerned.

1467
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,870
First of all,
they wonder where he went.

1468
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,790
So they're actually concerned that he's 
gone,

1469
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:21,180
but they also don't know what to do 
because there's just no going home.

1470
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,640
And so,
you know,

1471
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:27,000
that's also the case that once you hit a
certain point in your development,

1472
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:33,050
well it's the same thing we already 
talked about the answers that you're 

1473
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,050
looking for are not going to be found in
your parents house.

1474
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:37,560
It's as simple as that.
Now you could artificially maintain your

1475
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,260
dependency,
but you know,

1476
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,720
if you do that for too long,
things get pretty ugly.

1477
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:46,470
So you get pretty stale and,
and you know,

1478
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:48,720
you're like bread that's been on the 
shelf for too long.

1479
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,680
So now they're wondering what to do and 
where he could be.

1480
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,050
And then there's something very strange 
happens.

1481
01:21:55,080 --> 01:22:00,080
The star shows up again and it turns 
into a dove and the dove flies down and 

1482
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:06,200
puts a piece of paper bathed in light 
with gold writing on it in front of the 

1483
01:22:10,831 --> 01:22:14,790
cricket and the puppet.
So what in the world's going on there?

1484
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,680
Well,
we know what the star is.

1485
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,120
We've seen it multiple times,
right?

1486
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:21,420
It's also the place that the blue fairy 
came from,

1487
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,840
but it's this transcendent place.
It's this place that occurs sort of as 

1488
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,210
the ultimate ideal.
And this time it delivers a message.

1489
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,220
So what's happening here is

1490
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:41,080
Pinocchio is fundamentally oriented by 
the wish that his father made so long 

1491
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:41,150
ago,
right?

1492
01:22:41,151 --> 01:22:44,450
And the wish was that he would become a 
fully functioning individual.

1493
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:50,320
And so that's that transcendent place.
And young would say when you,

1494
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,600
when you orient your vision,
different things appear to you in the 

1495
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,691
world.
So and I mean this literally so because 

1496
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:07,150
you can't see everything,
your vision calculates what's necessary.

1497
01:23:07,151 --> 01:23:12,151
Your brain calculates what's necessary 
for you to see so that you get to the 

1498
01:23:12,151 --> 01:23:13,420
point that you're aiming at.
And I don't mean that metaphorically.

1499
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:18,900
I mean it literally.
Things that aren't relevant to what 

1500
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:23,511
you're seeking won't.
You won't see them unless they get in 

1501
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:29,751
your way and they have to.
They have to really block your pathway 

1502
01:23:29,751 --> 01:23:33,891
before there'll be literally visible.
So you orient yourself towards something

1503
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:37,810
and that makes some things visible that 
wouldn't be visible.

1504
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:40,240
It makes other things invisible that you
might've seen.

1505
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:45,540
And so when you change your orientation,
what manifests itself in the world also 

1506
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:48,640
changes.
Know Pinocchio is in despair here.

1507
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:53,800
And he asks himself,
where could my father have gone?

1508
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:59,790
And so the question is,
what exactly is he asking under those 

1509
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,650
circumstances?
And what he's asking is something like,

1510
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:09,630
I had a structure that was orienting me 
properly in relationship to the world

1511
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,980
and as far as it was embodied in my 
actual father,

1512
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:19,981
it's now gone.
Is there any possibility that I can find

1513
01:24:20,441 --> 01:24:22,870
that again?
And that is what you want.

1514
01:24:22,871 --> 01:24:25,000
You see like if you're in a chaotic 
circumstance,

1515
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:30,001
maybe you've escaped,
let's say from a bad relationship or 

1516
01:24:30,001 --> 01:24:30,001
something like that and you're out of 
it,

1517
01:24:30,001 --> 01:24:34,531
but now you don't know what to do.
What you're hoping is that you can get 

1518
01:24:35,021 --> 01:24:37,300
your life back together,
right?

1519
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,730
That you can put the pieces that have 
fallen apart,

1520
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:44,731
back together,
and so you're automatically going to 

1521
01:24:44,731 --> 01:24:44,770
generate a fantasy about producing 
another.

1522
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:49,980
Let's call it stable state.
You're going to be looking for this 

1523
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:52,741
spirit that would enable that stable 
state to be generated because really 

1524
01:24:52,741 --> 01:24:53,380
what it is,
and in some senses,

1525
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:56,140
your new personality,
you're in chaos.

1526
01:24:56,141 --> 01:24:58,720
You have to become something new in 
order to get out of chaos.

1527
01:24:58,721 --> 01:25:01,570
And so you're hoping for that,
you're hoping that you'll see it,

1528
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:03,010
and so

1529
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:08,480
that's going to make certain things 
visible to you.

1530
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:13,550
That's the.
That's the proper way of thinking about 

1531
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:13,550
it.
You know,

1532
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:15,380
when you get curious about something and
maybe you're curious about something and

1533
01:25:15,381 --> 01:25:20,381
you walk into a bookstore,
that curiosity is going to guide you to 

1534
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:23,951
a certain set of books.
The fact that you have the question in 

1535
01:25:23,951 --> 01:25:25,580
mind is going to open your eyes to 
certain kinds of possibilities.

1536
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,000
And so if your goal is to reestablish 
your union with the positive father,

1537
01:25:31,341 --> 01:25:36,341
let's say,
then certain things are going to appear 

1538
01:25:36,341 --> 01:25:37,280
in other things aren't.
And that's really what this represents.

1539
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:42,620
A transcendent star is the goal,
which is this developmental process.

1540
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,930
It's capable of,
let's say,

1541
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:49,931
delivering a message to you.
Some sense that's what's happening when 

1542
01:25:49,931 --> 01:25:49,970
you're thinking,
you know,

1543
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,340
because you have a problem you want to 
solve,

1544
01:25:52,341 --> 01:25:54,200
you have somewhere you want to go with 
your thoughts,

1545
01:25:54,201 --> 01:25:59,201
and as a consequence of that information
reveals itself to you.

1546
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:02,390
In the interior landscape.
It's a very strange thing.

1547
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:08,230
In some sense,
it feels as if you're producing the 

1548
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:08,450
thoughts,
but it could equally be said that you're

1549
01:26:08,451 --> 01:26:13,451
watching the thoughts revealed 
themselves and which of those is the 

1550
01:26:13,451 --> 01:26:14,360
more accurate description is by no means
obvious.

1551
01:26:14,361 --> 01:26:16,790
You can certainly have thoughts that 
surprise you,

1552
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:19,820
which is very strange.
It's like they're your thoughts.

1553
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:23,780
How in the world can they surprise you,
but they do so it's like you didn't know

1554
01:26:23,781 --> 01:26:25,880
them before you thought them up,
but then the question is,

1555
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:26,840
well,
where did they come from?

1556
01:26:26,841 --> 01:26:28,670
If you didn't know them before you 
thought them up,

1557
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,780
they sort of spring out of the void.
That's one way of thinking about it.

1558
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:38,250
Anyways,
this is a holy ghost symbol.

1559
01:26:38,251 --> 01:26:43,251
This dove as well,
so that puts some Christian imagery in 

1560
01:26:43,251 --> 01:26:43,251
here.
Again,

1561
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:48,010
you could think of it as a manifestation
of the spirit of transformation.

1562
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:50,020
That's another way of looking at it.
Anyways.

1563
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,240
It's the conscience that interprets the 
letter,

1564
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:55,180
so it's sort of figuring out what the 
next thing should be,

1565
01:26:55,181 --> 01:27:00,181
and weirdly enough,
what the letter says is that Japan was 

1566
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:03,580
out looking for Pinocchio and he got 
swallowed by a whale,

1567
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:08,520
which makes very little sense to put it 
bluntly.

1568
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:15,240
Japan,
I went to search for Pinocchio and now 

1569
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,180
he's at the bottom of the sea in a giant
whale and

1570
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:23,060
we bright over that tremendous gap in 
logic and follow the story nonetheless.

1571
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,600
Okay,
so what's the idea here?

1572
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:32,410
The idea is that if you're.
If you fall into a chaotic state and 

1573
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:36,251
everything falls apart,
there's the possibility that

1574
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:44,630
things can come back together,
including what you've just learned in a 

1575
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:51,291
new state,
and so you can conceptualize that 

1576
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:54,441
symbolically as the existence of the 
dead father at the bottom of the,

1577
01:27:56,490 --> 01:27:58,320
of the chaotic landscape.
That's.

1578
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,080
That's the proper way as far as I can 
tell,

1579
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:06,100
to think about it.
It's like there's something down there 

1580
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:06,420
that's capable of reforming and 
reemerging.

1581
01:28:06,421 --> 01:28:10,590
That's that incorporates the previous 
state,

1582
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:15,591
but that takes it farther and you're not
going to find that unless you descend 

1583
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:19,681
into this chaotic place where it feels 
like all order is gone while you 

1584
01:28:19,681 --> 01:28:24,561
generate order.
It's going to be akin to the order that 

1585
01:28:24,561 --> 01:28:26,841
you had before,
but there's going to be something new 

1586
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:28,701
about it as well,
so it's down to the bottom of the 

1587
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:30,861
chaotic state to bring up what you're 
missing and that's one level of 

1588
01:28:32,701 --> 01:28:34,680
analysis.
Another level of analysis you think is,

1589
01:28:34,681 --> 01:28:35,910
well,
that's also what you're doing.

1590
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:41,390
That's what you should be doing in 
principle when you're going to 

1591
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:41,750
university,
you know you're.

1592
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:46,070
You come to university in roughly the 
same status.

1593
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:51,100
Pinocchio,
you know you're a bit of a puppet and 

1594
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:51,420
you're kind of a jackass and what the 
hell do you know?

1595
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:55,230
And it's chaotic because you haven't 
found your place in the world properly.

1596
01:28:55,470 --> 01:29:00,470
And I don't mean merely for career.
Not that that's not relevant because it 

1597
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,680
is,
but it's more than that.

1598
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:06,681
It's because you're a historical 
creature because you are a product of 

1599
01:29:06,681 --> 01:29:11,091
history.
Unless you are inculturated properly,

1600
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:16,160
which means you understand your past and
in the sense that the humanities can 

1601
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:18,340
allow for that,
then

1602
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:25,710
you haven't been able to incorporate the
wisdom of your ancestors into your day 

1603
01:29:26,891 --> 01:29:29,050
to day pursuits and that's gonna make 
you weak.

1604
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:32,440
That's the idea anyways,
and so when you come to university,

1605
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:37,740
this is what university is for it so 
that you can go into the chaos and you 

1606
01:29:39,191 --> 01:29:44,191
can pull something out of it that's 
truly a value and you can incorporate 

1607
01:29:44,191 --> 01:29:45,790
that in your own personality and that 
makes you much,

1608
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:49,000
much stronger,
like literally stronger.

1609
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:53,590
Not more educated but not.
It's not like you know more facts.

1610
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:59,150
It's that you literally are a better 
person and better means you can do far 

1611
01:29:59,150 --> 01:29:59,790
more things.
You can articulate your.

1612
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:04,960
That's.
That's something that's of crucial 

1613
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:04,960
importance is that you can articulate 
yourself properly,

1614
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,930
which is more useful than anything else 
you could possibly manage.

1615
01:30:07,931 --> 01:30:12,931
Like if you guys come out of university 
capable of making coherent arguments and

1616
01:30:14,621 --> 01:30:18,790
using language properly,
you're so powerful that it's ridiculous.

1617
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,860
You,
you always,

1618
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:28,100
you can lay out a strategy and pursue it
successfully and maybe the strategy is 

1619
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,010
actually oriented towards something 
good.

1620
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:34,040
Something that will actually work,
work for you and work for other people 

1621
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,040
as well,
and I don't really understand why people

1622
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:37,340
aren't taught,
told this when they come to university,

1623
01:30:37,341 --> 01:30:42,341
is that your goal is to make yourself as
articulate in writing and thinking and 

1624
01:30:44,851 --> 01:30:49,851
speaking as you possibly can because 
that opens the door to everything that 

1625
01:30:49,851 --> 01:30:52,470
you'll want to do in the future.
No matter what it is,

1626
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:58,070
the more articulate person always rises 
always because they lay out strategies 

1627
01:31:02,911 --> 01:31:07,911
more effectively.
They they lay out the reasons for doing 

1628
01:31:07,911 --> 01:31:09,120
something or for not doing something 
more particularly.

1629
01:31:09,121 --> 01:31:14,121
They convinced people and properly so 
that they can grapple with potentials 

1630
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:21,350
that lies ahead effectively and they can
defend themselves when they're 

1631
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:26,570
challenged.
And so all of that is going into the 

1632
01:31:27,241 --> 01:31:29,310
past,
into the chaos of the past.

1633
01:31:29,311 --> 01:31:34,311
You could even say and pulling up the 
spirit that inhabits that from the 

1634
01:31:34,311 --> 01:31:37,650
bottom and uniting with it.
And if you don't do that well,

1635
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:45,520
you're defenseless.
In the case of in the face of the 

1636
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:49,031
tragedy of life and and then,
then that's not so good because if 

1637
01:31:49,191 --> 01:31:51,890
you're defenseless in the face of the 
tragedy of life,

1638
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:57,190
then you get way more hurt than you 
would otherwise get and some of the 

1639
01:31:57,190 --> 01:32:00,401
people around you and then the 
probability that you're going to be 

1640
01:32:00,401 --> 01:32:03,281
resentful and about that is really high 
because no one likes to fail continually

1641
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:10,080
and then you get bitter and resentful 
and then once you're bitter and 

1642
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:10,150
resentful,
well being,

1643
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:12,820
being vengeful and mean is the next 
step.

1644
01:32:13,290 --> 01:32:17,380
It doesn't take much of a transformation
to move you from place to the next.

1645
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:23,970
So now Pinocchio has to face the thing 
that he's afraid of most and that's a 

1646
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:26,080
complicated

1647
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:32,450
idea as well.
So you had this phrase that he liked,

1648
01:32:32,451 --> 01:32:37,451
that he took from the alchemists,
which was in stir wiliness infinite 

1649
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:38,810
tour,
and what it meant was what you most want

1650
01:32:38,811 --> 01:32:41,060
to find will be found where you least 
want to look.

1651
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:44,540
There's this old story.
It's from King Arthur.

1652
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:46,400
King Arthur has these nights,
right?

1653
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:49,670
They all sit around a round table,
which means they're roughly equal.

1654
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:54,730
That's what the round table means and 
they're off to find the holy grail and 

1655
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:56,540
the holy grail is the most valuable 
object that that's what it means.

1656
01:32:56,690 --> 01:32:58,850
So they're off to find the most valuable
thing,

1657
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,040
but they don't know what it is and they 
don't know where it is,

1658
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,460
but they know that there's a most 
valuable thing.

1659
01:33:03,461 --> 01:33:08,461
So in some sense it's akin to them 
orienting themselves by the star and 

1660
01:33:08,461 --> 01:33:12,221
they don't know where to look.
And so what they decide is they have the

1661
01:33:12,711 --> 01:33:14,240
castle.
It's the middle of a forest.

1662
01:33:14,241 --> 01:33:19,241
And so each night decides to start 
looking for the holy grail by entering 

1663
01:33:19,241 --> 01:33:20,600
the forest at the point that looks 
darkest to him.

1664
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,900
And so what's the idea there?

1665
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:32,200
Well,
imagine there are things that come easy 

1666
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,791
to you and that you're fond of pursuing 
and that you're happy about pursuing.

1667
01:33:33,831 --> 01:33:37,730
So you found those and pursued them and 
you've mastered them.

1668
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:43,480
So you know all that,
but then there's another place that you 

1669
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:46,961
don't want to go.
And so you haven't gone there and you 

1670
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:50,021
haven't mastered it and you're a very 
small in comparison to it because you 

1671
01:33:50,021 --> 01:33:54,341
haven't mastered it and so it has this 
monstrous aspect and but it has if what 

1672
01:33:55,761 --> 01:33:59,930
you're working where you,
if what you're doing isn't working,

1673
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:03,260
it's where you haven't gone that you 
need to go.

1674
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:06,080
And so I can give you another example of
this.

1675
01:34:06,081 --> 01:34:11,081
So let's say you're an agreeable person 
and so you don't like conflict and you 

1676
01:34:12,321 --> 01:34:17,321
won't stand up for yourself and you 
regard anger and the proclivity to 

1677
01:34:17,321 --> 01:34:21,110
provoke and to engage in conflict as 
something that's positively terrible.

1678
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:22,940
It's not only that you're not good at 
it,

1679
01:34:22,941 --> 01:34:27,080
it's actually that it's wrong.
So that's where you have to go.

1680
01:34:27,081 --> 01:34:32,081
If you're going to learn how to stand up
for yourself and imagine that you're 

1681
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:35,411
afraid,
maybe you have something like Agora 

1682
01:34:35,411 --> 01:34:38,470
Phobia.
And so there's a whole bunch of things 

1683
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:38,470
that you're afraid of and you don't want
to go there.

1684
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,920
But if you want to put yourself 
together,

1685
01:34:39,921 --> 01:34:41,900
then that's exactly where you have to 
go.

1686
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:47,120
And so it's frequently the case that 
what you want to find is to be found

1687
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,760
were you least want to find it,
and that idea is echoed in the

1688
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:59,000
prominent stories of dragons and gold.
It's exactly the same idea,

1689
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,160
is that the dragon is this terrible 
thing.

1690
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:04,220
It's this terrible predatory thing that 
lives forever and is very,

1691
01:35:04,221 --> 01:35:08,300
very wise.
It lives underground and it'll kill you,

1692
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:12,470
it'll burn you up in a second,
but it hoards gold,

1693
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:18,330
and so you have to go there into the 
dragon's layer if you're going to get 

1694
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:21,161
the gold,
and that's a representation of people's 

1695
01:35:21,161 --> 01:35:24,430
paradoxical relationship with reality.
It's like you have to go out there and 

1696
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:26,870
confronted in order to incorporate what 
it has to offer to you,

1697
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:32,350
but the probability that that's going to
be intensely dangerous and push you 

1698
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:34,040
right to the limit.
First of all,

1699
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:37,730
those are actually the same thing.
If it didn't push you to the limit,

1700
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:39,740
you wouldn't gain anything valuable from
it.

1701
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:45,580
So you don't get one without the other.
You don't get the gold without the 

1702
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:46,490
dragon.
That's a very strange,

1703
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,930
very,
very strange idea,

1704
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:53,600
but it seems to be accurate,
so all of that's lurking underneath this

1705
01:35:53,601 --> 01:35:58,370
in this imagery of the whale,
the thing that's at the bottom of now,

1706
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:01,790
the whale,
you can think of the story of Jonah.

1707
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:06,830
What happens with Jonah is that roughly 
speaking,

1708
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:10,630
he's a prophet and God tells him that he
has to,

1709
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:15,640
if I remember correctly,
God tells them in the house to go to 

1710
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,640
this city and straighten it out because 
it's.

1711
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:21,770
It's veered off the path and it's.
It's heading towards doom and Jonah 

1712
01:36:21,921 --> 01:36:26,921
thinks I'm not going to that city to 
tell those people anything like that 

1713
01:36:26,921 --> 01:36:30,221
because they're not going to be very 
happy with me just showing up there and 

1714
01:36:30,221 --> 01:36:33,440
telling them everything they're doing 
wrong and so he hops on a boat and tries

1715
01:36:33,441 --> 01:36:37,520
to get out of there and then God 
conjures up this huge storm and the boat

1716
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:42,521
is about to be swamped and the sailors,
they're worried about making the boat 

1717
01:36:43,851 --> 01:36:45,080
lighter.
Something like that.

1718
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:50,410
They all draw a lot to see who gets 
tossed overboard and Jonah admits that 

1719
01:36:50,410 --> 01:36:55,001
it's actually his fault because God's 
upset with him because he got this 

1720
01:36:55,001 --> 01:36:58,031
direct command to go straighten out the 
city and he ran off and so the sailors 

1721
01:36:58,031 --> 01:36:59,360
throat,
they're not happy about this,

1722
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:04,361
but they throw Jonah overboard and the 
CS and great fish comes up and swallows 

1723
01:37:04,361 --> 01:37:09,041
them.
Then he's down in the fish for three 

1724
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:10,010
days and it throws up on the dry land 
and then he's learned his lesson by that

1725
01:37:10,011 --> 01:37:15,011
time and he goes off to have this,
pursue the proper destiny to pursue his 

1726
01:37:15,011 --> 01:37:17,090
proper destiny.
So that's echoed in this story as well,

1727
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:18,030
that

1728
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,950
if you don't follow the pathway that 
you're supposed to follow,

1729
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:30,840
that this cs will become stormy for you 
and something will come up and pull you 

1730
01:37:31,281 --> 01:37:36,281
down and you'll be in a terrible place 
for some length of time until you learn 

1731
01:37:36,281 --> 01:37:40,391
your lesson and if you're lucky,
you'll get spit back up on shore and 

1732
01:37:40,391 --> 01:37:41,210
then you can go do what you should do.
Well,

1733
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,450
I mean that's not less than that.
Anybody needs to have interpreted.

1734
01:37:44,451 --> 01:37:49,190
I think everybody understands that.
Anyways,

1735
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:56,160
the Cricket Tells Pinocchio what he has 
to do and then something of paradoxical 

1736
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:00,981
happens.
Pinocchio decides he's going to go do 

1737
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:03,561
this,
and then the cricket is got this weird 

1738
01:38:03,561 --> 01:38:03,930
paradoxical response to that.
On the one hand,

1739
01:38:03,931 --> 01:38:06,180
he's he sort pulling Pinocchio back 
saying,

1740
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:06,870
look,
you know,

1741
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,460
this is foolhardy that you're going to 
go all the way down to the ocean.

1742
01:38:11,461 --> 01:38:13,140
You're going to confront this terrible 
whale.

1743
01:38:13,141 --> 01:38:14,640
This is really,
really dangerous,

1744
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:18,660
but at the same time when Pinocchio is 
on the edge of the cliff,

1745
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,490
the cricket helps him tie his tail 
around a rock and he.

1746
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:25,860
He holds his finger in place so that 
Pinocchio can tie the knot.

1747
01:38:25,861 --> 01:38:28,680
It's like the conscience is conflicted 
about this.

1748
01:38:28,681 --> 01:38:33,681
It's really dangerous and foolhardy,
but it's also necessary and so he plays 

1749
01:38:33,681 --> 01:38:35,850
this dual role,
but Pinocchio is leading at this point,

1750
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:37,560
so into the ocean.
He goes,

1751
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:47,230
I guess partly what this means is that 
if you're not oriented properly in the 

1752
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:50,471
world,
you should take your doubts and you 

1753
01:38:50,471 --> 01:38:50,690
should take your doubts and the chaos 
that you're involved in.

1754
01:38:50,691 --> 01:38:53,810
Seriously,
he should face it and think it through.

1755
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:58,870
You should go into it as far as you can 
go into it because maybe you'll find 

1756
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:59,210
something at the bottom of it.
I mean,

1757
01:38:59,211 --> 01:39:01,430
the alternative is to pretend that it 
doesn't exist,

1758
01:39:07,370 --> 01:39:09,380
so then Pinocchio is at the bottom of 
the water.

1759
01:39:09,381 --> 01:39:11,300
He can.
He can actually breathe down there.

1760
01:39:11,301 --> 01:39:14,240
It turns out so you could think that 
he's gone into the unknown.

1761
01:39:14,241 --> 01:39:18,170
He's outside of dry land.
He's in the unconscious.

1762
01:39:18,171 --> 01:39:22,970
All of those things are true and you 
might think,

1763
01:39:22,971 --> 01:39:27,971
well,
why would it be the world outside of 

1764
01:39:27,971 --> 01:39:28,310
what's known and the unconscious at the 
same time,

1765
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:31,940
this weird intermingling of those two 
things and as far as I can tell,

1766
01:39:31,941 --> 01:39:32,530
that's because

1767
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:36,920
when you're in chaos and you don't know 
what's going on,

1768
01:39:36,921 --> 01:39:41,921
then you start imagining what might be 
going on and that imagination is partly 

1769
01:39:41,991 --> 01:39:46,991
the world as it might be,
but it's also partly the structure of 

1770
01:39:46,991 --> 01:39:48,410
your unconscious mind,
which is producing the fantasies.

1771
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:53,890
And so when you're truly in chaos,
then the distinction between your 

1772
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:56,150
fantasies and reality isn't clear.
That's actually part of what constitutes

1773
01:39:56,151 --> 01:39:58,340
the chaos.
So imagine this,

1774
01:39:58,341 --> 01:40:03,341
so you're in a relationship and the 
person betrays you and you knew who they

1775
01:40:04,251 --> 01:40:06,380
were,
at least you thought you did before that

1776
01:40:06,381 --> 01:40:11,381
moment,
but now you're looking at them and you 

1777
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:15,731
don't know who they are and you don't 
know what the past was and you don't 

1778
01:40:15,731 --> 01:40:17,660
know what the present is and you don't 
know what the future's going to be.

1779
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:21,710
All of that's been thrown up into the 
air in a major way that's traumatic.

1780
01:40:21,711 --> 01:40:24,260
So much has fallen apart that it's 
traumatic.

1781
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:29,800
So what do you start to do?
You start to imagine what might be the 

1782
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,150
situation.
Well then the reality,

1783
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:33,970
the reality is your imagination and the 
reality.

1784
01:40:33,971 --> 01:40:35,980
At the same time,
they're not pulled apart at all.

1785
01:40:35,981 --> 01:40:37,870
You cannot distinguish between them.

1786
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:40,240
And so

1787
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:47,560
it was a young an idea.
I could say that's the snitch that Harry

1788
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,640
Potter is chasing.
By the way,

1789
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,110
I know what.
That's a terrible leap,

1790
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:55,620
but that is what it is.
It's that weird intermingling potential 

1791
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:59,470
in reality that that can manifest itself
as the world if you pursue it.

1792
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:05,040
It's roughly that.
So Pinocchio is in this situation that's

1793
01:41:05,461 --> 01:41:09,030
half fantasy and half reality in this 
chaotic state,

1794
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:11,640
and he had us to go down to find the 
thing that he leased,

1795
01:41:11,641 --> 01:41:14,220
wants to find,
and he's hoping that it.

1796
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:17,520
He's got this intuition that in facing 
that thing,

1797
01:41:17,521 --> 01:41:20,310
that chaos,
that that life really is that chaos,

1798
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:24,720
that he's going to find his father and 
reunite with them.

1799
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:32,030
So you could also say that in some sense
it's a decision of faith,

1800
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:33,740
I suppose because

1801
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,620
you might ask yourself,
well,

1802
01:41:36,621 --> 01:41:39,830
why bother confronted chaos?
Chaos is the ultimate reality.

1803
01:41:39,831 --> 01:41:44,831
Then what the hell uses they're in 
facing it because it's just going to 

1804
01:41:44,831 --> 01:41:46,700
reveal itself as the ultimate reality 
and drown you,

1805
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:49,460
but the myths always say the same thing.
They say,

1806
01:41:49,461 --> 01:41:49,820
no,
no.

1807
01:41:49,821 --> 01:41:51,890
If you confront what's really disturbing
you,

1808
01:41:51,891 --> 01:41:54,050
if you really confronted you do it 
voluntarily,

1809
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,120
you're going to find order in it 
eventually,

1810
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:59,120
or at least that's the only way you're 
going to find order.

1811
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:04,450
Now.
It's not like these stories are 

1812
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:05,210
optimistic and it's not as if they give 
you a sure guide to success.

1813
01:42:05,211 --> 01:42:10,211
That's the other thing.
It's not like they're unerringly 

1814
01:42:10,211 --> 01:42:12,880
accurate because you can be subsumed by 
chaos that so total that even if you 

1815
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:16,880
face it,
you're not going to prevail.

1816
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:19,220
I mean,
that's why people die.

1817
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:24,170
That's one way of looking at it anyways,
but the mythology basically says this is

1818
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:29,171
your best bet.
If there is a process that's going to 

1819
01:42:29,171 --> 01:42:29,450
work,
this is it,

1820
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:32,700
and so,
and then you might think,

1821
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:33,630
well,
the better you do it,

1822
01:42:33,631 --> 01:42:37,590
the better the chance of success,
or the more consistently you do it,

1823
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:42,980
the better the chances of success are.
And I think that that's a perfectly 

1824
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:42,980
reasonable way of looking at it.
Okay,

1825
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:47,691
so anyways,
Pinocchio's down at the bottom of the 

1826
01:42:47,691 --> 01:42:50,100
ocean and every time he says he's trying
to find out where monster is

1827
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:53,740
and they ask questions to the fish that 
are down there,

1828
01:42:53,741 --> 01:42:57,370
but every time they mentioned monster,
who's name all the fish disappeared.

1829
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:59,470
It's like Voldemort,
right?

1830
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:03,820
He's the guy whose name you cannot say 
and monster we is precisely that.

1831
01:43:03,821 --> 01:43:08,821
It's the thing that frightens everyone.
And so asking questions down there isn't

1832
01:43:10,481 --> 01:43:12,160
helping very much.
So Pinocchio,

1833
01:43:12,161 --> 01:43:17,161
what he does is he's calling for his 
father and he keeps going deeper and 

1834
01:43:17,161 --> 01:43:18,820
deeper into the depths and we're in a 
scene.

1835
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:19,840
There's a scene where

1836
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:26,740
the darkness of the ocean turns into an 
even more profound darkness and that's 

1837
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:27,260
what okay,
well disappears into.

1838
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:31,400
And then we see monster always in this 
sort of foggy representation,

1839
01:43:31,401 --> 01:43:36,401
this huge thing that lies very much at 
the bottom and there's no life or 

1840
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:38,960
anything around him except I think these
are macro,

1841
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:42,140
but maybe their tuna,
their animated anyway,

1842
01:43:42,141 --> 01:43:45,020
so it doesn't matter,
but there's no life down there.

1843
01:43:45,021 --> 01:43:50,021
He is so far down at the bottom of the 
ocean that there's nothing that's alive 

1844
01:43:50,021 --> 01:43:50,021
down there.
So.

1845
01:43:50,021 --> 01:43:54,750
And then we go inside the which is of 
course absurd and we see that the whale 

1846
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,480
has eaten a boat at some point in the 
past.

1847
01:43:56,481 --> 01:44:01,481
This is one whopping whale and Japan is 
sitting with the kitten of all things.

1848
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:05,270
He's also got that little goldfish bowl 
full of goldfish with them too,

1849
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:06,230
which is quite the feat.

1850
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:09,140
Anyways,
he's sitting there and he's.

1851
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:12,590
He knows that he's trapped in the belly 
of the whale to and in that he can't get

1852
01:44:12,591 --> 01:44:15,380
out.
And so that's an interesting issue.

1853
01:44:15,381 --> 01:44:18,140
It's because not only is Pinocchio 
lacking his father,

1854
01:44:18,141 --> 01:44:23,141
which isn't a good thing,
but the farther is lacking the sun and 

1855
01:44:23,141 --> 01:44:27,461
there is some indication that the father
can't get out of the whale without the 

1856
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:30,521
sun and so it's like the possibility for
order is down there in this chaotic 

1857
01:44:31,041 --> 01:44:33,830
state,
but unless there's an active agent to go

1858
01:44:33,831 --> 01:44:35,840
seek it out,
it can't pull itself.

1859
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,540
It's not animated enough to get out by 
itself,

1860
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:39,950
you know?
And you could say,

1861
01:44:39,951 --> 01:44:44,951
well there's wisdom in the libraries,
but it's not going to like without you 

1862
01:44:44,951 --> 01:44:46,070
going in there and gathering it and 
embodying it.

1863
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:49,550
All it does is sit there and potential.
And in all of that,

1864
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:55,180
in all of that implicit form,
now it's a good way of thinking about 

1865
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:55,220
it.
So anyways,

1866
01:44:55,221 --> 01:44:59,030
Jupiter was pretty feeling pretty 
hopeless because he can't figure out any

1867
01:44:59,031 --> 01:45:02,090
way of getting out of the whale and he's
also starving.

1868
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,920
He's starving in the belly of the whale.

1869
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,290
And

1870
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,260
here's a way of thinking about that

1871
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:18,890
Japan is a good guy,
but he's old and that being his way of 

1872
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:21,630
doing things is no longer fruitful.
That's why you starving.

1873
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:24,750
And it's especially not fruitful because
he's missing his son.

1874
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:27,810
He's missing the active element that the
child represents,

1875
01:45:27,811 --> 01:45:31,320
say the playful and transformative 
element that the child represents.

1876
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:34,800
And so if you get stuck doing something 
the same old way,

1877
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:36,600
at some point,
it's no longer going to work.

1878
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:41,250
Even if it was good at some point it has
to be updated and it's updated by,

1879
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:46,520
let's call it the spirit of youth or the
spirit of attention or the spirit of 

1880
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:46,520
play,
something like that.

1881
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:49,280
The willingness to break boundaries and 
take risks in Japan,

1882
01:45:49,281 --> 01:45:51,150
eto is very,
very skilled,

1883
01:45:51,151 --> 01:45:53,070
but,
but he doesn't have that.

1884
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:58,300
That symbolized by the loss of his son.
That's why he was looking for his son 

1885
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:02,331
too.
We need them and so they're in despair 

1886
01:46:02,331 --> 01:46:02,700
down there trying to fish and not 
getting anything.

1887
01:46:02,701 --> 01:46:03,150
And so

1888
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,020
monster wakes up.

1889
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:12,010
Mackerel happens to swim by and monster 
wakes up.

1890
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:16,050
And so then he started,
I think there two now actually,

1891
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:21,120
they look like tune into me and so 
monster wakes up and he opens his mouth 

1892
01:46:21,251 --> 01:46:23,860
and a bunch of water starts to come in 
and so.

1893
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:26,590
And then you see Pinocchio with the 
fish.

1894
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:27,010
Now

1895
01:46:31,210 --> 01:46:35,770
there's very intense implicit Christian 
symbolism in this part of the film.

1896
01:46:35,771 --> 01:46:38,410
And I'm going to lay it out point by 
point.

1897
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,680
So you may remember and perhaps you 
don't.

1898
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:46,000
Perhaps you don't know that one of the 
symbols for Christ is a fish it thesis.

1899
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:51,060
Right?
And that's a play on the Greek 

1900
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:51,060
representation,
Christ's name.

1901
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:55,131
But there's more to it than that because
all of Christ's followers are fishermen 

1902
01:46:55,131 --> 01:46:59,490
and he performs a bunch of miracles with
fish and fish are strange things because

1903
01:46:59,491 --> 01:47:01,320
while you can pull them up out of the 
depths,

1904
01:47:01,321 --> 01:47:06,321
that's part of it.
And so there are things that can be 

1905
01:47:06,321 --> 01:47:06,321
pulled out of the depth and you could 
say that

1906
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:10,330
it's going to be very difficult for me 
to take this apart.

1907
01:47:10,331 --> 01:47:13,420
But you could say in some sense that 
Christ is a matter of fish.

1908
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:18,070
A fish is something that you can dine 
on,

1909
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:23,880
but a way of being is something that 
provides you with something to dine on 

1910
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:27,910
on a continual basis,
and so you might say,

1911
01:47:27,911 --> 01:47:32,911
well,
is it better to be to have a fish or to 

1912
01:47:32,911 --> 01:47:34,681
be a fisherman?
That's another way of thinking about it 

1913
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:37,111
and obviously it's better to be a 
fisherman because then you can get more 

1914
01:47:37,111 --> 01:47:38,290
fish and so it's one thing to have 
something,

1915
01:47:38,291 --> 01:47:43,291
but it's another way.
It's another thing completely to know 

1916
01:47:43,291 --> 01:47:45,490
how to generate good things and so if 
you had any sense,

1917
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:50,670
you'd take the ladder over the former,
even though the former is more 

1918
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:53,110
instantaneously gratifying and requires 
less work and responsibility.

1919
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:58,920
And so anyways,
the way I'll opens his mouth and goes 

1920
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,981
chasing these fish and Pinocchio tries.
He's trying to get the hell out of 

1921
01:48:01,981 --> 01:48:03,340
there.
Even though he wants to find the whale.

1922
01:48:03,550 --> 01:48:06,050
When he actually sees the whale,
he leaves he.

1923
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:08,530
And that's also a very common 
mythological,

1924
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,170
what would you call it?
Plot element.

1925
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:18,440
It's very frequently that what happens 
when the hero first sees the terrible 

1926
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:22,041
thing,
the dragon say the terrible thing that 

1927
01:48:22,041 --> 01:48:23,931
he's come to conquer.
He freezes and gets the hell out of 

1928
01:48:23,931 --> 01:48:26,781
there because it's far worse than you 
thought it was going to be and so 

1929
01:48:26,781 --> 01:48:26,781
Pinocchio.
It's like,

1930
01:48:26,781 --> 01:48:28,110
no way man.
I'm not going.

1931
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:33,120
When you hear that whale way,
he swims and he's actually at the 

1932
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:33,300
forefront of all the fish,
which is quite interesting too.

1933
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:37,380
So it meantime,
monster was opened.

1934
01:48:37,381 --> 01:48:40,830
His mouth and the are pouring in Japan.
I was fishing like mad and he's catching

1935
01:48:40,831 --> 01:48:45,831
fish like crazy and so the little cat is
Japan was flinging the fish backwards 

1936
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:52,370
into this box and the little cat is 
there whacking them to to kill them 

1937
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,570
while they're flopping around and so 
they're.

1938
01:48:55,571 --> 01:48:59,190
They're pretty excited about this 
because they have a problem.

1939
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:00,750
The problem is how to get out of the 
whale.

1940
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:05,840
That's the actual problem,
but a nasty problem inside that is how 

1941
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:10,131
not to starve to death and so Japan was 
pretty happy that even though he's not 

1942
01:49:10,131 --> 01:49:11,790
getting out of the whale,
that he gets to have something to eat.

1943
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:15,930
So you could say as well that he's not 
exactly focused on the right thing.

1944
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:21,020
He's focused on the micro problem 
instead of the macro problem and that 

1945
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,080
makes them kind of blind.
So anyways,

1946
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:28,450
the whale swallows up.
Pinocchio and Japan are keeps fishing 

1947
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:33,060
and then he snags Pinocchio.
Now this is cool because,

1948
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:38,290
and this is another example of that Meta
fish idea is like you better was 

1949
01:49:40,231 --> 01:49:43,110
actually looking for a fish.
He's looking for a way out of the day.

1950
01:49:43,111 --> 01:49:48,040
I'm whale and then he catches a bunch of
fish and he's focused on like mad and

1951
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,820
then he couches Pinocchio.
Pinocchio represents what would get them

1952
01:49:51,821 --> 01:49:56,821
out of the whale,
but he's so bloody obsessed with the 

1953
01:49:56,821 --> 01:49:59,251
fish that he doesn't even notice.
So we catch this Pinocchio and flings 

1954
01:49:59,251 --> 01:50:02,791
them into the fish basket.
And so it signifies the blindness of 

1955
01:50:02,791 --> 01:50:06,550
Japan orientation in India as it.
When he's inside the way on that,

1956
01:50:06,551 --> 01:50:11,440
that's kind of a comment on his,
his aged and insufficient nature.

1957
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:14,440
He's solving the wrong.
He's solving the problem very well,

1958
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:16,480
but it's the wrong problem.
So anyways,

1959
01:50:16,481 --> 01:50:20,920
he fires Pinocchio into the Fish Pen and
Pinocchio says,

1960
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:22,500
Father,
I'm here in Japan.

1961
01:50:22,501 --> 01:50:24,880
No says,
don't bother me right now.

1962
01:50:24,881 --> 01:50:27,760
Pinocchio.
I'm busy fishing so.

1963
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,500
Well then that's fine.
So then he kind of wakes up.

1964
01:50:31,501 --> 01:50:36,501
He has this little moment of insight,
this little revelation that while he's 

1965
01:50:36,501 --> 01:50:37,320
caught Pinocchio's who cares about the 
damn fish.

1966
01:50:37,321 --> 01:50:42,321
So then he runs over to the fish box to 
grab Pinocchio and instead he grabs a 

1967
01:50:42,321 --> 01:50:45,891
fish and gives him a kiss.
And so that is another way of hammering 

1968
01:50:45,891 --> 01:50:49,461
home the fact that he's,
there's this confusion that he's 

1969
01:50:49,461 --> 01:50:52,490
suffering from.
He can distinguish the local truth from 

1970
01:50:52,490 --> 01:50:53,550
the,
from the transcendent truth.

1971
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:55,620
And so anyways,
he does figure it out.

1972
01:50:56,490 --> 01:51:01,490
He tosses the fish aside and he grabs 
Pinocchio and they're all thrilled to 

1973
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:01,490
death to see each other.
And,

1974
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:04,800
and so they're united.
So Pinocchio has found his father,

1975
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:06,690
but they're still trapped in the belly 
of the whale.

1976
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:10,740
Now Pinocchio takes off his hat,
he gets covered with a blanket,

1977
01:51:10,741 --> 01:51:14,250
he takes off his hat and he reveals his 
jackass ears,

1978
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:17,460
and so he's found his father,
but he but he's,

1979
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,780
he's damaged,
did not put Lko is he's damaged,

1980
01:51:20,781 --> 01:51:25,781
did not in good shape.
He isn't becoming what he was supposed 

1981
01:51:25,781 --> 01:51:25,781
to be.
In fact,

1982
01:51:25,781 --> 01:51:27,120
he's actually degenerated since,
since Japan.

1983
01:51:27,121 --> 01:51:31,530
I saw him last and so he becomes 
embarrassed and he says he has a tale.

1984
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:32,730
He says,
that's nothing.

1985
01:51:32,731 --> 01:51:34,920
I have a tail too.
And then he spins that around,

1986
01:51:34,921 --> 01:51:37,710
kind of laughing and braise and gets 
really embarrassed,

1987
01:51:37,711 --> 01:51:39,570
and so that's what you see here.
It looks like.

1988
01:51:39,571 --> 01:51:44,571
Well,
he's revealed himself as a jackass to 

1989
01:51:44,571 --> 01:51:44,790
his father,
but you know,

1990
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,500
that's actually a good thing because

1991
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:55,320
he is a jackass and if he was unwilling 
to admit his insufficiency,

1992
01:51:59,090 --> 01:52:00,800
he wouldn't have ever gone on this 
pursuit.

1993
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:02,850
So

1994
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:12,140
it's this perverse willingness to know 
that he isn't all that he could be.

1995
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:16,920
That's part of what drives him to find 
everything that his father represents.

1996
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:18,430
Oh,
it's a mission of.

1997
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:21,240
It's a human.
It's a humility and it's an admission of

1998
01:52:21,241 --> 01:52:24,480
insufficiency.
And you need that before you're going to

1999
01:52:24,481 --> 01:52:26,580
learn anything,
because before you learn anything,

2000
01:52:26,581 --> 01:52:29,460
you have to admit that there are things 
that are important,

2001
01:52:29,461 --> 01:52:33,510
that you don't know,
that you're a fool and maybe that you're

2002
01:52:33,511 --> 01:52:38,511
a brain jackass.
And so that's why there are injunctions 

2003
01:52:38,511 --> 01:52:42,800
in many religious writings that are 
positively portrait humility positively 

2004
01:52:43,621 --> 01:52:46,040
as the antidote to.
That's the right

2005
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:49,460
way of thinking about it is that 
humility means I still have something to

2006
01:52:49,461 --> 01:52:51,080
learn.
I still have something to learn.

2007
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:53,540
I'm in sufficient.
I still have something to learn.

2008
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:56,390
It's exactly the opposite.
Say of lamp wakes attitude.

2009
01:52:57,410 --> 01:52:58,630
Anyways,
Japan,

2010
01:52:58,631 --> 01:53:03,631
oh,
decides that sun puppet who's half 

2011
01:53:03,631 --> 01:53:06,671
jackass is better than no sun at all,
which is another indication of his 

2012
01:53:06,671 --> 01:53:08,450
relatively positive orientation towards 
the world.

2013
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:13,630
And they reunite and then put it on cue,
immediately sets his eyes on the main 

2014
01:53:13,971 --> 01:53:14,750
problem.
It's like,

2015
01:53:14,751 --> 01:53:15,860
Hey,
we're stuck in this whale.

2016
01:53:15,861 --> 01:53:20,861
We need to get out of here.
And it turns out that Japan has already 

2017
01:53:20,861 --> 01:53:20,861
built a raft,
but there's a problem.

2018
01:53:20,861 --> 01:53:22,810
And the problem is,
is that as Japan,

2019
01:53:22,811 --> 01:53:25,310
Oh,
says Pinocchio says,

2020
01:53:25,311 --> 01:53:30,311
well,
we'll wait for his mouth to open in 

2021
01:53:30,311 --> 01:53:30,311
Japan.
Oh,

2022
01:53:30,311 --> 01:53:30,311
says that doesn't work.
Because when he opens his mouth,

2023
01:53:30,311 --> 01:53:33,050
monster opens his mouth,
everything comes in and nothing goes out

2024
01:53:33,051 --> 01:53:34,730
so raft,
fine.

2025
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:38,110
But there's no way of using it.
And so Japan,

2026
01:53:38,111 --> 01:53:40,400
oh,
decides that they're not going to bother

2027
01:53:40,401 --> 01:53:43,670
with that problem and they're going to 
go have some fish.

2028
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:47,510
But Pinocchio,
his eye is still on the main prize.

2029
01:53:47,511 --> 01:53:48,260
He thinks,
no way,

2030
01:53:48,261 --> 01:53:49,490
man,
we're getting out of this whale.

2031
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:55,120
That's the fundamental thing.
We're not going to rearrange the deck 

2032
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:58,271
chairs on the titanic.
We're going to attend to the fact that 

2033
01:53:58,271 --> 01:54:01,061
it's sinking.
We're going to keep our eye on the 

2034
01:54:01,061 --> 01:54:01,061
primary problem.
So he's a little more awake by now.

2035
01:54:01,061 --> 01:54:04,430
So Pinocchio says,
we'll make a fire now.

2036
01:54:04,431 --> 01:54:08,510
That's cool.
I think because he's down in chaos,

2037
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:11,600
whereas father is trapped in,
the first thing he does is to use fire.

2038
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:13,370
And of course that's exactly what people
do,

2039
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:16,300
right?
Because we're fire users and so this and

2040
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:17,480
Shaman,
for example,

2041
01:54:17,481 --> 01:54:19,630
our masters of fire,
but it's,

2042
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:24,670
there's this really primordial element 
to the story right here and it's an 

2043
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:28,301
indication that the,
that the thing that can transform order 

2044
01:54:28,301 --> 01:54:31,030
into chaos,
into productive order results,

2045
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:36,040
so the same spirit that mastered fire 
and so Pinocchio lays that out and he 

2046
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,650
says,
we're going to build a fire and a Japan.

2047
01:54:38,650 --> 01:54:41,120
Oh,
says and we'll fill them up with smoke.

2048
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:44,990
And Japan says,
great smoked fish.

2049
01:54:45,110 --> 01:54:47,060
So he's still stuck on this whole fish 
thing.

2050
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:52,040
And so Pinocchio runs around gathering 
up all the spare wood on the boat,

2051
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:54,710
including the furniture which he starts 
to break.

2052
01:54:54,711 --> 01:54:55,180
And Japan.
Oh,

2053
01:54:55,190 --> 01:54:56,510
says,
well,

2054
01:54:56,511 --> 01:54:59,090
what are we going to sit on while we eat
or smoked fish?

2055
01:54:59,091 --> 01:55:04,091
And Pinocchio Basically says politely 
enough with the Damn Fish thing.

2056
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:08,070
I'm going to fill the whale with smoke.
And uh,

2057
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:10,310
that's gonna.
Make them sneeze and then we can get the

2058
01:55:10,311 --> 01:55:11,030
hell out of here.
And,

2059
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:12,070
and Japan.
Oh,

2060
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:13,490
says that's gonna.
Make them mad.

2061
01:55:13,491 --> 01:55:17,600
It's not a good idea.
And well,

2062
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:22,720
I would say that that's the stance of 
the benevolent state against innovation,

2063
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:29,310
you know,
even if the innovation is positive and 

2064
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:29,660
even if it's transformative and freeing,
the old state,

2065
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:32,360
even if it's good,
is going to stand in opposition to that.

2066
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:35,900
And so that's also something that's very
useful to know because otherwise you can

2067
01:55:35,901 --> 01:55:37,250
get bitter about that.
Anyways,

2068
01:55:37,251 --> 01:55:41,150
Pinocchio makes this big Fire Shapiro's 
pretty worried about it and he starts to

2069
01:55:41,151 --> 01:55:46,151
fill the way up with smoke.
And so this is where the whale turns 

2070
01:55:46,151 --> 01:55:46,800
into a fire breathing dragon,
which is quite cool.

2071
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:51,860
It's like in sleeping beauty maleficent 
turns into a fire spewing dragon as 

2072
01:55:52,381 --> 01:55:57,381
well.
And if you watch the little mermaid 

2073
01:55:57,381 --> 01:55:57,381
that,
what's her name,

2074
01:55:57,381 --> 01:56:01,341
that Ursula,
she turns into a gigantic snake like 

2075
01:56:01,341 --> 01:56:02,790
creature as well,
although she doesn't exactly spew fire,

2076
01:56:02,791 --> 01:56:07,791
but the transformation of the ultimate 
monster into something like a dragon is 

2077
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:14,210
very,
very common because it's the ultimate 

2078
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:14,670
symbol of the unknown for a variety of 
reasons that we'll discuss later.

2079
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,320
So anyways,
yes,

2080
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:18,270
it's a symbol of chaos.

2081
01:56:21,830 --> 01:56:23,930
Anyways,
and this is quite a horrifying scene.

2082
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:29,170
When my son watched,
he watched Pinocchio when he was about 

2083
01:56:29,170 --> 01:56:29,510
four and he watched the scene over and 
over and over and over.

2084
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,100
I don't know how many times he watched 
that movie,

2085
01:56:31,101 --> 01:56:36,101
but it must've been 100 times,
but he was really fascinated by this 

2086
01:56:36,321 --> 01:56:37,520
seat and you know,
he was,

2087
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:39,950
he was like locked onto it.
It was frightening,

2088
01:56:39,951 --> 01:56:42,850
but there was something in it that he 
was processing and,

2089
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:44,990
and cordoning onto.
So anyways,

2090
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:50,590
you see the whale is starting to prepare
to sneeze and it's belting out huge 

2091
01:56:50,590 --> 01:56:54,731
quantities of smoke and fire and 
Pinocchio and Japan Eto and the cat and 

2092
01:56:54,951 --> 01:56:55,790
the,
and the,

2093
01:56:55,791 --> 01:57:00,791
uh,
and the Goldfish bowl are all on the 

2094
01:57:00,791 --> 01:57:03,491
raft trying desperately to get out of 
the way whale which inhales and pulls 

2095
01:57:03,491 --> 01:57:05,120
the back and then sneezes and pushes 
them forward.

2096
01:57:05,121 --> 01:57:10,121
And at some point they actually break 
free and there's a good gates of hell 

2097
01:57:10,121 --> 01:57:13,790
image there with the whale belching 
smoke like mad and its jaws open.

2098
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:18,791
And so they are a paddling madly away to
get away from this whale.

2099
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,020
And the whale is very angry.
Just as you peddle a suggested.

2100
01:57:24,021 --> 01:57:27,430
And there's interesting sound effects 
that go along with this,

2101
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:30,170
that whale actually turns into a

2102
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,560
what happened when your phone is smarter
than you are?

2103
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:41,330
Um,
the way I'll actually turns into 

2104
01:57:41,330 --> 01:57:42,070
something that's like a locomotive and,
and the sound effects become industrial.

2105
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:47,460
So it's this monstrous machine like 
locomotive dragon that's bent on the 

2106
01:57:48,551 --> 01:57:50,370
destruction of,
of,

2107
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:55,440
of Pinocchio.
And you could say it's an amalgam of 

2108
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,430
natural and social forces completely 
unleashed.

2109
01:57:57,550 --> 01:58:00,340
Everything's unleashed against Pinocchio
and his father.

2110
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:05,660
And so they're having a hell of a time.
There's big waves and there and they end

2111
01:58:05,661 --> 01:58:08,770
up the way I'll actually abandons them,
but before it does that,

2112
01:58:08,771 --> 01:58:11,680
it nails them with its tail and blows 
the raft into smithereens.

2113
01:58:11,681 --> 01:58:16,681
And so then they're both in the water 
and Japan and Pinocchio or drowning and 

2114
01:58:16,681 --> 01:58:16,830
Japan.
No,

2115
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:19,840
actually goes down for the third time,
so to speak.

2116
01:58:19,841 --> 01:58:22,390
And as he's going down,
he says to Pinocchio,

2117
01:58:22,630 --> 01:58:24,790
Save Yourself,
save yourself.

2118
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:30,180
And so that's kind of Pinocchios last 
temptation because Japan has had it and 

2119
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:33,880
he could just get to shore on his own,
but he would have abandoned his father.

2120
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:39,150
And so that's the thing is,
and that's one of the issues that this 

2121
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:41,200
movie grapples with,
is what exactly is your responsibility?

2122
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:42,010
And you can say,
well,

2123
01:58:42,011 --> 01:58:45,760
it's to save yourself,
but the myth that underlies this says,

2124
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:46,480
no,
it's not.

2125
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:51,510
That's not exactly right,
is to rescue your father from the 

2126
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:53,320
chaotic depths and integrate with that 
and to save both.

2127
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:56,380
And that's your duty to your culture.
But more than that,

2128
01:58:56,381 --> 01:59:01,381
it's also your duty to your soul.
It isn't going to work if you just save 

2129
01:59:01,381 --> 01:59:03,280
yourself because you're still going to 
be a jackass puppet,

2130
01:59:03,730 --> 01:59:05,470
even though you're going to be back on 
shore.

2131
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:11,160
So anyways,
Pinocchio Grabs Jus Pedo and carries 

2132
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:14,470
them to shore and the whale shows back 
up and gives them one more good wallop.

2133
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:18,300
And then we see everybody on shore and 
it's peaceful again.

2134
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:23,700
Japan is on his back on the dry land and
the kitten washes up and the Goldfish 

2135
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:26,710
bowl washes up and the cricket washes 
up.

2136
01:59:26,770 --> 01:59:28,750
He's been outside the whale all of this 
time.

2137
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:33,340
And we see the cricket calling for 
Pinocchio.

2138
01:59:33,341 --> 01:59:35,890
And then we see him lying in a pool of 
water depth.

2139
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:41,400
So he's died rescuing his father,
he died well,

2140
01:59:42,211 --> 01:59:42,900
why?
Well,

2141
01:59:42,901 --> 01:59:44,250
he is a jackass,
puppet,

2142
01:59:44,251 --> 01:59:49,251
and maybe he was supposed to die if he 
rescued his father because that 

2143
01:59:49,251 --> 01:59:54,110
insufficiency that characterized him is 
something that's destroyed by the 

2144
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:57,360
process of encountering the chaos,
which it was so difficult.

2145
01:59:57,361 --> 02:00:02,280
It reforms the personality and the same 
occurs when he rescues his father and he

2146
02:00:02,281 --> 02:00:04,260
incorporates that.
So it's like

2147
02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:08,850
Bilbo in,
in the,

2148
02:00:08,851 --> 02:00:10,290
uh,
in the,

2149
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:13,260
in the first part of the,
what is it called,

2150
02:00:13,261 --> 02:00:15,330
the Lord of the rings,
the Hobbit.

2151
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:18,700
He's this sort of jackass,
puppet guy,

2152
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:22,140
little overprotected shire dweller at 
the beginning,

2153
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:27,270
and he goes on this tremendous adventure
and he has to develop the negative parts

2154
02:00:27,271 --> 02:00:29,430
of his character.
He actually has to become a professional

2155
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:34,431
thief and he has to develop his bravery.
And so they old personality and sunsets 

2156
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:38,960
has to die to give life to the new one.
And so

2157
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:49,050
you see in,
in the Harry Potter series to at the 

2158
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:51,190
very end part dies and then his 
resurrected right?

2159
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:56,280
That's,
that actually happens to a slightly 

2160
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:58,060
lesser degree in the second movie where 
the resurrection is aided by the Phoenix

2161
02:00:58,061 --> 02:01:02,230
tears after he gets eaten by that,
or he gets chomped by that big snake,

2162
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:05,470
which is roughly speaking the same thing
that's happening here.

2163
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:08,140
Sorry about that.
Okay,

2164
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,640
so anyways,
but don't kill us dead.

2165
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:12,730
That's not good.
So the next scene,

2166
02:01:12,731 --> 02:01:17,731
we see them back at home and he's lying 
dead on the bed and Japan and,

2167
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:22,930
and everyone else are mourning his loss.
And then the blue.

2168
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:25,990
Then we see this magic transformation 
and we hear the blue fairies

2169
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:32,690
voice and so it's like he's pushed 
himself to his limits and the natural 

2170
02:01:32,690 --> 02:01:34,920
process kicks back in and revive and 
fires him,

2171
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:38,070
but now he's no longer a jackass.
Puppet.

2172
02:01:38,071 --> 02:01:43,010
He's actually something that's real.
And so then he tells,

2173
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:46,210
he wakes up,
but he notices that now you know,

2174
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:48,170
he's under gun this proper 
transformation.

2175
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:53,620
He notices his hands in particular.
Then he and then he tells Japan who 

2176
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:55,880
refuses to even notice.
He says,

2177
02:01:55,881 --> 02:01:56,400
no,
no,

2178
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:58,640
don't kill your dad.
Lie Down.

2179
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:04,990
So you know,
Pinocchio convinces him that he's not 

2180
02:02:04,990 --> 02:02:07,691
dead.
And then in celebration they start the 

2181
02:02:07,691 --> 02:02:09,881
clock again and so time kicks back in at
that point and so then they have a big 

2182
02:02:09,881 --> 02:02:14,471
celebration.
Music happens again because this is a 

2183
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:19,480
celebratory moment and they dance and 
the harmony is restored.

2184
02:02:20,601 --> 02:02:25,601
The good old guy has his son and so the 
house is properly set up and the old 

2185
02:02:26,211 --> 02:02:31,211
state has its vision and its capacity 
for transformation and the thing that 

2186
02:02:31,211 --> 02:02:34,310
transforms how's the stability of the 
culture behind it and so perfect.

2187
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:40,030
And then the cricket goes outside and 
he's talking to the star and the blue 

2188
02:02:40,030 --> 02:02:41,420
fairy it.
He says he's pretty happy about how this

2189
02:02:41,421 --> 02:02:46,421
has gone.
And so then she gives him this little 

2190
02:02:46,421 --> 02:02:48,590
metal which is made out of gold and it's
a sign in.

2191
02:02:48,591 --> 02:02:51,520
It's a Mandela Hall at the same time.
And so it's.

2192
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:54,380
And it's made out of gold and gold is a 
noble metal.

2193
02:02:54,381 --> 02:02:58,430
It doesn't mate discriminate 
indiscriminately with other metals.

2194
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:00,730
It doesn't tarnish.
And so it's.

2195
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:05,780
It's a metal that represents the sun.
And then he flashes his little badge at 

2196
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:10,361
the star,
establishing a relationship between his 

2197
02:03:10,361 --> 02:03:14,651
function as the proper conscience.
And his orientation towards the highest 

2198
02:03:14,651 --> 02:03:17,800
good and that's it there.
So he's got this little son,

2199
02:03:17,801 --> 02:03:19,700
he's wearing this little son.
Uh,

2200
02:03:19,701 --> 02:03:23,990
so he's also transformed and developed 
as a consequence of this entire process.

2201
02:03:23,991 --> 02:03:27,800
And now his Pinocchio's conscience is 
properly oriented.

2202
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:33,250
It's oriented towards the highest value.
And then the movie closes and that's,

2203
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:41,820
but don't kill.
So I'll give you a minute and I'll take 

2204
02:03:50,351 --> 02:03:55,351
some,
take some questions and try to figure 

2205
02:03:55,351 --> 02:03:55,930
out how to shut my phone off.

2206
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:03,120
So does anybody have any questions?
Yes.

2207
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:09,350
Vaguely.
Psychoanalytic approach to kind of 

2208
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:12,460
extracting me articulated messages from 
the mythology,

2209
02:04:12,461 --> 02:04:14,580
getting the stories and the religion 
that's developed over time.

2210
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:18,170
So could you almost say that those are,
um,

2211
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:21,080
kind of constructing this to a societal 
level?

2212
02:04:22,190 --> 02:04:25,010
These are kind of the dreams of the 
collective unconscious.

2213
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:27,440
Sure.
Just exactly what they are.

2214
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:31,530
They're a collective founder of the 
fantasies of the collective unconscious.

2215
02:04:31,531 --> 02:04:33,170
So that's one way of looking at it.
I mean,

2216
02:04:33,171 --> 02:04:37,320
they also take us socio social,
socially determined form,

2217
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:40,350
right?
Because it's animated and that's,

2218
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,090
that's uh,
technology and,

2219
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:47,190
and it's obviously something that exists
in a particular time and place.

2220
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:52,520
But yeah,
it's a collective attempt to give voice 

2221
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:56,121
to the oldest of a behavioral patterns.
So here's one way of thinking about 

2222
02:04:56,121 --> 02:05:00,921
that,
which we'll talk about it in some 

2223
02:05:00,921 --> 02:05:03,081
detail,
which you should have read about at 

2224
02:05:03,081 --> 02:05:04,791
least to some degree already.
The question is where is that knowledge 

2225
02:05:04,791 --> 02:05:07,080
represented and younger would say,
well,

2226
02:05:07,190 --> 02:05:09,360
it's part of the collective unconscious 
and it's.

2227
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:11,640
It's got a biological origin,
but

2228
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:17,540
his,
his description of the biological nature

2229
02:05:17,541 --> 02:05:22,541
of the collective unconscious is quite 
ambiguous and I think that that's 

2230
02:05:22,541 --> 02:05:25,580
because it actually is ambiguous.
Like for example,

2231
02:05:25,581 --> 02:05:30,581
we know that primates and humans in 
particular are at least biologically 

2232
02:05:31,911 --> 02:05:35,990
predisposed to be afraid of snakes,
so we can learn that very easily.

2233
02:05:36,230 --> 02:05:40,460
Now you could make a case that it's more
than biological predisposition that it's

2234
02:05:40,461 --> 02:05:43,490
actually built in,
but I would say the predisposition id is

2235
02:05:43,491 --> 02:05:48,380
actually a better one because you would 
need the exposure to the snake to get it

2236
02:05:48,381 --> 02:05:49,800
going.
So,

2237
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:52,940
so that would take place as a 
consequence of your experience.

2238
02:05:52,941 --> 02:05:57,941
So it's not purely biological,
although it is the case that snake fear 

2239
02:05:58,071 --> 02:06:00,320
tends to become more intense as you get 
older.

2240
02:06:00,321 --> 02:06:04,400
Which is not necessarily what you would 
expect and the.

2241
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:08,570
I just read a paper this week,
localizing snake fear in primates and it

2242
02:06:08,571 --> 02:06:12,740
was hypothalamic to really old,
so because the hypothalamus is a very,

2243
02:06:12,741 --> 02:06:15,020
very old part of the brain.
It's older than the Amygdala.

2244
02:06:15,021 --> 02:06:18,200
The amygdala is involved in snake fear 
as well.

2245
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:19,610
It's really,
really old.

2246
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:21,500
So you could say,
well,

2247
02:06:21,501 --> 02:06:26,030
you're prepared to develop snake fear,
like you're prepared to develop language

2248
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:29,690
and like you're prepared to walk by your
biological structure.

2249
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:35,560
Now,
whether that actually constitutes the 

2250
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:37,250
contents of your memory,
which is what young seems to imply is an

2251
02:06:37,251 --> 02:06:39,710
open question,
but it doesn't really matter because.

2252
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:41,600
So

2253
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:49,540
one time when I went to visit my nephew,
he was running around in a night suit.

2254
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:54,020
He was only about four or five,
so he's acting out this

2255
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:58,370
mythological pattern roughly speaking,
and you'd say,

2256
02:06:58,371 --> 02:07:00,710
well how did he know how to do that?
And the answer would be,

2257
02:07:00,711 --> 02:07:05,711
well,
it was represented all around them in 

2258
02:07:05,711 --> 02:07:05,711
the culture,
in fragments,

2259
02:07:05,711 --> 02:07:09,410
and like kids are pretty good at putting
fragments of stories together.

2260
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:11,620
That's,
that's really what understanding is,

2261
02:07:11,621 --> 02:07:16,621
is to put fragments into story form and 
so he'd watched Disney movies and neat 

2262
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:21,670
and his parents had read him stories and
he did pretend play with the other kids 

2263
02:07:21,670 --> 02:07:24,920
and all of those were like exemplars of 
this underlying narrative.

2264
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:29,030
There are variants of it and because he 
can abstract and generalize,

2265
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:34,060
he's pulling out the central features of
those narratives to hear the heroic 

2266
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:35,620
features and then embodying them so 
could say,

2267
02:07:35,621 --> 02:07:40,621
well the central features of these 
narratives are fragmented and 

2268
02:07:40,621 --> 02:07:44,641
distributed around across the entire 
culture and so they don't have to be 

2269
02:07:46,001 --> 02:07:51,001
exactly inside your head.
They don't have to be part of your 

2270
02:07:51,001 --> 02:07:53,611
memory.
There are distributed in the behavior 

2271
02:07:53,611 --> 02:07:55,740
and the actions and the stories of the 
entire culture and they just.

2272
02:07:56,050 --> 02:07:59,200
You can put them together out of that 
so.

2273
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:01,810
And people do that.
That's why they're so hungry for stories

2274
02:08:01,811 --> 02:08:06,811
like Whoa,
like this one or like star wars or star 

2275
02:08:06,811 --> 02:08:10,300
trek or like the marvel movies are like 
Harry Potter.

2276
02:08:11,050 --> 02:08:16,050
Yeah.
What you said about the last scene on 

2277
02:08:16,050 --> 02:08:19,150
watching me over and over again,
my little brother did the same thing 

2278
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:19,190
with the last first Harry Potter you got
with the two faces.

2279
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:21,970
Watch that.
Probably 20 or $30.

2280
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:26,990
Yeah.
It's really interesting watching little 

2281
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:27,240
kids interact with.
Because movies are unbelievably complex.

2282
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:28,500
I mean,
you know,

2283
02:08:28,501 --> 02:08:30,030
by the time you're your age and you've 
seen,

2284
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:33,150
you know,
several hundred of them at minimum,

2285
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:39,140
the impact wears off,
but it's really something sitting down 

2286
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:40,770
with a four year old who hasn't watched 
very many movies and walking through one

2287
02:08:40,771 --> 02:08:43,320
with them.
I mean there are so turned on.

2288
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:48,380
It's just.
I took my daughter when she was too 

2289
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:50,811
young actually.
I took her to see the mask that Jim 

2290
02:08:50,811 --> 02:08:51,150
Carrey movie Jesus.
I mean she,

2291
02:08:51,170 --> 02:08:52,350
she,
she survived it.

2292
02:08:52,351 --> 02:08:55,800
I don't think I traumatized her,
but she was sitting on my lap,

2293
02:08:55,801 --> 02:09:00,240
but it was really like a gripping a 
bundle of barbed wire.

2294
02:09:00,330 --> 02:09:03,270
She was just like that,
the entire movie,

2295
02:09:03,271 --> 02:09:05,220
you know,
and halfway through I thought,

2296
02:09:05,221 --> 02:09:10,221
well that's probably a little too much 
psychophysiological intensity for one 

2297
02:09:10,221 --> 02:09:10,221
small body,
you know,

2298
02:09:10,221 --> 02:09:11,760
but she,
it was movies,

2299
02:09:11,761 --> 02:09:16,761
they just have a massive impact on 
little kids and they will do exactly 

2300
02:09:16,761 --> 02:09:19,941
that.
They'll watch it over and over and over 

2301
02:09:19,941 --> 02:09:21,561
and you think what is,
what are they doing exactly how they're 

2302
02:09:21,561 --> 02:09:21,561
trying to understand.
They're gripped by.

2303
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:24,000
They're gripped by it somehow.
Right.

2304
02:09:24,001 --> 02:09:29,001
And it's like there are deeply curious.
They know there's something in it and 

2305
02:09:29,001 --> 02:09:33,771
they're turning to extract out what it 
is and they'll repeat it and repeat it 

2306
02:09:33,771 --> 02:09:33,771
and repeat it and repeat it and repeat 
it.

2307
02:09:33,930 --> 02:09:38,930
So they're hungry for the information 
because it's part of rescuing their 

2308
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:41,130
father from the chaos.
That's one way of thinking about it.

2309
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:45,480
So other questions?

2310
02:09:50,310 --> 02:09:51,480
Well,
good enough.

2311
02:09:51,481 --> 02:09:53,200
Then.
Let's call it a day.

2312
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:59,970
What is one more question?
In maps of meaning that you keep 

2313
02:10:01,261 --> 02:10:04,220
returning to the boat when you first 
encounter the unknown.

2314
02:10:04,221 --> 02:10:06,320
It's like fearful.
Yep.

2315
02:10:06,730 --> 02:10:11,730
You're the idea of archetypes.
Are there other kinds of meaning that 

2316
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:17,820
people will find new information that's 
already patterned into them,

2317
02:10:19,510 --> 02:10:24,510
it's patterned into them or into the new
information that's pattern into them by 

2318
02:10:24,510 --> 02:10:27,090
the architect.
Do people actually,

2319
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:32,120
sure while they project the project,
the contents of their fantasy onto the 

2320
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:33,770
unknown thing and partly

2321
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,780
partly a process of self discovery,
you know,

2322
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:40,970
so for example,
let's say that you,

2323
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:44,370
you know,
you're gripped by love at first sight or

2324
02:10:44,371 --> 02:10:49,371
something like that.
Now you don't know anything about the 

2325
02:10:49,371 --> 02:10:49,371
person that you're tremendously 
attracted to,

2326
02:10:49,650 --> 02:10:52,860
but you'll have fantasies about them and
not found.

2327
02:10:52,861 --> 02:10:57,861
In fact,
your image of them is a fantasy and if 

2328
02:10:57,861 --> 02:11:00,090
you take that fantasy apart,
you'll find out what you value.

2329
02:11:02,420 --> 02:11:07,420
So you are projecting,
you're projecting yourself into the 

2330
02:11:07,420 --> 02:11:09,971
world and you can discover,
I mean you may also discover something 

2331
02:11:09,971 --> 02:11:12,521
about them because there may be elements
of them that matched the ideal quite 

2332
02:11:12,521 --> 02:11:13,700
nicely.
If you're fortunate and if your ideal is

2333
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:17,030
to have a reasonable sort,
but you can,

2334
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:22,060
you can.
You definitely encounter yourself when 

2335
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:22,140
you look at the unknown because you use 
your.

2336
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:25,130
Use your fantasy to structure the 
contact.

2337
02:11:26,310 --> 02:11:31,310
The fundamental structuring is the 
heroic encounter with a without known 

2338
02:11:31,310 --> 02:11:35,680
because that's the pathway.
That's the fundamental pathway of human 

2339
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:38,240
beings because we're information 
foragers fundamentally,

2340
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:44,340
so it's automatic responses,
fantasies as well that are part of the 

2341
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:45,680
first [inaudible].
Sure,

2342
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:46,430
sure.
Well,

2343
02:11:46,431 --> 02:11:47,630
that's all also.
Yes,

2344
02:11:47,631 --> 02:11:49,160
absolutely.
That's exactly right.

2345
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:52,230
Yes.
So Mindy,

2346
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:54,320
imagine this,
imagine that you're attracted to someone

2347
02:11:54,321 --> 02:11:56,240
in York too,
terrified to go speak to her.

2348
02:11:57,730 --> 02:12:02,730
Well,
what's happening while you have a 

2349
02:12:02,730 --> 02:12:04,641
fantasy of a judge and that's your 
imagined representation of your own 

2350
02:12:05,981 --> 02:12:08,500
insufficiency in relationship to the 
ideal,

2351
02:12:08,930 --> 02:12:13,930
and you project that on this person as a
judge and then you're too paralyzed to 

2352
02:12:13,930 --> 02:12:15,580
even open your mouth around her.
Very common experience.

2353
02:12:17,730 --> 02:12:19,890
Okay,
we should,

2354
02:12:20,020 --> 02:12:23,170
let's call it a day.
We'll see you in a week.
