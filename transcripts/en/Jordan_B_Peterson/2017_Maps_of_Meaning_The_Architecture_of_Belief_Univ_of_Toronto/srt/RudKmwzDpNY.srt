1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Okay,

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,550
now that you've had an opportunity to 
walk through a narrative,

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,590
then hopefully some of the things that 
I'm going to say that are more technical

4
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:24,670
will make more sense and so what we're 
going to do today,

5
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:26,530
at least in part,
is to deal with,

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,100
to start to deal with conceptualizing a 
solution to the fact that the world is 

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,600
too complex to properly perceive.
So what the problem fundamentally is,

8
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,000
is that there's a lot more of everything
else then there is of,

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,040
you know,
especially if you include in that 

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,090
everything else,
all the parts of you that you also don't

11
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,280
understand.
And so,

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,120
um,
I want to walk you through how I think 

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,561
we solved that at least in part.
And we do that by essentially by 

14
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,810
simplifying the world.
But I think mostly that we simplify.

15
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,820
It has a place in which to act rather 
than a place in which to perceive 

16
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,070
objects.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,340
And I really believe that there's a 
critical,

18
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,540
critical distinction between those two 
things.

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,990
I think that part of the reason that 
there's been a continual,

20
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:25,230
that there's been continual tension say 
between the claims of science and let's 

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,791
say the claims of religion is because 
the idea that the world as a place of 

22
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:35,221
objects and as a place to act,
have to be considered separately isn't 

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,840
properly understood.
Um,

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,380
I don't know.
So I'm going to try to straighten that 

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,591
up to the degree that that's possible.
So I'm going to talk to you about 

26
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:50,530
stories and met a stories.
And the story is this.

27
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,650
I would say it's the simplest unit of 
useful information with regards to 

28
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,440
action and perception that you can be 
offered at a Meta story is a story about

29
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:04,441
how a story like that transforms.
And I would say we'll concentrate on the

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,180
structure of the story and then we'll 
get into the structure of the Meta 

31
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,230
story.
And that'll constitute today's today's 

32
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:20,170
class.
So the first thing I want to show you,

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,660
I know many of you have seen this,
but I'm going to show it anyways.

34
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,350
For the longest time,
it was presumed that the longest time 

35
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,570
say,
at least in the 20th century,

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,750
it was presumed that we make a pretty 
complete model of the world and then we 

37
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:46,531
act in the world and we compare what 
happens to that model and as long as 

38
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:52,571
it's our model and the world are 
matching,

39
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,760
then roughly speaking,

40
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,240
we believe that everything is okay and 
our emotions stay under control.

41
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,640
But if that model mismatches,
then we knew that something's up.

42
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,480
Now,
a lot of this work was done by Russians,

43
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,410
especially in the early sixties,
um,

44
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,750
by two Russian scientists,
vinegar,

45
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:21,520
Dova and Sokolov who were students of 
Alexander Luria,

46
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,640
who was arguably the greatest neuro 
psychologist of the 20th century.

47
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,630
Larry has spent a lot of time studying 
soldiers from World War II that had 

48
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,860
received head injuries and of various 
sorts.

49
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:37,861
And because of that,
he could draw inferences about how the 

50
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:40,291
brain worked and some of what we're 
going to talk about over the upcoming 

51
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:44,040
weeks with regards to brain function.
Much of it is predicated on Lauria's 

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,280
work and Sokolov and vinegar Dover where
his students and they were interested in

53
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:53,281
this phenomena.
They were interested in 

54
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:53,281
psychophysiological measurement,
right?

55
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,980
So as a,
as a way of inferring brain function.

56
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,980
And so psychophysiological measurement 
is measurement of those physiological 

57
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,051
parameters,
say like pupil widths or or skin 

58
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:07,711
conductance or eeg that are in some ways
directly reflective of how the brain 

59
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,420
works.
Now,

60
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,410
if you measure skin resistance,
skin resistance changes with the amount 

61
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,760
that you swept and that that can change 
very,

62
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:23,761
very rapidly and it changes in response 
to physiological demands placed on your 

63
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,090
body.
So for example,

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,340
if your body assumes that you're going 
to leap into action for some purpose,

65
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,620
that it's going to open up your pores to
prepare you to keep yourself cool and 

66
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,301
you can measure those transformations 
quite accurately by measuring the 

67
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,260
electrical resistance of the skin.
And so what you see,

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,160
if you put someone in a lab chair and 
you expose themselves to different 

69
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:48,670
stimuli,
you find that,

70
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,671
for example,
if you expose them to something that's 

71
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:53,671
threatening,
say,

72
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:57,001
like a picture of a snake,
than their skin conductance will 

73
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:00,511
decrease because there or sorry,
their skin conductance will increase 

74
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:01,470
because they sweat a little bit more.

75
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,320
And it's quite a rapid response.
It can be a very rapid response.

76
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,860
Now,
one of the things that,

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,970
so [inaudible] or uh,
so yeah,

78
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:17,890
that's right noted was that if he is,
if I sat you down,

79
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:22,891
for example,
I put some headphones on you and I 

80
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:25,321
played a tone to you that repeated 
exactly the same tone that repeated at 

81
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,570
predictable intervals that the first 
time you heard the tone,

82
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,880
you'd produce quite a spike and skin 
conductance.

83
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,250
And the next time a slightly smaller 
spike.

84
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:38,251
And then the next time a slightly 
smaller spike until after maybe you'd 

85
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:40,930
heard it three or four times,
you would not respond to it at all.

86
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:43,570
And that was often regarded as 
habituation.

87
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:47,620
And habituation is the same thing that 
you can see in snails.

88
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,650
For example.
And I'm using snails as an example 

89
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,200
because they have very,
very simple nervous systems.

90
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,890
So if you take a snail and you poke it,
then like it comes out of its shell and 

91
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:58,890
you poke

92
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,980
it,
it'll go back into a shell and then 

93
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,931
it'll come out than if you poke it again
and go back into its shell and it will 

94
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:05,390
come out.
But if you keep doing that,

95
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,450
sooner or later,
the snail just stopped going in and you 

96
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,541
might think of that.
It has been conceptualized as the 

97
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,731
simplest form of learning habituation 
and the behavior has tended to presume 

98
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:22,091
that if a human being manifested,
a response that could be modeled by a 

99
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:26,531
simple organism,
then the human being was using a 

100
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:26,960
response that was analogous to that of 
the simple organism.

101
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,480
And sometimes that's true and sometimes 
it's not.

102
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,050
So for example,
you have simple reflexes that you know,

103
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,080
if you put your hand on a hot stove,
you'll jerk back and that's quite a 

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,021
simple circuit.
You move your hand back before the 

105
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:44,261
message gets to your brain because the 
spinal cord is smart enough to mediate 

106
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,320
reflex like that all by itself,
so you know your brain is actually quite

107
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,580
distributed throughout your body.

108
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,580
It's not just in your head like people 
tend to think and so we have conserved 

109
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,910
fast acting reflexes at various levels 
of our nervous system.

110
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,090
They they aren't capable of 
sophisticated response.

111
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,130
It's pretty much stimulus response 
thinking about it from the behavioral 

112
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,120
perspective,
but they have as an advantage,

113
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:16,121
incredible speed because there just 
aren't that many neural connections 

114
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:18,881
between the stimulus and the response 
and so we have layers of response at 

115
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:24,160
different timeframes that help us match 
with the demands of,

116
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,260
of the external environment.
So Charles Darwin,

117
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:32,261
for example,
used to go into the think was museum in 

118
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:32,261
England.
I don't remember the name of it.

119
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:36,880
They had a snake in there,
I believe it was a cobra and he'd stick 

120
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,870
his face up at the glass and the Cobra 
would strike Adam and he jerked back and

121
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:43,871
he tried many,
many times to master that reflexive 

122
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:43,871
response to the snake.

123
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,770
But there was no way,
every time that thing struck at him,

124
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:47,270
he,
he jumped backwards.

125
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:49,970
Well,
you can imagine the survival utility and

126
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,580
a reflex like that,
but in reflexes in general.

127
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,850
Okay,
so back to socal off.

128
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,040
Now,
what he decided,

129
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,850
he thought if you took that tone and you
did anything to it,

130
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:03,380
that was perceptible,
right?

131
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:08,381
Because there are certain gradations of 
tone that you're not capable of 

132
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:12,551
perceiving,
but let's assume you took the tone and 

133
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,921
you adjusted it enough so that it was 
perceptibly louder or it was 

134
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:16,580
perceptively a different frequency or 
something like that.

135
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,550
Or even that.
The spaces between the tones,

136
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,330
because I said they were predictably 
spaced even though if the spaces between

137
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:27,140
the tones were changed,
then when the change occurred,

138
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,900
the orienting reflex would be 
reinstated.

139
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,700
You'd respond to it again and socal have
tried to vary the tone on many,

140
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:35,840
many parameters.

141
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,750
But no matter what parameter he varied 
on,

142
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,020
as long as you could detect it,
perceptively,

143
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,200
you'd produce an orienting reflects.
So socalgas idea was that you must be 

144
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,380
producing a complex internal model of 
the world that's in concurrence with the

145
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:56,381
world and across pretty much every 
perceptible dimension because if you 

146
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:58,890
weren't doing that,
how in the world would you know that the

147
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:03,891
tone had changed from what you had 
already learned about it and so for the 

148
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:07,911
longest time,
and this was also true for people who 

149
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:07,911
are investigating artificial 
intelligence,

150
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,160
we had this idea that what people did 
was make a complex model of the world 

151
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,950
and hold it in their in their mind,
so to speak,

152
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,490
and then they'd act in the world and 
they compare what they expected to 

153
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,900
happen in the world with the model and 
as long as there was a match,

154
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:26,901
then there was no orienting reflects.
Now the orienting reflects turns out to 

155
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:30,231
be quite a complex reflex.
It's not merely an alteration in skin 

156
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:30,231
conductance.
What it is in,

157
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:31,050
in,
in essence,

158
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:36,051
is the manner in which you start to 
unfold your response to the unknown and 

159
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,630
the initial stages of that are very,
very quick.

160
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,050
But it's hard to tell when the orienting
reflex stops and when more complex 

161
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,760
learning begins,
they sort of shade into one another.

162
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,370
So the initial stages of the orienting 
reflects,

163
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,460
are quite reflective,
but the later stages can be 

164
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:55,890
extraordinarily complex.
So for example,

165
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,850
um,

166
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,110
well,
I,

167
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:08,000
I always think the example of betrayal 
is the best one because it,

168
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,980
because it's so complex.
So imagine that,

169
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,430
you know,
you come home and you find evidence 

170
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,670
lipstick or something like that.
Evidence that the person that you're 

171
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,601
with is betraying you.
The first thing that's going to happen 

172
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,631
is that you're going to orient,
there's going to be a real shock and 

173
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:26,660
that's a reflexive.
It's very much akin to the response that

174
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:31,661
you're going to,
that you would manifest if you saw a 

175
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:31,661
Predator or a snake or something like 
that.

176
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:33,470
And so that's very instantaneous,
you know,

177
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,130
um,
and then that'll prepare you for action.

178
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:42,131
You'll get,
you'll get ready to do whatever it is 

179
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:42,131
that you need to do next would be very 
unpleasant thing.

180
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:47,080
But then it might take you even years to
fully manifest the learning that would 

181
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:52,721
be necessary in a situation like that 
because there's so many things that you 

182
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:53,450
have to reconsider.

183
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,660
First of all,
the person might now appear to you as a 

184
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,121
threat that's pretty immediate.
So there's a biological physiological 

185
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:02,210
response.
First your body reacts first,

186
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,570
then you respond emotionally.
That's gonna take awhile and you know 

187
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,901
that emotional response might extend 
over days or weeks or months or even 

188
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,860
years.
And then as you're doing that as well,

189
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:17,861
you're going to try to start to resort 
out your interpretive Schema so that it 

190
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:20,570
can adjust to the transformation that 
this,

191
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,890
this,
um,

192
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,290
this error on your part,
say,

193
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,060
or this catastrophe or this betrayal,
it'll,

194
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,300
it,
it has to adjust to whatever information

195
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,480
that event contains.
And so the orienting reflex can,

196
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,650
can manifest itself over an 
extraordinarily long period of time.

197
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,020
It's best to think about it as the 
initial pro part of,

198
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,770
of what can be a very complex learning 
process.

199
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,610
Now that was standard.
That was a standard idea in psychology 

200
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,530
for the longest period of time that we.

201
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,760
We created a detailed internal model of 
world and we watched how the world was 

202
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,560
unfolding.
We compared the two and the physiology,

203
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,040
the neurophysiology of this was even 
understood to some degree even by the 

204
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,510
Russians in the early 19 sixties because
they basically localized.

205
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,780
You could use complex eeg,
electroencephalogram technology to 

206
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,521
localize where the orienting reflex was 
occurring in the brain and basically it 

207
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:21,421
appeared to occur roughly speaking in 
the hippocampus and the theory of that 

208
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,020
your brain,
your cortex,

209
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:28,021
let's say,
produced a very complex model of the 

210
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:28,021
world,
an internal model and your senses,

211
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:32,951
and we're producing a model of the 
external world and the hippocampus was 

212
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:35,770
watching those two things to see if they
matched and if they didn't match,

213
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:40,771
there was a mismatch signal and that 
would be the orientation reflects and 

214
00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:43,831
then your body would start to prepare,
would prepare itself for whatever that 

215
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,200
mismatch meant,
and then you would engage in exploratory

216
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,150
behavior to try to update your model.

217
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,870
That was the standard theory.
It was very well accepted theory.

218
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,350
It has elements of cybernetic theory in 
it,

219
00:12:56,351 --> 00:13:01,351
but it was well accepted enough so that 
when people first started to experiment 

220
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:06,091
with artificial intelligence,
that's how they tried to make 

221
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:07,570
artificially intelligent systems.
They tried to make ones that would model

222
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:12,130
the world and then act and then compare 
the changes in the world to that model,

223
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,780
but that didn't go anywhere as it turned
out because it.

224
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,920
It turned out that it's so.
It's so difficult to see and model the 

225
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,210
world that people had.
People had no idea how complex that was.

226
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,420
It was impossibly complex as it turned 
out,

227
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:29,260
and so that's part of the reason we 
don't have robots wandering around doing

228
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:34,261
apparently simple things like walking 
with a walking in an environment like 

229
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:34,600
this.
Now when we look at the environment,

230
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,350
we think,
well,

231
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,620
it's not that much different.

232
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,660
It's not that hard to look at.
It's full of objects and they're just 

233
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,881
self evident.
There they are and we can just wander 

234
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:44,881
through it,
you know,

235
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:48,400
and we don't even do that consciously to
any great degree because so much of that

236
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:52,270
perception is presented to our 
consciousness without effort.

237
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,300
In some sense,
but the ai guys learned pretty quick 

238
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,241
that perceiving the world was way more 
difficult than anybody had guest and 

239
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:05,011
then this experiment really in some sets
put a phenomenal logical put a 

240
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:11,090
phenomenological punch behind that 
observation because one of the 

241
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,271
presuppositions of the orienting reflex 
theory that I just laid out was that you

242
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:20,641
were very good at detecting changes,
that your nervous system would 

243
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:22,360
automatically detect change anomaly,
right?

244
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,750
Any mismatch between your model and what
you expected.

245
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:29,860
And then while the AI guys I think 
figured out first of all that that was a

246
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:34,861
big problem,
that the problem of perception was much 

247
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:34,861
more complicated than that.

248
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:35,770
You know,
it's actually,

249
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,050
it's out of that same set of 
observations in some sense that 

250
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,690
postmodernism emerged in literature 
because in literary criticism because,

251
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,010
well it turns out to be hard enough to 
see a normal object like a chair and 

252
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,980
part of that is,
is,

253
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,240
you know,
if you just do that to the chair,

254
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,600
it's really different than it was 
before.

255
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,210
You could imagine how different it would
be if you tried to paint the chair under

256
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:00,620
both those conditions.
Right.

257
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,170
And if you were really good at looking 
at it,

258
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:06,380
you'd find that even though if I asked 
you what color this is,

259
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:09,050
you'd say white,
if you were actually painting it,

260
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,700
you'd find out that the colors of the 
chair when it's in that location and the

261
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,190
colors in the chair when it's in that 
location,

262
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:19,220
just because of the difference in 
lighting are substantially different.

263
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I think it was monet,
I think who painted a very large series 

264
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,661
of haystacks in the French countryside,
right under in different seasons and 

265
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,420
under different conditions of 
illumination,

266
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,840
just because he was exploring how 
radically different the same object 

267
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,591
could be as it moved through contexts 
and so it isn't even obvious why we 

268
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:43,181
think this is the same object when you 
move it and the answer is something 

269
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:43,181
like,
well,

270
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:47,201
you can sit on it in both positions,
which is not a description of an object 

271
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:48,560
by the way.
Right?

272
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,960
That's a description of something that's
useful.

273
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:53,660
Something that's a tool,
something that exists in relationship to

274
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,670
your body.
It's not an object.

275
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,380
And so if you think that just looking at
something like a chair is almost 

276
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,770
impossibly difficult and subject to 
interpretation,

277
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,940
they'd imagine how difficult it is to 
perceive something like a text,

278
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,180
you know,
like a novel because a novel object 

279
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,791
obviously is subject to multiple 
interpretations of the interpretations 

280
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,760
are going to depend on who else,
at least in principle on the intent,

281
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,420
conscious and unconscious of the author 
of the time,

282
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:24,950
of the place,
of the culture,

283
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:25,940
of the language.

284
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,200
Then that's just on the side of the 
production itself.

285
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:35,201
But then there's the reader.
It's like I've read books when I was 16 

286
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:39,581
and then reread them,
say when I was 40 and the book was 

287
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:39,581
almost completely different as far as I 
was concerned,

288
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:44,650
partly because I knew it.
I knew what was in it the second time 

289
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:44,650
and I didn't know what was in it the 
first time.

290
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,840
And so the,
the meaning that manifests itself out of

291
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:53,960
a book is a consequence of all the 
complexity of the book.

292
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,170
Plus all the complexity of the reader.
And so you know,

293
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,270
if you,
if you're reading Russian literature for

294
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:00,980
example,
and you've already read 50,

295
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,190
50 Russian novels,
you're going to be in a much more 

296
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,521
difficult different.
You're going to be in a different 

297
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:11,891
interpretive space than you are if say 
the Russian novel is the first novel 

298
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:16,751
you've ever read and so and the 
postmodernists were grappling with this 

299
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,870
w as as well as with many other ideas 
that I think contaminated their thinking

300
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,890
and their conclusion was,
well,

301
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:28,310
you can't extract out a canonical 
meaning from a text.

302
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,290
It's so dependent on the situation that 
to say that the text has a interpretable

303
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,570
meaning is actually an error.
Now,

304
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,740
just because it's difficult to do 
something doesn't mean it's impossible 

305
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,161
and there's massive holes in the 
postmodernist view as far as I think 

306
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:47,450
it's an unbelievably pathological view 
personally,

307
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,690
but.
But the thing is is that there are 

308
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,881
reasons why it emerged and the reasons 
were analogous to the reasons that the 

309
00:17:55,881 --> 00:18:00,651
AI project initially failed and 
analogous to the reasons that this 

310
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:03,150
experiment turned out the way it did.
So I'm going to show you this.

311
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,610
Many of you have seen this already,
but as I said,

312
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:06,530
it doesn't matter.
So the,

313
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,190
the,
the job,

314
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,200
your job here is to count the Times.
He,

315
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,230
there's a team of three people here 
dressed in white and there's a team of 

316
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,330
three people here dressed in black and 
your job is to count the number of times

317
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:23,331
the white team throws the basketball 
back and forth to the white team 

318
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:23,331
members.
Okay.

319
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:24,450
So we'll just run that.

320
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,610
Okay.
Well,

321
00:18:56,641 --> 00:19:00,990
so obviously are perhaps not.
So obviously the,

322
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,350
um,
the number of times,

323
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,560
I believe that they threw it back,
they threw it back and forth with 16,

324
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:12,561
if I remember this correctly.
But of course that's not really the 

325
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:15,891
issue because what happens in the middle
of the scene is that a guy wearing a 

326
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:20,040
gorilla suit comes out into the middle 
of the screen and pounds his chest three

327
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,220
or four times as credit.
He comes out quite slowly as,

328
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,400
as you saw.
How many of you.

329
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,410
Is there?
Anybody here who didn't see the gorilla?

330
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,030
No.
Well,

331
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:29,370
you and I presume all of you knew about 
this video.

332
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,630
Anyways.
So,

333
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,800
uh,
Dan Simon who produced this video has 

334
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:35,800
got a couple of other ones where he 
shows that,

335
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,240
uh,
you know,

336
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:41,241
even if you're smart enough to see the 
gorilla because you've seen the video 

337
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:41,241
before,
you've heard about it,

338
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:42,870
if you make other changes in the 
background,

339
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:48,370
you'll,
you'll count properly and you'll catch 

340
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:48,370
the grill,
but you'll miss the other changes in the

341
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:48,510
background and they're not trivial 
either.

342
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,970
And it's really quite remarkable.
He's produced other,

343
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,470
uh,
uh,

344
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,940
short videos,
for example,

345
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:58,941
where you'll be looking at a,
like a field and a road will grow in it,

346
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,310
occupying about a third of the 
photograph space.

347
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:02,970
And you'd think,
well,

348
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:03,890
yeah,
you're going to see that.

349
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,560
Like,
you don't,

350
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,210
you don't.
So,

351
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,450
okay,
so this,

352
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,200
through this,
through a big spanner into the works,

353
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:12,990
this sort of experimental along with the
Ai Failures.

354
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:15,330
And we could even say the postmodern 
dilemma.

355
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:16,170
It's like,
well,

356
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,340
everyone,
virtually every psychologist would have 

357
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,571
predicted before this series of 
experiments that there's no damn way 

358
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:29,511
you'd miss that gorilla because your 
nervous system was actually attuned to 

359
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:31,290
change in the environment.
And like that's a big change.

360
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:36,291
And it's also a gorilla,
it's something you would really think 

361
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,110
that you couldn't miss,
you couldn't possibly miss,

362
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,920
especially when it's occupying the 
center of the,

363
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,280
of the visual field.

364
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,820
And so,
well this is part of a phenomena called 

365
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,031
changed blindness and it helped 
psychologists who had been studying the 

366
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,850
visual system for a very long time 
figure out,

367
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,870
well mostly figure out exactly how blind
human beings are because we're way 

368
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,480
blinder than we think.
And,

369
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,340
and so we actually focused on much less 
of the world than we think.

370
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:08,341
And we do that partly.
It's not exactly obvious how we do it.

371
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:13,441
It's Kinda like we,
we hold a still picture in our 

372
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:15,730
imagination and then fill in the details
by using our central Fulvio Vision,

373
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:20,731
which has always dancing around like a,
like a pinpoint or a laser beam moving 

374
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:25,141
back and forth.
And we're assembling those little 

375
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:27,400
snapshots from the phobia into a 
relatively coherent picture.

376
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,410
Maybe what happens is that a lot.
I look at you and then I look at you and

377
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:37,411
I've still got the information from 
looking at you so my brain can sort of 

378
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:38,340
infer that,
that that's remained stable,

379
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,840
but like if I look at you and I and I 
pay it,

380
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I've tried to learn how to do this 
because you could look at something and 

381
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,210
then pay attention to the periphery.

382
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,600
It's annoying,
but so if I'm looking at you,

383
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,230
I really can't make out your eyes.
I can more or less make out the fact 

384
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,230
that you have a head.
I can see that you're an eye,

385
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,440
especially if you move it and so that's 
what your periphery sorta like frog 

386
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,821
vision or dinosaur vision,
it's much better at picking up movement 

387
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:09,151
than it is at picking up something 
that's staying still and that makes 

388
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:12,460
sense because well if it staying still 
then and it hasn't already hurt you,

389
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,500
then it's probably not going to hurt 
you.

390
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:19,501
But if it's moving then you know that's 
a good thing that you might pay 

391
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:22,771
attention to.
And so if your periphery catches 

392
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:22,771
movement,
then you'll focus your phobia on it.

393
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:26,430
It's like you go from really low 
resolution to really high resolution,

394
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,800
so the center of your vision is 
incredibly high resolution,

395
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,160
but then it fades into low resolution as
you move towards the periphery until 

396
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,881
it's out here,
which would say it'd be about 170 

397
00:22:38,881 --> 00:22:38,881
degrees.

398
00:22:38,881 --> 00:22:41,350
I really,
if I concentrate on this hand,

399
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,930
I can tell it's a hand mostly when it's 
moving.

400
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,320
I have no idea what color it is,
this one I can't see at all,

401
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:53,190
and then I can probably see my fingers 
now and then I can clearly see them if 

402
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:57,460
I,
if I look at them with my phobia,

403
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,890
and so your vision is a very,
very,

404
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:04,891
very strange thing and it focusing on 
something very specific and so you're 

405
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:09,271
pointing your eyes at something very 
specific and that's what you seem to 

406
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:09,271
see.
And so,

407
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:13,090
so then that opens up a whole new 
universe of questions.

408
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:18,091
It's like,
how do you decide what to point your 

409
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:20,581
eyes out that that turns out to be an 
insanely complicated problem.

410
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,440
John Burbank,
he talks about that all the time as the 

411
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:26,830
problem of relevance,
but the issue is,

412
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:27,610
well,
there's many,

413
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:28,780
many things in the world.

414
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,090
There's an infinite number of things,
let's say,

415
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,460
and you're not going to be able to see 
them.

416
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:36,400
That's for sure.
Even if they happen to be changing as it

417
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:39,790
turns out and so out of this mess.
First of all,

418
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,650
how do you pick what to look at and 
second,

419
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:43,780
even if you do pick it,
how do you see it?

420
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,930
Because it's so crazily complicated,
so that's the problem that we're going 

421
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,580
to try to unpack.
Now,

422
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,940
roughly speaking,
what seemed to have happened with the 

423
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,791
gorilla video is you have to take that 
first theory that you make a complete 

424
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,710
model of the world and then a complete 
model of the world,

425
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,740
which is the objects in the world and 
how they're interacting,

426
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,820
and you compare that to the objects in 
the actual world and how they're 

427
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:09,820
interacting.
You have to modify that model.

428
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,130
You say,
well,

429
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:15,131
no,
you're certainly not making a complete 

430
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:15,190
model and people should have known 
better anyways,

431
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,980
even subjects to the limits of your 
perceptions because there's all sorts of

432
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:21,020
things in the world that you cannot 
directly perceive,

433
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,500
but what you're doing instead is it's 
something like you're making a partial 

434
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:32,051
model of the world,
but you're only making a partial model 

435
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:34,961
of the world that you're currently 
operating on that on on with some goal 

436
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:39,281
in mind and you're also comparing that 
to a model of the world as it's 

437
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:39,281
currently unfolding.

438
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,560
Because the other thing that was 
implicit in this is really tricky.

439
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:44,720
This is where you have to watch your 
implicit assumptions.

440
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:50,260
The other thing that was implicit in the
original cybernetic theory was that you 

441
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:56,171
have a model of the world that's 
complete and then what you're watching 

442
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:59,540
is the actual world as it unfolds,
and that's not a model.

443
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,760
That's just your perception of the 
objects,

444
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:06,761
but that also turns out to be wrong 
because your perception of the world as 

445
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:11,351
it unfolds is also a model.
And so what's happening is you look at 

446
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:15,461
the world,
the world you see as a model and a very 

447
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:19,451
partial model at that,
and then you compare it to the model 

448
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,810
that you expect or desire more 
accurately desire.

449
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,240
Although the initial models were 
expectation,

450
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,030
because if you're in the lab listening 
to tones,

451
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:31,031
it's not like you desire anything,
but mostly when you're acting in the 

452
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,480
world,
you have desires and so the experimental

453
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,750
constraints skewed the data in some 
sense by making people assume that what 

454
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:43,451
people were doing when they walked 
through the world was expecting instead 

455
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:46,451
of desiring anyways,
you have a model of the world that's 

456
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:46,451
generated.

457
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:50,470
As you look at it,
you have another model of the world 

458
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,470
that's something like the world that you
desire.

459
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,910
Then you compare both of them and they 
can mismatch and they can miss match in 

460
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,890
a way that upsets your current pursuit.
That's the critical issue.

461
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,200
You don't see the anomaly unless it 
upsets your current pursuit and you kind

462
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:05,030
of know that too because when you're 
like,

463
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,800
while I'm lecturing to you guys,
you know,

464
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:12,810
it was mostly you're sitting still,
but people are moving their arms and 

465
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,880
they're moving their glasses and they're
shifting their feet and generally I 

466
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,370
don't see any of that because what 
difference does it make,

467
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,270
you know as it's not relevant to the 
ongoing,

468
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,960
the ongoing,
what ongoing contract,

469
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,040
the an ongoing series of interactions,
it,

470
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:34,041
something like that.
So as long as you keep your movements 

471
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:37,031
bounded within a,
within a range that doesn't interfere 

472
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:41,591
with whatever it is that we're doing,
then I'm going to be as invisible to me 

473
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:44,670
as the gorilla was when you were 
counting the balls and the cool thing is

474
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:49,671
about the gorilla experiment or one of 
them is that the reason you were blind 

475
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:50,520
to the gorilla was because you were 
counting the balls.

476
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,300
And so what?
That's so fascinating because what it 

477
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,781
shows to a huge degree in unfathomable 
degree to to to to an unfathomable 

478
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:06,681
degree is that the value structure that 
you inhabit determines what you 

479
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:11,451
perceive.
It doesn't just determine what you 

480
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:13,761
expect or want it bloody well determines
what you see and that that makes the 

481
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:16,860
world a completely different place.
No one really expected that,

482
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,390
and so if you watch the basketballs you 
see or the basketball,

483
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:24,420
you see the basketball.
If you stop watching the basketball,

484
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,660
well then you see the gorilla and so the
first question that arises from an 

485
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,540
experiment like that is,
well,

486
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,140
just exactly what is it that you don't 
see in the world?

487
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:38,040
And the answer is all of it.
You see so little.

488
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:43,041
It's unbelievable.
You see that tiny amount that's 

489
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,801
necessary for you to undertake the next 
sequence in your plotted movements.

490
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,890
Something like that,
but then that becomes very complicated 

491
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,011
too because it isn't obvious how you can
conceptualize or how you can determine 

492
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,590
what your next movement is because it's 
not like you just add up movements and 

493
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:04,920
make up your life.
It's not that simple and it's related to

494
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:09,921
the to the novel problem,
the problem of meaning in a in a 

495
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,970
literary work,
so you imagine you're trying to specify 

496
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,490
the meaning of a literary work.
Well,

497
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,440
there's meaning in the word and then,
but the word is dependent meaning of the

498
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:22,920
word is dependent on the phrase within 
which it's embedded and then the meaning

499
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:27,921
of the phrase is determined dependent on
the sentence that it's embedded in and 

500
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:30,840
the sentence in the paragraph and the 
paragraph in the chapter and the chapter

501
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:35,841
in the book and the book and the Corpus 
of books of that sort and then within 

502
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,380
the culture and then within whatever 
you're peculiar personal experiences,

503
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:44,160
all of those things nested our operative
to some degree.

504
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,100
When you're extracting out the meaning 
at any level of analysis.

505
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,350
They're all operating simultaneously.
So you might say,

506
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,750
well,
what are you doing in this classroom?

507
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,410
Well,
the answer is sitting in a chair,

508
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,460
but that's obviously.
That's a very short term and context 

509
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,680
independent answer,
but you're also attending to what I'm 

510
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,421
saying hypothetically,
and you're attending to some of it and 

511
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:14,271
not other parts of it.
You're thinking about some parts of it 

512
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:16,891
and not other parts,
and you're also attending a class and 

513
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:21,771
the class as a sequence of lectures and 
that's embedded within your desire to 

514
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:25,881
finish up the semester and then to 
finish up the year and then to get your 

515
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:27,780
degree and that you nest that inside,
whatever it is,

516
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:32,870
whatever the reason is that you're 
getting your degree and then maybe 

517
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,460
that's nested inside your career goals 
and that's nested inside your life goals

518
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:37,680
and that's nested inside your ultimate 
values,

519
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,050
which you may or may not even be aware 
of,

520
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,030
and so I could say,
well,

521
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,820
you're sitting here because it serves 
your ultimate values.

522
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,950
Well,
that's true.

523
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,300
It seems a bit abstract to be useful,
right?

524
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:57,301
It's.
It gets so vague out at the out at the 

525
00:29:57,301 --> 00:29:58,360
outermost levels that it doesn't really 
have much specificity.

526
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:00,100
Right?
So it seems to lack information,

527
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:05,101
but by the same token,
if I said what you're doing is sitting 

528
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:08,011
there,
it has the same problem of too 

529
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:08,620
restricted meaning because of over 
specificity.

530
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,640
And so there's some level in there that 
you would,

531
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,250
that you would interpret as meaningful.
God only knows why,

532
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,730
and that's the level.
There's a natural level of perception 

533
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,250
for that sort of thing.
So for example,

534
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,270
um,
when children learn to name an animal,

535
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:26,890
for example,
they'll name cat,

536
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,630
they don't name this species of cat or 
the sub species of cat and they don't 

537
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,810
confuse cats with dogs even though 
they're both in the category for,

538
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,840
you know,
four legged furry mammal.

539
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,790
So why not call a cat and a dog?
Furry mammals.

540
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,830
Well,
children don't do that.

541
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:46,720
They go there,
you go to cat and dog.

542
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:51,721
And people who've who've studied the 
acquisition of language have found that 

543
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:54,400
there are basic level categories that 
children pick up first.

544
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:59,401
And they're are often represented with 
short words and the words are short 

545
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:02,650
because they've been around a long time 
because they seem to reflect the natural

546
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,660
level at which people perceive the 
world.

547
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,850
But none of that's obvious,
you know,

548
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,810
it's,
it's,

549
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,130
it's,
I mean,

550
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:14,131
you could just lump pull at animals 
together for that matter and just call 

551
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:14,260
them animals,
which we do sometimes.

552
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,680
So anyway,
so it's very difficult to specify the 

553
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,460
meaning level and it's not very easy at 
all to figure out how we do it.

554
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,970
And so that's partly what I'm,
what I'm trying to unpack.

555
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,960
So here's,
here's part of the issue.

556
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,260
So let's say that you're,
you have a computer.

557
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,710
Yeah.
I have a story for this.

558
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,110
So,
um,

559
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,380
one time when I was in Montreal,
I was using my computer,

560
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,780
it's in my apartment and I was typing 
out an essay and it crashed.

561
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,790
And so what happens when your computer 
crashes?

562
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:52,300
Well,
you know,

563
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:57,301
usually you have some sort of curse and 
it's interesting that you do that 

564
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:02,371
because the circuit that you use to 
curse with is the same circuit that 

565
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:05,710
monkeys used to detect eagles or 
leopards or snakes.

566
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,310
And so when,
when there's a bunch of monkeys 

567
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,310
together,
you know,

568
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,070
they're not all preyed on by eagles and 
leopards and snakes,

569
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:17,071
but you know,
there's usually a Predator in that 

570
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:17,071
category for every single monkey 
population.

571
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:19,180
And so when the monkeys are watching,
they have an,

572
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,570
an emotional adherents that the most 
nervous monkey might utter first that 

573
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,390
basically says,
you know,

574
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,720
hide from the Eagle,
get out onto thin branch so the cougar 

575
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,240
can't eat you and look the hell out for 
the snake.

576
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,600
But there's a circuit that's linked to 
emotions that produces an instinctive 

577
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,171
honor that represents that category.
And that's the same circuit that you use

578
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:45,680
when you curse and it's not the same 
circuit that used for normal language.

579
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,740
And we know that because that circuit is
activated and people who have to Rett 

580
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,250
Syndrome because they preferentially 
swear,

581
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,060
you think,
well,

582
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:58,061
how,
why in the world would you have a 

583
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:58,061
neurological condition that makes you 
preferentially curse?

584
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:02,590
Well,
that's the reason why you don't just 

585
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:02,590
have one linguistic circuit.
You have one for,

586
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,890
oh my God,
there's a predator.

587
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,960
And that's the one that will get 
activated when something happens.

588
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:13,961
Like your computer crashing because you 
know you're an evolved creature and so 

589
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:17,921
those old circuits that were there say 
30 million years ago to deal with 

590
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:21,890
exceptions are the same circuits you're 
using now to deal with your computer.

591
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,390
Why else would you want to hit it?

592
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:29,290
Right?
Because that's what you want to give it 

593
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,611
a whack.
It's like it doesn't behave whap 

594
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:30,611
aggression right away.
Well,

595
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:35,291
that's some clue as to the categorize,
categorize category system that you're 

596
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:38,120
automatically using to encapsulate the 
event.

597
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,400
Okay,
so fine.

598
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:41,950
What do you do when your computer 
crashes?

599
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Well,
first you curse and then you do the 

600
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,551
stupid things that idiot primates do 
when they're trying to deal with 

601
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:50,090
something that's way too complex and 
maybe you turn it on and off,

602
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,710
right?
And that doesn't work.

603
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:53,060
It didn't work.
And so then I thought,

604
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:54,350
well,
maybe the power bar went.

605
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:56,450
So I checked the power,
barred it.

606
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,690
I turned it on and off and nothing 
happened.

607
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,410
So I brought a light behind the 
computer.

608
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:01,850
The light wouldn't go on,
so I thought,

609
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:04,280
ah Ha,
I must have blown a fuse.

610
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:07,080
So I went to the fuse box and took a,
took a look,

611
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,560
but the fuses were fine and so I 
thought,

612
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,000
oh,
the power's gone out.

613
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,460
So then I went outside and the power was
out.

614
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,870
None of the street lights were working 
in.

615
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:20,871
The power was out everywhere and it was 
seriously out because this was the time 

616
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:23,630
that the almost the entire northeast 
power grid in,

617
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:28,650
in Quebec collapsed.
And the reason it collapsed is because 

618
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,351
there was a solar flare that happens 
reasonably often and the solar flare 

619
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:34,860
produced a huge electromagnetic pulse 
because it's basically,

620
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,990
you know,
like a billion high million hydrogen 

621
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,701
bombs going off at the same time.
Ninety 3 million miles away produces 

622
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:45,730
this tremendous electromagnetic pulse 
passes through the years.

623
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:50,731
Sat atmosphere produces a,
a spike and current in the main power 

624
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:54,050
lines and blows the whole system.
And so just so you know,

625
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:59,510
assist an event like that happens about 
every hundred and 50 years.

626
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,170
And if we had what now it would take out
all of our electronics,

627
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:08,171
like one of the big ones,
there was a big one back in the late 18 

628
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:08,171
hundreds.

629
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:08,171
Everything,
satellites,

630
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:08,171
computers,
cars,

631
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,360
everything gone,
and so that's a big problem and no one 

632
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,381
knows what to do about it.
One misdose by about nine minutes I 

633
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:17,381
think two years ago.
So.

634
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,810
So that's something else to worry about 
if you're inclined to worry about those 

635
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:22,810
sorts of things.
Um,

636
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,690
okay.
So what,

637
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:25,370
what did I conclude from that?
Well,

638
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,760
the function of my computer was 
dependent on the stability of the sun.

639
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,270
It's not the first thing you check out 
when your computer crashes,

640
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:36,110
right?
You don't run out and go,

641
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:37,110
hey,
well yeah,

642
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:40,350
the sun still sudden still there,
no product.

643
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:45,351
I can cross that off the list.
But to me it's an extraordinarily 

644
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:49,560
interesting example of the invisible 
interdependence of things.

645
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,630
You know,
when our tendency to fragment,

646
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:57,050
what we seem to do is to look at things 
at the simplest level of analysis that 

647
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:57,660
actually functions.

648
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,320
So for example,
when you're interacting with your 

649
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,301
computer,
you're not interacting with your 

650
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:06,090
computer at all really.
You're interacting with the keyboard,

651
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:11,330
sort of one key at a time and you're 
interacting with the symbols on the 

652
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,130
screen.
But as long as the computer is working,

653
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,820
you don't care about it at all,
you don't give it a second thought and 

654
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,660
you certainly don't care about the fact 
that it's dependent on.

655
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,180
Well,
the electrical power for example,

656
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:26,070
and the electrical power is dependent 
on,

657
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:32,790
you know,
I don't know how many men are out there 

658
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,450
right now or we're out there last night 
when it was freezing rain,

659
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:39,230
fixing power lines and freezing to death
while they're doing it so that your 

660
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,310
stupid computer doesn't malfunction 
while you're watching cat videos.

661
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:46,430
You know,
I mean there's this incredibly dynamic 

662
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,400
living system that social and economic 
and political that has to remain dead 

663
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,790
stable in order for us to have access to
functional and like pure non fluctuating

664
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,720
electricity 100 percent of the time 
because he also don't think,

665
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:05,721
well,
the stability of your computer is 

666
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:05,721
dependent on the stability of the 
political system.

667
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:09,560
But of course it is because if the 
political system mucks up and the 

668
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,041
economic system goes,
then people don't go work to fix things 

669
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:16,431
and things are breaking all the time.
That's their normal state is broken,

670
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,760
not,
not working.

671
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,900
And so,
and that's all in some sense,

672
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:27,210
fold it up,
not only inside your computer but 

673
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,351
actually inside your conceptions of,
of your tiny conceptions of the computer

674
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:35,691
while you're using it and you want to 
get a glimpse of what the computer is 

675
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:35,691
really like.
When it doesn't work,

676
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,640
then it's when it becomes a complex 
object,

677
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:39,990
right?
As long as it's working,

678
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,620
then you're stupid.
Perceptions are are perfectly fine to 

679
00:37:45,691 --> 00:37:50,691
get the job done and that's another 
indication that what you're using your 

680
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:54,771
perceptions for is to get the job done 
and how you specify exactly the level of

681
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,320
resolution that you should be operating 
at.

682
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:04,270
I haven't sorted that out,
but it's something like you default to 

683
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,070
the simplest level that moves you to the
next step.

684
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,780
You know?
So for example,

685
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:11,781
and generally that is what you should do
if you're having an argument with 

686
00:38:11,781 --> 00:38:12,060
someone that you have a longterm 
relationship with.

687
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,050
You can start by arguing about what the 
little argument is about.

688
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:21,051
Or you can immediately cascade into 
whether or not you should have a 

689
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:24,561
relationship with this person at all,
or even into whether or not you should 

690
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:26,910
even bother with relationships,
which is,

691
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,480
you know,
every time there's an argument that 

692
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:32,940
question is a reasonable question to 
have emerge,

693
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,830
or at least it's in the realm of 
potential reasonable questions,

694
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,130
but it doesn't seem useful to jump to 
the most catastrophic possible 

695
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,750
explanation.
Every time some minor thing goes wrong.

696
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,360
That's what happens to people who have 
an anxiety disorder.

697
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,850
And that's what happens to people who 
are depressed,

698
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,220
right?
They can't bind the informally.

699
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,460
And so what happens is it tends to 
propagate up the entire system until it 

700
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,850
takes out their highest order 
conceptualizations,

701
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,280
you know?
So if you're seriously depressed,

702
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,250
maybe you'll watch a news article about 
something stupid and you'll think,

703
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:04,900
Jesus,
why should I even be alive?

704
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:05,500
You know,
and,

705
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,600
and I'm dead serious about that.
If you score 60 on the beck depression 

706
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,701
inventory,
which puts you way the hell up and the 

707
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,501
depressed range,
anything that happens to you that's 

708
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:18,100
negative will trigger suicidal thoughts,
roughly speaking.

709
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:23,101
And sometimes even positive things.
We'll do it because there are very few 

710
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:26,470
positive things that happen that don't 
carry with them some threat of change or

711
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:30,820
transformation.
So you know one mystery.

712
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:35,821
It's a big mystery is why don't you fall
into a catastrophic depression every 

713
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:38,920
time something goes wrong because it's 
not.

714
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,090
That level of analysis is not self 
evident and you see this with people who

715
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:48,091
are high in neuroticism too.
You know there are trivial fluctuations 

716
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:56,341
at their workplace or in their 
relationships or in their health will 

717
00:39:56,341 --> 00:39:58,570
produce a disproportionate negative 
emotional response,

718
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:03,571
but it's.
It's part of the range of normal 

719
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:03,571
emotional responses.
Some people are very,

720
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,200
very high in neuroticism,
so everything upsets them.

721
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:10,201
Some people are very low and the reason 
that whole range exists is because 

722
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:12,730
sometimes you should get upset when some
little thing happens to you because it's

723
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:16,300
an indication that the whole damn 
environment has got dangerous on you and

724
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:19,360
sometimes you should just brush it off 
because you know it's,

725
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:24,220
it's net consequence is low,
but how do you calculate that?

726
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,050
Very,
very difficult question.

727
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,960
So you know when your computer goes 
wrong.

728
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,220
Well,
you have to pick the proper level of 

729
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,230
analysis to fix it and you could say,
well,

730
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,950
there's something wrong with the circuit
board and maybe you know,

731
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,520
there's a crack in one of the,
uh,

732
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,410
and one of the US somewhere that it's 
soldered and,

733
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,560
or,
you know,

734
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,580
sometimes now when people are building 
microchips,

735
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,950
they've run into a crazy problem.

736
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,860
Intel microchips keep getting smaller 
and smaller and smaller.

737
00:40:56,861 --> 00:40:58,390
Right?
And so the little wires,

738
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:01,760
now we're down to atomic weight or you 
know,

739
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,850
the width of maybe 20 adams or something
like that.

740
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:06,340
But really,
really they're really getting thin.

741
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,780
And so that produces another problem 
which no one would have ever.

742
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,670
No,
no,

743
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,200
you wouldn't expect.
And that is,

744
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:16,480
you know,
that at the quantum level,

745
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,820
there's uncertainty about where 
electrons might be normally out.

746
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:25,830
Doesn't matter the degree of uncertainty
about where your electrons are small 

747
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,580
enough at your size so that it's 
basically irrelevant.

748
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:33,390
But down at the subatomic level where 
these microchips are starting to be 

749
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,571
produced,
sometimes electrons will be outside the 

750
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:37,460
wires and that means that they're 
getting so damn small that they'll short

751
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:42,461
circuit by themselves because the 
electrons aren't stable enough to be 

752
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:42,650
where they're supposed to be in the 
wires.

753
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,030
And so,
well the reason I'm pointing that out is

754
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:52,031
because a problem that exists in the 
system can exist at any of the multiple 

755
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:55,640
levels of that system.
And it isn't obvious where to start.

756
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,920
And a lot of political arguments are,
are like that,

757
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,150
you know,
it's like,

758
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,620
well maybe a company goes bankrupt and 
its shareholders get,

759
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,310
maybe a bank fails and so people can't 
withdraw their money.

760
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:12,311
And one response is,
well that just shows you how rotten the 

761
00:42:12,311 --> 00:42:12,311
capitalist system is.
It's like,

762
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,250
well maybe that is what it shows.
But it seems there's,

763
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,930
it seems like that might not be the most
appropriate level to start.

764
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,530
And so again,
it's [inaudible] razor in the scientific

765
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,340
world,
right?

766
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,730
You want to use the simplest explanation
that it's not that fits the facts 

767
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,320
because you don't organize your 
perceptions by facts.

768
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,890
It's kind of like you want to use the 
simplest tool you can possibly manage to

769
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:38,900
fix the problem so you don't.

770
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,960
When your car has a flat tire,
you don't buy a new car,

771
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,510
you,
you fix the flat tire.

772
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:49,511
If you can figure out how to do it and 
so you go for the thing that will put 

773
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:53,210
the tool back together with a minimum 
investment of time and effort.

774
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,300
It's something like that and you care 
about that because you have limited time

775
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:03,521
and you have limited resources and so it
makes sense for you to conserve them and

776
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:10,350
I'm telling you that partly for 
practical reasons too because this is a 

777
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,841
very useful thing to know.
If you're arguing with someone you want 

778
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:18,131
to argue about the smallest possible 
thing that you could argue both that 

779
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:19,550
might fix the problem.
You want to really specify it.

780
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:24,551
It's like what's going on at a micro 
level and what's the minimum that I 

781
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:26,990
would require to be satisfied with 
outcome.

782
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,800
And if you're.
This is especially true in intimate 

783
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,580
relationships is like if someone's 
bugging you and you want them to change,

784
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:35,240
you think,
well,

785
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:40,241
how can I be minimally bothered by this 
and what's the tiniest amount of change 

786
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:44,321
I could request that might satisfy me?
Because otherwise the argument will come

787
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:48,440
unglued and every time you guys try to 
discuss a problem,

788
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,560
you'll start talking about whether you 
should even be together and then you're 

789
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,711
done because you'll never solve a 
problem and then you won't be together 

790
00:43:56,711 --> 00:43:59,090
because you'll never solve a problem.
So okay,

791
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,750
so here's a way to think about 
perception.

792
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,410
So let's say that this is the thing 
you're trying to look at.

793
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,880
I called that the thing in itself.
Now that's a schematic of a thing in 

794
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:17,981
itself.
So the thing in itself that's an old 

795
00:44:17,981 --> 00:44:19,190
philosophical,
a concept and I think it came from,

796
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,840
but I'm not sure about that.

797
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,840
It might be older than that.
And the thing in itself is what you 

798
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,390
could see if you could see everything 
about something,

799
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:31,391
but you can't.
So it's a hypothetical entity and maybe 

800
00:44:31,391 --> 00:44:36,250
who knows,
if I was looking at you like the thing 

801
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,571
in itself,
maybe I could see every level of your 

802
00:44:38,571 --> 00:44:41,181
being from the subatomic up to the up to
this level of perception and then 

803
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:43,830
beyond.
I could see your family relationships.

804
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,890
I could see how they were nested in your
societal relationships,

805
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:49,740
economic relationships,
political relationships,

806
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,700
the ecosystem as a whole.
Like I would see all these levels at the

807
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:57,090
same time.
Of course I don't because I can't.

808
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,540
What I see instead is first of all,
you're radically simplified by my senses

809
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,700
because they're just not acute enough to
say see you at a microscopic level and 

810
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,200
they're not comprehensive enough to see 
your connections across time.

811
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:15,230
So my sense is filter a bunch of you 
from me right away and then I'm also 

812
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:19,611
filtered from you by my,
by your willingness to act like I want.

813
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:26,931
Well,
we're together because that's because 

814
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:26,931
you could be doing all sorts of strange 
things at the moment,

815
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:31,490
but you're not.
And so you're helping me simplify my 

816
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,200
perceptions of you by agreeing to play 
the same game that I'm playing.

817
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:39,201
Well,
we occupied the same space and that's 

818
00:45:39,201 --> 00:45:41,511
basically politeness.
That's the mark of someone who's well 

819
00:45:41,511 --> 00:45:41,511
socialized.
You walk in somewhere,

820
00:45:41,511 --> 00:45:43,680
you get the game,
you play the game,

821
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,880
and you don't scare the hell out of 
everybody and that's.

822
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,120
That's partly how we keep our emotions 
stabilized because if you're like a 

823
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,750
Friday and you think,
well,

824
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:59,930
as long as your ego as well constituted,
you can keep your emotions under 

825
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,350
control.
It's like yes and no.

826
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,430
Mostly No.
I like the Piagetian idea better,

827
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:10,170
which is if you're well socialized,
you're awake enough to identify the game

828
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:15,171
that's going on wherever you go,
and then you play that game immediately 

829
00:46:15,171 --> 00:46:19,280
and so to all the other socialized 
primates and so then you can just 

830
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,550
understand the game.
You don't have to understand them.

831
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:25,910
Thank God.
You could just understand the game and 

832
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,670
as long as the game continues,
you don't have to be nervous because you

833
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:31,671
know you at least know what's going to 
happen and maybe you even know how to 

834
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:33,930
get what you want in that game.
And so.

835
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,260
So that again,
that's really we're thinking about,

836
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:42,261
because we talked about this before,
about why people want to maintain their 

837
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:46,221
culture,
it hasn't just because their culture is 

838
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,210
a belief system that helps them orient 
themselves in the world.

839
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,630
It's because I believe system is a game 
that everyone who shares that belief 

840
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,191
system is playing and the fact that 
everybody's playing means nobody needs 

841
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:58,380
to get upset.

842
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,160
So it isn't like the belief system is 
directly inhibiting the emotions.

843
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,900
That isn't how it works.
So and,

844
00:47:04,901 --> 00:47:09,901
and it's,
it's not like the culture is just a 

845
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:11,931
belief system.
It's only secondarily a belief system 

846
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:15,181
man.
Mostly it's a game that people are 

847
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:15,181
actively engaging in.
Now.

848
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:17,820
It's way more important than the beliefs
that go along with it.

849
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:23,540
You don't even need the damn beliefs.
That's why walls and wolves can live 

850
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,500
with each other.
They don't know what the.

851
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,790
They don't have a belief system.
Exactly.

852
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:32,320
Mostly they have a set of,
they have a game.

853
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:34,210
It's the wolf game,
roughly speaking,

854
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:37,330
and all the wolves know how to play it.
And so that's that.

855
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,090
That's how they keep themselves 
organized in their packs.

856
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,320
A lot of it's externalized and so

857
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:45,900
okay,
so anyway,

858
00:47:45,901 --> 00:47:50,280
so the thing in itself out,
it's a very complicated thing.

859
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:53,670
It's got multiple dimensions,
multiple levels,

860
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:57,990
and then it's worse than that because it
doesn't only have multiple levels,

861
00:47:57,991 --> 00:48:02,991
but all of those levels move across time
and every one of those levels shifts as 

862
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:08,091
it moves across time.
And so I like to think of the thing in 

863
00:48:08,091 --> 00:48:10,200
itself like a symphony.
I think that's a good moral.

864
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:12,120
I think that's why we like music in 
fact,

865
00:48:12,121 --> 00:48:17,121
because music shows you a multilevel 
reality that unfolds and Shay shifts 

866
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:19,200
across time within some parameters,
right?

867
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:24,201
Because it's not just chaos.
The music has an element of 

868
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:28,971
predictability and an element of 
unpredictability and it has these 

869
00:48:28,971 --> 00:48:31,320
multiple levels and that's sort of what 
what everything in the world is like.

870
00:48:31,321 --> 00:48:34,350
It's what the world is like,
so this is a even.

871
00:48:34,351 --> 00:48:37,170
That is just a conceptual model of the 
thing in itself.

872
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:42,170
First of all,
that's only got two dimensions instead 

873
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:42,710
of three because it could be a cube and 
then it.

874
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:47,850
It has even a cube has three dimensions 
instead of four because if that was a 

875
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,260
cube,
adding the third dimension,

876
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:55,070
then it would also be a cube that would 
transform and shift as it moved across 

877
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,850
time and that's what the thing in itself
is,

878
00:48:56,851 --> 00:49:01,080
but that's too damn complicated.
So then the question is when you look at

879
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:01,980
it,
what do you see?

880
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,910
And the answer is to some degree it 
depends on what you want to use it for.

881
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,980
And so I would say,
well here,

882
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:09,750
look at the different ways you can look 
at this.

883
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,190
You might say,
what is this?

884
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,400
And somebody could say,
well it's a rectangle and would you say 

885
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:16,530
that's correct?
It's like,

886
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,130
well

887
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:23,310
it's not correct because there's not a 
one to one correspondence,

888
00:49:23,311 --> 00:49:26,220
but it might be a useful 
conceptualization.

889
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:31,250
If you think about that as a box,
it could contain that and if you were 

890
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:36,351
carrying the box you'd only have to be 
concerned about the box and so that 

891
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,110
would be fine.
That's a good functional simplification.

892
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,810
That ones a little higher resolution 
because it says,

893
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:40,410
well,
yeah,

894
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,710
it's actually four rectangles and that 
one says,

895
00:49:43,711 --> 00:49:48,711
well wait,
think about that as an orchard that 

896
00:49:48,711 --> 00:49:51,081
someone's looking at from the top.
You want to figure out how walk from 

897
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:51,360
south to north.
Well,

898
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,460
you got a little map there because you 
can think of those as bars instead of 

899
00:49:56,461 --> 00:50:01,461
collections of dots.
Piaget showed that children will 

900
00:50:01,461 --> 00:50:01,770
automatically do this,
so for example,

901
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:06,771
if you take six dots and put them in a 
row and you take the same six dots and 

902
00:50:08,161 --> 00:50:13,161
you stretch them out,
so the rows this much longer and then 

903
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:13,161
you ask the child where there are more 
dots.

904
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:17,960
The child will say that there are more 
dots where it's longer because they're 

905
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,191
flipping in some sense between the 
perception of the individual dots and 

906
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:26,331
the perception of the shape that the 
array of dots makes and so the shape is 

907
00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:31,131
longer because you could see it as a 
rectangle and so they think well longer 

908
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:31,131
is bigger,
bigger.

909
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:32,960
It's more,
there's got to be more dots so.

910
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:39,130
Well what?
Then there's this one which is sort of 

911
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,580
an amalgam of this one and this one,
and then not one.

912
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,720
There's that one and that's the highest 
resolution model of that.

913
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:48,200
That still a simplification.
And you know,

914
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,380
what I like about this diagram is that,
you know,

915
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,460
people say,
well,

916
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:58,330
the facts are the facts and what we're 
disagreeing about is your opinion about 

917
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:58,330
the facts.
It's like,

918
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:59,570
no,
yes,

919
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:05,260
you have an opinion about the facts,
but the world is so horrible lead 

920
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,770
complex that you can actually disagree 
about the facts themselves.

921
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,710
And I think an etiology does that to 
people very,

922
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:14,740
very commonly.
So I saw this movie once that Naomi 

923
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,470
Klein made.
If I tell you the same story,

924
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,190
tell me.
Okay,

925
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,630
because I don't want to tell you the 
same story,

926
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:22,631
but I might.
So she went down to Argentina after a 

927
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:25,880
bunch of money had gone out of Argentina
because of financial collapse.

928
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:30,881
And she went to a factory that had been 
padlocked and it was heavy machinery 

929
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,680
factory and the workers had decided they
were gonna,

930
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,310
undo the padlocks and go build machines,
you know,

931
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,620
tail with the owner who shut it down.
And so she went down and made this movie

932
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:47,621
and follow these workers around and 
showed how catastrophic their lives had 

933
00:51:47,621 --> 00:51:49,280
been because they'd lost their 
livelihood in this big financial crash.

934
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:54,730
And so that was really interesting.
But then she went and interviewed the 

935
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,660
Guy who owned the factory and she 
treated him like he was like a cipher in

936
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:57,380
some sense.

937
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,860
Instead of asking him how he got the 
factory,

938
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:03,560
what he wanted to do with it,
how it fit in with his life plans,

939
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:08,770
why he,
why he shut it down instead of 

940
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:08,770
continuing it,
you know,

941
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:09,260
he,
she didn't get the backstory on him.

942
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,500
She just left him in the evil 
capitalists box and went on with the 

943
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:14,660
film.
And it was,

944
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,320
it was like,
it wasn't like what she did wasn't true,

945
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:24,190
but it was only half true.
And it was half true because she could 

946
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,820
perceive the complexity of the workers 
having sympathy for them,

947
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,360
but as far as she was concerned,
the the enemy,

948
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:34,361
the owner had no complexity.
He was just bad capitalist and that's 

949
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:38,681
how it was left in the movie.
I found it profoundly unsatisfying 

950
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:38,681
because I wanted to know,
okay,

951
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:40,310
it's like you know that these workers 
are suffering.

952
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,690
It's not self evident that you want your
damn factory closed.

953
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,970
You'd think you'd want it open.
So you could be building things.

954
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:48,290
It's like,
who are you?

955
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,300
What are you doing?
Why is this justifiable?

956
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,030
Have a question about it.
Well,

957
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:58,990
you can take this infinite set of facts 
and then you subject it to your filters 

958
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,050
and you let some of the facts through 
and their fact.

959
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,440
But what about all the facts that you 
don't let through?

960
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:12,250
That's the thing.
And that's what the gorilla video shows 

961
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:12,250
too.
It's like,

962
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:12,250
yeah,
yeah,

963
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:12,650
you got the basketball account,
right?

964
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:15,440
But you miss the big primate.
And you might say,

965
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:20,441
well,
your priorities were a bit skewed in 

966
00:53:20,441 --> 00:53:22,361
that circumstance because you were 
rearranging the deck chairs as the 

967
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:22,490
titanic sank,
you know,

968
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:24,230
as the.
As the old joke goes,

969
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,350
and so it's very much useful to to think
always while you're.

970
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,530
It isn't just your damn opinion that's 
biased,

971
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:35,220
although it is,
it's your perceptions that are biased

972
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:36,500
so

973
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,840
well in with your words.
It's even more so.

974
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:42,530
You say,
well,

975
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,230
you can't see the thing in itself 
because it's too complex,

976
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:50,231
so you perceive it simpler than it is,
and some of that perceptual 

977
00:53:50,391 --> 00:53:52,970
simplification is dependent on your 
aims.

978
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,170
So that's a vicious one because it pulls
the,

979
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:59,240
the value structure that you're 
ensconced within,

980
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:04,270
into your perceptions.
It pulls it into the realm of facts 

981
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:04,730
itself.
And then you do another.

982
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:10,330
I think about this as a compression.
You know,

983
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,510
you can compress a photograph by getting
rid of redundant information.

984
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,250
That's sort of what you're doing here.
So you're like one of these squares,

985
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:24,370
little black squares here,
black rectangles compresses all of 

986
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:28,241
those.
It's like we're going to treat those as 

987
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:29,090
if they're a grayish black.
Same thing happens here,

988
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:33,600
so we're blurring across them so we have
a much less hire,

989
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:38,330
much less high resolution image here,
so you take the thing in itself,

990
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:43,350
if you perceive it as a low resolution 
representations and then you take that 

991
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,880
low resolution representations and you 
replace that with a word and so the word

992
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:51,881
is a twofold compression and then when 
someone tosses you the word,

993
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:58,640
you unpack it into the low resolution 
perception and then maybe into the world

994
00:54:58,641 --> 00:54:59,030
itself.

995
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,770
If you can do that,
probably not.

996
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:03,080
So that's what we're doing.
We're taking the complex world,

997
00:55:03,081 --> 00:55:06,410
we fold it into a simple perception.
We fold that into a word,

998
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,740
we throw the word to someone else and 
they unpack it and the only way you can 

999
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,041
unpack it of course is if you've had 
enough similar experience so that you 

1000
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:16,670
have the reference for the word already 
in your experience.

1001
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,270
So which is why you have to use 
simplified language with children,

1002
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:25,300
right?
Because there's no point in tossing a 

1003
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:25,300
child a concept that he or she can't 
unpack.

1004
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:26,670
So

1005
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:35,270
we,
we compress a very complex reality and 

1006
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,850
to have a very,
very small keyhole that's basically,

1007
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,430
that's basically our cognitive 
processing.

1008
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,940
Okay.
So then here's the next kind of 

1009
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,250
argument.
This goes along with the science 

1010
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,500
religion argument that I was making 
earlier,

1011
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:50,120
which I want to unpack a little bit 
more.

1012
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:57,370
I think that fundamentalists and 
atheistic scientists have the same 

1013
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:02,600
problem,
the fundamentalists.

1014
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:07,690
So we could say the Christian 
fundamentalists in the US make the 

1015
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:11,500
proposition that biblical stories,
we'll call them mythological stories,

1016
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,110
are literal representations of the 
truth,

1017
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:19,070
but,
and that might be true depending on what

1018
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:24,071
you mean by literal,
but what they mean by literal or what 

1019
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:27,461
they attempt make literal mean is that 
they're in the same category of 

1020
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:30,491
scientific facts because they don't have
the idea that there are different ways 

1021
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:36,010
of approaching truth and the truth's can
serve different purposes.

1022
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:41,011
They don't have a sense that your 
definition of truth is actually 

1023
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:44,521
something like a tool rather than an 
ontological statement about the reality 

1024
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:48,631
of the world.
And so the fundamentalists basically 

1025
00:56:48,631 --> 00:56:51,670
make the proposition that the idea that 
God created the world in six days,

1026
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:55,450
5,000
years ago is literally true and they get

1027
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:57,970
the 5,000
year estimate by the way,

1028
00:56:57,971 --> 00:57:02,971
by going through the genealogies in the 
Old Testament and adding up the 

1029
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:06,391
hypothetical ages and figuring out,
you know how long before Moses Adam 

1030
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:08,580
lived and some bishop did that back in 
the,

1031
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,080
I think it was in the mid 18 hundreds.

1032
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:16,230
I might be wrong about that,
but it was somewhere back about that 

1033
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,520
time and more or less that's been 
accepted as canonical fact ever since.

1034
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,890
And then the scientists say,
well yeah,

1035
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:23,050
those are imperial truth.
They're just wrong.

1036
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:28,530
And that's the only difference there is 
between the fundamentalists and the 

1037
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:31,141
atheist scientists.
The fundamental say those are 

1038
00:57:31,141 --> 00:57:31,180
fundamental scientific truths and 
they're right.

1039
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:33,310
And the scientists say,
while their scientific truths,

1040
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,380
they just happened to be wrong.
Well,

1041
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,130
I think that's a stupid argument 
personally.

1042
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:44,190
I mean for a bunch of reasons.
One is that the people who wrote the the

1043
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:49,411
ancient stories that we have access to,
we're in no way shape or form 

1044
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:51,370
scientists,
you know,

1045
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:56,460
modern people tend to think that you 
think like a scientist and people have 

1046
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:56,460
always thought that way.
First of all,

1047
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:01,260
you do not think like a scientist.
Even scientists hardly even think like 

1048
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:01,260
scientists.

1049
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,590
But if you're not scientifically 
trained,

1050
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,860
you don't think like a scientist at all.
So one of the things for example that 

1051
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,760
characterizes your thinking is 
confirmation bias.

1052
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:14,761
And so if you have a theory,
what you do is wander around in the 

1053
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:17,761
world looking for reasons why it's true.
And the scientists does exactly the 

1054
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:21,901
opposite of that in the little tiny,
narrow domain where he or she is 

1055
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:25,651
actually capable of being a scientist 
and what they have is a theory and look 

1056
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:27,070
for a way to prove it wrong.
But believe me,

1057
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:29,400
you don't run around doing that.
I mean you,

1058
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:31,930
you can train yourself so now and then 
you can do that.

1059
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,580
You know when you can learn to listen to
people,

1060
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:38,581
for example,
on the off chance that you might be 

1061
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:38,581
wrong,
but that is by no means a natural way of

1062
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:42,800
thinking,
and of course the the,

1063
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:48,250
the fundamental philosophical axioms of 
the scientific method weren't developed 

1064
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:51,280
until descartes and Bacon and who else?

1065
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:54,400
Descartes Bacon.
There's one more.

1066
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,980
Anyways,
the name escapes me at the moment,

1067
00:58:56,981 --> 00:58:59,530
but you can argue about when science 
emerged,

1068
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,770
but you,
you,

1069
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:06,280
it certainly emerged in it's articulated
form within the last thousand years.

1070
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,910
I think you could say even more 
specifically that it emerged in the last

1071
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,820
500 years.
Now you might argue with that and say,

1072
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:17,821
well,
what about the Greeks and other people 

1073
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,381
who were fairly technologically 
sophisticated or who invented geometry 

1074
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:20,470
or that kind of thing,
but yeah,

1075
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:24,350
yeah,
bear precursors to the idea of empirical

1076
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:25,790
observation.
Aristotle,

1077
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:30,791
for example,
when he was writing down his knowledge 

1078
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:33,551
of the world,
it never occurred to him to actually go 

1079
00:59:33,551 --> 00:59:34,370
out in the world and look at it to see 
if what he assumed about it was true and

1080
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:39,371
it certainly never occurred to Aristotle
to get 20 people to go look at the same 

1081
00:59:39,711 --> 00:59:44,711
thing independently,
write down exactly how they went about 

1082
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:45,560
doing it,
compare the records,

1083
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:50,561
and then extract out what was common and
that's a that seems self evident to us 

1084
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:53,090
to some degree,
but you know,

1085
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:58,780
it was by no means self evident to 
anyone 500 years ago and people still 

1086
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,860
don't do it,
so it's not even.

1087
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:06,010
It's not plausible.
If you know anything about the history 

1088
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:09,020
of ideas,
it's not plausible to posit that stories

1089
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:14,021
about the nature of reality that existed
before 500 years ago were scientific in 

1090
01:00:14,091 --> 01:00:19,091
any but the most cursory of ways.
So why we have that argument continually

1091
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:22,700
is somewhat beyond me.
Part of the reason is though,

1092
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:27,701
that everyone fundamentalists included 
really believe in scientific facts.

1093
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,430
Even though they hate it.
They'll use computers,

1094
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:33,440
they'll fly.
Computers won't work,

1095
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,140
wouldn't work unless quantum mechanics 
were correct,

1096
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,680
like the fact that you use a high tech 
device indicates through your action 

1097
01:00:42,321 --> 01:00:45,350
that you actually accept the theories 
upon which is predicated,

1098
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,000
right?
Same as flying.

1099
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,750
Same as anything you do in it too.
Complex technological society.

1100
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:52,640
You're stuck with it.
You're reading by the lights.

1101
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:53,630
Do they work?
Yeah,

1102
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:58,631
they work well,
so it's really hard for people who are 

1103
01:00:58,631 --> 01:01:02,561
trying to hold onto a way of looking at 
the world that appears to contradict the

1104
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:07,841
scientific claims when everything they 
do is predicated on their acceptance of 

1105
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:09,680
the validity of the scientific claims.

1106
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:13,850
It's really problematic for people and 
it's problematic in a real way,

1107
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:18,851
I think because one of the problems with
the scientific viewpoint is it doesn't 

1108
01:01:18,851 --> 01:01:20,240
tell you anything about what you should 
do with your life.

1109
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,720
It doesn't.
Does it solve the problem of value at 

1110
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:25,720
all?
In fact,

1111
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:30,311
it might make it more difficult because 
one of the fundamental scientific 

1112
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:30,590
claims,
roughly speaking,

1113
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:33,230
is that every fact is of an equal 
utility,

1114
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,820
at least from a scientific perspective.
Right?

1115
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,110
There's no hierarchy of facts.
It's not exactly.

1116
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,200
It's not exactly true because you can 
think of one theory is more true than 

1117
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:49,271
another,
but that boils down to saying that it's 

1118
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:52,121
more useful than another,
so I don't think that that's a really 

1119
01:01:52,121 --> 01:01:52,121
good exception.
Okay,

1120
01:01:52,121 --> 01:01:55,120
so fine.
You got the scientific atheist,

1121
01:01:55,121 --> 01:02:00,121
so on one end and you got the religious 
fundamentalists on the other and what 

1122
01:02:00,121 --> 01:02:00,170
they both agree on whether they like it 
or not,

1123
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,940
is that there's so much power in the 
scientific method that it's difficult to

1124
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:09,941
dispute the validity of scientific facts
and they seem to exist in contradiction 

1125
01:02:09,941 --> 01:02:12,770
to the older archaic stories.

1126
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,490
If you also accept them as fast fact 
based accounts,

1127
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,010
so what do we do about that?
Well,

1128
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,300
your own scientific atheist end of 
things.

1129
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,230
You say,
well,

1130
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:24,420
those old stories or just superstitious 
science,

1131
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:28,230
second grade,
barbaric archaic forms of science,

1132
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:33,231
you just dispense with them.
They're nothing but trouble and if 

1133
01:02:33,231 --> 01:02:33,231
they're on their fundamental aside,
you say,

1134
01:02:33,231 --> 01:02:35,310
well,
we'll try to shoe horn science into this

1135
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,160
framework,
and really that doesn't work very well.

1136
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:40,140
It doesn't work very well with the 
claims of evolution.

1137
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:41,180
For example.
Fact,

1138
01:02:41,181 --> 01:02:45,750
it works very badly and that's a problem
because evolutionary theory is like,

1139
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,690
it's a killer theory and it's,
it's,

1140
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,250
it's,
it's really,

1141
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:55,251
really hard and like it's not a complete
theory and there's lots of things we 

1142
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:55,251
don't know about evolution,

1143
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:56,740
you know,

1144
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,440
trying to hand wave that away.
That's,

1145
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:04,940
that's not gonna work without dispensing
with most of biology.

1146
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,760
So.
So that's a big problem.

1147
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,760
So here's another way of thinking about 
it.

1148
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,900
You don't just need one way of looking 
at the world.

1149
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:21,040
Maybe you need two ways of looking at 
the world and I'm not exactly sure how 

1150
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,161
they should be related to one another,
which should take precedence under which

1151
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:28,370
circumstances,
but one problem is what's the world made

1152
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,020
of,
you know,

1153
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,680
what's the world conceptualized as an 
objective place made of.

1154
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:37,850
And the other is how should you conduct 
yourself while you're alive?

1155
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:43,810
And there's no reason to assume that 
those questions can be answered using 

1156
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:45,350
the same approach.

1157
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,240
I mean,

1158
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:54,040
physics has its methods and chemistry 
has its methods and biology has its 

1159
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,401
methods.
So a method for obtaining the truth can 

1160
01:03:57,401 --> 01:04:02,231
be bound to a domain.
So why would we necessarily assume that 

1161
01:04:02,231 --> 01:04:06,281
you could use the same set of tools to 
represent the world as a place of 

1162
01:04:06,281 --> 01:04:09,890
objects and to represent it as a place 
in which a biological creature would act

1163
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,570
in anyways?
I'm suggesting that we,

1164
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:19,280
that we don't view it that way,
that we have two different viewpoints.

1165
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,450
Maybe they can be brought together,
although it's not obvious how,

1166
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:28,690
but that it's not a tenable solution to 
get rid of one in favor of the other,

1167
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,130
and I think the reason for that is

1168
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,640
you need to know how to conduct yourself
in the world.

1169
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,880
You have to have a value system.
You can't even look at the damn world 

1170
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,240
without a value system.
It's not possible.

1171
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,300
Your emotional health is dependent on a 
value system.

1172
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:49,300
The way you interact with other people 
is dependent on a value system.

1173
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,510
There is no getting away from it and 
you'll say,

1174
01:04:52,511 --> 01:04:57,511
well,
there's no justification for any value 

1175
01:04:57,511 --> 01:04:57,511
system.
From a scientific perspective.

1176
01:04:57,511 --> 01:04:59,980
You're going to draw that conclusion 
that no value system is valid.

1177
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,890
Where the hell does that leave you?
There is no down.

1178
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:08,190
There's no APP.
There's no rationale for moving in any 

1179
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:11,281
direction.
There's not even really any rationale 

1180
01:05:11,281 --> 01:05:11,281
for living.
And so people say things like that,

1181
01:05:11,281 --> 01:05:11,300
well,
why?

1182
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,630
Why the hell should I care what happens 
in a million years?

1183
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:15,040
Who's going to know the difference?
It's like,

1184
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,000
yeah,
yeah,

1185
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,940
true,
stupid but true.

1186
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,570
And the reason I think it's stupid is 
because it's just a game,

1187
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:25,240
you know,
I can take anything of any sort and find

1188
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:29,630
a context in which it's irrelevant.
It's just a rational games like

1189
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,760
who cares if a 100 children freeze to 
death in a blizzard who,

1190
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:35,740
what differences is going to make a 
billion years?

1191
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:37,660
Well,
what do you say to someone who says that

1192
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:38,320
you say,
well,

1193
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,450
seems like the wrong frame of Reference 
Bucko that's what it looks like to me.

1194
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,600
You know,
because at some point you question the 

1195
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,180
dam frame of reference,
not what you derive from it.

1196
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:54,990
And it certainly seems to me that 
situations like that don't allow you to 

1197
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:58,180
use that kind of frame of reference.
There's something in humane about it and

1198
01:05:58,181 --> 01:06:01,000
that trumps the logic,
or at least it should.

1199
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:06,450
And if it doesn't,
then all hell breaks loose and that 

1200
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:06,450
doesn't seem to be a good thing.
Okay,

1201
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:08,650
so I have this quote from Shakespeare 
here.

1202
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:14,250
He says,
all the world's a stage and all the men 

1203
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:14,250
and women,
merely players,

1204
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,251
they have their exits and their 
entrances and one man in his time plays 

1205
01:06:17,251 --> 01:06:17,251
many parts.

1206
01:06:17,251 --> 01:06:20,740
While it's the sort of thing that you'd 
expect to dramatists to pant,

1207
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:26,010
but that's how we looked at the world 
and we still watch Shakespeare's plays 

1208
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:30,060
some hundreds of years later because 
there seems to be something essential 

1209
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,440
captured in something about how people 
do act.

1210
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:37,470
But more importantly,
I think how people should and shouldn't 

1211
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:40,291
act.
Because what fund is it going to a play 

1212
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,610
that doesn't outlined how someone should
and how someone shouldn't act.

1213
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:46,330
You want a good guy or a couple of them,
maybe they can be complex,

1214
01:06:46,331 --> 01:06:48,340
intermingling of good and bad,
you know,

1215
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:52,660
that makes it more sophisticated and you
want a bad guy or a bad.

1216
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:58,220
You know,
you always want to see that contrast in 

1217
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,290
either within a character or between 
characters.

1218
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:04,530
And it's because you want to know how to
live properly now it's how to be a good 

1219
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:05,410
person and you want to know how to live 
in properly,

1220
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:10,860
how to be a bad person so you can watch 
out for people like that are so you can 

1221
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,230
figure out what that means for yourself.
It's compelling.

1222
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,780
And that's another thing that's worth 
thinking about.

1223
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:23,480
Why is it compelling?
And it's compelling everyone.

1224
01:07:23,481 --> 01:07:28,481
That's the thing that's so cool is that 
there aren't that many phenomena that 

1225
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:29,060
you can point to that are compelling to 
everyone.

1226
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:34,240
Music is close is a very rare person who
doesn't like at least some genre of 

1227
01:07:34,491 --> 01:07:35,960
music,
no matter how narrow.

1228
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,860
But the other one is stories.
You're hard pressed to find someone,

1229
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,980
especially if they're younger,
who doesn't like stories.

1230
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:48,050
Why is a waste of time?
Or is there something going on?

1231
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:49,570
Well,

1232
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,380
I think it's not only not a waste of 
time,

1233
01:07:54,381 --> 01:07:59,381
it's actually the most fundamentally 
important thing you can possibly do 

1234
01:07:59,381 --> 01:08:02,231
because there's no difference between 
understanding stories and figuring out 

1235
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:04,010
how to get along in the world.
So.

1236
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:09,910
And there's a tight relationship between
the story that you inhabit that 

1237
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:14,351
structures your behavior and the games 
that Piaget talked about that organize 

1238
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:14,930
people's behavior,
you know,

1239
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,940
to some degree,
the reason that we can all sit in this 

1240
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:23,171
room together like this is because a 
huge chunk of the value system that 

1241
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:29,411
guides our behavior is shared.
So I am lecturing and you're sitting in 

1242
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:32,870
the classroom and that distinguishes us 
to some degree,

1243
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:37,871
but you know that that's partly merely a
consequence of the difference in our 

1244
01:08:37,871 --> 01:08:41,860
age.
It's the same trajectory we just 

1245
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,561
happened to occupy different positions 
in a value hierarchy that we both 

1246
01:08:44,561 --> 01:08:47,531
accept.
And so as long as you feel that that's 

1247
01:08:47,531 --> 01:08:47,810
fair and just then you're not going to 
object to it.

1248
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:52,810
But I'm here in the classroom for many 
of the same reasons that you're here in 

1249
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:53,660
the classroom.
If you look at the higher order parts of

1250
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:56,540
the value structure and maybe right out 
at the end of that,

1251
01:08:56,690 --> 01:09:01,690
because I've tried to figure out if you 
push why you're doing what you're doing 

1252
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:05,951
right now to its ultimate limit so you 
can't get a story that superordinate to 

1253
01:09:06,591 --> 01:09:07,970
that.
It's something like,

1254
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:12,971
well,
you believe that the investigation of 

1255
01:09:12,971 --> 01:09:12,971
the world to acquire knowledge is 
worthwhile.

1256
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,020
Otherwise,
what the hell are you here for?

1257
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:19,640
And even if you know 80 percent of your 
motivation is to get a good stable job,

1258
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:24,970
fair enough.
There's still something outside of that 

1259
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:24,970
because the whole culture says,
well,

1260
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:29,531
you're more likely to be able to 
function properly in a good stable job 

1261
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:33,190
if you're the sort of person who knows 
how to go out in the world and forage 

1262
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:33,190
for information usefully.

1263
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,260
And I think that's very much analogous 
to the hero's story.

1264
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:40,970
It's like you'd go out and you search 
the unknown to find something of value,

1265
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:44,780
and so fundamentally that's what we're 
doing in the classroom and the reason we

1266
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:49,781
can all organize our behaviors because 
we accept that framework consciously 

1267
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:55,270
consciously would be,
we know how to articulate it 

1268
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,270
unconsciously.
It's,

1269
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,640
well,
it doesn't matter.

1270
01:09:55,641 --> 01:10:00,641
We know how to act out the patterns,
whether we know that can say the rules 

1271
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:00,641
or not,
doesn't matter.

1272
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,530
Same as a wolf pack.
We know the dam,

1273
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:08,560
we know the procedures,
and you could describe them with an 

1274
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,470
articulated value structure.

1275
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,940
Let's take a break.
Okay,

1276
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:19,370
so let's go back to the complexity 
problem.

1277
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:21,590
See,
I actually think it's the.

1278
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:27,010
In some sense it's the fundamental 
problem when when you read about the 

1279
01:10:27,531 --> 01:10:32,300
terror management theorists types and 
they think that death is the fundamental

1280
01:10:32,301 --> 01:10:37,301
problem and that's a good argument 
because it's definitely a fundamental 

1281
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:41,201
problem,
but I think it's a subset of the 

1282
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:41,201
complexity problem.
And,

1283
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:47,110
and the reason I think that is because 
sometimes people's lives become so 

1284
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,410
complex that they'd rather be dead.
So.

1285
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:54,370
And the reason they seek death through 
suicide is to make the complexity go 

1286
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,430
away because complexity causes 
suffering.

1287
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:57,400
If it's an controlled,
you know,

1288
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:00,980
things beyond your control.
And that can happen.

1289
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:06,180
You know,
if you're hit by three or four 

1290
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:06,180
catastrophes at the same time,
you know,

1291
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,280
maybe you have,
oh,

1292
01:11:07,281 --> 01:11:09,950
the political system collapses,
there's hyperinflation,

1293
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:13,980
you lose your job and you have someone 
that you love or two

1294
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,850
people die and maybe you get cancer or 
something like that.

1295
01:11:16,851 --> 01:11:21,851
Like that.
Those things happen to people and they 

1296
01:11:21,851 --> 01:11:21,851
just think,
well,

1297
01:11:21,851 --> 01:11:23,190
there's no getting out of this.
Like it's just too much.

1298
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:28,490
And you know,
one of the things that's very 

1299
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,171
interesting about being a psychologist 
is that what you learn if you're going 

1300
01:11:30,171 --> 01:11:34,191
to be a psychologist,
is that people come to you with mental 

1301
01:11:34,191 --> 01:11:34,191
illnesses.
And that's almost never true.

1302
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,650
People come to you because their lives 
are so damn complicated,

1303
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:42,651
they cannot stay on top of them in any 
way that doesn't make it look like 

1304
01:11:42,651 --> 01:11:42,780
they're just going to get more 
complicated.

1305
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:45,690
And so then that causes the symptoms.
You know,

1306
01:11:45,691 --> 01:11:50,691
it's like there's this old idea.
It's sort of a metaphor for genetic 

1307
01:11:50,691 --> 01:11:53,130
susceptibility.
Take a balloon and blow it up until it's

1308
01:11:53,131 --> 01:11:54,120
beyond.
It's tolerance,

1309
01:11:54,121 --> 01:11:55,710
it's going to blow out at the weakest 
point.

1310
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:01,220
Well,
that's sort of what a genetic 

1311
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,451
susceptibility is.
If I just keep adding complexity on top 

1312
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,631
of you,
at some point you'll blow out at your 

1313
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:05,631
weakest point,
you know,

1314
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,290
maybe you'll get physiologically ill,
maybe it'll start drinking,

1315
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:09,840
maybe we'll develop an anxiety disorder.
Maybe you'll get ocd,

1316
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:11,580
maybe you'll get depressed,
whatever.

1317
01:12:11,581 --> 01:12:15,630
There'll be something about you that's 
the weakest point and if I just push,

1318
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,600
that's where you'll blow out.
So that's a mental illness,

1319
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:21,930
but those things are almost never just 
happen sometimes,

1320
01:12:21,931 --> 01:12:26,931
but not very often.
Usually people have just been hammered 

1321
01:12:26,931 --> 01:12:29,691
like two or three different ways and 
then they collapse in the direction of 

1322
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:32,790
their biological weakness and then maybe
you put them back together,

1323
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:37,791
but it's almost always a complexity 
related phenomena rather than a mental 

1324
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:39,060
illness related phenomena.
Not always,

1325
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:41,520
but almost always.
So okay,

1326
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:45,870
so now you've got this complexity 
problem and you think,

1327
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:50,871
well you deal with it conceptually and 
that sort of akin to the idea that it's 

1328
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:54,930
belief systems that protect you from 
death anxiety.

1329
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:58,290
The ideas are roughly comparable,
but again that's,

1330
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:03,380
that's wrong.
It's the sort of thing only a 

1331
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,421
psychologist could think about,
thank God because psychologists think 

1332
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:05,421
that everything about you happens inside
your head,

1333
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:06,270
so to speak,
in your psyche.

1334
01:13:06,271 --> 01:13:11,271
But that's not true.
There's a huge chunk of you that's 

1335
01:13:11,271 --> 01:13:13,140
outside of you completely.
And so this is a really good example.

1336
01:13:13,141 --> 01:13:13,530
Like,
you know,

1337
01:13:13,531 --> 01:13:16,380
we know the oldest cities,
this is a medieval city in France,

1338
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:21,950
beautiful old city.
All cities were walled and the reason 

1339
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:27,411
for that was because they were places of
wealth and if you didn't put walls 

1340
01:13:27,411 --> 01:13:31,620
around them then other people would come
in and steal everything and kill you.

1341
01:13:31,621 --> 01:13:33,840
So like having some walls was a good 
idea.

1342
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,620
Like the same as having walls in your 
house is a good idea.

1343
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,510
Walls between your rooms are a good idea
or borders between categories are a good

1344
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:42,900
idea.

1345
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:47,220
And so part of the way you simplify the 
world is by building walls,

1346
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:51,090
walls around your space because then a 
whole bunch of things can come in and so

1347
01:13:51,091 --> 01:13:53,640
you don't even have to think about them.
It's not conceptual,

1348
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,830
it's practical.
And so,

1349
01:13:56,190 --> 01:14:01,190
and you know,
one of the things I think I figured out 

1350
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:02,340
recently is the fundamental political 
difference between people.

1351
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:06,360
And it looks to me like the fundamental 
political differences.

1352
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:09,090
How many walls should there be around 
your stuff?

1353
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:15,020
And the ultimate liberal answer is zero.
And the ultimate conservative answer is 

1354
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,530
bring on those walls,
man.

1355
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,860
And what's interesting about both those 
perspectives,

1356
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:25,861
first of all,
is that there's temperamental 

1357
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:25,861
contributions to them and second,
that they're both valid.

1358
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:30,510
So one of the mysteries I believe that 
permeates psychometric psychology right 

1359
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:37,981
now is why the temperamental factors 
that influence politics are those 

1360
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:40,390
particular temperamental factors.

1361
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:41,500
So there's five,
let's say,

1362
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:42,340
right,
this classic,

1363
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:43,480
Big Five,
extroversion,

1364
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:44,650
neuroticism,
agreeableness,

1365
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:47,080
conscientiousness and openness.
Well,

1366
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,660
the biggest predictors of political 
allegiance,

1367
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:52,000
forget about the politically correct 
types for a minute,

1368
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:57,390
but on the liberal to conservative 
access is that the liberals are low in 

1369
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:01,021
conscientiousness and high in openness 
and the conservatives are high in 

1370
01:15:01,021 --> 01:15:02,140
conscientiousness and low in openness 
and so then you think,

1371
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:05,650
well why those two traits?
That's the first question and the second

1372
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:07,960
question is why those two traits 
together,

1373
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:10,120
given that they're not very highly 
correlated,

1374
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:11,740
right?
They're really quite independent,

1375
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:17,490
so why do they co-vary along the 
political oxys and I think this is the 

1376
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:21,001
reason I think it's exactly that is that
open people like to live on the 

1377
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:26,851
periphery of boundaries and they like to
break boundaries between things because 

1378
01:15:26,851 --> 01:15:29,050
interesting things happen when you,
when you think a different way,

1379
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,240
when you think outside of the box,
so to speak.

1380
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:34,180
That's what opened people do.
They always think outside of the box,

1381
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:36,360
no matter what box you put them in,
you know,

1382
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:41,370
and sometimes you meet people that are 
so open that they're completely 

1383
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,461
disorganized there.
Their thought process is almost 

1384
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:47,221
completely association like a dreamer.
They just jumped from one thing to 

1385
01:15:47,221 --> 01:15:47,950
another and they're very interesting to 
talk to.

1386
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:53,190
It's very hard for those people to get 
their lives together because they're 

1387
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:55,621
interested in absolutely everything and 
their attention just flips all over the 

1388
01:15:55,621 --> 01:15:59,401
place and so they're open and that 
actually does go along with higher 

1389
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:02,791
intelligence generally speaking,
so and then if they're low in 

1390
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:06,451
conscientiousness,
they don't see any utility in order and 

1391
01:16:06,451 --> 01:16:09,721
order like orderly people because that's
part of conscientiousness and the 

1392
01:16:09,721 --> 01:16:11,560
biggest determiner of political belief 
in the conscientious domain.

1393
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:16,800
The orderly people like to have 
everything in its separate place and 

1394
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,260
properly structured and so you know 
their world is box inside a box,

1395
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:25,290
inside a shelf of boxes and then that 
shelf of boxes inside another box and 

1396
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:26,920
all those boxes are nice and neat and 
tight.

1397
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,920
Nothing inside the ms dot touching and 
everything in every box is the same 

1398
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,190
thing and you know,
you can see that,

1399
01:16:32,191 --> 01:16:36,850
that you can see the utility in that and
that as far as we'd been able to tell,

1400
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:41,460
is also associated with disgust,
sensitivity and disgust sent.

1401
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,630
People are disgusted,
generally speaking,

1402
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:48,810
when things that shouldn't be touching 
are touching like something horrible 

1403
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:49,240
stuck to you,
for example,

1404
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:54,570
that that produces a very visceral sense
of disgust and it's a boundary violation

1405
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:59,910
because that's what disgust is.
It's indic in index is a boundary 

1406
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:03,181
violation and you can you how separate 
people should be from one another as 

1407
01:17:04,481 --> 01:17:09,481
individuals or in groups is an entirely 
debatable issue because there's huge 

1408
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:14,801
advantages when people mingle and mix 
and there's huge dangers when people 

1409
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:17,510
mingle and mix and so at some point you 
say,

1410
01:17:17,511 --> 01:17:19,280
well,
the dangers are overwhelming.

1411
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:21,020
The positives,
and then another point you say,

1412
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:22,610
well,
the positives are overwhelming,

1413
01:17:22,611 --> 01:17:27,611
the dangerous,
and you have a continual argument about 

1414
01:17:27,611 --> 01:17:30,131
that with yourself,
but more importantly with people have 

1415
01:17:30,131 --> 01:17:32,891
different temperament than you know,
when the terrible temptation is to 

1416
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:38,051
assume that only those people who have 
your temperament are correct and that's 

1417
01:17:38,051 --> 01:17:41,330
just those other temperaments wouldn't 
exist if that was true.

1418
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,740
I mean,
if you look at it from,

1419
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,530
just say if you look at it from a 
strictly biological perspective,

1420
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:51,100
so anyways,
one of the things we do to simplify the 

1421
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,790
world is to frame it physically and so 
you look at this,

1422
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:55,190
you've got wall number one,
and then you have wall number two,

1423
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:58,640
but then inside the walls you have walls
around everything.

1424
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:02,540
All these houses are walls and inside 
the houses there are walls as well,

1425
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:07,870
and so everything is and what you do 
when you put walls around things as you 

1426
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:08,510
make part of the world simpler,
right?

1427
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:13,570
Constantly.
If the reason you have houses so that 

1428
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,710
every buddy and his dog isn't in your 
house.

1429
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:20,860
You just want those few people that you 
can barely tolerate in your house and 

1430
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,490
not all those other strangers and God 
only knows what they're gonna do.

1431
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:26,720
You'll still invite people in now and 
then because maybe you're sick and tired

1432
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:31,721
and bored of the people that are in your
house and so you want a little bit of 

1433
01:18:31,721 --> 01:18:34,601
new information,
but you want those barriers to be there 

1434
01:18:34,601 --> 01:18:36,860
so that you can voluntarily modulate the
information flow.

1435
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:39,460
Okay,
so that's the first thing you do and you

1436
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:44,461
know,
then you set up rules with everybody 

1437
01:18:44,461 --> 01:18:44,461
else.
It says,

1438
01:18:44,461 --> 01:18:44,540
well I'm going to have some walls so you
can't come in,

1439
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:49,541
but what I'm going to do is pay you for 
that privilege by letting you have some 

1440
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:53,090
walls where people can't come in.
And so I think that's analogous.

1441
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:58,180
I was thinking about the issue of 
discrimination in relationship to sex 

1442
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:03,220
because I've been thinking a lot about 
discrimination lately because everybody 

1443
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:06,071
thinks discrimination is a bad idea,
which is a very stupid proposition 

1444
01:19:06,071 --> 01:19:09,791
because you're discriminating all the 
time and the most fundamental form of 

1445
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:11,600
discrimination is choice of sexual 
partner.

1446
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:14,480
And so you might say,
well why should that even be allowed?

1447
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,510
Because it is the most fundamental form 
of discrimination.

1448
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:22,511
So for example,
almost everyone is racially prejudice 

1449
01:19:22,511 --> 01:19:22,700
when it comes to sexual partners.

1450
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:23,720
So you think,
well,

1451
01:19:23,721 --> 01:19:24,590
is that,
is that,

1452
01:19:24,591 --> 01:19:25,580
uh,
what about,

1453
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,840
uh,
are you,

1454
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,660
do you use age as an exclusionary 
criteria?

1455
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:34,670
Probably do use physical attractiveness 
only in so far as you're able,

1456
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,890
right?
You use it completely.

1457
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:38,870
If you could get away with it roughly 
speaking,

1458
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:43,871
but you can't because the most 
attractive people aren't going to be 

1459
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,180
anywhere near you,
so you can't do it,

1460
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:45,800
but you'd like to.
Health.

1461
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:46,880
Yes.
Strength.

1462
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:47,930
Yes.
Wealth.

1463
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:49,010
Yes.
Education,

1464
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:54,020
definitely.
So it's unbelievably discriminatory.

1465
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:57,080
And so you might say,
well why is that justifiable?

1466
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:58,790
And it seems to me that it's something 
like,

1467
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:06,550
well,
you get to say no to me if I get to say 

1468
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,550
no to you.
It's something like that.

1469
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:10,930
We've agreed that everybody gets to 
discriminate on that basis and because 

1470
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:13,950
everybody can do it then it's fair.
It's something like that,

1471
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:17,100
but it's very much we're thinking about,
you know,

1472
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:22,101
I don't know if you know this,
but in Huxley's brave new world where 

1473
01:20:22,101 --> 01:20:25,791
the family had been completely 
demolished rate in children were 

1474
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:29,010
conceived in bottles and given an 
produced in factories.

1475
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:33,360
So the whole idea of the relationship 
between sex and procreation had become a

1476
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:37,800
taboo.
One of the Mantras,

1477
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:42,801
the slogans of the society was everyone 
belongs to everyone else and so it was 

1478
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:45,030
actually a social photo,
Paul,

1479
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:50,450
to refuse to sleep with someone just as 
it was a social for Paul to have any 

1480
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:55,161
exclusionary relationship.
Because another thing you might notice 

1481
01:20:55,161 --> 01:20:56,880
is that there's nothing more 
discriminatory than falling in love with

1482
01:20:56,881 --> 01:21:01,881
someone.
It's like you're special and all the 

1483
01:21:01,881 --> 01:21:04,440
rest of you know,
so it's the ultimate exclusionary act.

1484
01:21:04,441 --> 01:21:09,441
Right?
And yet we presume that that's an 

1485
01:21:09,441 --> 01:21:09,441
acceptable,
not only acceptable.

1486
01:21:09,441 --> 01:21:11,400
We demand that as a,
as a right.

1487
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:16,170
And while that's where thinking about a 
lot anyways,

1488
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:19,200
okay,
so what you're doing is by,

1489
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,350
by agreeing to this segregation and 
boxing,

1490
01:21:22,351 --> 01:21:25,860
what you're doing is carving off little 
bits of the world that are simple enough

1491
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:30,980
so that someone like you can live for 
some amount of time there without too 

1492
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:32,310
much danger and everyone agrees to do 
that.

1493
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:37,370
Roughly speaking because everybody needs
to engage in that process of 

1494
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,890
simplification and safety provision.
And so,

1495
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,830
so we have towns and the towns are 
nothing but boxes but inside bolt inside

1496
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:46,680
boxes.
So there's a good,

1497
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:52,140
a good schematic of a little little 
house and you can see that even inside 

1498
01:21:52,891 --> 01:21:57,891
the same place,
we segregate off rooms for different 

1499
01:21:57,891 --> 01:22:00,051
purposes.
And then what's interesting too is that 

1500
01:22:00,051 --> 01:22:00,960
we set up those rooms as a little 
dramatic spaces,

1501
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:03,630
right?
So you furnish them and you furnish them

1502
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:05,580
with things that tell you how to behave 
in that room.

1503
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:11,300
So table and chairs tells you that's 
where you're going to eat and that's 

1504
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:11,910
where people are going to sit and 
they're roughly going to.

1505
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:17,030
They're going to sit facing each other.
That has certain implications because 

1506
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:20,211
the chairs don't face the walls,
they face each other and you have a 

1507
01:22:20,211 --> 01:22:20,930
living room where it's comfortable and 
there's a fire and you know,

1508
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,190
you're setting up little stages 
basically.

1509
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,710
So that just like kids do when they 
pretend,

1510
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:30,810
you know,
they all assign each other roles and 

1511
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:33,531
then they lay out a little drama and 
that's what you do when you invite 

1512
01:22:33,531 --> 01:22:33,531
someone over for a while.
Let's sit in the living room.

1513
01:22:33,531 --> 01:22:38,480
Well,
you'll probably get a drink if you sit 

1514
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,521
in the living room and hypothetically 
you're going to have some conversation 

1515
01:22:40,521 --> 01:22:44,030
and so it's a bounded place.
There are rules that apply and then you 

1516
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:47,511
get to have a little exploration inside 
that set of bounded rules and if you're 

1517
01:22:47,511 --> 01:22:52,071
open and you're going to discuss all 
sorts of things and if you're 

1518
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:53,250
conservative and closed,
then you're going to discuss a very,

1519
01:22:53,251 --> 01:22:56,640
very small subset of things.
And so and so,

1520
01:22:56,641 --> 01:23:00,380
hopefully everyone will agree on that.
So that's one form of,

1521
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:03,180
of binding.
Then another is while we,

1522
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:06,640
we put boxes around each other when it 
comes to groups.

1523
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:09,280
And so this is,
I think this is a picture from the,

1524
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:14,740
um,
from the Democratic convention when 

1525
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,160
Obama was elected,
if I remember correctly.

1526
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:22,190
But anyways,
what happens is that people segregate 

1527
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:23,260
themselves into little micro groups like
Democrats and Republicans,

1528
01:23:23,261 --> 01:23:25,770
and they basically do that on a 
temperamental grounds,

1529
01:23:25,771 --> 01:23:27,000
right?
Fundamentally.

1530
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:30,000
And they,
and then they produce these,

1531
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:33,600
these games that everyone knows how to 
play.

1532
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,960
And that's another form of 
simplification.

1533
01:23:36,961 --> 01:23:40,710
So when you bring all these people 
together at a,

1534
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,800
at a political convention,
it's not like they all have the same 

1535
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,621
ideas,
they don't and it could degenerate into 

1536
01:23:48,621 --> 01:23:51,741
chaos and sometimes that happens.
You get big demonstrations at these 

1537
01:23:51,741 --> 01:23:52,470
places and sometimes people throw tear 
gas and all of that,

1538
01:23:52,471 --> 01:23:57,471
but mostly speaking it's pretty peaceful
and the reason for that is that there's 

1539
01:23:57,471 --> 01:24:01,910
a set of procedures in place that have 
some historical justification that are 

1540
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:06,651
embedded within the shared cultural and 
belief system and everybody goes there 

1541
01:24:06,651 --> 01:24:08,910
and agrees to play by the rules roughly 
speaking,

1542
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:12,030
and so then they can elect a candidate.

1543
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:15,060
It can kind of flip it down to a binary 
choice for the election,

1544
01:24:15,061 --> 01:24:16,320
right?
Yes or no,

1545
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:20,250
something like that,
and nobody gets killed usually.

1546
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:25,310
So Hooray for that.
That's a hell of a thing to pull off to 

1547
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,580
be able to generate out of 300 million 
people,

1548
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:29,160
two people to run for the highest 
office.

1549
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:34,550
Then let everyone play a game to 
determine who they're going to be and 

1550
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:35,790
then to have the bloody thing function 
stable.

1551
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:38,580
He through power transitions like that 
never happens.

1552
01:24:38,581 --> 01:24:43,581
Right?
That's a complete bloody miracle and 

1553
01:24:43,581 --> 01:24:46,101
hardly any societies have ever pulled it
off the power transition being the 

1554
01:24:46,101 --> 01:24:48,100
really important thing because a tyrant 
can be stable for awhile,

1555
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:51,270
but usually what happens is he dies and 
all hell breaks loose.

1556
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,840
So I think George Washington,
I think it was George Washington that 

1557
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:01,100
said or had said about him,
the reason that he was a great leader 

1558
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,581
wasn't because he was president,
but because he stopped being president 

1559
01:25:04,581 --> 01:25:08,930
and that's really worth thinking about.
So then the next thing that sort of 

1560
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:12,570
simplifies your world is actually your 
physiological structure,

1561
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:14,520
right?
And we talked about that a little bit.

1562
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:20,380
Well,
you can only see things there in front 

1563
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,101
of you,
not things that are to decide or behind 

1564
01:25:22,101 --> 01:25:22,101
you.
You know,

1565
01:25:22,101 --> 01:25:22,290
you can only see a very narrow.

1566
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,380
You can only see a very narrow chunk of 
the electromagnetic spectrum,

1567
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:35,700
roughly that chunk that enables you to 
see by sunlight and to detect ripe fruit

1568
01:25:35,701 --> 01:25:40,701
and that sort of thing.
So it's very evolutionarily determined 

1569
01:25:40,701 --> 01:25:40,701
and

1570
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:46,990
you see things of a certain size quite 
easily because they're handy,

1571
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:52,450
right?
So objects manifest themselves to you as

1572
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:57,510
things because they have some 
relationship to your capacity to use 

1573
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,290
them as tools and that's dependent on 
your size.

1574
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:02,560
You have a certain strength and not a 
different strength.

1575
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:05,210
You have a certain degree of 
articulation.

1576
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,250
There's some things you can represent 
language.

1577
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:11,390
So you have limitations that screen out 
from your consideration.

1578
01:26:11,391 --> 01:26:15,560
All sorts of things.
And that's bad because for example,

1579
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:20,561
before people discovered germs,
there was a lot of them zipping about 

1580
01:26:20,561 --> 01:26:23,801
killing people and the fact that we 
couldn't see them wasn't such a good 

1581
01:26:23,801 --> 01:26:23,801
thing.
But by the same token,

1582
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:29,770
we're also not as overwhelmed with 
complexity as we might be if we could 

1583
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:29,850
detect everything.
And you know,

1584
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:34,880
one of the problems with being connected
so much is that it's easy to drown in 

1585
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,491
information and that's rough information
for Jersey can't stay off your damn 

1586
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:41,720
computer because there's,
you know,

1587
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:45,380
it opens up your senses far beyond their
normal limitations.

1588
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:48,110
And so where should you stop?
Well,

1589
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:49,160
you don't,
you know,

1590
01:26:49,161 --> 01:26:54,161
you're on the damn thing like a,
like a pensioner on a slot machine and 

1591
01:26:54,161 --> 01:26:58,751
for many of the same reasons.
So your body also filters out the world 

1592
01:26:58,751 --> 01:27:03,701
for you and provides you with access to 
some information and not access to 

1593
01:27:03,701 --> 01:27:04,850
others.
And then the same thing as the case with

1594
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:08,330
your nervous system.
And I do read.

1595
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:13,390
I put the first picture there of the.
This is the central nervous system that 

1596
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:15,530
controls voluntary movement.
For example,

1597
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:20,720
I put it there because people like to 
think that their brain is in their head,

1598
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:25,721
but it's.
It's stupid way of thinking about it as 

1599
01:27:25,721 --> 01:27:27,941
far as I'm concerned because you have an
awful lot of neurological tissue 

1600
01:27:27,941 --> 01:27:29,900
distributed through your body.
Like your autonomic nervous system,

1601
01:27:29,901 --> 01:27:32,300
if I remember correctly,
which is mostly distributed through your

1602
01:27:32,301 --> 01:27:34,790
body has more neurons in it than your 
central nervous system.

1603
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:38,060
And so you.
You aren't a brain and a in a body.

1604
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:39,140
You know your,
your,

1605
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:44,340
your brain is really,
really distributed through your whole 

1606
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,111
body.
And I think the idea that you have a 

1607
01:27:47,111 --> 01:27:50,741
brain in a body is kind of a holdover 
from the idea that you have a soul in a 

1608
01:27:50,741 --> 01:27:53,090
body.
And not that I'm necessarily criticizing

1609
01:27:53,091 --> 01:27:58,091
that idea,
but I think they kinda got grafted onto 

1610
01:27:58,091 --> 01:28:00,341
one another and so,
but the problem with that is that it,

1611
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:05,150
and this is the so it's the soul body,
brain,

1612
01:28:05,151 --> 01:28:06,350
body,
mind,

1613
01:28:06,351 --> 01:28:09,410
body dichotomy,
which I think is the same dichotomy.

1614
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:15,160
And the problem with that is that it's 
easy to think of thought as something 

1615
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:19,121
that's abstracted away from the body.
And I think that was an enlightenment 

1616
01:28:19,121 --> 01:28:19,121
idea.
You know that,

1617
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:24,280
that,
that just like the sole shouldn't be 

1618
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,520
contaminated by the demands of the body.

1619
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,680
If you were going to be pure 
spiritually,

1620
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:32,950
so your thought shouldn't be 
contaminated by your subjectivity and 

1621
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:34,640
your emotions and your motivations and 
all of that.

1622
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:39,641
It should.
Your abstractions should be independent 

1623
01:28:39,641 --> 01:28:42,611
of your subjectivity and rationality and
emotion are,

1624
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:47,840
are,
are construed in that manner as enemies.

1625
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:52,700
You know that the purpose of rationality
as to dispense with the irrationality of

1626
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:55,640
emotion and motivation.
And that's Freud.

1627
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:59,150
Freud's idea of the property functioning
ego is something like that too,

1628
01:28:59,151 --> 01:29:04,151
because the Ed is this place of 
compulsion and and drive and the ego has

1629
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:08,940
to basically suppress that in the 
service of the Super Ego.

1630
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:12,870
There's no idea of integration really in
Freud now.

1631
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,590
I don't want to be rough on Freud and I 
think part of the reason that he thought

1632
01:29:16,591 --> 01:29:21,591
that way is because the patients he had 
were precisely those who weren't very 

1633
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:28,281
well integrated because of their 
pathological past and so they didn't 

1634
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:32,091
know how to get those subsystems up into
the overarching game and so their only 

1635
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,290
alternative was something like 
suppression or repression.

1636
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:38,990
Because if you.
You know,

1637
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:42,930
if you don't know how to be aggressive 
in a sophisticated way,

1638
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:47,400
you're still going to be aggressive,
but you're going to have to inhibit it.

1639
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:52,290
Control yourself because you cannot just
be aggressive around people.

1640
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:57,291
It just won't go well for you.
So even if you can't do it in a 

1641
01:29:57,291 --> 01:30:00,021
sophisticated way,
you're going to repress it or you're or 

1642
01:30:00,021 --> 01:30:00,021
you're gonna get in trouble.
Those are the options,

1643
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:05,210
so okay,
but if you start thinking about the 

1644
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:08,811
brain,
the nervous system as part of the body 

1645
01:30:08,811 --> 01:30:12,200
as an inseparable part,
well then then the function of thinking 

1646
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:16,041
starts to become something different.
It's not so much the object of abstract 

1647
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:17,910
representation of the world,
which is kind of what you're pursuing if

1648
01:30:17,911 --> 01:30:22,911
you're a scientist.
It's more like it's more like 

1649
01:30:24,551 --> 01:30:29,551
conceptualization of and practice the 
practice of the proper way of being in 

1650
01:30:30,131 --> 01:30:34,520
the world and I think that's what you're
more interested in any ways.

1651
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:39,560
I don't see how you can't be since 
you're living thing and you're.

1652
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:45,250
You're overwhelmingly motivated,
too

1653
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:53,150
successfully manifest those actions that
are living thing has to manifest in 

1654
01:30:53,731 --> 01:30:58,731
order to continue and it's complicated 
like you can boil it down to survival 

1655
01:30:58,741 --> 01:31:03,741
and reproduction.
It's a good overarching simplification,

1656
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:09,150
but there's nothing simple about 
survival and reproduction.

1657
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:14,230
I mean all sorts of complex monsters 
emerge out of that even simple 

1658
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:17,400
conceptualization,
but it's not unreasonable to assume that

1659
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:22,401
one of the things that people generally 
want to do is to continue living in as 

1660
01:31:22,401 --> 01:31:23,950
pain free manner as possible.
It's something like that.

1661
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,530
That's a simplification.
So now the reason I'm,

1662
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:33,200
I'm making that case is because the fact
that you have a body and yet the fact 

1663
01:31:34,051 --> 01:31:39,051
that you have a nervous system is 
another set of limitations on how it is 

1664
01:31:39,051 --> 01:31:40,020
that you're going to interact with the 
world.

1665
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:41,940
Okay?
So now we've got the nervous system.

1666
01:31:41,941 --> 01:31:43,950
We can go to higher resolution.
You say,

1667
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:46,380
well,
you have a brain and the brain,

1668
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:47,910
see if I can.

1669
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,580
So that's the prefrontal.
That's the frontal cortex there.

1670
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:55,890
And that's the temporal cortex there.
And that's the pridal cortex there.

1671
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:58,740
And that's the sensory cortex there.
And these were,

1672
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:03,860
if I remember properly,
these were divisions that I think we're 

1673
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:05,830
first,
while they were first thought through in

1674
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:08,530
the late 19th and early,
early 20th century,

1675
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:11,080
um,
they're slightly specialized.

1676
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:16,620
So this cortex back heres is,
does a lot of the elaboration of vision 

1677
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:22,440
and that one there helps you with your 
sense of embodiment and your knowledge 

1678
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:24,820
about where your body actually happens 
to be localized.

1679
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:28,510
And then that one helps for,
for example,

1680
01:32:28,511 --> 01:32:33,511
in some elements of language output.
And then the frontal cortex,

1681
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:36,130
especially the prefrontal part,
which is up here,

1682
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:41,670
is concerned with the organization and 
implement the Organization of motor 

1683
01:32:42,101 --> 01:32:47,101
action,
and that's a good way of thinking about 

1684
01:32:47,101 --> 01:32:49,741
it.
You got part of your brain that deals 

1685
01:32:49,741 --> 01:32:50,740
with the sensory world and the and the 
integration of the century world,

1686
01:32:50,741 --> 01:32:55,741
which seems to happen about there are 
these places meet and the prefrontal 

1687
01:32:56,591 --> 01:32:59,260
cortex grew out of the motor cortex.

1688
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:04,820
Motor cortex helps you plan and plan out
voluntary auctions.

1689
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,320
The prefrontal cortex grew out of that 
in the course of evolution.

1690
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:10,090
So you might think,
well,

1691
01:33:10,091 --> 01:33:14,890
the there's reflex auctions and they 
happen when something happens to you,

1692
01:33:14,891 --> 01:33:19,891
you respond and then that elaborates up 
into the motor system and that enables 

1693
01:33:20,081 --> 01:33:25,081
you to act voluntarily in the world and 
then not elaborates up into the 

1694
01:33:25,081 --> 01:33:28,441
prefrontal motor system,
which helps you plan how you might act 

1695
01:33:28,441 --> 01:33:28,930
in the world.
Right?

1696
01:33:28,931 --> 01:33:31,120
So it's the prefrontal cortex that's the
home of,

1697
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,770
let's call it.
It's complex,

1698
01:33:32,771 --> 01:33:34,660
sophisticated,
voluntary thought,

1699
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:38,140
which you could think about as a way of 
representing the world,

1700
01:33:38,141 --> 01:33:43,000
but which is more accurately a way of 
generating avatars of yourself.

1701
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:48,030
In hypothetical worlds to figure out how
they would survive if you did implement 

1702
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:51,280
them into action.
And so I think that's why.

1703
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:56,950
So one of the weird things that you 
discover psychometrically is that 

1704
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:59,500
there's no correlation between 
conscientiousness and intelligence.

1705
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:01,540
And that's a weird one,
you know,

1706
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:05,980
because people think about intelligence 
as planning and forward thinking and all

1707
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:10,981
of that.
But that's also how they think about 

1708
01:34:10,981 --> 01:34:10,981
conscientiousness as planful behavior 
and,

1709
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:16,290
and,
and the consideration of future 

1710
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:19,290
possibilities.
But intelligence and conscientiousness 

1711
01:34:19,290 --> 01:34:20,440
have zero correlation.
And so you think,

1712
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:21,850
well why is that?
Well,

1713
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,900
I guess it has to be that way because 
you couldn't think abstractly if you are

1714
01:34:25,901 --> 01:34:29,440
prone to act out what you thought you'd 
just go and act it out.

1715
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:32,590
And that like when I mentioned this to 
you before,

1716
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:37,591
when you dream you're paralyzed and you 
can take that little part of the brain 

1717
01:34:37,591 --> 01:34:40,810
that produces that perilous paralysis 
out of a cat or out of person.

1718
01:34:40,811 --> 01:34:43,150
But we haven't done it with people out 
of a cat.

1719
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:45,880
And then when the cat falls asleep and 
hits Rem Sleep,

1720
01:34:45,881 --> 01:34:48,460
it'll run around until it runs into 
something and then it'll wake up.

1721
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:54,420
Oh.
So the dream thinking is so tightly 

1722
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:55,990
aligned with action that there's no 
separation between them.

1723
01:34:55,991 --> 01:35:00,350
So there's no real abstraction there.
If you couldn't abstract,

1724
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:03,830
you wouldn't be able to think.
And the fact that you can obstruct means

1725
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:06,110
that you can separate your thinking from
your auction.

1726
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:11,410
So that's why as far as I can tell,
there's very little correlation between 

1727
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:15,041
conscientiousness and intelligence.
It's like it has to be that way because 

1728
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:18,821
you have to be able to think about 
things that you wouldn't do if you're 

1729
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:21,341
going to think so.
And in generally we think of people who 

1730
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:26,150
act as soon as they think as impulsive.
So

1731
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:28,530
okay,
well,

1732
01:35:28,531 --> 01:35:33,531
so there's a huge part of the brain 
that's devoted to sensory processing and

1733
01:35:34,351 --> 01:35:39,351
there's a huge part of the brain that's 
devoted to planning and the whole 

1734
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:39,900
prefrontal part of the brain is devoted 
to planning.

1735
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:45,380
And that's again.
So what that indicates is that in large 

1736
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:49,011
part,
as far as your evolved body is 

1737
01:35:49,011 --> 01:35:52,911
concerned,
the reason is that you think is so that 

1738
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:56,181
you can act better and of course that 
makes sense and you can think about 

1739
01:35:56,181 --> 01:35:59,970
memory from that perspective too,
because if you think scientifically,

1740
01:35:59,971 --> 01:36:03,510
you think that your memory of the world 
is something like an objective record of

1741
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,010
events,
of objective events,

1742
01:36:05,011 --> 01:36:07,320
but it's really not very much like that 
at all.

1743
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:09,600
And besides who cares?

1744
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:16,470
You don't need an accurate 
representation of all the facts about 

1745
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:16,470
this room.
In fact,

1746
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:19,300
all it would do is weigh you down.
Who cares what color the walls are,

1747
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,910
what kind of the ceiling is,
or what color the paint is.

1748
01:36:21,911 --> 01:36:26,911
All of that's not worth remembering,
partly because it has no relationship 

1749
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:31,150
whatsoever to what you need to do in 
order to continue to act.

1750
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:34,750
And so what you're doing when you 
remember as far as I can tell,

1751
01:36:34,751 --> 01:36:39,751
is that you're mining your experience 
for information that you can bring 

1752
01:36:39,751 --> 01:36:43,081
forward into the future.
It's purely pragmatic and so you know,

1753
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:49,190
my team treat people who have 
posttraumatic disorder or symptoms of 

1754
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:53,430
posttraumatic disorder and so let's say 
they got posttraumatic stress disorder 

1755
01:36:54,551 --> 01:36:59,551
because again,
because their relationship collapsed on 

1756
01:36:59,551 --> 01:36:59,551
them suddenly,
which is quite common.

1757
01:36:59,551 --> 01:37:01,300
You know,
they get betrayed or someone leaves them

1758
01:37:01,301 --> 01:37:06,301
suddenly and then they don't know what 
to do because especially if they're 

1759
01:37:06,301 --> 01:37:10,981
conscientious because then they just 
tear themselves into pieces trying to 

1760
01:37:10,981 --> 01:37:14,131
figure out what they did wrong to bring 
about that event and the reason they're 

1761
01:37:14,131 --> 01:37:18,811
doing that is because they want to 
retool their perceptions and their 

1762
01:37:18,811 --> 01:37:22,231
actions so that the probability that 
they'll have the same experience again 

1763
01:37:22,231 --> 01:37:24,700
is minimized and their mind won't leave 
them alone until they do it.

1764
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,290
And no wonder.
Right?

1765
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:29,860
Because if you fall into a big pit and 
you get really hurt,

1766
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:35,020
the first thing you should figure out is
how to not fall into big pits anymore.

1767
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:38,050
And your mind is set up exactly for 
that.

1768
01:37:38,051 --> 01:37:41,440
And so what you do with someone who's 
having problems like that.

1769
01:37:41,441 --> 01:37:46,441
So maybe they're waking up at the middle
of the night or obsessing about what 

1770
01:37:46,441 --> 01:37:49,381
went wrong is you walk them through it.
You do a situational analysis first 

1771
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:53,950
because one of the oversimplifications 
that people make,

1772
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,310
and this is especially for conscientious
people,

1773
01:37:56,311 --> 01:38:01,200
is if something bad happened to me,
I must've done something to deserve it.

1774
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:03,990
Now,
that's actually a pretty functional idea

1775
01:38:03,991 --> 01:38:08,991
because it suggests that there are 
things about your behavior that you 

1776
01:38:08,991 --> 01:38:09,960
could change that would make the future 
better.

1777
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:16,130
But the problem is is that say if it's 
the collapse of a relationship and 

1778
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:18,030
you've been with that person for eight 
years or longer,

1779
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:24,440
well you did so many things with them 
that the idea that you did something 

1780
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:27,030
wrong pretty much extends to every 
single thing you ever did with them.

1781
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:30,210
And that's how are you going to fix 
that?

1782
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,670
And so that's part of the trauma 
actually,

1783
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:37,680
that the trauma is $80,
million snakes all at the same time.

1784
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:38,910
It's like,
well,

1785
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:44,390
forget it.
You don't have time to go through all 

1786
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:47,601
that material.
And so partly what you do is with 

1787
01:38:47,601 --> 01:38:50,661
people,
and this is what you should do with 

1788
01:38:50,661 --> 01:38:50,661
yourself too,
is you do a situational analysis.

1789
01:38:50,661 --> 01:38:54,000
It's like don't be assuming necessarily 
that the thing that happened to you only

1790
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:56,250
happen to you because of what you did or
didn't do.

1791
01:38:56,670 --> 01:39:00,960
There's all sorts of factors at play.
So one of the things that sometimes I do

1792
01:39:00,961 --> 01:39:05,961
with clients as if they were in a 
relationship and I can get some 

1793
01:39:05,961 --> 01:39:07,080
reasonable personality information about
both of them,

1794
01:39:07,081 --> 01:39:10,770
I can point out where they were 
temperamentally incompatible.

1795
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:16,400
You know,
like if you're a highly conscientious 

1796
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:16,400
person and your partner is very,
very low in conscientiousness,

1797
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,940
it's like,
well good luck to you too.

1798
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:23,570
How the hell are you ever gonna work 
that out because you want everything to 

1799
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:26,781
be exactly where it's supposed to be and
you're working all the time and your 

1800
01:39:26,781 --> 01:39:30,231
partner could care less whether things 
were were they supposed to be and 

1801
01:39:30,231 --> 01:39:33,621
they're not going to work.
And you can butt heads about that 

1802
01:39:33,621 --> 01:39:37,431
forever.
The probability that you're going to 

1803
01:39:37,431 --> 01:39:37,431
shift it,
you know,

1804
01:39:37,431 --> 01:39:38,250
except to some minor degree is very,
very low.

1805
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:43,890
And so sometimes you end up with someone
with whom you get along very well on one

1806
01:39:43,891 --> 01:39:48,891
temperamental dimension and you're an 
absolute catastrophe on the other four 

1807
01:39:48,891 --> 01:39:52,820
and the probability that you're going to
be able to mediate a huge temperamental 

1808
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:56,811
differences extremely low.
You wouldn't expect yourself to mediate 

1809
01:39:56,811 --> 01:39:58,500
a huge intellectual difference,
right?

1810
01:39:58,501 --> 01:40:03,501
You're going to make the other person is
smarter or maybe you smarter depending 

1811
01:40:03,501 --> 01:40:03,570
on who you're with.
It's like no,

1812
01:40:03,571 --> 01:40:05,520
probably not bit maybe.

1813
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:11,480
So you do a situational analysis and so 
what you're trying to do is to extract 

1814
01:40:12,181 --> 01:40:17,181
out information from your past and your 
present that will enable you to conduct 

1815
01:40:17,181 --> 01:40:21,051
yourself properly into the future.
And so that's another example of the 

1816
01:40:21,051 --> 01:40:22,470
pragmatic element of,
of thought.

1817
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:28,700
Well then within the brain itself,
apart from the major subdivisions which 

1818
01:40:28,741 --> 01:40:30,300
which,
which we just described,

1819
01:40:30,301 --> 01:40:33,840
there are minor subdivisions,
and here's a bunch of them listed,

1820
01:40:33,841 --> 01:40:36,060
the caudate nucleus,
the cerebral cortex,

1821
01:40:36,061 --> 01:40:39,900
the huge newest part of the brain that's
about a square meter.

1822
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:45,230
If you unfold it,
it's all folded up and most of the 

1823
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:46,530
processing occurs right on the surface.
That's the idea.

1824
01:40:46,531 --> 01:40:48,030
Anyways,
the Thalamus,

1825
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:53,031
that's a place where a lot of the 
inflammation in the brain appears to be 

1826
01:40:53,031 --> 01:40:55,971
integrated.
I'm the cerebellum helps you with 

1827
01:40:55,971 --> 01:40:56,950
balance and the sequencing of complex 
motor activities,

1828
01:40:56,951 --> 01:40:59,200
the hippocampus,
that's the one we talked about before.

1829
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:04,650
One of the things that the hippocampus 
does seems to do is compare your model 

1830
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:08,311
of the world as it's unfolding with the 
model that that you desire to be 

1831
01:41:08,471 --> 01:41:13,030
occurring and then keep track of 
mismatches and if it detects a mismatch,

1832
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:18,031
then it disinhibit other emotional and 
motivational centers and that's the 

1833
01:41:18,031 --> 01:41:19,060
beginning of your response to the 
unknown.

1834
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:20,560
So

1835
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:27,520
one of them is the hypothalamus.
I'm going to concentrate on it for a 

1836
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:30,191
bit.
It's a little tiny part of the brain 

1837
01:41:30,191 --> 01:41:30,191
that's pretty much it at the top of the 
spinal cord.

1838
01:41:30,191 --> 01:41:34,061
C,
it's really small compared to the rest 

1839
01:41:34,061 --> 01:41:35,200
of the brain.
Now it turns out that if,

1840
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:39,280
imagine this is a cat brain for a minute
and you take off the whole cat brain,

1841
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:42,420
except for the Hypothalamus,
which,

1842
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:45,150
which people do you take off?
The whole cortex for example.

1843
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:49,260
Um,
and then the cat still live.

1844
01:41:49,261 --> 01:41:54,261
If you do it carefully but it doesn't 
have much of a brain and so you might 

1845
01:41:54,261 --> 01:41:57,501
think,
well that cat would just do nothing but 

1846
01:41:57,501 --> 01:41:57,750
cats actually pretty functional.
If it's reduced,

1847
01:41:57,751 --> 01:42:02,751
just do it's hypothalamus and that's 
because the hypothalamus is an 

1848
01:42:02,751 --> 01:42:06,231
incredibly important part of the brain 
and it provides what I would say 

1849
01:42:06,231 --> 01:42:10,370
constitute the major frames,
the major psychological frames and so so

1850
01:42:11,081 --> 01:42:16,081
I like a decorticate cat can still eat 
and drink and regulate his body 

1851
01:42:16,711 --> 01:42:21,711
temperature and engage in defensive 
aggression and if it's female it can 

1852
01:42:21,711 --> 01:42:25,791
still meet male can't because the male 
mating behavior is more complicated and 

1853
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:27,720
as long as you keep it in a bounded 
environment,

1854
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:32,870
it can function reasonably well.
It's hyper curious though,

1855
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:37,320
which is very weird because you wouldn't
expect a cab with no brain to be curious

1856
01:42:37,321 --> 01:42:42,321
about anything but a cat with no brain 
is curious about everything and that 

1857
01:42:42,321 --> 01:42:46,011
seems to be because part of the reason 
that you aren't curious about something 

1858
01:42:46,011 --> 01:42:49,851
anymore is because you've investigated 
it and you've built a representation of 

1859
01:42:49,851 --> 01:42:53,490
it that's functional and that functional
representation then stands for the thing

1860
01:42:53,491 --> 01:42:57,570
itself and then you can ignore it and so
you learn to ignore things there.

1861
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:59,970
They're interesting to begin with and 
then you learn to ignore them.

1862
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:03,360
And so one of the things that I think 
artists do,

1863
01:43:03,361 --> 01:43:08,361
if they're great artists is remind you 
that there's more to things that you see

1864
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:13,490
now that you've learned to ignore them.
So you get a kind of a hallucinogenic 

1865
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:17,010
painting of flowers like Van Gogh might 
produce like his famous irises,

1866
01:43:17,011 --> 01:43:20,550
which I think sold for $220,000,000
or something outrageous.

1867
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:25,830
It's like what Van Gogh is trying to 
show you is what those flowers looked 

1868
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:28,300
like before you thought you could see 
that because now you flower and you walk

1869
01:43:28,301 --> 01:43:29,070
by.
You know,

1870
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:34,280
you don't see it at all because you're 
off to get a peanut butter sandwich or 

1871
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:37,851
something.
You don't have time to glory and the 

1872
01:43:37,851 --> 01:43:39,981
wonder of the world,
you know you've got something practical 

1873
01:43:39,981 --> 01:43:39,981
to do,
so.

1874
01:43:39,981 --> 01:43:44,790
All right,
so we're going to zoom in on the 

1875
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:46,191
hypothalamus here and what you see of 
course when you zoom in on the 

1876
01:43:48,071 --> 01:43:53,071
hypothalamus is that it's not a thing.
It's a whole bunch of things and then 

1877
01:43:53,071 --> 01:43:56,570
it's one of those horrible whole bunches
of things that are made out of even more

1878
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:59,270
bunches of things and they're made out 
of more bunches of things.

1879
01:43:59,271 --> 01:44:04,271
And what's really interesting about 
going down the body from an analytic 

1880
01:44:04,271 --> 01:44:08,951
perspective,
it doesn't seem to get less complex as 

1881
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:08,951
you go farther down.
You know,

1882
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:11,840
like some of the should actually show 
you that

1883
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:17,730
I haven't showed you that little video 
of DNA fixing itself a Oh,

1884
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:20,740
I better show you that.
It's so cool.

1885
01:44:20,850 --> 01:44:23,110
It's ridiculously cool.
So you definitely need to see it.

1886
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:30,310
Until I encountered the artworks of 
David goodfellow and it was a molecular 

1887
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:33,020
biologist at the scripts institute and 
his pictures are old.

1888
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:36,590
Everything's accurate.
At all to scale and his work illuminated

1889
01:44:36,591 --> 01:44:39,860
for me what the molecular world inside 
us is like,

1890
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:45,130
so this is a transection through blood.
In the top left hand corner you've got 

1891
01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:45,130
this yellow,
green area.

1892
01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:46,940
The yellow green area is the fluids of 
blood,

1893
01:44:46,941 --> 01:44:48,890
which is mostly water,
but it's also antibodies,

1894
01:44:48,891 --> 01:44:50,570
sugars,
hormones,

1895
01:44:50,571 --> 01:44:55,571
that kind of thing,
and the red region is a slice and a red 

1896
01:44:55,571 --> 01:44:55,571
blood cell and those red molecules or 
hemoglobin,

1897
01:44:55,571 --> 01:45:00,401
they are actually red.
That's what gives blood its color and 

1898
01:45:00,401 --> 01:45:03,490
hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to
soak up the oxygen in your lungs and 

1899
01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:06,971
then carried to other parts of the body.
I was very much inspired by this image 

1900
01:45:06,971 --> 01:45:10,100
many years ago and I wondered whether we
could use computer graphics to represent

1901
01:45:10,101 --> 01:45:10,760
the molecular world.

1902
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:13,820
What would it look like?
And that's how I really began.

1903
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:19,270
So let's begin.
This is DNA and it's classic double 

1904
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:19,580
helix form and it's from x Ray 
crystallography.

1905
01:45:19,581 --> 01:45:24,581
So it's an accurate model of DNA.
If we unwind the double helix and 

1906
01:45:24,581 --> 01:45:28,571
unzipped the two strands,
you think see these things that look 

1907
01:45:28,571 --> 01:45:28,571
like teeth,
those are the letters of genetic code.

1908
01:45:28,571 --> 01:45:30,470
The 25,000
genes you've got written in your DNA.

1909
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:33,260
This is what they typically talk about,
the genetic code.

1910
01:45:33,261 --> 01:45:38,261
This is what they're talking about,
but I want to talk about different 

1911
01:45:38,261 --> 01:45:40,841
aspect of DNA science and that is that 
the physical nature of Dna and it's 

1912
01:45:40,841 --> 01:45:44,920
these two strands that run in opposite 
directions for reasons I can't go into 

1913
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:49,421
right now,
but they physically run in opposite 

1914
01:45:49,421 --> 01:45:51,671
directions which creates a number of 
complications for your living cells as 

1915
01:45:51,671 --> 01:45:53,840
you're about to see most particularly 
when DNA is being copied.

1916
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:59,590
And so what I'm about to show you is an 
accurate representation of the actual 

1917
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:02,240
DNA replication machine that's occurring
right now inside your body.

1918
01:46:02,241 --> 01:46:07,241
At least 2002 a biology.
So DNA is entering the production line 

1919
01:46:07,241 --> 01:46:09,440
from the left hand side and it hits this
collection,

1920
01:46:09,441 --> 01:46:14,441
this miniature biochemical machines that
are pulling apart the DNA strand and 

1921
01:46:14,441 --> 01:46:17,951
making an exact copy.
So DNA comes in and hits this blue 

1922
01:46:17,951 --> 01:46:20,000
doughnut shape structure and it's ripped
apart into its two strands.

1923
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:23,660
One strand can be copied directly and 
it's conceivably seen spooling off,

1924
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:26,420
down to the bottom there,
but things aren't so simple as the other

1925
01:46:26,421 --> 01:46:28,670
strand because it must be copied 
backwards.

1926
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:32,600
So it's thrown out repeatedly in these 
loops and copied one section at a time,

1927
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:38,050
creating two new DNA molecules.
Now you have billions of this machine 

1928
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:43,900
right now worrying and right way inside 
you copying your DNA with exquisite 

1929
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:45,920
fidelity.
It's an accurate representation and it's

1930
01:46:45,921 --> 01:46:48,620
pretty much at the correct speed for 
what it's occurring inside you.

1931
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:50,730
But I've out error correction,
a bunch of other things.

1932
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:55,500
This was work from a number of years 
ago.

1933
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:55,950
Thank you.

1934
01:46:58,450 --> 01:46:59,620
This is where from a number of years 
ago,

1935
01:46:59,621 --> 01:47:01,900
but when I show you next is updated 
science.

1936
01:47:01,901 --> 01:47:03,790
It's updated technology.
So again,

1937
01:47:03,791 --> 01:47:06,070
we begin with DNA and it's jiggly and 
wiggling their.

1938
01:47:06,071 --> 01:47:08,590
Because of the surrounding soup of 
molecules which are stripped away.

1939
01:47:08,591 --> 01:47:12,040
So you can see something.
DNA is about two nanometers across,

1940
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:15,430
which is really quite tiny.
But in each one of your cells,

1941
01:47:15,490 --> 01:47:19,150
each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 
million nanometers long,

1942
01:47:19,690 --> 01:47:23,470
so to keep the DNA organized,
regulate access to the genetic code.

1943
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:26,560
It's wrapped around these purple 
proteins I've labeled in purple here.

1944
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,770
It's packaged up in bundles up all of 
this field of view.

1945
01:47:29,771 --> 01:47:34,771
It's a single strand of DNA.
This huge package of DNA is called a 

1946
01:47:34,771 --> 01:47:36,700
chromosome and we'll come back to 
chromosomes in a minute.

1947
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:42,870
We're pulling out,
were zooming out out through a nuclear 

1948
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:46,351
pore,
which is sort of the gateway to this 

1949
01:47:46,351 --> 01:47:46,351
compartment that holds all the Dean I 
called the nucleus.

1950
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:51,820
All of this field of view is about a 
semester's worth of biology and I've got

1951
01:47:51,821 --> 01:47:56,821
seven minutes,
so we're not gonna be able to that 

1952
01:47:56,821 --> 01:47:56,821
today.
No,

1953
01:47:56,821 --> 01:47:56,821
I'm being told,
no,

1954
01:47:57,850 --> 01:48:02,850
this is the way a living cell looks down
a light microscope and it's been filmed 

1955
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:02,980
under time latches.
Why?

1956
01:48:02,981 --> 01:48:07,981
You can see it moving.
The nuclear envelope breaks down these 

1957
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:08,560
sausage shape things are the chromosomes
and we'll focus on them.

1958
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:13,980
They go through this very striking 
motion that is focused on these little 

1959
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:16,480
red spots within the field cell fields.
It's ready to go.

1960
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,710
It rips apart the chromosome.
One set of DNA goes to one side,

1961
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,600
the other side gets the other set of 
DNA,

1962
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:26,290
identical copies of DNA,
and then the cell splits down the middle

1963
01:48:26,410 --> 01:48:31,410
and again,
you have billions of cells undergoing 

1964
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:33,250
this process right now inside of you.
Now we're going to rewind and just focus

1965
01:48:33,251 --> 01:48:36,520
on the chromosomes and look at its 
structure and describe it.

1966
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:39,280
So again,
here we are at that equator moment,

1967
01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:43,780
the chromosomes line up and if we 
isolate just one chromosome,

1968
01:48:43,781 --> 01:48:45,730
we're going to pull it out and have a 
look at its structure.

1969
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:50,880
So this is one of the biggest molecular 
structures that you have in Lisa as far 

1970
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:55,381
as we've discovered so far inside of us.
So this is a single chromosome and you 

1971
01:48:56,111 --> 01:48:58,060
have two strands of DNA in each 
chromosome.

1972
01:48:58,090 --> 01:49:03,090
One is bundled up into one sausage,
the other strand is bundled up to the 

1973
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:06,751
other sausage.
These things that looked like whiskers 

1974
01:49:06,751 --> 01:49:06,790
that are sticking out from either side 
are the dynamic scaffolding,

1975
01:49:06,791 --> 01:49:11,791
the cell.
They're called microtubules but means 

1976
01:49:11,791 --> 01:49:11,791
not so important,
but we're going to focus on it.

1977
01:49:11,791 --> 01:49:15,751
This red region,
I've labeled it right here and it's the 

1978
01:49:15,751 --> 01:49:17,080
interface between the dynamic 
scaffolding and the chromosomes.

1979
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:20,710
It is obviously central to the movement 
of the chromosomes.

1980
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:24,160
We have no idea really as to how it's 
achieving that movement.

1981
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:29,250
We've been studying this thing.
They called the Kinetic Corp for over 

1982
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:31,621
100 years of intense study and we're 
still just beginning to discover what 

1983
01:49:31,621 --> 01:49:35,341
it's all about.
It is made up of about 200 different 

1984
01:49:35,341 --> 01:49:36,100
types of proteins,
thousands of proteins in total.

1985
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:42,180
It is a signal broadcasting system.
It broadcasts through chemical signals 

1986
01:49:42,190 --> 01:49:44,770
telling the rest of the cell when it's 
ready,

1987
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:48,830
when it feels that everything is aligned
and to go for the separation,

1988
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:53,850
the chromosomes.
It is able to couple onto the growing 

1989
01:49:53,850 --> 01:49:53,980
and shrinking microtubules.
It's transiently,

1990
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:59,030
it's involved with the growing of the 
microtubules and it's able to translate 

1991
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:01,390
couple onto them.
It's also attention sensing systems able

1992
01:50:01,391 --> 01:50:06,391
to feel when the cell is ready,
when the chromosome is correctly 

1993
01:50:06,391 --> 01:50:07,360
positioned,
it's turning green here because it feels

1994
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:12,361
that everything is just right and you'll
see there's this one little last bit 

1995
01:50:12,361 --> 01:50:15,670
that's still remaining red and it's 
walked away down the microtubules.

1996
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:22,310
That is the signal broadcasting system 
and sending out that stop signal and 

1997
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:22,620
it's walked away.
I mean it's that mechanical.

1998
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:28,220
It's molecular clockwork.
This is how you work at the molecular 

1999
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:31,851
scale,
so with a little bit of Molecular 

2000
01:50:31,851 --> 01:50:32,460
Icandy,
we've got kinases,

2001
01:50:32,461 --> 01:50:37,461
which are the orange ones.
They're a little molecular Korea 

2002
01:50:37,461 --> 01:50:37,461
molecules working one way and here are 
the dining.

2003
01:50:37,461 --> 01:50:42,231
They're carrying that bray broadcasting 
system and they've got their long legs 

2004
01:50:42,231 --> 01:50:42,231
so they can step around obstacles and so
on.

2005
01:50:42,231 --> 01:50:46,940
So again,
this is all derived accurately from the 

2006
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:50,601
science.
The problem is we can't show it to you 

2007
01:50:50,601 --> 01:50:52,521
any other way.
Exploring at the frontier of science at 

2008
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:54,360
the frontier of human understanding is 
mindblowing.

2009
01:50:56,170 --> 01:51:01,170
Discovering this stuff is certainly a 
pleasurable incentive to work in 

2010
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:03,310
science,
but most medical researchers,

2011
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:09,090
this is just discovering this stuff is 
simply steps along the path to the big 

2012
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:12,780
goals which are to eradicate disease,
to eliminate the suffering and the and 

2013
01:51:13,001 --> 01:51:16,150
the misery that disease causes and to 
lift people out of poverty.

2014
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:16,930
Thank you.

2015
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:22,500
So like that's just so ridiculously 
mindblowing.

2016
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:28,510
It's almost unbearable to think about 
that as clockwork even as pretty strange

2017
01:51:28,921 --> 01:51:33,060
idea because all those little things 
walk over obstacles.

2018
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:35,730
It's like how the hell does that happen?
They're just molecules.

2019
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:39,150
So it's so cool because when you go down
you'd think simple,

2020
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:41,910
but you know,
and you know,

2021
01:51:41,911 --> 01:51:44,790
he said at the beginning when they were 
taking the little machines,

2022
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:48,090
we're taking that DNA apart that he 
didn't show the error correcting.

2023
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:53,120
You know,
they have these other little machines 

2024
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:53,120
that go along and see if everything's 
okay and if it isn't,

2025
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:53,460
they cut it out and put it right pcn.

2026
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:54,250
It's like,

2027
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,010
yeah,
things we don't understand.

2028
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,930
There's no shortage of them,
that's for sure.

2029
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:04,580
Okay,
so what I'm doing in some senses walking

2030
01:52:04,581 --> 01:52:09,581
you through a psychophysiological or 
representation of Piaget's developmental

2031
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,840
process,
I would say.

2032
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:15,860
Um,
so I wanted to zero in on a hypothalamus

2033
01:52:15,861 --> 01:52:20,861
because it seems to me the thing that 
sets the most basic frames and so we'll 

2034
01:52:20,861 --> 01:52:22,250
go head with that.

2035
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:30,600
So you see that it's made up of all 
these little parts and so it's called 

2036
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:34,120
the hypothalamus more for convenience 
than.

2037
01:52:34,121 --> 01:52:37,180
Because it's a homogenous set of 
structures because it's not a homogenous

2038
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:42,181
set of structures and this is something 
to consider very carefully when you're 

2039
01:52:42,181 --> 01:52:45,540
thinking about the terminology that 
psychologists use or that you might use 

2040
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,330
to describe your own behavior.
Because you know you can roughly.

2041
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:52,560
There is a psychology of motivation and 
there's the psychology of the emotion 

2042
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:52,610
and you might think,
well,

2043
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:55,610
emotion and motivation are categorically
different entities,

2044
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:58,400
but they're not.
In fact,

2045
01:52:58,401 --> 01:53:02,030
there's no such thing as a uniform set 
of motivations and there's no such thing

2046
01:53:02,031 --> 01:53:06,290
as a uniform set of emotions.
And the distinction between a motivation

2047
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:08,990
out an emotion is unclear to say the 
least.

2048
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:13,991
And that's partly because the 
physiological substructures that subsume

2049
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:19,330
what we call motivations and what we 
call emotions and it's not like there's 

2050
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:19,800
a motivation center that's,
Whoa,

2051
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:22,340
that's a margin is the closest is the 
hypothalamus,

2052
01:53:22,341 --> 01:53:25,220
but it's made of structures that are 
qualitatively different.

2053
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:30,700
And then the emotions,
because I have to use that descriptive 

2054
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:32,090
terminology because we have to 
communicate about it somehow.

2055
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:37,630
There's all sorts of different 
structures in the brain that contribute 

2056
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:38,600
to emotional expression and they're not 
even in the same place,

2057
01:53:38,601 --> 01:53:43,601
much less,
much less composed of identical 

2058
01:53:43,601 --> 01:53:45,140
structure or function.
So you know,

2059
01:53:45,141 --> 01:53:47,870
we have these shorthands that we use to 
divide up the world,

2060
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:52,871
but they're,
they're awkward and untenable as the 

2061
01:53:52,871 --> 01:53:54,380
level of resolution increases.
But anyways,

2062
01:53:54,381 --> 01:53:59,381
I'm still going to go with motivation 
and emotion because it's a useful 

2063
01:53:59,381 --> 01:54:02,891
simplification.
But you can see with the hypothalamus 

2064
01:54:02,891 --> 01:54:03,630
that there's all these complicated 
little subsystems in there.

2065
01:54:03,631 --> 01:54:07,400
And then I showed you that video to show
you just how complicated this subsystems

2066
01:54:07,401 --> 01:54:11,000
are all the way down to the relate to 
the molecular level.

2067
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:15,110
How those little machines manage what 
they do is completely beyond me.

2068
01:54:15,110 --> 01:54:20,110
You know,
to call it clockwork when those little 

2069
01:54:20,110 --> 01:54:20,110
things that walk and walk over 
obstacles,

2070
01:54:20,110 --> 01:54:22,630
it's like clockwork does one thing,
you know,

2071
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:24,100
only click,
click,

2072
01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:24,650
click,
click.

2073
01:54:24,651 --> 01:54:26,990
That's all it does.
No exceptions.

2074
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:29,840
This thing walks over.
Obstacles to get where it's going.

2075
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:32,630
It's like who knows what's going on down
there,

2076
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:36,170
but it works well enough.
So here we are,

2077
01:54:36,230 --> 01:54:41,230
weirdly enough.
So motivation seems to me to be the 

2078
01:54:41,230 --> 01:54:45,821
initial framing process and you come,
you come into the world with the 

2079
01:54:45,821 --> 01:54:47,630
motivational systems roughly ready to 
go.

2080
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:49,010
You know,
babies are hungry,

2081
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:52,130
babies get cold,
babies want something to drink,

2082
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,270
you know,
so.

2083
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:58,660
So the world already comes in some sense
they come into the world with 

2084
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:03,190
prepackaged categories for existence and
those are the categories that are going 

2085
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:04,550
to aid their survival.
And you know,

2086
01:55:04,551 --> 01:55:06,680
they're not simple either.
It's not so simple.

2087
01:55:06,681 --> 01:55:08,510
It's a hunger,
thirst,

2088
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:10,220
pleasure,
pain,

2089
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:12,050
anxiety,
you know,

2090
01:55:12,051 --> 01:55:14,330
the classic,
sort of the classic emotion,

2091
01:55:14,331 --> 01:55:16,640
sadness,
joy and so forth.

2092
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:21,640
Those systems are already there,
but babies or have more complicated 

2093
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:24,881
systems too.
Like the system for exploration has 

2094
01:55:24,881 --> 01:55:25,700
already in place in the system for play,
which is really complicated.

2095
01:55:25,701 --> 01:55:29,140
It's already in place and so you know,
you come into the world with a,

2096
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:34,430
with a human nature and the nature seems
to be distributed across these 

2097
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:35,010
subsystems.
That's.

2098
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:40,040
That's one way of thinking about it and 
it's also useful to think about the 

2099
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:43,691
operation of those subsystems as 
something like you could think about 

2100
01:55:43,691 --> 01:55:46,170
them as games with a with an aim.
You can think about them as stories.

2101
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,810
You can think about them as frames of 
reference.

2102
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:50,700
You can think about them as action 
patterns,

2103
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:56,570
all of those,
and you can think about them as 

2104
01:55:56,570 --> 01:55:56,570
subpersonalities,
which I actually think is maybe the best

2105
01:55:56,570 --> 01:55:58,890
way to think about them because if 
you're hungry,

2106
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:04,340
it's not a deterministic drive fits the 
sub personality that has a goal and then

2107
01:56:04,921 --> 01:56:09,921
it has a bunch of action patterns that 
are going to work in reference to that 

2108
01:56:09,921 --> 01:56:09,921
goal.

2109
01:56:09,921 --> 01:56:13,670
It has a bunch of perceptions that that 
suit that goal and it organizes your 

2110
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:18,381
emotional responses around that goal.
And so to think about it as a 

2111
01:56:18,381 --> 01:56:20,490
personality is a much.
It's a much more intelligent way to look

2112
01:56:20,491 --> 01:56:22,980
at it.
One of the thing about skinner's rats,

2113
01:56:22,981 --> 01:56:27,981
you know,
skinner could get rats to do almost 

2114
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:29,010
everything and he would reward them with
food and so he had a simple rat model,

2115
01:56:29,011 --> 01:56:32,520
but his rats were starved down to 75 
percent of their normal body weight.

2116
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:35,910
So not only were they know it's social 
gregarious,

2117
01:56:35,911 --> 01:56:38,010
rats,
rats are because they were isolated,

2118
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:41,910
they were genetically altered from wild 
rats,

2119
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:47,270
but they also weren't as complex as a 
real route because they were starving 

2120
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:47,270
and so,
but you know,

2121
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:52,161
a starving rat is a pretty good model of
a rat and a rat is a pretty good model 

2122
01:56:52,161 --> 01:56:52,161
of a person.

2123
01:56:52,161 --> 01:56:55,830
But are a lot of our models have simple 
behavior learning were based on starving

2124
01:56:55,831 --> 01:56:58,860
isolated rats.
So anyways,

2125
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:05,780
how to think about motivation will think
about it from the hypothalamic 

2126
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:08,811
perspective.
So we could say one thing that 

2127
01:57:08,811 --> 01:57:10,611
motivation does is set goals.
We could say that emotions track 

2128
01:57:10,611 --> 01:57:12,630
progress towards goals and I'm going to 
use that scheme.

2129
01:57:12,631 --> 01:57:14,790
I even though it's not exactly right.
So you say,

2130
01:57:14,791 --> 01:57:16,950
well,
motivation determines where you're going

2131
01:57:16,951 --> 01:57:18,180
to aim.
So if you're hungry,

2132
01:57:18,181 --> 01:57:23,181
you're going to aim at something to eat 
and then that will organize your 

2133
01:57:23,181 --> 01:57:26,901
perceptions so that you zero out 
everything that isn't relevant to that 

2134
01:57:26,901 --> 01:57:30,321
task,
which is almost everything you 

2135
01:57:30,321 --> 01:57:32,751
concentrate on those few things that are
going to facilitate your movement 

2136
01:57:32,751 --> 01:57:35,811
forward.
When you encounter those things that 

2137
01:57:35,811 --> 01:57:38,001
produces positive emotion,
as you move through the world towards 

2138
01:57:38,001 --> 01:57:41,391
your goal and you see that things are 
laying themselves out that facilitate 

2139
01:57:41,391 --> 01:57:43,920
your movement forward,
those things caused positive emotion and

2140
01:57:43,921 --> 01:57:45,870
if you encounter anything that gets in 
the way,

2141
01:57:46,170 --> 01:57:50,220
then that produces negative emotion and 
it can be like threat because you're not

2142
01:57:50,221 --> 01:57:52,080
supposed to encounter something that 
gets in the way.

2143
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,060
It can be anger so that you move it 
away.

2144
01:57:54,061 --> 01:57:56,220
It can be frustration,
disappointment,

2145
01:57:56,221 --> 01:57:57,510
grief.
Those would,

2146
01:57:57,870 --> 01:58:00,630
if you had a response that serious to an
obstacle,

2147
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:04,470
it would probably punish the little 
motivated frame right out of existence.

2148
01:58:04,730 --> 01:58:09,730
You know,
so you walked downstairs and I don't 

2149
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:12,101
know the contracting company,
instead of wrecking ball through your 

2150
01:58:12,101 --> 01:58:15,441
kitchen,
it's like that's going to be 

2151
01:58:15,441 --> 01:58:17,331
disappointing.
You're not going to keep eating the 

2152
01:58:17,331 --> 01:58:19,461
peanut butter sandwich and the rubble,
that little frame is going to get 

2153
01:58:19,461 --> 01:58:22,461
punished out of existence and some new 
goal is going to pop up and it's dead 

2154
01:58:22,461 --> 01:58:26,900
and you know,
one of the things we're going to try to 

2155
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:27,960
sort out is how do you decide when 
you've encountered an obstacle that's so

2156
01:58:27,961 --> 01:58:32,961
big that you should just quit and go do 
something else because that's not 

2157
01:58:32,961 --> 01:58:32,961
obvious,
you know,

2158
01:58:32,961 --> 01:58:37,830
and you can.
You can get into counter productive 

2159
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:41,091
persistence pretty easily.
So we don't know how people solve that 

2160
01:58:41,091 --> 01:58:41,091
problem.
It's a really complicated one.

2161
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:41,980
So anyways,
we're

2162
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:46,980
going to work on that scenario.
Your hypothalamus pops up micro goals 

2163
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:51,841
that are directly relevant to biological
survival that produces a frame of 

2164
01:58:51,841 --> 01:58:53,470
reference.
So it's not a goal,

2165
01:58:53,530 --> 01:58:56,650
it's not a drive and it's not a 
collection of behaviors.

2166
01:58:56,710 --> 01:59:00,160
It's a little personality and the 
personality has a viewpoint.

2167
01:59:00,161 --> 01:59:03,940
It has thoughts that go along with it.
It has perceptions,

2168
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,100
it has action tendencies,
all of that.

2169
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:09,490
You can see this in addiction most 
particularly.

2170
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:15,420
So one of the things that you find often
with people who are alcoholic is they 

2171
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:17,560
lie all the time and that's because when
they're.

2172
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:22,750
They built a little alcohol dependent 
personality inside of themselves or a 

2173
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:26,911
big one might,
maybe it's 90 percent of their 

2174
01:59:26,911 --> 01:59:29,221
personality and one of that,
one of the things that consists of is 

2175
01:59:29,471 --> 01:59:34,471
all the rationalizations that they've 
used over the years to justify their 

2176
01:59:34,471 --> 01:59:35,470
addiction to themselves and to other 
people.

2177
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:39,520
And so the addiction has a personality,
you know,

2178
01:59:39,521 --> 01:59:44,521
and so when the person is off or maybe 
they're addicted to meth or something 

2179
01:59:44,521 --> 01:59:44,860
like that,
where we know the addiction is more.

2180
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:49,330
It's more short term powerful than I 
would say,

2181
01:59:49,331 --> 01:59:52,760
than an alcohol addiction.
They'll say anything and the.

2182
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:57,850
The words are just tools used to get 
towards the goal and if they happen to 

2183
01:59:57,850 --> 01:59:58,510
be deceptive,
whatever,

2184
01:59:58,511 --> 02:00:03,511
it doesn't matter.
They're just practical tools to get 

2185
02:00:03,511 --> 02:00:05,791
towards the goal.
And then when you get towards the goal 

2186
02:00:05,791 --> 02:00:05,791
and you take a nice shot of meth or 
something like that,

2187
02:00:06,130 --> 02:00:09,460
you reinforce all those rationales that 
you use to get the drug.

2188
02:00:09,461 --> 02:00:12,550
And then the next time you're even a 
better deceiver and liar.

2189
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:18,360
So okay,
so we're going to say motivations one 

2190
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:20,911
way of thinking about as they set goals,
but it's not the right way of thinking 

2191
02:00:20,911 --> 02:00:20,911
about it.

2192
02:00:20,911 --> 02:00:21,820
They produce a whole framework of 
interpretation.

2193
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:24,610
And so we're going to think about that 
framework of interpretation.

2194
02:00:24,910 --> 02:00:28,650
And then emotions emerge inside of that.
So that's it.

2195
02:00:28,690 --> 02:00:30,640
So the world is framed.
Motivations,

2196
02:00:30,641 --> 02:00:35,641
set goals.
You could say the world has to be 

2197
02:00:35,641 --> 02:00:35,641
framed.
So motivation sets that frame,

2198
02:00:35,641 --> 02:00:36,550
cruise goals,
emotions,

2199
02:00:36,551 --> 02:00:39,430
perceptions and actions and inactions 
track progress.

2200
02:00:39,431 --> 02:00:44,170
So positive emotion says you're moving 
forward properly towards your goal.

2201
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:46,720
And if you encounter something you don't
expect,

2202
02:00:46,721 --> 02:00:48,460
you stop.
That's anxiety.

2203
02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:49,210
It's like,
oh,

2204
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:52,120
we're not where we thought we were.
And so we don't know what to do,

2205
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:54,610
so we should stop because we don't know 
where we are,

2206
02:00:54,611 --> 02:00:56,410
what we're doing.
Stop frozen.

2207
02:00:57,190 --> 02:01:02,190
And then the more powerful negative 
emotions like pain they might make you 

2208
02:01:02,190 --> 02:01:05,140
get out of there.
So emotions forward,

2209
02:01:05,141 --> 02:01:06,550
stop,
reverse.

2210
02:01:06,730 --> 02:01:09,340
That's your emotions within that 
motivated frame.

2211
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:15,020
So,
and that's another example of how your 

2212
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:16,170
mind is embedded in your body.
Your emotions are in like their,

2213
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,680
their offshoots of action tendencies.
That's,

2214
02:01:18,681 --> 02:01:23,681
that's the right way to think about it 
because action is everything 

2215
02:01:23,681 --> 02:01:26,110
fundamentally.
So what are some basic motivations?

2216
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:31,240
Uh,
most of these are regulated by the 

2217
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:31,240
Hypothalamus,
by the way,

2218
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:31,660
that that tells you just how important 
the control system it is.

2219
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:36,900
The other thing that's useful to know 
about the hypothalamus is that it has 

2220
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:39,631
projections going up from it that are 
like tree trunks and inhibitory 

2221
02:01:39,631 --> 02:01:40,070
projections

2222
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,290
coming down there.
They're like grape vines.

2223
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:47,860
So you can kind of control your 
hypothalamus as long as it's not on too 

2224
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:47,860
much,
but if it's on,

2225
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:50,310
in any serious way,
it's like it,

2226
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:55,510
it winds.
So partly what you do to stop yourself 

2227
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:57,950
from falling under the dominion of your 
hypothalamus is to never,

2228
02:01:57,951 --> 02:02:00,770
ever be anywhere where it's action is 
necessary,

2229
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:06,580
right?
You don't want to go into a biker bar 

2230
02:02:06,580 --> 02:02:07,340
because you might find yourself in a 
situation where panicked.

2231
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:10,040
Defensive aggression is immediately 
necessary.

2232
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:13,040
You probably don't want that.
You don't want to panic,

2233
02:02:13,041 --> 02:02:16,070
you don't want the terror,
you don't want the frenzied fight,

2234
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:21,100
you don't want any of that.
You don't want to have to run away in 

2235
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:21,100
absolute panic,
so you just don't go there,

2236
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:26,380
and then a huge,
a huge part of how we regulate our 

2237
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:29,981
emotions is just by never going anywhere
where we have to experience them and so 

2238
02:02:29,981 --> 02:02:34,691
that has very little to do with internal
inhibitory control and everything to do 

2239
02:02:34,691 --> 02:02:35,630
with staying where you belong.

2240
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:40,580
So okay,
so basic motivations,

2241
02:02:40,581 --> 02:02:41,300
hunger,
thirst,

2242
02:02:41,301 --> 02:02:46,301
pain,
pain is not regulated by the 

2243
02:02:46,301 --> 02:02:46,301
hypothalamus.
That's a different circuit.

2244
02:02:46,301 --> 02:02:47,660
Anger slash aggression,
thermoregulation,

2245
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:51,350
panic and escape,
affiliation and care,

2246
02:02:51,410 --> 02:02:53,630
sexual desire,
exploration play,

2247
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:58,080
and you can kind of break those in.
You can kind of break those into a,

2248
02:02:59,230 --> 02:03:01,730
the classic Darwinian categories to and 
say,

2249
02:03:01,731 --> 02:03:06,731
well,
there's a set of motivations that go 

2250
02:03:06,731 --> 02:03:06,731
along with self maintenance.
That'd be your survival,

2251
02:03:06,731 --> 02:03:08,360
ingestive and defensive.
See,

2252
02:03:08,370 --> 02:03:13,370
I've sort of coded them there.
So the self maintenance,

2253
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:20,820
there's an adjustive set of basic 
motivations that go with self 

2254
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:20,820
maintenance.
You say that's hunger,

2255
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:23,050
thirst.
There's a set of defensive motivations,

2256
02:03:23,110 --> 02:03:23,920
pain,
anger,

2257
02:03:23,921 --> 02:03:27,250
thermoregulation paddock and escape,
and then there's,

2258
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:30,010
there's motivations that are associated 
with reproduction,

2259
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:35,280
affiliation care and sexual desire.
And then I put exploration in place sort

2260
02:03:35,471 --> 02:03:37,150
of outside of that,
uh,

2261
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:44,100
I would say because those two things 
serve both of these approximately 

2262
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:47,371
equally.
So what I tried to do is take the basic 

2263
02:03:47,371 --> 02:03:50,751
motivations and then nest them inside up
fundamental Darwinian framework so that 

2264
02:03:50,751 --> 02:03:54,651
you could see how the biological process
of evolution has manifested itself and 

2265
02:03:54,651 --> 02:03:59,601
then sort of differentiated into these 
fundamentals fundamental biological 

2266
02:03:59,601 --> 02:04:00,120
systems.
So,

2267
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:04,580
okay,
so this is a rat brain flat map.

2268
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:10,230
And so it's basically what you would see
other routes brain if you flattened it 

2269
02:04:10,230 --> 02:04:10,230
out,
unrolled it,

2270
02:04:10,230 --> 02:04:15,101
flattened it out,
and then made it to dimension when you 

2271
02:04:15,101 --> 02:04:17,471
can see here,
so this is the hypothalamus and you can 

2272
02:04:19,571 --> 02:04:21,400
see that it's made out of these 
different nuclei.

2273
02:04:21,401 --> 02:04:26,401
That's what they're called.
And they started correspond to those 

2274
02:04:26,401 --> 02:04:26,401
shapes that I showed you in the human 
hypothalamus earlier.

2275
02:04:26,401 --> 02:04:28,150
And you see that there's different 
systems.

2276
02:04:28,151 --> 02:04:33,151
There's the system for eating and 
drinking is outlined in green and the 

2277
02:04:33,151 --> 02:04:35,800
reproductive system.
There's two of them and they're outlined

2278
02:04:35,801 --> 02:04:37,860
in in,
I think it's red.

2279
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:41,700
Is that right?
Yeah.

2280
02:04:41,701 --> 02:04:46,701
Reproductive is red in the defensive 
ones are in Magenta and so those are 

2281
02:04:46,701 --> 02:04:50,871
the.
You can think about those as the three 

2282
02:04:50,871 --> 02:04:52,731
fundamental value systems of living 
creatures with complex nervous systems 

2283
02:04:53,071 --> 02:04:56,730
as far as the hypothalamus is concerned,
and then given what I told you about the

2284
02:04:56,731 --> 02:04:57,840
hypothalamus switches,

2285
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:02,040
you hardly need the rest of your brain 
at all.

2286
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:07,700
As long as you have the hypothalamus,
it's worth thinking that those are very 

2287
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:11,520
fundamental to value per se.
Now you might think if you only need the

2288
02:05:11,521 --> 02:05:13,920
damn hypothalamus,
why bother with the rest of the brain at

2289
02:05:13,921 --> 02:05:15,540
all,
which is.

2290
02:05:15,790 --> 02:05:20,790
That's a very useful question,
especially because most creatures don't 

2291
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:22,740
have much of a brain so,
but it seems to be something like,

2292
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:28,760
well,
you've gotten your eating and drinking 

2293
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,291
system,
your reproductive system and your 

2294
02:05:30,291 --> 02:05:30,291
defensive system,
but the problem is,

2295
02:05:30,291 --> 02:05:31,320
is that those things,
first of all,

2296
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:33,360
can conflict.
You know,

2297
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:35,520
are you too hungry to sleep or to sleep?
Eat,

2298
02:05:35,521 --> 02:05:40,521
eat is.
That's a pretty simple kind of 

2299
02:05:40,521 --> 02:05:40,521
contradiction.
You know,

2300
02:05:40,521 --> 02:05:44,420
are you more angry at your partner or do
you want sexual relations more so 

2301
02:05:44,420 --> 02:05:46,320
there's an so they can conflict in the 
present,

2302
02:05:47,190 --> 02:05:51,030
but then they can conflict with other 
people doing the same thing and they can

2303
02:05:51,031 --> 02:05:56,031
conflict across time and so partly the 
reason that you need the rest of your 

2304
02:05:56,031 --> 02:05:59,991
brain is to solve the problems that 
emerge from the solutions that the 

2305
02:05:59,991 --> 02:06:03,711
hypothalamus offers and so because you 
don't want to just eat and drink and 

2306
02:06:03,711 --> 02:06:06,270
reproduce and and and defend yourself.

2307
02:06:06,450 --> 02:06:09,690
You want to eat now later,
tomorrow,

2308
02:06:09,691 --> 02:06:14,691
next week and next month.
While you're able to engage in 

2309
02:06:14,691 --> 02:06:18,560
reproductive activity and defend 
yourself in multiple contexts with a 

2310
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:20,520
whole bunch of people for as long as you
can possibly manage it.

2311
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:23,280
And so you need the rest of your brain 
to calculate that.

2312
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:26,910
And so what the rest of your brain has 
to do roughly speaking,

2313
02:06:26,911 --> 02:06:31,911
is regulate these and also elaborate 
them up into like,

2314
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:37,500
like into something that's integrated 
inside you which might roughly be your 

2315
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:41,451
personality.
And then so that that personality is 

2316
02:06:41,451 --> 02:06:41,451
integrated with the personality of other
people.

2317
02:06:41,700 --> 02:06:43,890
And so you can think about it as an 
emergent process.

2318
02:06:43,891 --> 02:06:45,990
This is one of the things I really like 
about piaget.

2319
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:51,230
He's so damn smart because piaget is the
only thinker I know really who really 

2320
02:06:52,321 --> 02:06:55,440
addressed the problem of the evolution 
of value systems.

2321
02:06:55,620 --> 02:07:00,620
Now,
he never nailed it down to the 

2322
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:03,021
physiology because there wasn't enough 
known about physiology when he did his 

2323
02:07:03,021 --> 02:07:05,931
work,
but it maps very nicely onto the 

2324
02:07:05,931 --> 02:07:05,931
physiology.

2325
02:07:05,931 --> 02:07:05,931
But you know,
he said,

2326
02:07:05,931 --> 02:07:07,410
well,
but he got it right.

2327
02:07:07,411 --> 02:07:08,070
Anyways,
he said,

2328
02:07:08,071 --> 02:07:13,071
you come into the world with a handful 
of of a preestablished reflexes.

2329
02:07:13,470 --> 02:07:15,180
Okay,
we're going to complicate that up a bit.

2330
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:20,330
No,
you come into the world with a handful 

2331
02:07:20,330 --> 02:07:22,670
of micro personalities that are centered
around these fundamental motivational 

2332
02:07:22,741 --> 02:07:23,910
axes.
Okay?

2333
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:29,600
And then that gets you started and is.
And that has motor output as well as 

2334
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:31,260
perceptions and all of that that's 
associated with it.

2335
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:35,130
And then as you interact initially,
let's say with your mother,

2336
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:40,830
you start to learn how to integrate 
those things in some sort of social 

2337
02:07:40,830 --> 02:07:43,891
context because you form a relationship 
with your mother right off the bat and 

2338
02:07:43,891 --> 02:07:48,511
so you're starting to figure out how to 
to to produce patterned and stable 

2339
02:07:49,691 --> 02:07:53,170
interactions between those motivational 
systems on a day to day,

2340
02:07:53,171 --> 02:07:54,940
week to week,
month to month basis.

2341
02:07:55,150 --> 02:08:00,150
And one of the things you do with kids,
it's really important to do this with 

2342
02:08:00,150 --> 02:08:00,340
kids is you want to get them onto some 
sort,

2343
02:08:00,370 --> 02:08:05,370
some sort of a routine.
Because what the routine is actually is 

2344
02:08:05,370 --> 02:08:09,211
the beginnings of the system that 
integrates all of these underlying 

2345
02:08:09,211 --> 02:08:11,700
biological systems into some sort of 
unity because they have to sleep in,

2346
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:15,100
they have to sleep and wake up.
So you want to get nailed that down.

2347
02:08:15,101 --> 02:08:17,070
So it's predictable,
you know,

2348
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:22,080
they have to eat,
they have to stay warm and they need to 

2349
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:23,080
do that in a manner that's,
that's stable.

2350
02:08:23,350 --> 02:08:28,350
And so it's to your great benefit as a 
parent that you get islands of stability

2351
02:08:29,650 --> 02:08:34,650
planted in the life of your kid.
So that some of this gets simplified so 

2352
02:08:34,691 --> 02:08:39,691
that the kid isn't constantly 
preoccupied with domination by these 

2353
02:08:39,691 --> 02:08:43,111
different motivational systems and so 
it's a useful thing to know because you 

2354
02:08:43,111 --> 02:08:43,111
might think,
well,

2355
02:08:43,111 --> 02:08:44,590
you don't want to impose any structure 
on your baby.

2356
02:08:44,590 --> 02:08:45,790
It's like no,
wrong.

2357
02:08:46,630 --> 02:08:51,630
You don't want to be a tyrant about it,
but there's no difference between that 

2358
02:08:51,630 --> 02:08:55,060
structure and the emergence of the 
child's adaptation to the world.

2359
02:08:55,360 --> 02:09:00,360
And to some degree what you're trying to
do is free them up from arbitrary 

2360
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,050
domination by these underlying 
motivational systems.

2361
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:04,960
You know,
because if the baby gets too tired,

2362
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:09,820
it's a horrible little thing to just 
scream at you nonstop and it's not happy

2363
02:09:09,821 --> 02:09:14,821
about it.
It's like it's not good for anyone for 

2364
02:09:14,821 --> 02:09:17,041
that to happen.
And so the faster you have to do it in 

2365
02:09:17,041 --> 02:09:20,521
relationship with the child,
even if some will sleep right away in a 

2366
02:09:20,521 --> 02:09:24,090
schedule almost immediately and other 
kids are harder to to to get their 

2367
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:29,460
circadian rhythms regulated.
So you have to attend to the individual 

2368
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:33,721
differences that characterize the child,
but you're still trying to establish 

2369
02:09:33,721 --> 02:09:37,471
some stable harmony out of this mishmash
of initial of initial systems.

2370
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,010
So

2371
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:43,220
all right,
so,

2372
02:09:43,580 --> 02:09:46,030
so that's sort of a physiological look 
at that.

2373
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:50,990
This is more of a conceptual look at it.
So I said that each of these systems you

2374
02:09:50,991 --> 02:09:52,790
can think about in a bunch of different 
ways.

2375
02:09:52,820 --> 02:09:55,640
You can think about our best,
something that sets a goal.

2376
02:09:56,780 --> 02:10:01,780
I'm,
I'm hungry and I don't want to be 

2377
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:01,780
hungry.
Point a point b.

2378
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:05,030
So the hunger and the vision of the 
satiation,

2379
02:10:05,031 --> 02:10:07,010
of the hunger,
all part of the same frame.

2380
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:10,520
And so if you're hungry,
you go into the kitchen,

2381
02:10:11,150 --> 02:10:13,340
you know that already,
that's part of your

2382
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:19,150
procedural knowledge about how the world
works and then what you're going to look

2383
02:10:19,151 --> 02:10:24,151
for are only those things that are 
relevant to what you're trying to do in 

2384
02:10:24,151 --> 02:10:24,610
the kitchen.
Everything else is zeroed out.

2385
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,680
You won't even really see it.
And why would you?

2386
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:32,020
You want to see the things that are 
relevant to the task at hand and so that

2387
02:10:32,350 --> 02:10:33,920
that's the.
That's so cool,

2388
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:39,250
I think because what it means is that 
you see the things that are relevant to 

2389
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:40,400
the task at hand and so here's something
to think about.

2390
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:45,940
Let's say that you see a whole bunch of 
things in the world that you don't want 

2391
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:47,420
to see know that make you constantly 
miserable and unhappy.

2392
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:52,720
One thing you might ask yourself is,
are you sure that your goals are proper 

2393
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:55,640
because your goals determine what you 
see now,

2394
02:10:55,641 --> 02:11:00,641
not 100 percent.
Obviously you can be thinking about the 

2395
02:11:00,641 --> 02:11:02,780
homework you're going to do and step off
a curb and be hit by a van.

2396
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:07,780
It's like you're going to get hit by the
van regardless of how you've oriented 

2397
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:08,810
your perceptions,
likely in all likelihood.

2398
02:11:09,290 --> 02:11:11,930
So I'm not trying to argue for pure 
solipsism,

2399
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:16,960
but it is very interesting to consider 
that since you see in relationship to 

2400
02:11:17,541 --> 02:11:20,450
what you want,
that a very large amount of what you see

2401
02:11:20,451 --> 02:11:25,451
is dependent on what you're aiming at.
And so one issue is if your life is 

2402
02:11:25,451 --> 02:11:30,251
wretched and miserable.
One thing to think about is whether or 

2403
02:11:30,251 --> 02:11:30,410
not what you're aiming at is the right 
thing to be aiming at,

2404
02:11:30,790 --> 02:11:34,820
and so it's and nothing is exactly the 
wrong answer to that.

2405
02:11:34,821 --> 02:11:36,500
I'm aiming at nothing,
so okay,

2406
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:40,130
you're going to experience a tremendous 
amount of misery and not very much joy.

2407
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:42,530
So anyways,
you've got this little frame.

2408
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:48,580
You're somewhere and it's not good 
enough and you're going somewhere else 

2409
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:48,580
that's going to be better.

2410
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:53,980
And what better depends upon is the 
state of these underlying biological 

2411
02:11:54,651 --> 02:11:59,651
systems and then more complex Lee,
as those biological systems get 

2412
02:11:59,651 --> 02:12:01,490
integrated into a personality and into 
the social world,

2413
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:07,030
then the frame and the goal is going to 
be dependent on that more complex 

2414
02:12:07,030 --> 02:12:11,891
hierarchical organization.
So you're not in here because you're 

2415
02:12:11,891 --> 02:12:14,621
hungry.
You're in here because if you get a 

2416
02:12:14,621 --> 02:12:14,621
degree,
maybe you don't ever have to be hungry.

2417
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:19,880
So.
So the hunger is properly incorporated 

2418
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:21,140
into your.
You don't want to be cold.

2419
02:12:21,141 --> 02:12:22,250
You don't want to freeze to death in the
winter.

2420
02:12:22,251 --> 02:12:23,990
You don't want to be on the street,
you know,

2421
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:29,020
so your higher order goals are longterm,
socially negotiated solutions to the 

2422
02:12:31,341 --> 02:12:34,760
problems that are implicit in your 
being.

2423
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:36,500
Not that might be one way of thinking 
about it.

2424
02:12:36,501 --> 02:12:38,540
So,
so,

2425
02:12:38,890 --> 02:12:41,930
and the micro elements of this.
So you could say I'm hungry.

2426
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:44,210
That's a physiological state and it 
conception.

2427
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:46,820
I have a vision of how I'm going to 
solve that,

2428
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:49,280
but then,
and those are,

2429
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:53,710
that's an abstraction,
but what you do to transform point a and

2430
02:12:53,780 --> 02:12:56,600
point b is not an abstraction.
You Act,

2431
02:12:57,140 --> 02:12:58,100
you know,
so if you're hungry,

2432
02:12:58,101 --> 02:13:03,101
you actually move your body,
say down from the second floor into the 

2433
02:13:03,101 --> 02:13:07,130
kitchen and you arrange things so that 
there's transformations in the world and

2434
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:12,460
that's a good way of thinking about the 
relationship between the mind and the 

2435
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:15,191
body.
Your hypothetical solution to your 

2436
02:13:15,191 --> 02:13:15,191
problem.
That's the mind.

2437
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:18,590
But the manner in which you incarnate 
that solution,

2438
02:13:19,070 --> 02:13:21,680
that's no longer abstract.
So you know,

2439
02:13:21,681 --> 02:13:25,460
people are always trying to solve the 
mind body problem and that's as far as I

2440
02:13:25,461 --> 02:13:30,461
can tell,
that's how you solve it is you have 

2441
02:13:30,461 --> 02:13:32,231
abstractions,
but they're not abstractions that are 

2442
02:13:32,231 --> 02:13:32,231
representations of the world.

2443
02:13:32,231 --> 02:13:36,500
There are abstractions that are 
representations of action patterns and 

2444
02:13:36,601 --> 02:13:41,601
the way those are implemented in the 
world is that you act them and so it's 

2445
02:13:41,601 --> 02:13:43,770
strange because you've got this weird 
level of control,

2446
02:13:43,771 --> 02:13:48,771
you know,
I can move my arm and I seem to be able 

2447
02:13:48,771 --> 02:13:51,081
to do that voluntarily,
but I really have no idea how I'm doing 

2448
02:13:51,081 --> 02:13:54,471
it.
Like I don't have conscious access 

2449
02:13:54,471 --> 02:13:57,420
exactly to the musculature except 
technically and I certainly have no idea

2450
02:13:57,421 --> 02:14:01,020
what I'm doing chemically to make those 
muscles muscles transform,

2451
02:14:01,410 --> 02:14:03,540
but my,
my soul,

2452
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:08,900
my abstractions ground out in this 
movement and I can observe the movement 

2453
02:14:09,670 --> 02:14:14,670
and and modern and modify it,
but I have no conscious access 

2454
02:14:14,670 --> 02:14:17,370
whatsoever to the microprocessors that 
are making that possible.

2455
02:14:17,670 --> 02:14:20,850
I have no idea why that is.
Probably because I'm not smart enough.

2456
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:24,840
That would be my guess right?
Is you're only going to.

2457
02:14:24,990 --> 02:14:29,990
Evolution is only going to allow your 
mind to control those elements of your 

2458
02:14:29,990 --> 02:14:34,071
being that you're smart enough to 
control and so you don't get voluntary 

2459
02:14:34,071 --> 02:14:34,470
control over your heartbeat,
for example,

2460
02:14:34,471 --> 02:14:39,471
because you just forget and then you'd 
be wandering around and then you'd 

2461
02:14:39,471 --> 02:14:42,150
forget to beat your heart bag and you'd 
be dead so you don't get to do that.

2462
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:47,960
So all right,
so all these different classified,

2463
02:14:49,171 --> 02:14:54,171
these again is self propagation and self
maintenance motivations and so if you're

2464
02:14:54,421 --> 02:14:57,030
too hot while you want to go somewhere 
cooler and if you're too cool,

2465
02:14:57,031 --> 02:15:02,031
you want to go somewhere hotter.
Same if you're thirsty and hungry and 

2466
02:15:02,031 --> 02:15:05,750
for self propagation while you're get 
lonesome and maybe you know you have 

2467
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:09,291
some sexual desire and and each of those
different systems competes for access to

2468
02:15:10,321 --> 02:15:15,321
this central frame and that's something 
like the contents of your consciousness 

2469
02:15:15,321 --> 02:15:15,321
at any given time.

2470
02:15:15,690 --> 02:15:20,690
So up pops a desire,
but it's wrong way of thinking about it 

2471
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:23,790
because a desire sounds like something 
that's pushing you forward,

2472
02:15:23,791 --> 02:15:25,740
but the desire is goal,
framework,

2473
02:15:25,741 --> 02:15:28,230
emotion perception,
action pattern,

2474
02:15:28,290 --> 02:15:33,290
all at the same time.
It's a little personality or it's a 

2475
02:15:33,290 --> 02:15:36,081
little story actually,
when you describe the operation of one 

2476
02:15:36,081 --> 02:15:36,750
of these things,
that's when you're telling a story,

2477
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:42,120
so I was somewhere I needed something.
I went and got it.

2478
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:45,810
It's boring little story,
but that's the basic unit of a story,

2479
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:48,930
right?
Because I don't care to hear what you're

2480
02:15:48,931 --> 02:15:50,430
doing unless you had a reason for doing 
it.

2481
02:15:50,730 --> 02:15:55,730
I just say what's the point of the story
and the point of the story is the point.

2482
02:15:56,550 --> 02:15:58,110
It's directional,
right?

2483
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:00,600
It says,
I went from here to there.

2484
02:16:00,601 --> 02:16:02,460
That's the point.
Here's how I did it.

2485
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:07,520
That's the point,
and you're interested in that because 

2486
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:09,411
maybe you want to know how to do it too 
and you won't have to struggle through 

2487
02:16:09,411 --> 02:16:09,411
it like I did.
You could just listen,

2488
02:16:09,570 --> 02:16:14,570
and so we're always throwing these 
little units of information back and 

2489
02:16:14,570 --> 02:16:14,620
forth to each other and for good reason.
I.

2490
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:19,230
I want to know what your point is 
because better I learned it from you.

2491
02:16:19,231 --> 02:16:24,231
Then make all the mistakes that you had 
to make when you were learning it and 

2492
02:16:24,231 --> 02:16:24,600
human beings.
We've got that figured out.

2493
02:16:24,601 --> 02:16:29,601
That's for sure.
So okay,

2494
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:30,070
I'm

2495
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:33,070
going to just explain this and then 
we'll stop.

2496
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:38,680
All right,
so we're in one of those frames now and 

2497
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:43,290
we're going from point a to point b and 
so the question is how does the world 

2498
02:16:43,290 --> 02:16:44,380
lay itself out?
Okay.

2499
02:16:44,381 --> 02:16:49,381
So the first thing to understand,
and this is partly the reason I showed 

2500
02:16:49,381 --> 02:16:51,340
you the gorilla video,
is that the first thing a frame does for

2501
02:16:51,341 --> 02:16:56,341
you is make almost everything irrelevant
and that's so great because that's what 

2502
02:16:56,341 --> 02:17:00,031
you want.
You want almost everything to be 

2503
02:17:00,031 --> 02:17:02,011
irrelevant because otherwise you're 
going to be so flooded with information 

2504
02:17:02,011 --> 02:17:02,950
that you.
That's what hallucinogens do,

2505
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:08,610
at least in their initial stages,
is they take away that filter and make 

2506
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:13,051
everything relevant.
You can read about that in Huxley's 

2507
02:17:13,051 --> 02:17:17,670
doors of perception.
He does a great job of describing that 

2508
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:20,491
initial stages of a masculine experience
and what happens is that all of the 

2509
02:17:20,491 --> 02:17:24,930
memory in some sense that regulates is 
perceptions is stripped off and so he 

2510
02:17:24,930 --> 02:17:27,700
sees everything glowing and alive and 
magical like,

2511
02:17:27,970 --> 02:17:29,800
like he'd never encountered it before.

2512
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:31,510
Which is exactly how you would see 
something.

2513
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:36,750
If all your memory about it was gone and
so he sees things as way more complex 

2514
02:17:36,750 --> 02:17:37,720
and interesting than he normally sees 
them,

2515
02:17:38,170 --> 02:17:40,390
while that's fine,
but if you're like that all the time,

2516
02:17:40,391 --> 02:17:45,391
then you end up in a ditch starving to 
death or something like it's not 

2517
02:17:45,391 --> 02:17:47,230
commensurate with normal life.
That's what it looks like,

2518
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:52,530
and so your perceptions or just shrunk 
and restricted to the bare minimum 

2519
02:17:52,530 --> 02:17:54,550
necessary to keep you moving in the 
direction that you're moving.

2520
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:56,500
All right,
so the first thing you want to do is you

2521
02:17:56,501 --> 02:17:59,890
want to make things irrelevant.
Now,

2522
02:18:00,310 --> 02:18:03,590
if you're with someone in a 
relationship,

2523
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:09,900
partly what you want them to do is to 
help you continue making most of their 

2524
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:14,551
possibility irrelevant.
It's polite because one of the things 

2525
02:18:14,551 --> 02:18:15,310
you so,
so you say,

2526
02:18:15,311 --> 02:18:16,840
well,
we have a friendship.

2527
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:18,400
Let's say we have a friendship.
Okay,

2528
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:23,670
so that means you're going,
you've agreed to act in a friendly 

2529
02:18:23,670 --> 02:18:26,731
manner towards me and to support me.
There's all sorts of other ways you 

2530
02:18:26,731 --> 02:18:28,870
could act like a myriad of them and I'm 
going to do the same for you.

2531
02:18:28,871 --> 02:18:33,250
So were simpler to each other than we 
would normally be and then you go and do

2532
02:18:33,251 --> 02:18:35,290
something that betrays me.
It's like bang,

2533
02:18:35,470 --> 02:18:40,470
that whole simplification has gone and 
all those parts of you that were 

2534
02:18:40,470 --> 02:18:42,370
supposed to be irrelevant because we 
were playing the same game,

2535
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:45,310
they're dead relevant and I don't know 
who the hell you are.

2536
02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:48,460
And so that's really rough and people do
not like that.

2537
02:18:48,461 --> 02:18:53,461
It's this emergent mismatch between 
their desires and the way the world is 

2538
02:18:53,461 --> 02:18:57,331
manifesting itself.
So one of the issues of complexity is 

2539
02:18:57,331 --> 02:19:01,291
that when you hit an obstacle,
everything that you have agreed with 

2540
02:19:01,361 --> 02:19:05,080
other people to make irrelevant,
irrelevant.

2541
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:09,070
And that's generally a disconcerting 
experience.

2542
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:10,600
Now you can,
you know,

2543
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:14,450
you might want a toy a little bit with 
that interrelationship,

2544
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:19,800
you know,
so maybe you encourage your partner to 

2545
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:22,111
dress differently or you go do different
things or something because you don't 

2546
02:19:22,111 --> 02:19:22,360
want to be stuck in exactly the same old
rut.

2547
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:27,160
And so what you'll agree is how you can 
both deviate and interesting amount,

2548
02:19:27,710 --> 02:19:28,100
but that's

2549
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,830
voluntary and controlled.
It's not the same at all.

2550
02:19:30,831 --> 02:19:35,831
It's having that little massive 80 
million snakes pop up right in front of 

2551
02:19:35,831 --> 02:19:37,610
you,
which is the last thing you want to have

2552
02:19:37,611 --> 02:19:42,611
happen and so it's so weird because one 
of the things that we're striving to do 

2553
02:19:42,621 --> 02:19:47,621
constantly is to keep most of the world 
irrelevant and our cultural systems are 

2554
02:19:48,621 --> 02:19:53,621
designed precisely for that purpose and 
part of what you do when you disrupt 

2555
02:19:53,621 --> 02:19:57,581
them is you force people to consider a 
far more range of relevance than they 

2556
02:19:57,581 --> 02:20:02,261
are even vaguely comfortable or vaguely 
competent to manage and it just burns 

2557
02:20:03,051 --> 02:20:06,200
them to a Chris.
Because what your body does is if all of

2558
02:20:06,201 --> 02:20:07,970
a sudden everything around you is 
irrelevant.

2559
02:20:08,330 --> 02:20:11,730
Like I could say you're stripped naked.
I take you to helicopter jumped,

2560
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:14,210
drop you right into the middle of a 
jungle at midnight.

2561
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:18,770
It's like you're not bored standing 
there,

2562
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:20,690
frozen,
paralyzed.

2563
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:25,840
Everything is interesting.
Well too bad for you because to 

2564
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,620
interesting is very little different 
from terrifying.

2565
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:33,040
And so you know,
your heart rate's going to be at one 

2566
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:34,250
slash 60 for like two days and then 
something will eat you and your problems

2567
02:20:34,251 --> 02:20:35,660
will be over.
So.

2568
02:20:35,990 --> 02:20:40,990
Alright.
So this diagram basically suggest this 

2569
02:20:40,990 --> 02:20:44,141
is,
this is how you break up the world when 

2570
02:20:44,141 --> 02:20:44,141
you're going from point a to point b,
you read,

2571
02:20:44,141 --> 02:20:45,440
it renders almost everything we 
irrelevant,

2572
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:49,550
hooray.
And then what happens is the rest of the

2573
02:20:49,551 --> 02:20:54,551
world is broken up into obstacles that 
get in your way and tools that 

2574
02:20:54,551 --> 02:20:59,501
facilitate your movement forward.
And that's actually what you see when 

2575
02:20:59,501 --> 02:20:59,960
you come into a place like when you come
into this room.

2576
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:05,800
These are obstacles in so far as you 
can't walk through them and those are 

2577
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:06,820
tools in so far as you can sit on them 
and watch the class.

2578
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:12,160
This is a tool and these are tools and 
this is a tool and I'm a tool for,

2579
02:21:13,430 --> 02:21:15,440
although I'd never admitted,
but anyways,

2580
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:20,790
um,
I'm a tool of because you need to take 

2581
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:21,550
this class in order to advance towards 
your,

2582
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:27,370
towards your degree.
And so basically what you see in the 

2583
02:21:27,370 --> 02:21:29,540
world or entities that functional 
significance and those are not objects,

2584
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:31,910
they are not the same thing.
So,

2585
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:37,020
and that's,
that's very much worth considering 

2586
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:37,280
because see,
we're trying to build up a case,

2587
02:21:37,340 --> 02:21:42,340
at least in part,
for analyzing the nature of the 

2588
02:21:42,340 --> 02:21:46,090
structures within which you organize 
your perceptions and we tend to think 

2589
02:21:46,090 --> 02:21:47,420
that those are predicated on object 
perception.

2590
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:50,780
It's not true.
It's not true.

2591
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:53,780
They're predicated on relevance.
Conception.

2592
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:59,200
Does it help you?
Does it get in your way or is it 

2593
02:21:59,200 --> 02:21:59,200
irrelevant?
That's what you want to know.

2594
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:00,650
If it helps you,
you're happy about it.

2595
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:02,100
If it gets in your way,
you're,

2596
02:22:02,530 --> 02:22:04,400
you're negatively predisposed towards 
it.

2597
02:22:04,401 --> 02:22:06,530
If it's irrelevant,
it's invisible.

2598
02:22:07,430 --> 02:22:11,450
And so if you're,
if your little scheme is functional,

2599
02:22:11,451 --> 02:22:16,451
your little frame is functional than 
most of the things that you encounter 

2600
02:22:16,451 --> 02:22:19,721
are mildly positive.
And that's how you know that you know 

2601
02:22:19,721 --> 02:22:22,391
what you're doing.
That's how you validate the entire 

2602
02:22:22,391 --> 02:22:22,391
frame.
So.

2603
02:22:22,391 --> 02:22:23,060
Okay,
good.
