1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,060
Okay,
so the last time we were here we got 

2
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:23,110
about maybe a third of the way through 
his story,

3
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,230
his story of no kill and the 
transformation of a marionette into 

4
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:33,571
something hypothetically real.
And I'm gonna backtrack a few slides and

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,840
it'll get us into it again.
So you remember that.

6
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:40,810
Um,
the blue fairy.

7
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,990
So I would say the benevolent element of
Mother Nature in the ski matter that 

8
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,981
we're going to use to investigate 
mythology had more or less been allowed 

9
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:54,601
her entrance because Japan was a good 
guy and because he wished for the right 

10
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,730
thing.
And so in some sense here,

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,080
here's a way of thinking about that,
you know,

12
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,350
genetic studies,
genetic slash environmental studies of 

13
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,890
children's temperament have revealed 
something quite interesting,

14
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:10,891
which is that the shared environment 
that children have within a family.

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,100
So that would be what's the same about 
your environment and your brother's 

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,100
environment.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,580
The Se doesn't have that much effect on 
your temperament or his temperament 

18
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,070
because the presumption always was that 
within a family there was a shared 

19
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,070
environment,
right?

20
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,250
That something was common about the 
environment to every child within that 

21
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,250
environment.
But,

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,900
but there isn't much of a shared 
environmental effect on temperament and 

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:35,900
so then you could say,
well,

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,961
that makes it appear as though parenting
isn't that relevant in relationship to 

25
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:44,251
the development of temperament,
but you could also suggest something 

26
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:48,001
else.
You could suggest that if parenting is 

27
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:51,871
occurring properly,
the effect of the shared environments 

28
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:54,460
should be very close to zero and the 
reason for that is that you establish an

29
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:59,461
identity on an individual relationship 
with each child and the environment is 

30
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:04,531
actually a microenvironment that's 
composed of your observations of your 

31
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:07,480
child and that specific child's 
interaction with you and to some degree,

32
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:12,481
if there is a shared environment that 
means that you're enforcing the same 

33
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:12,550
principles on every child.

34
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,550
And so my suspicions are,
although I don't know this because the 

35
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,890
research hasn't been done that in bad 
families there is a shared environmental

36
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:25,891
effect,
but in good families there are there 

37
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,910
that minimize it.
And so that lets the child's biological 

38
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,441
predisposition roughly manifest itself 
with support and in some positive 

39
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,040
manner.
Well,

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,940
I don't want to extend the analogy too 
far,

41
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:40,870
but you could imagine that if,
and this is what this film proposes,

42
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:44,050
is that if you aim properly in 
relationship to your child,

43
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,350
what you're trying to do is to establish
an individual relationship and to allow 

44
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,090
them to move towards whatever their 
particular expression of individuality 

45
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,051
happens to be and that's while that 
would be the same as allowing nature to 

46
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,670
take its course in some sense at nature 
and it's positive guys,

47
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:05,671
and that's exactly what happens here.
Now the other thing that happens of 

48
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:09,181
course,
is that the cricket for reasons that 

49
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:13,201
aren't clear precisely is knighted by 
the Blue Fairy and serves as Pinocchio's

50
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,640
conscience.

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,270
Although he isn't very good at it,
which is a very peculiar thing and quite

52
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:24,271
a market,
a point that the film is making that 

53
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,781
that conscience actually has something 
to learn too and there's actually a 

54
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:28,240
Friday and element to that.
You know,

55
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:33,241
because Freud thought of the Super Ego 
as the internalization roughly speaking 

56
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,230
of the father,
and it could be very severe,

57
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,420
the superego.
So it'd be like a really strict father,

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,910
really tyrannical father.
Inside your head,

59
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,390
although I think it's better to think 
about the Super Ego as the internalized 

60
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,591
representation of society at large 
mediated to some degree through your 

61
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:53,500
parents because it's not as if your 
father even assuming he's too radical,

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,740
is the inventor of all those tyrannical 
rules.

63
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,950
He's the propagator of them,
but he's actually a proxy voice if he 

64
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,640
even if it's just for the harsh side of 
society.

65
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:07,420
He's proxy voice for society and because
we are social creatures,

66
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,430
the the utility of having an internal 
social voice to guide you.

67
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,730
Although again,
you seem to be able to follow it or not 

68
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,281
follow it,
which I also find spectacularly 

69
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,400
interesting because obviously if it was 
an unerring guide,

70
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:24,370
you could just follow it and if it was 
an unerring guide,

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,300
well you wouldn't need freewill either 
because you could just act out the 

72
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,540
dictates of this internal representation
and that isn't what you do.

73
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,960
So anyways,
the proposition here is that the 

74
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,381
conscience exists but it's a relatively 
flawed entity and it needs to be 

75
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,690
modified as well by nature.
Which is quite interesting because the 

76
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:45,690
blue fairy night,
Sam,

77
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,110
because you also might think of the 
conscience as only something that's 

78
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,170
socially constructed,
right?

79
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:55,171
Which is the more typical viewpoint.
But I don't buy that for a second 

80
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:58,530
because I believe firmly and I think,
I think the pig jetty and interpretation

81
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:02,620
of child development more or less bears 
this out,

82
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:07,621
is that there are parameters within 
which conscience has to operate and that

83
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,000
it's sort of like this.

84
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,350
It's like the same parameters that 
govern fairplay will say that.

85
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,550
And so you can say there's fairplay 
within a game and there's fairplay 

86
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,610
across sets of games and the set of 
games is pretty much indistinguishable 

87
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,050
from the actual environment,
right.

88
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:29,150
If you think about all the things you do
is nested games at,

89
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,860
at some point,
the spread of that is large enough so it

90
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:36,040
encompasses everything you do,
which includes the environment.

91
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,340
And so,
uh,

92
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,710
I believe that you're adapted to the set
of all possible games,

93
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,080
roughly speaking all possible playable 
games,

94
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,670
something like that.
And that,

95
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:46,810
you know,
the rules for that,

96
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:49,180
which is why we talked about this a 
little bit.

97
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:51,220
Why you're so good at identifying 
cheaters,

98
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,610
you have a module for that.
According to the evolutionary 

99
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,861
psychologists send you,
not only do identify the but really 

100
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:02,561
remember them.
It really sticks in your mind and 

101
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,130
there's other evidence to so one piece 
of evidence that I love.

102
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,130
I think it's so well there's a couple.
One I would derive from friends to wall 

103
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,460
who's a famous primatologist and he 
studied.

104
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,700
He studied the prototype morality that 
emerges in chimpanzees and it's very 

105
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:18,770
much rest nested in their dominant 
structures,

106
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:23,771
you know,
because you could think of morality in 

107
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,811
some sense as the understanding of the 
rules by which the dominance hierarchy 

108
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:25,820
operates.
Right?

109
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,800
And so you could say,
well,

110
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:28,760
the biggest,
ugliest,

111
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:33,761
meanest chimp and the male dominance 
hierarchies in chimps seemed to be the 

112
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:37,331
predominant ones.
Although the females also have a 

113
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:37,331
dominance hierarchy in it.
It's not quite so clear in Bonobos,

114
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,590
which seemed to be more female 
dominated.

115
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:42,380
But in any case,
I'm the champ.

116
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,650
Primary chimp dominant structure is male
and you could think,

117
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:50,651
well,
it's like the cave man champion whose 

118
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,160
biggest and toughest to necessarily 
rules and who rules longest,

119
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,070
but that isn't what the wall filed.

120
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,740
See,
the problem with being mean,

121
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,860
let's say,
and not not negotiating your social 

122
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,520
landscape and not trading reciprocal 
favors,

123
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,960
is that no matter how powerful you are 
as an individual to pete,

124
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,020
to individuals,
three quarters of your power can do you 

125
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,171
in,
and that happens with the chimps fairly 

126
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:20,141
regularly.
If the guy on top is to tyrannical and 

127
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,280
doesn't make social connections than 
weaker chimps,

128
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:26,240
males make good social connections and 
when he's not in such good shape,

129
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,700
they take them down and viciously to,
to wall has,

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,270
has documented some unbelievably 
horrendous acts of,

131
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:36,680
let's call it regicide in among the 
chimpanzee troops that he studied mostly

132
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:41,681
in the Arnhem Zoo.
They have a big troop there that's been 

133
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:43,460
there a long time,
but he's very interested in prototypical

134
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:48,461
morality.
And here's some other examples of 

135
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:48,461
prototypical morality emerging among 
animals.

136
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,490
There's many of them,
but one is um,

137
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,000
you know,
have two wolves have a dominance dispute

138
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,040
that again,
that would be more likely among the male

139
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,570
wolves,
but it doesn't really matter.

140
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,440
They basically display their size and 
they grow for all shipley and puff up 

141
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
their hair so they look bigger and you 
know,

142
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,440
you can see cats do that when they're,
they go into fight or flight,

143
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,630
right?
Not only do they puff up including their

144
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:13,631
tail,
but they stand sideways and the reason 

145
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:13,631
they do that is because they look 
bigger,

146
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:18,340
right?
Because they're trying to put out the 

147
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:18,340
most intimidating possible front.
So anyways,

148
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,910
if two wolves are going at it,
they're.

149
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,910
What they're really trying to do is to 
size each other up and they're trying to

150
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:27,380
scare each other into backing off 
fundamentally because see,

151
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,220
the worst case scenario is like your 
world for number one and number two.

152
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,500
And we tear each other to shreds,
but I win,

153
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:38,501
but I'm so damaged after that,
that wolf number three comes in and 

154
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:41,531
takes me out.
So like there's a big cost to be paid 

155
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:42,500
even for victory in a dominance dispute.

156
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,560
If a degenerates into violence and 
animals and human beings,

157
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:48,230
but animals in particular have evolved 
very,

158
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:53,231
very specific mechanisms to escalate 
dominance disputes towards violet by 

159
00:08:55,681 --> 00:09:00,681
step so that they don't so that the 
victor doesn't risk incapacitating 

160
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:04,890
himself by winning.
So what happens with the wolves is that,

161
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,110
you know,
they growl at each other and posture and

162
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,060
display and maybe they even snap at each
other,

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,360
but the probability that they're going 
to get into a full fledged fight is 

164
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,361
pretty low.
And what happens is one of the wolves 

165
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:17,400
backs off and flips over and shows his 
neck.

166
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,920
And that basically means all right,
tear it out.

167
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,050
You know.
And the other wolf says,

168
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,080
of course he doesn't,
while you're kind of an idiot and you're

169
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:30,081
not that strong,
but we might need you to take down a 

170
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:30,081
moose in the future.
And so,

171
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:33,920
you know,
despite your patheticness I won't tear 

172
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:33,920
out your throat.

173
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,740
And then they've established their 
dominant position.

174
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,950
And then from then on,
at least for some substantial period of 

175
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,891
time,
this subordinate wolf gives way to the 

176
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:45,291
dominant wolf.
But at least the subordinate wolf is 

177
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:45,291
alive.
And you know,

178
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:49,071
he might be dominant over other wolves 
and so everyone in the whole hierarchy 

179
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:52,761
is sorted that out through either 
through mark combat or through combat 

180
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:56,901
itself and you know,
the low ranking members aren't in the 

181
00:09:56,901 --> 00:10:00,531
best possible position,
but at least they're not getting their 

182
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:01,110
heads turn off every second of their 
existence.

183
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:05,310
And so there's even some utility in this
stability of the dominance hierarchy for

184
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:09,240
the low ranking members because at least
they're not getting pounded.

185
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,220
They're getting threatened,
which is way better.

186
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:14,250
I mean it's not good,
but it's way better than actual combat.

187
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,220
And then there's the example of rats,
which I love.

188
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:21,000
This is Jaak Panksepp work and he wrote 
a book called affective neuroscience,

189
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,320
would I,
which I would highly,

190
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,280
highly recommend.

191
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,820
I have a list of readings,
recommended readings on my website.

192
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,730
It's a brilliant book and he's a 
brilliant psychologist.

193
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:33,900
Really one of the top top psychologist 
as far as I'm concerned,

194
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,780
both theoretically and experimentally.
A real genius,

195
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:41,781
Huh?
He's the guy who discovered that rats 

196
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:42,240
laugh when you tickle them.
They laugh ultrasonically.

197
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,440
So you can't actually hear them,
but if you record it and slow it down,

198
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,270
then you can hear them giggling away 
when you take a look with an eraser,

199
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,280
which is sort of like their mother's 
tongue.

200
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,180
It's often what lab people use as a 
substitute for the licking of the little

201
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:55,950
wrapped by the mother.
So,

202
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,880
so,
and he discovered the place circuit and 

203
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:01,880
in mammals,
which is like a major deal,

204
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,430
right?
He should get a Nobel prize for that.

205
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:07,431
That's a big deal to discover an entire 
motivational circuit whose existence no 

206
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:09,030
one had really predicted,
you know,

207
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:12,410
apart from the fact that obviously 
mammals play and uh,

208
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,480
even lizards,
maybe some of the more social lizard 

209
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:17,480
seemed to play,
you know,

210
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,650
so anyhow,
but panksepp observed,

211
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,930
I think this is a brilliant piece of 
science,

212
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,520
is that first of all,
juvenile male routes in particular,

213
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,050
like too rough and tumble play.

214
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,830
They like to wrestle and they actually 
pin each other just like little kids do.

215
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:36,831
Or like adult wrestlers do.
They pin their shoulders down and that 

216
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,110
basically means you win.
And so,

217
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,520
okay.
So that's pretty cool.

218
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:41,670
But what's even cooler,
I think while there's three things,

219
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:46,671
one is the rats will work for an 
opportunity to get into an arena where 

220
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:50,130
they know that play might occur,
and so that's one of the scientific ways

221
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:52,050
of testing in animals motivation,
right?

222
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:57,051
So imagine you have a starving route and
it knows that it's got food down the end

223
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,640
of a corridor.
You can put a little spring on its tail 

224
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,860
and measure how hard it pulls and that 
gives you an indication of it's 

225
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,771
motivational force.
Now imagine the starving rat that's 

226
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:11,221
trying to get to some food and you have 
a little spring on his tail and you 

227
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:11,221
walked in some cat odor.

228
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,560
So now that route is starving and wants 
to get out of there.

229
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,270
He's going to try to pull even farther 
towards the food.

230
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:21,130
So getting away plus getting forward are
separate motivational systems and if you

231
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:23,470
can add them together,
it's real potent.

232
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,920
And part of the reason why in the future
authoring exercise that you guys are 

233
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,851
going to do as the class progresses,
you're asked to outline the place you'd 

234
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,490
like to end up,
which is your desired future,

235
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:38,491
and also the place that you could end up
if you let everything fall apart is so 

236
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:43,291
that your anxiety chases you and your 
approach systems pull you forward.

237
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,370
You're maximally motivated,
dead,

238
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,670
and it's important because otherwise you
can be afraid of pursuing the things 

239
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,550
that you want to pursue.
Right?

240
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,420
And that's very common.
And so then the fear inhibits you as the

241
00:12:55,421 --> 00:13:00,421
promise pulls you forward,
but it makes you weak because you're 

242
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:00,421
afraid.

243
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:01,180
You want to get your fear behind you,
pushing you.

244
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,450
And so what you want to be as afraid,
more afraid of not pursuing your goals 

245
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,020
than you are of pursuing them.
It's very,

246
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,020
very helpful.
And lots of times in life,

247
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:12,640
and this is something really worth 
knowing,

248
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:18,150
you know,
and this is one of the advantages to 

249
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,880
being an autonomous adult,
is you don't get to pick the best thing.

250
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:23,881
You get to pick your poison.
You have two bad choices and you get to 

251
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:27,631
pick which one you're willing to suffer 
through and every choice has a bit of 

252
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:28,570
that element in it,
and so if you know that,

253
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:32,230
it's really freeing because otherwise 
you torture yourself by thinking,

254
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:35,140
well,
maybe there's a good solution to this.

255
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,730
You know,
compared to the bad solution.

256
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:37,220
It's like,
Nah,

257
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:39,580
Nah.
Sometimes there's just risky solution,

258
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:44,581
one and risky solution to and sometimes 
both of them are really bad,

259
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,950
but you at least get to pick which one 
you're willing to suffer through and 

260
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:49,950
that's.

261
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,390
That actually makes quite a bit of 
difference because you're also facing it

262
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:57,160
voluntarily then instead of chasing you,
and that is an entire different entirely

263
00:13:57,161 --> 00:14:01,060
different psychophysiological response.
Challenge versus threat.

264
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,300
It's not the same.
Even if the magnitude of the problem is 

265
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,631
the same,
and so putting yourself in a 

266
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:09,631
challenging,
let's call it mind frame.

267
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:13,530
You can't just do that by magic.
Putting yourself in a challenging 

268
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,820
mindframe is much,
much easier on you cycle physiologically

269
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,640
because you don't produce.
You don't go into the generalized stress

270
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:23,641
response to the same degree and you're 
activating your exploratory and seeking 

271
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:26,800
systems which are dopaminergic mediated 
and that involved positive emotion.

272
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,420
So if you can face something voluntarily
rather than having to chase you,

273
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,090
it's way better for you cycle 
physiologically.

274
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,970
So that's partly why.
Well,

275
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:41,971
it's worthwhile to go find the dragon in
its layer instead of waiting for it to 

276
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:41,980
come and eat you.

277
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,520
So and especially when you also add the 
idea that if you go find the dragon in 

278
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,511
it's layer,
you might find it when it's a baby 

279
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:53,941
instead of a full fledged bloody monster
that is definitely going to take you 

280
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:55,430
down.
And so that's part of the reason why.

281
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,770
Well,
there's a whole bunch of things that,

282
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,560
that,
that emerge out of that observation,

283
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,860
like don't avoid small problems that you
know,

284
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:08,861
are there,
face them because they'll grow into big 

285
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:10,010
problems all by themselves.
And you can think about,

286
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,980
imagine the Tax Department sends you a 
notification.

287
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,100
You owe them like $300.
Well it's,

288
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,840
you know,
that's annoying.

289
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,720
Maybe you don't even want to open the 
letter or maybe if you do,

290
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:25,721
you just put it on the shelf,
but that damn thing doesn't just sit 

291
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:25,721
there like a piece of paper on the 
shelf,

292
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:28,100
right?
You ignore that for five or six years.

293
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,310
It's going to be come attached to all 
sorts of horrible things and if you 

294
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:33,740
ignore it long enough,
you get the idea,

295
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,760
it's going to turn into something that 
is completely unlike the little piece of

296
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:42,290
paper that it's written on and and many,
many problems in life are like that.

297
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:47,291
You'll see they'll,
you'll see that they popped their ugly 

298
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,620
little head up and you know,
and you might want to turn away,

299
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,440
might not want not want to think about 
it,

300
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,390
which is the easiest way of turning 
away,

301
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:54,890
right?
You just don't attend to it.

302
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,110
It's not like you repress it or anything
like that.

303
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,440
You just failed to attend to it and 
that's a really as a longterm strategy.

304
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:07,691
It's dismal.
It's also something that I think that's 

305
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:10,361
more characteristic of people who are 
high in neuroticism and high in 

306
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:11,750
agreeableness.
Agreeable people don't like conflict and

307
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,990
people who were high in neuroticism,
we were high negative emotion are hit 

308
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,200
harder per unit of uncertainty or 
threat,

309
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,010
and so you know,
that's partly why in psychotherapy,

310
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:24,710
a lot of times the people you see need 
assertiveness training,

311
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:29,711
so that would be the opposite of 
agreeableness or they need to help get 

312
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:30,590
their anxiety and emotional pain under 
control.

313
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,210
It's.
Those are not the only reasons.

314
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:35,030
There's antisocial behavior,
but you can't fix that in therapy.

315
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,800
In all likelihood.
There's alcoholism,

316
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,860
there's lots and lots of other reasons,
but those are two major reasons.

317
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,580
So anyways,
there is a that was all to tell you 

318
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:45,580
that.
Oh yes,

319
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,700
back to the rat.
So okay.

320
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:51,701
The rats are pulling on.
You can measure rat motivation by how 

321
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:52,550
hard they pull on this on the spring,
let's say,

322
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,300
and they're more motivated if they're 
running away and running towards,

323
00:16:56,301 --> 00:17:01,301
but let's go back to play.
So you can take juvenile routes who 

324
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:04,511
haven't been able to play for a while.
Maybe they've been isolated or maybe 

325
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,901
they just haven't been able to engage in
physical activity like many school 

326
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,470
children that you might be thinking 
about,

327
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,930
um,
neither allowed to play nor allowed to 

328
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,261
engage in physical activity.
And there's a reason I'm telling you 

329
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:17,261
that.

330
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:17,420
So anyways,
you get one of these little rats and you

331
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,460
can measure all hardy wants,
how hard it,

332
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,250
he'll pull the go out and play or how 
many buttons he'll push,

333
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,280
you know,
and that gives you an indication of his 

334
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,280
motivation.
So anyways,

335
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,230
you can see that the play deprived 
juvenile route will fight harder to play

336
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:35,231
than a non play deprived juvenile rat.
And so you can infer that the rat wants 

337
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:39,020
to go play and uh,
you know,

338
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:44,021
you do that,
you do the same measurement with 

339
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,021
everyone around you.
If they want to do something,

340
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,610
you're going to poke and prod out them 
to see what sort of things they're 

341
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,010
willing to overcome in order to go and 
do.

342
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,480
You'll object even if you don't really 
object.

343
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:56,481
It's like it's a measurement device.
And if they're willing to overcome a 

344
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:57,120
bunch of your objections,
then you think,

345
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,650
oh well maybe they really want to.

346
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,400
And that's another thing to really know 
if there's something you want,

347
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,600
you need about five arguments about why 
you wanted,

348
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,900
because the probability that the person 
who is opposing you will have five 

349
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,690
arguments about why you shouldn't have 
it,

350
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:17,691
is very low.
They just won't have thought it through 

351
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:19,821
enough.
So the other thing that happens in the 

352
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:22,041
future authoring exercises that you're 
asked to articulate the reasons for all 

353
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,600
the goals that come out of your vision 
of the future.

354
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,880
So you're asked like why would it be 
good for you?

355
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Why would it be good for your family?
Why would it be good for broader 

356
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,791
society?
And so that gives you the three levels 

357
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,580
of argumentation right there.
And if you have it articulated down into

358
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,190
detail and it's related to other 
important goals,

359
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,520
then you're,
you're a hell of a thing to argue with 

360
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:43,520
because people just aren't that deep.

361
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,470
By which I mean they just don't have 
that many levels of explanation or 

362
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,000
objection.
And it's also really useful in 

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,221
relationship to your own mind because if
you want to do something that's 

364
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:58,251
difficult and that requires energy,
a lot of different subsystems in your 

365
00:18:58,251 --> 00:18:59,130
mind,
you're going to throw up objections.

366
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:00,050
It's like,
well,

367
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,710
maybe that isn't what you should be 
doing right now.

368
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:06,711
Maybe you should be doing the dishes or 
vacuuming or watching TV or looking at 

369
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:07,890
youtube,
or if you're really sneaky,

370
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,730
when you're trying to do something hard,
what your brain does is give you 

371
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,461
something else hard to do that's not 
quite as hard so that you can feel 

372
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:19,461
justified in not doing the thing you're 
supposed to because you're doing 

373
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:20,370
something else useful.
And if you give into that temptation,

374
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:23,580
which you often will,
then it winds and because it winds,

375
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:26,010
it gets a little dopamine kick and it 
grows stronger.

376
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,640
Every anything you let when the internal
argument grows and anything you let be 

377
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:35,040
defeated,
shrinks because it's punished.

378
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,250
It doesn't get to have its way.
So that's another thing really to 

379
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,761
remember.
Don't practice what you do not want to 

380
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,420
become.
And because those are their neurological

381
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,040
circuits,
you build those things in there.

382
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:47,810
Man,
they're,

383
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,940
they're not going anywhere.
You can build another little machine to 

384
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,010
inhibit them.
That's the best you can do.

385
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,470
Once they're in there,
you can't get them out.

386
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,920
So.
And then the ones you build to inhibit 

387
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,320
can be taken out by stress and the old 
habits will come back up.

388
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,320
So you gotta be careful what you say and
what you do because you,

389
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,430
you build yourself that way.
So anyways,

390
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:09,540
back to the rats.
Okay?

391
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,360
So the little rat gets to go out there 
and play.

392
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,280
Now imagine one little rat is paired 
with another route,

393
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,170
but the little other little route is 10 
percent.

394
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:21,170
Finger can percent in juvenile rats is 
enough to obtain permanent dominant.

395
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:26,460
So that 10 percent bigger wrap will win 
the first wrestling contest.

396
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,170
Okay?
And so that's what happens.

397
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,040
And then the.
So the little route gets pinned and 

398
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,040
maybe they play a bit and then they're 
done with it.

399
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,331
And so you separate them,
then you let them play again and the 

400
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:41,001
next time what happens is that the 
subordinate rat does the invitation to 

401
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,230
play and that's like,
you know,

402
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:47,231
like a dog does when it wants to play.
You can recognize that kind of displays 

403
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,110
its feet apart and it up and looks 
interested in sort of dances around.

404
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:52,570
And you can do with any kid that has a 
clue,

405
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:55,450
you know,
that hasn't been destroyed by adults.

406
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,480
If you little three year old kid or four
year olds are better for this.

407
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:03,481
If you go like this,
they know exactly what's going to 

408
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:06,061
happen,
you know they're ready to dart back and 

409
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,600
forth and they'll usually smile and,
and kids love rough and tumble play,

410
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,290
which is now basically illegal in all 
daycares.

411
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,520
It seriously,
it seriously is it.

412
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Kids need it so desperately because it 
teaches them the limits of their body 

413
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,200
and your body and it teaches them what's
painful and what isn't.

414
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,410
And it teaches them the dance of play.
And without that they're just little 

415
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,910
disembodied blobs like they have no 
finance.

416
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,380
What?
That's what you're checking out when you

417
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,560
dance with someone you know you're 
seeing if they have that,

418
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,950
that fluency and facility for mutual 
reciprocal action in embodied in them,

419
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:43,141
and if they're kind of like this,
you know and just have no sense of 

420
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,590
rhythm and don't pay any attention to 
you and all of that.

421
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,800
You have reason to question whether they
actually inhabit their body and whether 

422
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,590
they can engage in a mutual interaction,
the physical interaction that's going to

423
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:58,540
be reciprocal and mutually satisfying.
It's really important to check out and a

424
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,160
lot of that rough and tumble play.

425
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,950
Even interactions between a child and 
it's mother.

426
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,250
If you have a happy mother and unhappy 
infant and you videotape them and you 

427
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,360
speed up the video tape,
you'll see that they're dancing.

428
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,840
So one response than the other response 
than the other responds.

429
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:16,750
It might just be with eye-gaze and 
movement and all of that,

430
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:20,830
but there's a dynamic interplay which 
you don't see with depressed mothers and

431
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:23,500
their infants.
So okay,

432
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:28,501
so back to play.
So the little rat who got is the 

433
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:29,350
subordinate one.
He has to do the invitation and then the

434
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:33,610
big rat can allow agreed to play because
he's in the dominant position,

435
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,290
but if you pair them repeatedly,
and this is really we're thinking about,

436
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:43,291
because see,
morality emerges out of repeated 

437
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:43,960
interactions because you might say,
well,

438
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,760
if you're only interact with someone 
wants,

439
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:48,220
he might as well just take advantage of 
them and run off.

440
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,320
That's what a psychopath does by the 
way.

441
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:55,530
And there is,
there is room in an environmental niche 

442
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,611
for psychopaths,
but they have to keep moving around 

443
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,220
because otherwise people figure out who 
they are so they just move around and 

444
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,350
they can take advantage of one person,
you know,

445
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:04,390
maybe five times or 10 times or 
something,

446
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,780
and then the reputation spreads and they
gotta get the hell out of there.

447
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:12,550
But so it's not a good longterm strategy
unless you can't think of a better one.

448
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,130
So anyways,
if you repeatedly pair these routes,

449
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,460
unless the big rat lets the little rat 
win,

450
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,820
at least 30 percent of the time,
the little rat will not ask the big rat 

451
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,880
to play.
And that is,

452
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:30,290
it's a staggering discovery.
It's a staggering discovery because 

453
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,691
you've got the emergence there of a of a
implicit morality essentially that's 

454
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:37,300
even incarnated in rats that emerges 
across multiple play sessions.

455
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,500
It's like,
yes,

456
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,590
exactly.
That's exactly what Piaget said about 

457
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,141
the emergence of morality.
It's exactly the same idea at the right 

458
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:46,141
level,
so it's.

459
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:48,920
It's a massively and the fact that 
there's a circuit,

460
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:53,921
a separate neurophysiological circuit 
that's actually specialized for that 

461
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:55,220
sort of thing is also a big deal.
Now,

462
00:23:55,221 --> 00:24:00,221
the other thing banks have figured out 
is that if you deprive juvenile rats 

463
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,660
have the opportunity to engage in rough 
and tumble play,

464
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,810
their prefrontal cortex is don't develop
properly and they become impulsive and 

465
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,071
restless and then you can fix them with 
methylphenidate or Ritalin and those are

466
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,310
the drugs that are used to fix 
hyperactive kids,

467
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,860
most of whom are male,
and that's because,

468
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:21,560
well really you're going to take your 
six year old,

469
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,480
your five year old,
you know,

470
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,540
put them in a desk.
You're going to get them to sit there 

471
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:28,540
for six hours.

472
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:28,580
That's your plan,
right?

473
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,760
That's a stupid plan and there they are,
denied the opportunity to engage in play

474
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,500
and that means that their ability to 
become social is being impaired.

475
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,740
It may cause neurological impairment.
That's what the evidence suggests and 

476
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,881
then you suppress that within fed means 
because amphetamines actually don't 

477
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:53,230
activate the play circuit.
They activate a different circuit which 

478
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,920
will suppress the place.
So it's very,

479
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:59,921
very.
It's not very wise and I'm not going to 

480
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:02,801
go off on that tangent because I 
couldn't tell you why this school 

481
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,101
systems were set up that way,
which I probably will at some point 

482
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:08,420
because it's quite an interesting story 
in and of itself and it's the reason all

483
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:13,020
you guys are sitting in desks right now.
Somebody laughingly referred to this one

484
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:18,021
says Grade Fifteen,
which I thought was pretty funny given 

485
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:18,021
the look at the bloody place,
you know,

486
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,520
a hideous and so now this is an 
interesting thing.

487
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,530
So you've got the emergence of morality 
and say,

488
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:29,300
chimps,
you've got the emergence of morality and

489
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:34,301
wolves.
He got the emergence of morality and 

490
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:36,161
rats and the morality governs sequential
interactions or group interactions.

491
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:41,591
They have to repeat because.
Because it's an emergent property of 

492
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:44,960
social or repetitive interactions and 
that's why you can't just localize it in

493
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:49,961
one instance to repeat it and uh,
there's been computer simulations of 

494
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:54,731
this too,
to help you figure out how you might 

495
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,681
attain victory across games across time.
Maybe you need a strategy and that 

496
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,460
there's a very simple strategy which I 
believe is called modified tit for tat.

497
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:06,461
So if you're nice to me,
I'm nice back and if you do something 

498
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:06,461
bad to me,
I do something bad back.

499
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:11,140
But,
but imagine you run that out in 

500
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,010
sequences of a behavior and see who who 
does best with what strategy across time

501
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,480
or an alternative strategy.

502
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,910
Here's the best strategy.
I trust you.

503
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,430
You Trust me,
we start interacting,

504
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,550
you screw up,
I whack you and then I forgive you.

505
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:25,220
And we started getting that's modified,
tit for tat.

506
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,650
And so,
and there hasn't been an issue.

507
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,680
It's a very simple algorithm.
No one has come up with a better 

508
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:32,680
algorithm in computer game,
in,

509
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,050
in the computerized simulation of game 
space that not particular strategy.

510
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:41,051
So it's like trust,
but don't be a pushover if someone 

511
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:41,690
violates the rules,
you've got to nail them,

512
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,960
but then you don't hold grudge.
He opened the door to further 

513
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,520
interactions.
So pretty smart,

514
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,670
pretty smart and okay.
So anyways,

515
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,640
so what this means,
because rats can't talk,

516
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,760
can't talk and chimpanzees can't talk.
And what that means,

517
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,540
just as piaget suggested,
was that the morality,

518
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:05,541
the development of the morality precedes
the development of the linguistic 

519
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,600
ability to describe the rules for the 
morality.

520
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,520
He said exactly the same thing about 
kids,

521
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:13,521
right?
As they learn how to play games before 

522
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:15,951
they know how,
what the rules are to the games and so 

523
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:19,251
you see that with your playing peekaboo 
with a kid who they can pick that up 

524
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:20,730
like really young to get that right away
and there's.

525
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You can play with kids almost 
immediately after they're born if you 

526
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,031
play simple enough games and so they've 
got that deep and they're unbelievably 

527
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:32,811
playful.
So they've got that circuitry ready to 

528
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:37,041
go right off the bat.
And it's one of the things that makes 

529
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:37,320
kids so much fun because they just liked
to play all the time.

530
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,390
And so if you're,
if the play circuit and you hasn't died,

531
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,570
which is a bad thing,
then you can use that a lot with your 

532
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,691
kids.
And it's one of the things that helps 

533
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:50,691
you love them.

534
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:50,691
So that's a good thing.
So okay,

535
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,700
so the point is that the dam morality 
emerges before the representation of the

536
00:27:57,361 --> 00:28:00,530
morality.
It's a big deal to know that and that it

537
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:03,480
emerges as a consequence of repeated 
social interaction.

538
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,020
So it's not a top down thing.
It's a bottom up thing.

539
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,940
Now with Piaget says,
well,

540
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:13,941
it's not just bottom up because what 
happens with human beings is that they 

541
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:17,511
learn to play the games.
His one of his experiments was watched 

542
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:19,170
seven year olds,
I think that's the right age,

543
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,800
play marbles.
And then you notice that they can play 

544
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,260
with each other and that they can follow
the rules.

545
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:30,261
But then if you take the individual 
seven year olds out of the game and you 

546
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:30,261
say,
what are the rules?

547
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:33,270
They give incoherent and incomplete 
explanations of the rules,

548
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,930
so what that means is they've it don't 
really represent the rules,

549
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:40,740
but they can act them out and they have 
a partial representation of what they're

550
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:41,400
acting out.

551
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:46,730
Now when they get older,
the rural representation starts to fall 

552
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,211
into alignment with the actual rules of 
the game and you can imagine that's why 

553
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:51,060
because when they're playing something 
like marbles,

554
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:52,710
they're going to have discussions like 
your treat,

555
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:57,711
your cheating or you're not allowed to 
do that because they're always going to 

556
00:28:57,711 --> 00:29:01,101
be pushing the envelope a little bit and
then the group is going to render a 

557
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:02,820
judgment on whether or not that's 
appropriate and out of that,

558
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:07,821
the rules are going to emerge,
but they're not rules to begin with 

559
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:09,720
their patterns of behavior.
It's not the same thing as a rule.

560
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,470
A rule describes a pattern of behavior,
but a pattern of behavior.

561
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:15,840
He has a pattern of behavior.
It's something that's acted out,

562
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,410
so there's the individual within the 
group and then the interactions of the 

563
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,301
individuals within the groups produces a
hierarchical arrangement or multiple 

564
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:26,400
hierarchical arrangements.

565
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,580
Those are games,
roughly speaking or stories nested 

566
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,150
inside an overarching story,
which is the fundamental culture,

567
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,600
right?
And then that's nested in a whole bunch 

568
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,341
of competing cultures that have some 
commonalities or they would just be at 

569
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:41,530
war all the time,
which you know,

570
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,180
to some degree they are.
So now you see that back to the movie,

571
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:51,970
you see that happening in this movie.
I mean it's very,

572
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:53,900
very quick.
But the,

573
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,950
the um,
the blue fairy terns the bug into the 

574
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,981
conscience and then the bug tries to 
explain to Pinocchio what the rules of 

575
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:06,181
morality are.
But the thing is the bug doesn't know 

576
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:06,181
because he's just a bug and you know,
he,

577
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,460
he's,
he's just not omniscient.

578
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,410
So the best he can do is to come up with
like a propaganda stick,

579
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,800
semantic verbal representation that's 
internally contradictory.

580
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:22,531
And when he tells Pinocchio,
Pinocchio has no idea what he's talking 

581
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:22,531
about and neither does the bug.

582
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:24,130
That's the thing.
And so,

583
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,720
well,
so what happens is this,

584
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:28,540
that the cricket says,
well pinnock maybe you and I had better,

585
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:32,050
have a little heart to heart talk and a 
puppet says y.

586
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,770
and the cricket says,
well you want to be a real boy,

587
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,440
don't you?
Alright,

588
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,570
sit down son.
Now you see the world is full of 

589
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:42,730
temptations.
Temptations,

590
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,470
yes.
Temptations.

591
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,230
There the wrong things that seem right 
at the time.

592
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,980
But even though the right things may 
seem wrong sometimes,

593
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,100
sometimes the,
the wrong things maybe right at the 

594
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,810
wrong time or vice versa,
understand.

595
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,080
No,
no.

596
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,550
And needed to cricket and,
and,

597
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,560
and that's actually very nicely done in 
that piece of the movie because as soon 

598
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,990
as you just want to slap him as soon as 
he starts talking like that,

599
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:15,991
because while he gets up on his little 
matchbox and lectures and he's dull and 

600
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:16,990
tyrannical both at the same time.

601
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,840
And so there's nothing genuine about 
what he's saying.

602
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,140
He's sort of imitating.
He's imitating something that isn't him.

603
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:25,600
So he's really acting like a puppet at 
that point too.

604
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,480
And it doesn't work at all.
And so Pinocchio says,

605
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,120
I'm going to try to be a good boy.
And the cricket says,

606
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:33,820
well that's,
that's the spirit son.

607
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,030
And then away they go.
So all right,

608
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:41,200
so then we're at the next day because 
this all happens in one night.

609
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:46,201
We're at the next day and you know,
it's a nice day and there's these birds 

610
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:46,201
flying around.
That's actually,

611
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,130
that's a bit of foreshadowing there.
You know,

612
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,640
so I'm not really.
You have to remember when you watch 

613
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,541
something like this movie,
not a single bit of it is random or 

614
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:01,321
accidental.
None of it because you know they had to 

615
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:04,531
draw.
I don't remember how many frames per 

616
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:04,531
second these things are 30.

617
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:04,750
Maybe.
Maybe it's a little less than that,

618
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:09,751
but it's high quality automation and so 
someone had to paint 30 pictures to get 

619
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:12,340
a second of this.
You're not doing that accidentally.

620
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:17,341
It's really expensive and everyone has 
to agree on exactly what's going to 

621
00:32:17,341 --> 00:32:17,410
happen.
And you might say,

622
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:21,130
well do the people who are doing this 
consciously know what they're doing?

623
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:22,530
And the answer to that is,
well,

624
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,420
sort of just like you do you know it's 
yes,

625
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,250
they no,
no they don't.

626
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,670
And they know because they're really 
smart and gifted and all that,

627
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:32,980
but they don't know because it's not all
articulated.

628
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:37,981
Plus,
they're working in a group so they know 

629
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:41,191
and don't know just like you do when 
you're watching it and so and when you 

630
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:44,891
do anything else,
so now they're also guided by what you 

631
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:48,671
might call they're guided by their 
unconscious in the in the Freudian and 

632
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:53,460
in the cognitive way,
partly because your unconscious value 

633
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,221
structures determine the direction and 
content of your perceptions and so it's 

634
00:32:57,221 --> 00:33:01,271
built right into the way you move your 
eyes because you tend to look at things 

635
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,930
you value right or things you're afraid 
of,

636
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:07,931
like you look at things with valence and
part of the decision about what has 

637
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:10,910
value is dependent on the implicit 
structure of your moral system,

638
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:15,911
your purse,
because morality is about what's good 

639
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,981
and what isn't,
and that's been partly a conscious 

640
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:18,350
construction of you,
but it's partly something you've been.

641
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:23,550
You've picked up by interacting with 
people like mad ever since you were 

642
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,411
born.
You don't know all the rules anymore 

643
00:33:26,411 --> 00:33:28,750
than the damn cricket did.
You just don't and you can't because 

644
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,561
you're too complicated,
but you act them out and then you also 

645
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:36,800
have representations of how people act 
in your imagination.

646
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,300
Dreams are.
That's what a dream is.

647
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:41,120
That's what a fantasy is.
That's what that little movie that plays

648
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,520
inside your head when you remember what 
you did is,

649
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,730
and you only remember the just you know,
so even the the images stick 

650
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,570
representation of your behavior in your 
past,

651
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:55,571
which is basically your episodic memory.
It's already selecting and molding and 

652
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:59,750
turning it into a relatable story.
It can't help but do that.

653
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,740
It's the only way you can represent it 
and so you don't know how you do that or

654
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:08,741
why you do that,
but part of it's governed by this 

655
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:09,920
implicit morality that's part of your 
procedural memory system.

656
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,920
Part of the way you act and part of the 
way you move your eyes and listen to 

657
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,041
things and focus on them and that's all 
been instantiated inside of you because 

658
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,190
of this immense social,
your biology,

659
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:24,191
but also this immense social project 
that you're continually engaged in and 

660
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:27,110
so that informs what you remembered.
It informs what you imagined.

661
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:32,350
It informs what we collectively imagine.
It informs what we can collectively 

662
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,520
understand and partly what you're doing 
well,

663
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:39,521
you become conscious of yourself is to 
map the implicit structures that already

664
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:45,560
constitute you from society into 
explicit representation.

665
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,800
That's what self understanding means and
you know when you have that moment of 

666
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,431
insight about something you've done,
it's like you're watching your this 

667
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:58,061
repetitive behavior that you've 
manifested probably that got you in 

668
00:34:58,061 --> 00:34:58,310
trouble.
You know it's your characteristic way of

669
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,840
falling accidentally into chaos and you 
talk about your problems.

670
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,840
You talk about them with your friends,
you talk about them and maybe you have 

671
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,781
dreams about them and you're,
you're trying to relate them and you 

672
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:13,211
have memories about them that you can't 
get rid of because they're negatively 

673
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,911
tones.
So you talk about them and then someone 

674
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:16,220
comes up with a little statement that 
links them together,

675
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:19,250
causley and he thank God that's what I'm
doing.

676
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,740
And then maybe you can stop doing it or 
at least,

677
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:27,050
or at least maybe.
Then you can think of some strategies 

678
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,680
for not doing it anymore,
but it's not like,

679
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:30,230
you know,
it's like you're acting it out,

680
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,560
you know it that way,
but until that's until the 

681
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,671
representation matches that pattern,
that click of insight doesn't occur and 

682
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:42,600
that's like a revelation.
It's a really good way of thinking about

683
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:47,601
it because the knowledge is there and 
it's implicit forum and all of a sudden 

684
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:47,610
bang.

685
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:51,690
It's been made explicit as a fantasy 
maybe or also as a,

686
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,450
as a set of semantic statements.
You know,

687
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,660
maybe you're,
you have a crush on someone and you 

688
00:35:59,660 --> 00:35:59,850
don't notice it and maybe you find 
yourself having a fantasy about him.

689
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:00,540
You Think,
oh,

690
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,140
that means something that indicates 
something.

691
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,990
Maybe you don't want to know that that's
what you want.

692
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,030
But the fantasy will tell you.
And one of the things you suggested,

693
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,870
and this is sort of out of the Freudian 
tradition of free associations,

694
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:20,871
is watch yourself.
Watch your fantasies because they're 

695
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:22,320
always happening and so,
and they'll tell you something.

696
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,580
And so one of the things I do when when 
I'm interacting with my clients is we'll

697
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:31,581
have a discussion and then they'll let 
their eyes will drift a little bit and 

698
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:35,181
I'll know that there,
that something's flitted through their 

699
00:36:35,181 --> 00:36:35,181
mind,
you know,

700
00:36:35,181 --> 00:36:37,050
and that means we've touched on 
something that has multiple,

701
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,460
a multiplicity of elements.

702
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,600
And so I'll stop and say,
look,

703
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:44,601
I noticed that you maybe you tear it up.
That's another thing to really watch 

704
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:45,840
her.
Maybe you laugh or you drifted.

705
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:50,841
At least it's like it's because some 
other thought has entered your field of 

706
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:54,081
consciousness.
And then if you can get the person to 

707
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:54,081
grab those thoughts,
to notice them,

708
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:59,060
then you can often figure out the 
avenues along which that particular 

709
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,870
conversation might unfold.
That's a complex,

710
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:03,510
that's a union complex or a 
psychoanalytic complex.

711
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:08,511
It's like there's an emotional core that
produces a whole range of associated 

712
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:12,981
ideas and that thing's got a life.
It's like a micro personality and it 

713
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,310
might have resentment and it might have 
anger.

714
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,610
It's often negative emotion tinge 
because the negative emotion tinge 

715
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:25,010
episodes are still problems and they 
will emerge automatically because your 

716
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,211
threat detection systems force them onto
your consciousness essentially so you 

717
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:34,311
watch and where when you drift you will 
drift and the fantasy is partly a 

718
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:36,330
representation of the problem space.

719
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,600
You know that happens when you wake up 
at three in the morning and you're 

720
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:41,600
worried about things,
right?

721
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,560
Because actually what happens is you 
wake up during threat processing and if 

722
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,520
you're depressed actually that gets so 
intense you can't sleep,

723
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,470
so then you just lay there all night 
worrying,

724
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,770
not fun,
and those are fantasies about the 

725
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,140
negative elements of your past,
present and future,

726
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,290
and the fantasies can also breed 
solutions.

727
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,990
And that's partly why Freud regarding 
dreams as wish fulfillment.

728
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,020
It's partly that and he wasn't.
That was where he stopped.

729
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,940
It's not correct.
It,

730
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:14,150
it's partially correct.
It's like the fantasy will provide you 

731
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,961
with a problem and a potential solution,
but they're more like problem 

732
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:22,131
identification mechanisms.
The fantasies with the possibility of a 

733
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,280
solution built in.
And so a way of thinking about that is 

734
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,281
that you can generate potential futures,
so they're like each segregated 

735
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,250
environments according to the rules of 
your fantasy.

736
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,430
Then you can generate little avatars of 
yourself that didn't have at each of 

737
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,401
those little universes and you can run 
them as simulations and then you can 

738
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:46,600
watch what happens in the simulation and
if it's a catastrophe,

739
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:50,290
then you don't have to act it out.
And that's exactly not exactly.

740
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,230
That's akin to what you're doing when 
you go watch a movie,

741
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:56,800
except that is much more coherent and 
well thought through.

742
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,120
And then just a dream which is often 
quite fragmentary.

743
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:06,121
And that's partly because of the dream 
is willing to sacrifice coherence to 

744
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:08,650
play with category structures,
you know?

745
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:11,290
And that's why in dreams things can 
change from one thing into another.

746
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:15,550
Really weirdly or scenes can change from
one scene to another without a logic.

747
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,760
The logic gets loosened so that the 
experience of your thinking can widen 

748
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,350
and it's,
it's not.

749
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,680
It's dangerous to do that.

750
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,080
And that's partly why you do it.
When you're asleep and paralyzed,

751
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,060
you don't run around and act out your,
your suit,

752
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:36,110
a puddle fantasies,
you know where you're stretching 

753
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:36,110
yourself out into the world.
There is no risk.

754
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:39,190
Exactly and so although it can be bad 
enough so you'll wake up in terror,

755
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:44,210
you know,
but that's better than being in a 

756
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,210
crocodile's mouth by a large margin.
Anyways,

757
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,820
back to these,
these birds,

758
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:50,200
these are used later in the movie as a 
manifestations of the holy spirit,

759
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:55,230
roughly speaking,
and of course that's a standard 

760
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,230
Christian symbol.
Although as I mentioned,

761
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,551
the dove often represents the holy 
spirit and we'll talk about that later,

762
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:04,120
but this movie has very strong pagan 
elements in it,

763
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:09,121
as I mentioned before,
as opposed to a strictly Christian 

764
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:09,210
symbolism.
But,

765
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,910
but that's a foreshadowing.
And what it foreshadows is that while a 

766
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,821
new day has dawned,
it's the emergence of new consciousness 

767
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:19,300
and everything last night went well 
really well.

768
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,730
Everything in the,
let's call it the unconscious say,

769
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:24,760
after time stops,
that all went well and so the new day is

770
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:28,000
full of promise and so the birds are 
singing in,

771
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:32,920
the sun is shining and like hooray.
And so that's exactly so that sets.

772
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,540
This is the next scene,
right?

773
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:38,230
So it sets the tenor for that scene just
like the introductory song does.

774
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,450
So.
So anyways.

775
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:45,451
Then you see all these kids playing and 
enthusiastic so they're off to school 

776
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:49,800
which is presented in a positive light 
and so that's where you get socialized 

777
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,020
is Pinocchio is ready to go beyond the 
boundaries of the familial home and he's

778
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:59,791
ready because his father prepared amend 
because his mother prepared and so he 

779
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,890
goes off and he's not going off alone.
He's going with his conscience and which

780
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:07,891
is sort of the Internet.
You could think about it again as the 

781
00:41:07,891 --> 00:41:09,931
internalized representation of nature 
and society and so he's not going out 

782
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:11,440
there alone even though he's not very 
good at it.

783
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,460
And he's pretty excited about this.
And so is Japan.

784
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,680
See Japan is standing there paralyzed 
with terror and the kid isn't phobic of 

785
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,750
the outside world and so that's,
he's,

786
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,190
he's right.
He's treating it as an adventure.

787
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,240
I mean,
even though,

788
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,150
well,
it's an adventure,

789
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,970
but adventure's can be dangerous.
What if the other,

790
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,060
you can imagine a kid,
especially one who's like high in 

791
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,461
neuroticism,
who hasn't been encouraged sufficiently 

792
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:42,260
to overcome that?
Let's say their primary idea might be,

793
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:43,940
well,
what if the other kids don't like me?

794
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,160
That's a big one.
What if the teachers don't like me?

795
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:47,630
What if the other kids won't play with 
me?

796
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,490
It's like,
yeah,

797
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,240
what if that's rough man?
And if,

798
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,160
if you're not a playful kid,
it could easily be the case.

799
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,410
So,
but that's not Pinocchio.

800
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:59,510
He's like spinning out,
ready to go.

801
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,740
And so good.
Good.

802
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,910
He's got naive but enthusiastic.
Okay,

803
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:06,560
well that at least gets the ball 
rolling.

804
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,070
Now you've got these two evil creatures 
here,

805
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,540
the Fox and the cat.
Um,

806
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,110
I think this one's based on one of the 
Marx brothers,

807
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:17,840
actually Harpo Marx,
who I believe never said anything,

808
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,170
but be that as it may.
There are these Ne'er do well 

809
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:23,170
characters,
um,

810
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,610
the Fox in particular,
now fox is a standard trickster animal,

811
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,390
right?
It's a,

812
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,670
it's a,
it's,

813
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,740
it's,
it's a classic animal.

814
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:33,950
Maybe because it's good at hiding and 
it's good at hunting.

815
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,920
I don't know exactly why,
but it's,

816
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,710
and coyotes are like that too.
They're classic trickster animals.

817
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,530
Um,
he's Kinda like Wiley Coyote,

818
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:43,370
in fact,
you know,

819
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:44,060
the,
the,

820
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:49,150
the warner brothers character whose 
genius at large and of course whose 

821
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,870
arrogance continually gets him walloped 
and this character has a lot of features

822
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:54,680
like that,
but he,

823
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,690
he's,
he feigns being,

824
00:42:56,691 --> 00:43:01,691
uh,
an English gentleman of the 18 nineties 

825
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:02,090
and pretends to be educated and,
and,

826
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:07,091
uh,
it has our kind of high blown way of 

827
00:43:07,091 --> 00:43:07,091
talking and he's a fraud through and 
through and he's got,

828
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,380
he's got this,
you know,

829
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,440
sidekick who is barely there at all and 
he doesn't treat him that well,

830
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,870
but he's got someone to Lord it over.

831
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,540
So that keeps his dominance hierarchy 
thing going well.

832
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:25,541
And the fact that he's like a second 
rate companion while he never really 

833
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:29,921
noticed is that although he'll treat him
contemptuously whenever he gets a 

834
00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:29,921
chance.
So anyways,

835
00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:31,160
they're walking down the street and,
uh,

836
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,130
the,
uh,

837
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,180
Fox is bragging away about some crooked 
thing that he's done and how he pulled 

838
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,081
the wool over someone's eyes.
And he confuses that with a wisdom and 

839
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:45,221
intelligence.
And one of the things that you see this 

840
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:48,431
is worth knowing too,
because if you're preyed upon by a 

841
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:50,240
psychopath,
which you will be to some degree at some

842
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:55,241
point in your life,
the psychopath who will be narcissistic 

843
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:57,390
will presume that you're stupid and,
and,

844
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:02,530
and that you deserve to be taken 
advantage of because you're naive and 

845
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,381
stupid.
So it's actually a good thing that he's 

846
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:05,381
doing it.
And,

847
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:05,381
uh,
he,

848
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:05,990
his proof for,
and I'm saying he,

849
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:08,550
because there are more male psychopaths,
um,

850
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,970
the,
uh,

851
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,060
the proof that you're stupid naive is 
that he can take advantage of you.

852
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,670
And so like if you were wiser you,
you'd be,

853
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,630
you know,
you'd,

854
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,130
you'd know his tricks and then it 
wouldn't be morally necessary for him to

855
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,770
show you just exactly who knows what 
about what.

856
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:30,190
And so the psychopath will use his 
ability to fool you as proof of his own 

857
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,500
grandiose,
grandiose omnipotence,

858
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:39,530
omniscience and narcissism.
And the problem with that is that you 

859
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,700
can be fooled by a psychopath and 
virtually anybody can.

860
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,770
So that Robert Hare,
for example,

861
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:47,520
who studied psychopaths for a long time 
and interviewed a lot of them,

862
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:52,730
like hundreds of them and videotape many
of the interviews he said when he was 

863
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:56,571
talking to the psychopath,
he always believed what they were 

864
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:58,611
saying.
And then he'd watched the video 

865
00:44:58,611 --> 00:44:58,620
afterwards and see where the 
conversation went off the rails.

866
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:01,420
But you know,
the pro,

867
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,210
the proclivity to be polite in a 
conversation is very strong.

868
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,600
And if you're polite,
you don't object to the way that the 

869
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:11,880
person unfolds their strategy.
You know?

870
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:17,120
And psychopaths are pretty good at 
figuring out how to manipulate 

871
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,750
obviously,
how to manipulate people and the 

872
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:21,420
probability that you will be immune to 
that is extraordinarily low.

873
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,990
Go Watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed
by policemen on,

874
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,390
on Youtube.
That's bloody.

875
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,300
That's enlightening man.
Paul Bernardo,

876
00:45:30,301 --> 00:45:32,880
he's like the CEO of a meeting in that 
video,

877
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,560
you know,
he gives the cops hell.

878
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:36,900
It gives lawyers hell.
He protested his innocence.

879
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,901
He basically tells them that they're 
rude and untrustworthy because they 

880
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:46,671
don't trust him because he did a few 
little things 17 years ago and he gets 

881
00:45:46,671 --> 00:45:47,550
away with it.
A few little things,

882
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:48,030
right?
I mean,

883
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:53,031
he killed a bunch of people,
including the sister of his girlfriend 

884
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:56,691
at the time and you know,
he was a repeat sexual offender and 

885
00:45:56,691 --> 00:45:56,691
murderer.

886
00:45:56,691 --> 00:45:56,700
It's like,
but he basically goes,

887
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:57,270
well,
you know,

888
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,410
that's a long time ago.
It's like we're,

889
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,010
we're past that,
aren't we?

890
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,480
I mean,
I'm having a discussion with you.

891
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:05,760
I'm trying to solve help you solve some 
crimes,

892
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:07,020
which by the way,
I committed,

893
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:08,760
but we won't bring that up.
You know,

894
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:09,350
and you're,
you're,

895
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,220
you're,
you're accusing me of being a liar,

896
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:13,560
like you're not playing fair what,
what's up with you?

897
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,990
And then when they answer,
he looks at his fingernails,

898
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:20,991
which is like,
that's a lovely little manipulative 

899
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:23,571
thing because it basically means 
whatever happens to be under my 

900
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:26,871
fingernail at the moment is much higher 
priority than listening to your story 

901
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:31,371
and you watch,
you'll see people do that to you and 

902
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:31,371
then you get a little insight into what 
they're up to.

903
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,390
He's very good at that and so.
Or he looks outside or,

904
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,990
or are you just looking at his hands?

905
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,040
He looks out the window immediately.
Dismissive and his nonverbal behavior 

906
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,190
pr.
It's brilliant that the courts were 

907
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,440
forced to release that by the way,
but look it up,

908
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:48,240
Paul Bernardo on Youtube.
Wow.

909
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:50,640
It's,
it's just mind boggling.

910
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,700
It's he's so good at what he does and 
he's good looking and he's charismatic 

911
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,511
and he can really pull it off and you 
can't tell what's happening with the 

912
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:00,990
cops and the lawyers,
whether they're just letting him play as

913
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:05,991
a routine to get some information from 
them or whether he's actually setting 

914
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:07,290
them back on his heels.
And I suspect it's a bit of both,

915
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,620
but it's a masterful performance.
If you didn't know who he was and you 

916
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:16,620
were watching it without the audio,
you'd think he's the CEO of some company

917
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:19,320
given its employees hell for not being 
up to scratch.

918
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,590
That's all his body language,
his eye contact,

919
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:24,150
everything just speaks to that.

920
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,520
It's amazing.
So anyways,

921
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,310
you've got these two bit hoods here who 
think they're really something.

922
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:33,070
They also think they're tough and 
dangerous and and they're not.

923
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:36,700
They're just cowardly and cornered 
dwellers.

924
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:41,701
And,
and they confuse their unwillingness to 

925
00:47:41,701 --> 00:47:44,350
abide by reasonable rules as indication 
of their heroic courage,

926
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:46,780
which is something else that low rent 
hoods like to do.

927
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:51,810
You know?
And it's partly because lots of people 

928
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,020
who just attend to the law do do that 
because they're cowardly,

929
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,690
which is a Nietzschean observation.
Are you good?

930
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Are you just afraid?
Let's start with afraid first before we 

931
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,891
proceed to good.
And that the reason that you follow the 

932
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:04,900
rules is because you're afraid of 
getting caught.

933
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,160
Yeah.
Well,

934
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:11,370
you know,
those kids who I often university kids 

935
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,791
who are in like a hockey riot and they 
ended up breaking windows and stealing 

936
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,451
things and you know,
they get nailed for it and afterwards 

937
00:48:18,451 --> 00:48:20,200
they're really blown away by their own 
behavior.

938
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,640
It's like,
well they're in that camp.

939
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,010
It's like they think they're good 
people,

940
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:29,011
but they're not.
They're just never anywhere where you 

941
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:31,021
could be bad.
And as soon as you put them somewhere 

942
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:31,021
where they could be bad,
it's like,

943
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:32,350
would it comes just like that?
And that's,

944
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,890
that's really worth thinking about 
because most of you,

945
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:41,220
many of you but not all of you,
I suspect have never really been 

946
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:44,440
somewhere that you could be really bad 
and get away with it.

947
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:45,760
And so you might think,
well,

948
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:46,810
you wouldn't do it,
but,

949
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,540
but people do it all the time.
So anyways,

950
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:57,541
they're talking about some exploits and 
then they see that this character named 

951
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,320
Stromboli who's a Marionette,
he has a puppet show,

952
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,700
right?
And uh,

953
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,060
he's kind of a wheeler dealer to 
remember you.

954
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,090
I showed you that,
that mask that was glaring out Pinocchio

955
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:12,360
when he got his voice,
it's like Stromboli isn't one of his 

956
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:12,430
manifestations.

957
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:17,430
These Fox here is another one of his 
manifestations and all of the negative 

958
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,110
characters throughout the movie are 
manifestations of the same thing.

959
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:25,111
It's partly the adversarial individual 
and it's partly the theoretical aspect 

960
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:26,970
of society.
It's the negative masculine that's,

961
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:29,290
that's one way of thinking about it.
So,

962
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,880
and you know,
when men go bad,

963
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:33,790
they often go bad by being antisocial 
and tyrannical.

964
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:37,630
So where there's way more antisocial men
than are anti social women,

965
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:40,420
which is why there's 20 times as many 
men in jail as there are women.

966
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,180
So each gender,
let's say each sex has its own path,

967
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,640
characteristic pathologies.
And there are some antisocial women,

968
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:49,390
you know,
and,

969
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:52,240
and there are some high neuroticism guys
who are,

970
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,880
who are,
or some guys who are really agreeable as

971
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:56,020
well,
so,

972
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,870
but they're rarer.
So anyways,

973
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:03,871
he sees this,
this a poster advertising strombolis 

974
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,320
puppet show.

975
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:10,380
So strombolis a puppet master.
Now that's really worth thinking about 

976
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:15,001
because that's an archetypal theme or 
it's at least attached to an 

977
00:50:15,001 --> 00:50:19,561
architectural theme.
Some things behind the scenes pulling 

978
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:24,001
the strings.
And everybody always wonders what that 

979
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:24,001
is.
Right?

980
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:25,150
What's actually going on?
What's actually going on with trump?

981
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,040
Who's actually in control?
Is it Putin?

982
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,390
I mean,
that's,

983
00:50:29,391 --> 00:50:31,940
that's the,
that's the fantasies of the left.

984
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:33,050
It's potent.
It's like,

985
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:38,051
well,
the question always is what's going on 

986
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:38,480
behind the seed?
Right?

987
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:40,520
And the question is,
that's the case,

988
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:43,430
certainly on the political landscape,
the business landscape,

989
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,910
interpersonal relations,
what,

990
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:50,050
what are you really up to?
Everyone's always wondering that right 

991
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:53,291
there.
That's why they're watching your eyes 

992
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:55,720
because your eyes pointed things and 
they can infer what you're interested 

993
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,510
in.
And then what you're up to by looking at

994
00:50:56,511 --> 00:51:01,511
what you look at.
And that's why your eyes have whites is 

995
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:03,200
so that we can see where you're pointing
because gorillas don't.

996
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,130
And so,
so what that means roughly speaking,

997
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:11,870
is that all of your ancestors whose eyes
couldn't be reliably tracked were either

998
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:16,871
killed or didn't mate.
It's a big deal for us to see where 

999
00:51:16,871 --> 00:51:20,951
people's eyes are pointed.
And so we're always watching each 

1000
00:51:20,951 --> 00:51:20,951
other's eyes constantly.
What are you up to?

1001
00:51:20,951 --> 00:51:22,490
What are you up to?
What are you looking at?

1002
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:27,610
What do you want?
And I want to know because if I know 

1003
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:27,610
what you want,
I can predict how you're going to behave

1004
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:33,190
and that also means I can cooperate with
you or I can compete with you or I can 

1005
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,911
lie to you,
but all the information is in the eyes 

1006
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:37,850
of surrounded by the facial display,
right?

1007
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:40,700
Because that's also an indication of 
motivation and emotion.

1008
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,700
And so we're trying like our eyes are so
good at that.

1009
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:45,320
But for you guys sitting there in the 
back,

1010
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:51,550
I can tell if you're looking at my eyes 
or at my Chin and the deviation in your 

1011
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,360
eyes is so tiny that it's.

1012
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:58,390
It's a kind of miracle that we're 
capable of making that perceptual 

1013
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:59,510
observation,
so really important to us.

1014
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,220
So.
And we have really good eyes.

1015
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:03,950
So that's another thing about us.
So anyways,

1016
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,740
what's going on behind the scenes?
Well,

1017
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,350
if you look at Stromboli,
you might be thinking it's not clear he,

1018
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,210
someone you'd want to have pulling your 
strings,

1019
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:17,870
like there's a little bit of forced 
enthusiasm,

1020
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:20,930
let's say there.
And he's just not a very savory look and

1021
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:23,300
character.
So anyways,

1022
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:27,080
the Fox knows them and they start 
talking about Stromboli.

1023
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:32,081
That'll joker and then what they could,
how they could possibly involve hidden 

1024
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:36,171
in him in some sort of scam because he's
back in town and then they see the 

1025
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:39,800
puppet and the Fox does his equivalent 
of thinking,

1026
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:40,510
which is,
you know,

1027
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,530
pretty sad but,
and nasty,

1028
00:52:42,531 --> 00:52:47,531
but that's what he does.
And then they see this puppet with no 

1029
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:47,780
strings and they think,
hey man,

1030
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:53,050
a puppet master would pay a lot for 
something that is capable of semi 

1031
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:53,960
autonomous movement like that.

1032
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,960
It would be kind of a miracle.
And so they decided that they're going 

1033
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,391
to take them to Stromboli.
And so they grab them and he's,

1034
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,520
he's got an apple to take to the 
teacher,

1035
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:07,970
which I think it's the cat promptly eats
and uh,

1036
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:14,290
that the FARC saw acts out this sort of 
false enthusiasm about what Pinocchio is

1037
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:19,931
up to and pretends that he's his friend,
which is of course what your typical 

1038
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:23,591
pedophile will do.
And so this is in the same kind of 

1039
00:53:23,591 --> 00:53:26,501
category and it truly is.
So one of the things that's to know 

1040
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:28,770
about pedophiles and is that they're 
predatory,

1041
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:33,390
right?
And so they don't go after kids that are

1042
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:38,690
assertive and likely to be noisy.
They watch and they watch to see if they

1043
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:44,361
can find a kid who's defeated and that's
good enough who's defeated and who is 

1044
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:49,350
going to need a friend and who's not 
going to object.

1045
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,680
And so when they check out,
these are the ones who do the stranger 

1046
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:54,680
abductions,
which are,

1047
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,270
by the way extraordinarily rare.
They look for a victim type.

1048
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,970
They look for a kid who's going to be 
easy to take down.

1049
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,280
And so,
you know,

1050
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,350
that's one thing you don't want.
So you might think,

1051
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:09,351
well,
one of the things that was really big 

1052
00:54:09,351 --> 00:54:10,620
and it's probably even worse now when I 
was a parent of young children,

1053
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:13,680
was to teach your kids how to be afraid 
of strangers.

1054
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:18,681
It's like a no wrong id.
That is not what you teach them because 

1055
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,510
all you do is teach the men to be timid 
and fearful and the real predatory types

1056
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:29,511
there are,
there are pretty much thrilled about 

1057
00:54:29,511 --> 00:54:29,640
that because you'll also make them 
sheltered and naive,

1058
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,430
you know,
so that is you make your kids courageous

1059
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:37,431
and you get the damn eyes open and 
that's the best thing you can do to 

1060
00:54:37,431 --> 00:54:38,370
protect them against people who are 
truly dangerous.

1061
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:43,730
So none of that terrifying that it's not
a good idea.

1062
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,600
Anyways,
they,

1063
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,910
the,
the Fox befriends the puppet,

1064
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,870
and then they come up with this evil 
scheme to get them off to Stromboli,

1065
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:56,871
the puppet master and the way they go 
and they sing a little song about being 

1066
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:57,600
an actor,
an actor's life.

1067
00:54:57,601 --> 00:55:02,601
For me,
and this took me a long time to figure 

1068
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:05,361
out,
I thought they're taking Pinocchio away 

1069
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:08,900
to be an actor.
Now why in the world are actors getting 

1070
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,640
such a rough time in this movie?
It's like it's a Hollywood movie,

1071
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:16,140
you know,
it's acting obviously the voiceovers and

1072
00:55:16,141 --> 00:55:18,120
all that are acting.
It's why.

1073
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,700
What is this thing about being an actor?
And then I thought,

1074
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,810
oh,
I get it.

1075
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:26,870
I see what's going on that they seem to 
Pinocchio about the delights of unearned

1076
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:29,970
celebrity.
So He's,

1077
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,950
he's doesn't have to go and get an 
education.

1078
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,660
He doesn't have to take the difficult 
route.

1079
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:38,810
He can take the easy way to dominance,
to success,

1080
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,420
two dominant success.
He can circumvent all the hard work and 

1081
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:44,420
go right to the top,
you know,

1082
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:49,401
and when you think about phenomena like 
the Kardashians family and how popular 

1083
00:55:49,411 --> 00:55:54,411
they are,
part of that is this desire that people 

1084
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:57,651
have for unearned celebrity because you 
can get to the top without any 

1085
00:55:57,651 --> 00:56:00,210
sacrifices and without any work.
And if you're really cynical,

1086
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,430
you know,
you think that the people at the top are

1087
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:05,370
just there by accident anyways and it 
might as well be you.

1088
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:08,070
And of course there's a lot of naivety 
in that as well.

1089
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,660
And,
and a fair bit of,

1090
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,200
you know,
not a fair lack of wisdom and all of 

1091
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,810
that,
but the actor idea here is that you can,

1092
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:20,870
you can pretend to be something you're 
not and that that's the proper route of 

1093
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:23,340
anyone wise to success.

1094
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,560
It's the ultimate and cynicism and it's 
a nihilistic perspective as well and 

1095
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,790
that's how they interact and they say,
look,

1096
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,490
why are you going?
Why are you bothering to go to school?

1097
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:36,220
That's going to take 18 years with all 
of your talents.

1098
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:38,890
You can just go on the stage,
your name will be up in lights,

1099
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,100
you'll be out the top and no time.
And what is the puppet?

1100
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:44,350
No.
And plus he does have some talents.

1101
00:56:44,351 --> 00:56:46,780
He is after all,
a semi autonomous puppet.

1102
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,720
Now he doesn't exactly know how special 
that makes them,

1103
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:54,721
but the Fox can obviously see something 
in him and he's good at playing that,

1104
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:57,760
naive it often in offering these false 
promises.

1105
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:01,780
But see,
the thing is one of the things that Carl

1106
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:06,780
Jung said that I thought was really 
interesting when he was talking about 

1107
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:07,360
the whole situation and families.
I never forgot this,

1108
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,720
so the eatables situation,
roughly speaking is when I'll lay out 

1109
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,550
the classic story is when a child is 
seriously overprotected,

1110
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,250
usually a male child by his mother.

1111
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:23,310
Now the reverse can be the case and it 
can be a female child by the mother and 

1112
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:26,581
all of that,
but I'll just talk about the classic 

1113
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:28,831
case to begin with.
Now what Freud observed was that there 

1114
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:32,521
were usually not very good boundaries in
families like that and so the 

1115
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:36,421
relationship between the husband and the
wife was either strange or nonexistent 

1116
00:57:36,421 --> 00:57:40,410
and the wife would often turn to the 
child to be what she isn't getting from 

1117
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:44,791
the husband,
and so there's a great south park 

1118
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:47,521
episode about this,
a wonderful south park episode where 

1119
00:57:47,521 --> 00:57:51,301
they were.
I don't remember that horrible little 

1120
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:51,301
guy.
Is that.

1121
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:51,301
That's him.
Yeah,

1122
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,150
yeah,
yeah.

1123
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:57,270
And his mother brings in the dog 
whisperer to train him and it's 

1124
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,020
brilliant.
It's brilliant episode.

1125
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:02,400
If you want to learn about Freudian,
Freudian eatable situation,

1126
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:03,940
you,
you watch that.

1127
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:07,150
You've got it down cold because she 
brings in this expert who then she wants

1128
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:07,990
to have an affair with.

1129
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:12,990
So that's a boundary issue and he 
basically separates her son from him 

1130
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:12,990
and,
and,

1131
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:17,980
and imposes the same discipline on him 
that he would do impose on a bad dog,

1132
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:23,550
although he also trains the dogs owners 
all the time because maybe it's not the 

1133
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,370
dog,
maybe it's the owner.

1134
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:29,490
There's a horse whisperer movie too,
about the original horse whisperer that 

1135
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:32,911
does a beautiful job of laying that out 
too because he's very good at fixing 

1136
00:58:32,911 --> 00:58:36,721
problem horses and unbelievably good at 
diagnosing psychopathology on the part 

1137
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:38,430
of the owner.
It's his,

1138
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:41,020
he's got a gift for it.
But anyways,

1139
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:46,021
what happens in this South Park episode 
is that the dog whisperer gets cartland 

1140
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,240
yeah,
straightened out and he starts like 

1141
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:51,240
dressing properly and doing his 
homework.

1142
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,741
And,
and the mother is pursuing an affair 

1143
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,561
with the dog whisperer,
but he's professionally keeps his 

1144
00:58:58,561 --> 00:58:58,561
distance,
like he keeps boundaries around them.

1145
00:58:58,561 --> 00:59:00,280
And uh,
then he leaves.

1146
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:05,281
And then the first thing that she does 
when he leaves his bride cartman 

1147
00:59:05,281 --> 00:59:09,550
basically out of doing his homework so 
that he can accompany her to know a fast

1148
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:14,551
food restaurant or something like that.
And so the reason she does that is 

1149
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,240
because she's lonesome and it doesn't 
have anybody else around and you know,

1150
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:18,310
maybe she's also deeply,
deeply,

1151
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:21,130
deeply terrified that if she helps that 
boy grow,

1152
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,130
he will leave and she'll have nothing,
you know.

1153
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:29,510
And so mothers who don't have something 
say outside their infants,

1154
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,720
not merely their children are more 
likely to fall into that.

1155
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:33,770
And it's no wonder,
you know,

1156
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:37,100
you got to think that through.
And lots of women really,

1157
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,490
most women really fall in love with 
their babies,

1158
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:45,580
you know.
And so even if they start growing into 

1159
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,340
larger children,
that can be threatening because,

1160
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,080
well,
when the,

1161
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:53,470
when the child turns into,
when the infant turns into a toddler 

1162
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:56,300
that the infant is dead,
there's the toddler is there now and you

1163
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,970
can radically interfere with that 
process.

1164
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,130
That happens all the time,
all the time.

1165
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,380
That's the classic Freudian eatable 
nightmare.

1166
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:06,710
And that episode is brilliant.
It's bloody brilliant.

1167
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:11,711
It just nails it.
And some of you have been in my 

1168
01:00:11,711 --> 01:00:12,170
personality class and watched crumb the 
documentary crum.

1169
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,730
And that's another staggering exposition
of exactly that kind of pathology.

1170
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,420
Anyways,
one of the things young pointed out,

1171
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:25,690
so I knew this guy wants who had a 
mother who basically was trying that 

1172
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:30,431
trick and she had lots of.
She was very smart and had lots of 

1173
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:31,580
tricks up our sleeves and there's just 
no way he was going to go for it.

1174
01:00:31,581 --> 01:00:34,580
He rebelled at every possible moment and
he basically became,

1175
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,460
I would say,
somewhat hypermasculine in response,

1176
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:42,730
which is a,
which is an interesting lesson with 

1177
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,741
regards to the hypermasculinity that 
boys often develop if they're raised by 

1178
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:48,191
single mothers because they tend to go 
one of two ways and he just fought her 

1179
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:50,180
at every step of the way and it didn't 
happen.

1180
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,570
But one of the things you said,
which I loved,

1181
01:00:53,571 --> 01:00:55,500
and you can really see this in the 
chrome documentary,

1182
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:58,910
is that the oedipal mother basically 
entices.

1183
01:00:58,911 --> 01:01:00,440
The child says,
look,

1184
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,160
here's the deal.
You don't have to do anything but you 

1185
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,091
don't get to leave.
But if you don't leave and you don't do 

1186
01:01:10,091 --> 01:01:10,091
these difficult things,
then I'll take care of you.

1187
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,620
And the child has a choice all the way 
along there.

1188
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:15,710
I mean,
obviously he's outclassed in some sense,

1189
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:20,711
but it's not as obvious as you'd think 
little kids are tough and they make 

1190
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:24,671
decisions all the time and so young 
thought about it more as a conspiracy 

1191
01:01:24,671 --> 01:01:26,030
than as something imposed on the child 
by the mother.

1192
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:31,031
And I really like.
It's actually a conspiracy between 

1193
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:31,031
mother,
father and child actually.

1194
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:35,530
And I think that's a good way of looking
at it even though it's really rough 

1195
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:35,530
because said,
well,

1196
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:35,990
should you hold a child responsible?

1197
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:38,540
Well,
yes,

1198
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,900
but judiciously and not completely 
because then if you deal with someone 

1199
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:44,930
like that as an adult and they're trying
to escape from it,

1200
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,140
you have to go all the way back and 
figure out how the hell it happened.

1201
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:53,141
And then they have to adjust.
They have to figure out where they 

1202
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:56,380
opened the door,
like inviting a vampire in because they 

1203
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:56,660
can't come in unless you invite them in,
you know,

1204
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,380
so don't invite them in because once 
they're in,

1205
01:02:00,381 --> 01:02:03,320
they're really hard to get rid of and 
they'll take all your blood.

1206
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,650
So that's a cautionary tale.
So anyways,

1207
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:10,100
Pinocchio doesn't know any better and 
he's got the egotism of,

1208
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:15,180
you know,
of youth and he's offered the easy way 

1209
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:15,650
to success,
which is exactly what the Fox tells them

1210
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,860
and off they go to see Stromboli.
So this is the song,

1211
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:24,750
I'm not going to read it all.
It's great to be a celebrity and actor's

1212
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:25,620
life for me.

1213
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:26,750
Um,

1214
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:32,810
sleep till after to you promenade a big 
cigar,

1215
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:37,811
you tour the world in a private car,
you dine on chicken and caviar and 

1216
01:02:37,811 --> 01:02:39,200
actor's life for me.
So it's all this idea of,

1217
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:44,350
of wealth and public exposure and zero 
attention whatsoever to anything 

1218
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,660
regarding responsibility or discipline 
or learning.

1219
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,390
And so it's a dual attraction,
right?

1220
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,790
You get everything we want and you don't
have to do anything.

1221
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,840
Jesus,
what a deal.

1222
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,420
And so that's what the act or 
represents.

1223
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,650
It's,
it's a liar.

1224
01:02:57,651 --> 01:02:59,710
Fundamentally,
it's someone who's acting out a,

1225
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:03,500
a deception there,
a persona in the union sense.

1226
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:08,830
So the persona is the mask you wear in 
public that you might even think you 

1227
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:10,940
are,
but you're not.

1228
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:14,030
It's this mask and that's the act.
That's the persona.

1229
01:03:14,031 --> 01:03:19,031
So the Fox and the cat or inviting the 
puppet to only become a persona and and 

1230
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,090
that's,
that's see for young,

1231
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:28,300
you start as a persona and then when you
start to investigate the parts of you 

1232
01:03:28,941 --> 01:03:31,640
that don't really fit in that persona,
that would be the shadow.

1233
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:37,060
Then you start understanding who you 
really are and that's shocking because 

1234
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:41,560
the persona contains everything roughly 
speaking that you think is good and 

1235
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,461
maybe even that your immediate culture 
thinks is good and then the shadow 

1236
01:03:45,461 --> 01:03:48,290
contains everything that's not part of 
that and some of that's really bad,

1237
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:52,130
but some of it is good,
disguised as bad,

1238
01:03:52,131 --> 01:03:57,131
and you can't break out of the persona 
and transcended until you incorporate a 

1239
01:03:57,131 --> 01:03:59,150
lot of what's in the shadow.
And so for example,

1240
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,610
if you're an extraordinarily 
compassionate person,

1241
01:04:01,611 --> 01:04:06,611
let's say 98th percentile will say 
you're going to be sacrificing yourself 

1242
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:12,041
to other people all the time and there 
are people who will find that 

1243
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,570
extraordinarily endearing and it will be
under some circumstances.

1244
01:04:14,571 --> 01:04:19,571
But the problem is is that you will 
sacrifice yourself and that's a really 

1245
01:04:19,571 --> 01:04:20,270
bad attitude to have.
For example,

1246
01:04:20,271 --> 01:04:23,030
towards adult males.
It's a great thing for infants,

1247
01:04:23,031 --> 01:04:28,031
but for adult males it is the wrong 
approach and so you will get taken 

1248
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:32,861
advantage of continually by people who 
are looking for someone like you until 

1249
01:04:32,861 --> 01:04:34,930
you grow some teeth and you'll think,
no,

1250
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:35,390
no.

1251
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:40,630
That's the opposite of compassion.
Being able to bite hard is the opposite 

1252
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,930
of compassion,
which it is,

1253
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,260
and so you'll have that pushed into the 
predatory category.

1254
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:47,120
I'm not doing that.
I'm not getting angry.

1255
01:04:47,121 --> 01:04:52,121
I don't like conflict.
It's like until you bring that out of 

1256
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,510
the depths and put it on so you can use 
it,

1257
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,540
you're going to be in trouble and that's
kind of niches,

1258
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:58,700
idea of the reevaluation of good and 
evil,

1259
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:04,300
right?
You have a sense of what's good in a 

1260
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:04,300
sense of what isn't with your 
conscience,

1261
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,860
but it's not very smart.
It's got things in the wrong boxes and a

1262
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,900
lot of the things that even nature 
itself,

1263
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:13,370
a lot of the things that you accept as 
untrammeled goods like compassion,

1264
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:18,371
let's say have a very dark side first of
all and are not enough to get you 

1265
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:23,701
through life.
You need the opposite virtues to and so 

1266
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:27,121
you have to develop them and so you get 
outside the persona to do that,

1267
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,760
but anyways,
Pinocchio was invited to be a false 

1268
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,301
persona,
to take the gains of celebrity without 

1269
01:05:36,301 --> 01:05:36,490
having to do anything to be educated.

1270
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:41,670
He's just going to go right to the top 
from right where he is and you know 

1271
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,030
people are kind of fascinated by that 
idea.

1272
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:47,280
That's why you watch America's got 
talent or the x factor with your shows.

1273
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,510
I actually love,
by the way you.

1274
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,990
You never see narcissism in its pure 
forms.

1275
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:58,380
Then you see it when you watch people 
who display an absolute lack of talent 

1276
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,270
and become homicidal.
When someone dares pointed out,

1277
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,450
right,
accusatory and homicidal instantly,

1278
01:06:04,451 --> 01:06:09,451
it's really something,
and then now and then you do see one of 

1279
01:06:09,451 --> 01:06:13,051
these people who's so introverted and so
out of society and have this 

1280
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:18,481
unbelievable gift,
which is also something really 

1281
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:19,630
remarkable to see and it's no wonder 
those things are so popular,

1282
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,620
they're psychologically stored nearly 
interesting.

1283
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:29,250
So okay,
so that's the actor first of the nokias 

1284
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:29,410
temptations,
and of course it's the first one because

1285
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:34,411
he's entering the social world and the 
temptation in the social world is to be 

1286
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:38,461
exactly what other people want you to be
and the thing that's cool about that is 

1287
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:39,880
that is what you should be doing right?

1288
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,880
When you go out in your peers,
you should be not subjugating your 

1289
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,020
individuality to your peers because 
that's not exactly right.

1290
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,510
That's kind of based on an inhibition 
model.

1291
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,580
You know you've got aggression that 
you've got bad habits.

1292
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:56,581
They have to be inhibited.
You learn that by interacting with your 

1293
01:06:56,581 --> 01:06:56,710
peers.
It's not the right model.

1294
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,480
PSJ,
that's a Freudian model.

1295
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:03,481
Piaget was was correct about that.
He basically pointed out that what 

1296
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:06,570
should happen is let's say with your 
aggression and hopefully you have some,

1297
01:07:06,571 --> 01:07:10,360
is that it gets socialized and so you 
learn how to play games,

1298
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:15,361
but you don't drop your drive to when 
you integrate that in the games and so 

1299
01:07:15,361 --> 01:07:16,900
you try to,
when you try to play hard,

1300
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,540
but if you're defeated or you hit 
something negative,

1301
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:24,541
you don't respond negatively and you can
keep that all bounded within being a 

1302
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,180
fair,
a good player,

1303
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:26,440
a fair,
a fair player,

1304
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:31,860
and that means what's happening is you 
just learn how to play a game or a set 

1305
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:35,791
of games that also includes the darker 
parts of you and they actually become 

1306
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:37,060
part of your force of character.

1307
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,250
It's way better if you can pull that 
off.

1308
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:44,251
It's and,
and that's what you definitely want to 

1309
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:44,251
do as an adult.
Like all you people are going to have to

1310
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:47,710
learn to negotiate on your own behalf 
and that that's really hard.

1311
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:49,570
It means that you have to know what you 
want.

1312
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:55,540
You have to be able to communicate it 
and you have to be able to say no and to

1313
01:07:55,541 --> 01:08:00,541
say no.
You have to be built on a solid 

1314
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:00,541
foundation.
You have to have options,

1315
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:05,160
so you've got to remember that as you go
through your life is like if you don't 

1316
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,971
have options,
you can't negotiate with someone and if 

1317
01:08:08,971 --> 01:08:08,971
you're not willing to use them,
they win period,

1318
01:08:08,971 --> 01:08:11,350
because if you're asking your boss for 
more money,

1319
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,800
say the answer is no because he doesn't 
have any spare money lying around that 

1320
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:20,360
he can just give to you and lots of 
other people are asking,

1321
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,480
so some of that zero some stuff,
you know,

1322
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:28,540
not all of it because often you 
cooperate with people in the whole pot 

1323
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:31,481
can grow,
but some of it's zero sum and so you 

1324
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:31,481
better have a case made.

1325
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:33,080
It's like,
here's why I should.

1326
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,300
Here's how much money I should have.
Here's why.

1327
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,450
Here's the benefit to you that will 
accrue if you don't,

1328
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,360
if you do it,
here's the consequences that you don't.

1329
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:45,260
They're actually real.
They will cost you and I will do them.

1330
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,400
It's like then you can negotiate and you
don't do that rudely,

1331
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,250
but those arguments,
you better have them in order like so.

1332
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:54,350
For example,
if you're going to negotiate for a raise

1333
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:58,360
or a or a status shift,
you better have your resume out,

1334
01:08:58,361 --> 01:09:03,361
hand all polished up and nowhere else 
you're going to look for a job and you 

1335
01:09:03,361 --> 01:09:05,240
better be able to get one because 
otherwise you're just.

1336
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:08,060
You're weak and you will not win the 
negotiation,

1337
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:11,720
and if you're too agreeable,
so your conflict avoidant,

1338
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:16,910
you will make less money across time 
that's already been well established and

1339
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:20,120
that's because you don't have teeth,
not enough,

1340
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:24,890
and so in the little micro contests that
you're going to have every day,

1341
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,150
you're going to incrementally lose to 
people who are more aggressive,

1342
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:32,750
who have bigger teeth,
and that's what happens so,

1343
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,110
so don't let that happen.
You want to,

1344
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,960
you place yourself so you can negotiate 
because otherwise

1345
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,970
you're just a facade and when a real 
battle of facade is just torn down right

1346
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:51,150
away.
So yes,

1347
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,310
well say no more.

1348
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:56,460
Well,
the cricket,

1349
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,440
he's supposed to be helping to pop it 
out,

1350
01:09:58,441 --> 01:09:59,970
but he overslept.
It's like,

1351
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,660
that's just another indication that he's
not everything he could be yet,

1352
01:10:03,661 --> 01:10:08,661
and that's really,
that took me a long time to puzzle out 

1353
01:10:08,661 --> 01:10:10,080
with regards to interpreting this movie.
I could not figure out,

1354
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,280
alright,
I told you this,

1355
01:10:11,281 --> 01:10:16,281
if the bug is the person who opens the 
hero narrative and who can guide the 

1356
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:19,410
transformations of time and who has the 
same initials as Jesus Christ,

1357
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:23,700
it's like,
is like knighted by nature herself.

1358
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:28,790
Why is he such an idiot?
It's a very difficult thing to figure 

1359
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:28,790
out,
but,

1360
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:31,140
but the idea that the conscience isn't 
omniscient,

1361
01:10:31,141 --> 01:10:33,540
even though it has that sort of,
that voice of,

1362
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,920
of let's say common sense.
Uh,

1363
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:39,690
and that fits very nicely in with the 
Freudian idea of the Super Ego.

1364
01:10:39,691 --> 01:10:41,940
Again,
because the Super Ego can be flawed,

1365
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,860
it can be too harsh,
it can not be,

1366
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:45,720
it can not be properly developed.

1367
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:48,390
You see that often with people who are 
orderly,

1368
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:53,600
so they're high in conscientiousness,
conscientiousness fragments into 

1369
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,290
industriousness and orderliness orderly.
People like willpower,

1370
01:10:55,350 --> 01:11:00,350
they're very judgmental and they like 
things to be exactly where they're 

1371
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:01,500
supposed to be,
but they're also very self punitive.

1372
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:05,480
So conservatives are much more likely to
be orderly by the way it's.

1373
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:10,481
It's one of the best predictors of 
conservative low openness is the best 

1374
01:11:10,481 --> 01:11:11,670
predictor,
but right after that is high,

1375
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,530
high orderliness.
So.

1376
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,340
And it's associated with disgust 
sensitivity,

1377
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:20,610
which is really an amazing thing.
We'll talk about that later.

1378
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,050
Anyways,
the cricket.

1379
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:28,670
Oh,
he falls down on his first day on the 

1380
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:28,950
job.
He's not as conscientious a conscious.

1381
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,180
He's not as conscientious a conscience 
as he should be.

1382
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:38,690
So he's feeling pretty stupid.
He's got his little millionaire clothes 

1383
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:38,690
on there,
but he's really not living up to them.

1384
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:43,530
So he does catch up to the Fox and the 
puppet however,

1385
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:48,740
and tries to dissuade Pinocchio from 
going down this road hand.

1386
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,760
Of course the cat.
Well you can see what the cat is doing.

1387
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:56,110
Mary's going to big hammer,
big Mellott and he's gonna.

1388
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,340
He also shows you just exactly how much 
of a clue he has.

1389
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:02,440
He's going to wall up the bug who's 
sitting on the foxes hat,

1390
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,070
which I think he actually does and you 
know,

1391
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:08,280
then the farcs can't get out of his hat 
and has to talk through his hat,

1392
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,110
which basically is what he's doing the 
whole time.

1393
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:13,170
Anyways.
So this I really like.

1394
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:19,290
So you see on the left here that cricket
is speaking inside this flower,

1395
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,000
you know,
and like I said,

1396
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:24,540
there's nothing accidental in these,
in these representations.

1397
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:29,070
So these are artists who are coming up 
with these compositions and they fantasy

1398
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:33,480
has a structure and so the cricket is 
speaking out of this flower that has.

1399
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,490
Well,
you could think about it as,

1400
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,320
it has a sexualized element.

1401
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,320
So you can think about that as a part of
it and not part of the feminine part of 

1402
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:42,320
it.
Well,

1403
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,420
they are flowers after all.
They are the sex organs of plants.

1404
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:50,810
And so,
and that's very much the same over here 

1405
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:51,330
as this is the Yoni and lingam misses 
from,

1406
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,230
from,
uh,

1407
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:53,820
from Hindu cultures.
And so,

1408
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,010
and they see there's a snake wrapped 
around that.

1409
01:12:56,011 --> 01:13:01,011
And so that's masculine and feminine 
with a snake wrapped around it and 

1410
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:02,520
that's,
that's a wholly representation,

1411
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,100
you know,
sacred representation and it represents,

1412
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:09,270
it represents the deepest reality.
That's one way of thinking about it,

1413
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:11,490
like chaos and order surrounded by the 
snake.

1414
01:13:11,491 --> 01:13:13,350
It's the same.
Exactly the same idea.

1415
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:18,360
And so the cricket speaks out of that 
already know that because the cricket is

1416
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:21,690
the conscience and he's been awakened in
part by by Japan,

1417
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:26,220
Eto and the good father and awakened in 
part by the good fairy and nature.

1418
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:30,900
And so he speaks with those voices and,
and he's also a manifestation of,

1419
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:36,420
of the underlying chaos itself because 
nature and culture spring out of chaos.

1420
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:42,290
You know,
I already showed you that schematic 

1421
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:42,290
representation.
Okay.

1422
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:46,430
So I'll just,
I'll just end this scene and then we'll 

1423
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:47,760
have like a 15 minute break.
Okay.

1424
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:52,560
So anyways,
the cricket tries to make a case for why

1425
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:55,020
Pinocchio shouldn't go off to be a 
celebrity,

1426
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:58,830
but you know,
it's a hard case to make because the Fox

1427
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:04,070
is very manipulative and Pinocchio is 
naive and it sounds like a good offer.

1428
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:06,600
And also the Fox is actually quite 
forceful,

1429
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:08,430
you know,
he basically takes them by the hand.

1430
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,880
So the temptation is,
and this is something else I liked about

1431
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,290
the movie,
you can't just say,

1432
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:19,291
well the puppet gets what he deserves 
because he's little naive and what he's 

1433
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:25,080
facing is really malevolent,
truly malevolent and physically 

1434
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:29,191
overpowering.
And so the movie does a nice job of not 

1435
01:14:29,191 --> 01:14:31,180
minimizing the threat that's posed by 
this particular temptation.

1436
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,150
And that's part of what makes it art.
Okay,

1437
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:35,260
good.
So we'll stop there.

1438
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,140
We'll have a break for 15 minutes and 
then we'll start with the stage.

1439
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,620
So.
Alright.

1440
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:44,520
So here we are at the big event in 
Pinocchio is off to be a celebrity.

1441
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:53,120
And the cricket is watching.
And a Pinocchio basically.

1442
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:58,470
Well he's got some natural talent 
because he's,

1443
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:03,740
he's a puppet,
he doesn't have strings and he goes on 

1444
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,721
stage and with strings and then he drops
his strings and the whole crowd was 

1445
01:15:05,721 --> 01:15:09,501
amazed.
And the crowds should be amazed when 

1446
01:15:09,501 --> 01:15:09,501
that happens.
Right.

1447
01:15:09,501 --> 01:15:13,490
You can imagine when a kid goes to 
school and show some independence that 

1448
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,660
that's actually gonna.

1449
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,950
People are gonna notice that he's his 
peers are gonna notice that the teachers

1450
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:24,920
are going to notice that maybe it's too 
much independence even.

1451
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:26,230
Right,
but it's still a.

1452
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:29,660
It is a remarkable thing to like.
It's so interesting.

1453
01:15:29,661 --> 01:15:31,850
You know,
you can see marked signs of independence

1454
01:15:31,851 --> 01:15:33,640
and children.
Well,

1455
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:38,650
right from the time they're born 
basically because what's one of the 

1456
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:38,650
things that's really funny about infants
is that,

1457
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:40,910
you know,
when they're crying you always say,

1458
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:43,400
oh,
the baby's while you're crying.

1459
01:15:43,401 --> 01:15:44,870
It's maybe sad.
It's like,

1460
01:15:44,871 --> 01:15:49,871
no,
a lot of the time that maybe is angry 

1461
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:53,230
and the way that we know that is because
you could do facial expression coding on

1462
01:15:53,751 --> 01:15:58,751
infants just like on,
on adults and you can tell what emotion 

1463
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:02,921
they're expressing and very frequently,
like when the kid starts to recognize 

1464
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:06,791
his mom explicitly because he or she 
knows the smell right away pretty much 

1465
01:16:06,951 --> 01:16:07,850
in the sound of the voice.

1466
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:12,590
But visually,
if someone comes in and it isn't who the

1467
01:16:12,591 --> 01:16:15,170
baby wants,
so generally it isn't mom,

1468
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,660
the baby will start to cry,
but it's not [inaudible] the baby.

1469
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:22,661
Sad.
Generally it's because it's angry that 

1470
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:23,360
mom didn't show up and that's an early 
sign of will.

1471
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:28,361
It's like this kid has this kid wants 
things like and it's perfectly willing 

1472
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:33,160
to tell you about that and of course a 
two year old who's having a temper 

1473
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,130
tantrum is in some sense doing the same 
thing.

1474
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:37,520
It's poorly integrated will and 
independence obviously,

1475
01:16:37,521 --> 01:16:40,220
but it certainly runs contrary to what 
you want.

1476
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:45,400
You don't want your two year old having 
a temper tantrum in the middle of the 

1477
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,041
toy store.
It's extraordinarily embarrassing for 

1478
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:51,071
you and while for you,
but it's also embarrassing for the two 

1479
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:54,491
year old.
That's one of the reasons I think that 

1480
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:56,261
that sort of thing should be carefully 
socialized rapidly because it's actually

1481
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:02,320
humiliating for the kid because other 
people don't like that and they're very 

1482
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:02,960
judgemental about like they won't say 
anything usually,

1483
01:17:02,961 --> 01:17:07,961
but sometimes they will,
but they're not happy about the fact 

1484
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,080
that that's happening and they will 
judge the child negatively.

1485
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:14,470
So you don't want your child to be 
behaving in a way in public that makes 

1486
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:17,600
other people think badly of them.
It's really,

1487
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:22,790
it's really not good and so you,
you're part of your job as a parent is 

1488
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:25,820
to not expose your child to that sort of
experience,

1489
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:30,821
especially not repeatedly.
It's really hard on them or they get 

1490
01:17:30,821 --> 01:17:32,660
narcissistic,
which is also really hard on them.

1491
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:37,661
It's just,
it takes a lot longer to manifest 

1492
01:17:37,661 --> 01:17:37,661
itself.
So anyways,

1493
01:17:37,661 --> 01:17:40,900
he's off on stage and Stromboli 
introduces him and talks about how 

1494
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:45,311
wonderful this is going to be and Nokia,
it comes out on stage with the strings 

1495
01:17:45,311 --> 01:17:47,920
on and drops them and then he falls down
the steps and put his nose in the whole.

1496
01:17:47,921 --> 01:17:52,921
It makes a fool out of himself and 
that's when Stromboli first time 

1497
01:17:52,921 --> 01:17:55,961
Stromboli shows his true character 
because he just really yells and screams

1498
01:17:56,511 --> 01:18:01,511
at him and he has his back to the 
audience Stromboli while he's doing 

1499
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:01,511
this.

1500
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:03,260
So he's not noticing how the audience is
reacting.

1501
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:05,210
Typical to radical parent,
right?

1502
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:09,800
Who's not noticing that society is 
reacting a different way than in him and

1503
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:14,801
he's not happy about it.
And Pinocchio of course is dazed and 

1504
01:18:14,801 --> 01:18:17,270
feels like a fool and he is a fool.
So that's appropriate.

1505
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:21,050
But then Stromboli,
here's the crowd laughing,

1506
01:18:21,051 --> 01:18:23,420
and as soon as he turns around,
he's like all smiles again,

1507
01:18:23,421 --> 01:18:28,421
and so that's the first time you get 
insight into what sort of puppet master 

1508
01:18:28,421 --> 01:18:32,081
he is.
He's there to please the crowd and that 

1509
01:18:32,081 --> 01:18:32,081
all and he's there to look good in 
public.

1510
01:18:32,081 --> 01:18:34,040
But fundamentally he's a tyrant.
And so,

1511
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:37,610
and I guess that's the problem,
the problem with false celebrity is that

1512
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:40,970
the negative spirit of the crowd becomes
your master,

1513
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,890
right?
Because to be a celebrity you have to be

1514
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:46,100
a crowd pleaser.
And if you're pleasing the kind of crowd

1515
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:49,250
who likes a celebrity like you,
which is,

1516
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:55,770
and there's not much reason for that,
then it's not exactly like you're 

1517
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,490
appealing to the proper side of the 
crowd and you've become,

1518
01:18:57,491 --> 01:19:00,850
it's puppet one way or another.
And maybe it's rewarding you with wealth

1519
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,880
perhaps and with attention,
but fundamentally it's not.

1520
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:12,660
It's not something I would recommend if 
you want to stay reasonably 

1521
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:13,270
psychologically healthy for any 
reasonable amount of time,

1522
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:17,350
you're going to sell yourself out.
And I don't mean not in any casual way,

1523
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:17,740
you know?

1524
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:20,450
All right.
So anyways,

1525
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:25,520
Stromboli changes from the tyrant to the
good father in half a second,

1526
01:19:25,521 --> 01:19:30,521
He gives Pinocchio Pat on the head 
despite the fact that he's made a 

1527
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:31,580
mistake,
looks all kind and the show continues.

1528
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:36,700
Now,
the cricket is not very happy about 

1529
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:36,700
this.
He's sitting in the stage watching.

1530
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:40,970
He's very angry and let's say disgusted 
by what's happening,

1531
01:19:40,971 --> 01:19:44,270
partly because Pinocchio was making a 
fool of himself.

1532
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,280
Now that's an interesting thing.
You know,

1533
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:49,640
human beings blush.
In fact,

1534
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:52,340
if I remember correctly,
the name Adam,

1535
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:57,950
you know,
like Adam and eve is related to the 

1536
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:57,950
capacity to blush.
Now that,

1537
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,450
that comes from something I read a long 
time ago,

1538
01:19:59,451 --> 01:20:04,451
and that might be wrong,
but Adam does manifest shame in the 

1539
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:04,730
sight of God.
So there,

1540
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,160
there is a relationship there,
but anyways,

1541
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:11,170
um,
people do make fools of themselves for,

1542
01:20:11,171 --> 01:20:16,171
for public display.
And you can tell you've done that in 

1543
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:18,621
some sense,
not always if you blush because you've 

1544
01:20:18,621 --> 01:20:20,580
either said something you shouldn't have
and you know,

1545
01:20:20,581 --> 01:20:23,010
you realize that,
which is more like you've,

1546
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,620
you've tried to be funny and gotten a 
little bit too far.

1547
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:29,730
And sometimes that can be really funny,
or you said something that you know,

1548
01:20:29,731 --> 01:20:32,700
to be false,
manipulative,

1549
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:35,820
deceitful beneath you or any of those 
things,

1550
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:37,740
and you'll have an automatic response to
it.

1551
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:43,130
It'd be ashamed and blush.
And one theory about that is that you 

1552
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:46,431
can trust people who blush.
And so because you know that their 

1553
01:20:46,431 --> 01:20:48,870
conscience will be trade that and so 
that even if they are lying,

1554
01:20:48,871 --> 01:20:51,720
they tell you.
And so it's an interesting theory,

1555
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:54,060
you know,
because blush is definitely like,

1556
01:20:54,061 --> 01:20:55,440
it's a facial display,
you know,

1557
01:20:55,441 --> 01:20:57,150
it's right out there where people can 
see it.

1558
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,280
So,
you know,

1559
01:20:59,281 --> 01:21:00,600
maybe that's true,
maybe it isn't,

1560
01:21:00,601 --> 01:21:02,340
but it's kind of an interesting idea.
Anyways.

1561
01:21:02,341 --> 01:21:04,230
The cricket is not happy with what's 
going on.

1562
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:09,231
He's not happy boats,
Stromboli and he's not happy about the 

1563
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:12,621
willingness of Pinocchio to make a fool 
of himself to support this false 

1564
01:21:12,621 --> 01:21:12,870
celebrity.

1565
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:18,470
And so I actually think that's why the 
celebrity types like that often get 

1566
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,060
narcissistic and arrogant.
You know,

1567
01:21:21,061 --> 01:21:25,320
it's because they,
they aren't paying attention,

1568
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:28,950
they're not paying attention really to 
what's happening inside of them.

1569
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:33,951
They drowned it out because the glory.
And the money and all that is so 

1570
01:21:34,111 --> 01:21:36,420
attractive and enticing.
They don't notice.

1571
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:41,480
They refuse to notice what price they're
paying for it and they magnify up their 

1572
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,620
grandiosity and their arrogance to keep 
that stuff all under control.

1573
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,080
And then of course they get surrounded 
by sycophants,

1574
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:47,670
which is a really bad thing,
right?

1575
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,000
They,
they get surrounded by people who will 

1576
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,191
tell them exactly what they want to hear
and that's really bad if what you want 

1577
01:21:55,191 --> 01:21:58,320
to hear from other people is not good 
for you to surround yourself with people

1578
01:21:58,321 --> 01:22:03,240
who won't offer you genuine criticism or
even genuine reward.

1579
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:05,310
It's the same thing like you want for 
me,

1580
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:10,311
that I differentially reward and punish 
you in approximately the way that the 

1581
01:22:10,311 --> 01:22:11,970
good part of the crowd will.

1582
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:17,180
That's what you want from all your 
friends because then your interactions 

1583
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:19,770
with them can generalize out to the 
broader community in a productive way.

1584
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:21,570
And so a good friend,
you know,

1585
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:26,571
I mean your friends tend to be on the 
supportive side and perhaps that's 

1586
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:27,210
appropriate.
Assuming there's reciprocity,

1587
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:30,900
but a good friend will also tell you 
when one way or another,

1588
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:35,901
when your behavior is starting to tilt 
in a direction that's going to make you 

1589
01:22:35,901 --> 01:22:37,560
unpopular with them and likely unpopular
with other people,

1590
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:39,630
and of course that's what a parent is 
supposed.

1591
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:42,240
That's the prime job of a parent in my 
estimation.

1592
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:44,490
It's like,
don't do that.

1593
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:49,640
Other people will hurt you if you do 
that by exclusion,

1594
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:53,460
by threat,
by failure to offer you an opportunity,

1595
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:56,760
bad things will happen to you so you 
can't do that,

1596
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:00,810
and then you're a representative of the 
social situation,

1597
01:23:00,811 --> 01:23:03,300
which is exactly what you should be,
not a friend,

1598
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:08,870
so or at least not precisely a friend 
that doesn't make you an enemy.

1599
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:13,420
It makes you better than a friend.
Well,

1600
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:18,421
so minimal cues on stage,
making a fool of himself and then he 

1601
01:23:18,421 --> 01:23:19,570
gets all tangled up in other puppet 
strings.

1602
01:23:19,571 --> 01:23:24,571
That's what happens to them and the and 
then it all ends rather badly with 

1603
01:23:24,571 --> 01:23:26,470
everything being a tangled mess on 
stage,

1604
01:23:26,471 --> 01:23:28,600
but it also turns out to be rather 
funny.

1605
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,580
It's funny because he's surrounded by 
angry Russians know,

1606
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:38,610
which you know,
you could kind of view that as a 

1607
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:40,471
potential lesson is that if you're a 
puppet on a stage and you mess around 

1608
01:23:40,471 --> 01:23:44,401
too much,
you just might get tangled up with a 

1609
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:44,401
bunch of angry Russians and these are 
costs acts.

1610
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:47,170
That's exactly what happened.
So anyways,

1611
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:48,820
of course,
no,

1612
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,310
that's not what's happening here,
but it's still funny.

1613
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:52,390
So

1614
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:57,130
Stromboli is not happy with the tangled 
mass,

1615
01:23:57,131 --> 01:24:02,131
but then the crowd reacts very 
positively and then that confuses the 

1616
01:24:02,131 --> 01:24:02,131
conscience because he thinks,
well look,

1617
01:24:02,131 --> 01:24:03,460
this is horrible.
This guy's a tyrant,

1618
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,710
like Pinocchio's making a fool of 
himself.

1619
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:10,711
Everything turns into a tangled mess,
but the crowd goes crazy and well being 

1620
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,080
a fool.
That can be entertaining,

1621
01:24:14,081 --> 01:24:16,960
right?
So it's hard to tell when the crowd,

1622
01:24:16,961 --> 01:24:21,961
especially at a spectacle,
because that's this crowd is at a 

1623
01:24:21,961 --> 01:24:24,691
spectacle.
You just don't know exactly why it is 

1624
01:24:24,691 --> 01:24:26,170
that they're responding positively,
but you've definitely give them what you

1625
01:24:26,171 --> 01:24:31,171
want.
And you can see this look on strombolis 

1626
01:24:31,171 --> 01:24:31,171
face.
It's like this false.

1627
01:24:31,171 --> 01:24:32,500
Again,
this false kindness and generosity,

1628
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:38,190
public facing and oh well anyways,
the conscience is very confused and I 

1629
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:41,560
really think this is an important thing 
because I've often thought I spent a lot

1630
01:24:41,561 --> 01:24:43,450
of time thinking about Hitler and I was 
thinking,

1631
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:46,450
well,
how do you get into a state like that?

1632
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,250
You know,
can you think?

1633
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:53,251
Well,
he was a dictator and he led his people 

1634
01:24:53,251 --> 01:24:53,251
down a bad path.
It's like,

1635
01:24:53,251 --> 01:24:54,880
that's not right.
That is not what happened.

1636
01:24:56,350 --> 01:25:00,610
They had a conspiracy together and went 
down a bad path.

1637
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:01,930
Now think about it this way.

1638
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,300
Hmm.

1639
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:06,440
If one person thinks something about 
you,

1640
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,210
it's like whatever.
Right?

1641
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,360
But if five people tell you that,
well,

1642
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:16,361
what?
Then then to start to start not taken 

1643
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:16,580
that seriously.
It's kind of narcissistic.

1644
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:17,990
Right?
And if it isn't five,

1645
01:25:17,991 --> 01:25:22,991
let's say it's 15 people tell you the 
same thing or act the same way towards 

1646
01:25:22,991 --> 01:25:24,920
you.
It's like probably you should clue in,

1647
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:30,040
well what if you're a politician and 
you're trying out a bunch of different 

1648
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,050
ideas and you're good at interacting 
with the crowd,

1649
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,240
you're charismatic,
you watch the crowd,

1650
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,060
but you're not necessarily all that 
articulate.

1651
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:39,670
You don't have your values all 
straightened out,

1652
01:25:39,671 --> 01:25:43,010
but you're kind of angry too and maybe 
that's because you spent a bunch of time

1653
01:25:43,011 --> 01:25:48,011
in World War One,
world war one in the trenches which was 

1654
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:49,190
like no joke and all your friends got 
blown up.

1655
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:54,660
You had when you were unemployed and 
then you tried to be an artist and that 

1656
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:57,671
didn't work out even though you were 
moderately talented and then maybe the 

1657
01:25:57,671 --> 01:26:00,881
economy fell apart completely on you 
hyperinflation and then maybe there was 

1658
01:26:00,881 --> 01:26:05,561
a communist menace coming in from the 
east and they're genuinely was and so 

1659
01:26:05,561 --> 01:26:10,210
you're not the world's happiest clam at 
that point and you're talking to people 

1660
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:14,770
who aren't that happy either because 
they were also badly defeated in world 

1661
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:14,770
war one.

1662
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:16,130
And then they had a terrible treaty.
They had decided they lost part of their

1663
01:26:16,131 --> 01:26:20,240
territory and so the crowd's not happy 
and neither are you.

1664
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,450
And there's reason for it,
and so you start talking to them,

1665
01:26:23,451 --> 01:26:26,570
you don't know what you're upset about 
and neither does the crowd,

1666
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:30,770
so you start to articulate some things 
about why you might be upset and some of

1667
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:35,771
them fall flat,
but you're paying attention to the 

1668
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:37,100
crowd.
So you stop saying those things and some

1669
01:26:37,101 --> 01:26:40,070
of the things make the crowd really wake
up and listen.

1670
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,440
And so you start seeing more of those 
things.

1671
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,140
Right?
It's an.

1672
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,520
It's an unconscious dialectic between 
you and the crowd.

1673
01:26:46,521 --> 01:26:51,521
It's mediated by consciousness,
but it's not like you're sitting there 

1674
01:26:51,521 --> 01:26:51,521
saying,
although you might be,

1675
01:26:51,521 --> 01:26:53,480
I'm going to tell this crowd more what 
it wants to hear.

1676
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,960
It's more sophisticated than that.
And so you do that thousand times and 

1677
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,371
you do that to ever increasing crowds 
and the crowd really starts to go mad 

1678
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:07,310
and they basically tell you that you're 
the savior of the nation.

1679
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:12,640
It's like at what?
How many bloody people have to tell you 

1680
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,810
that before you start to believe it,
you know?

1681
01:27:14,811 --> 01:27:17,620
I would say with a typical person,
100,

1682
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,830
we'll do it now.
That'll get you going,

1683
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:24,831
man.
If a hundred people tell you 

1684
01:27:24,831 --> 01:27:25,010
specifically why you're special,
you're going to be thinking,

1685
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:26,840
even if you're kind of humbled to begin 
with,

1686
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:27,800
you're going to be thinking,
gees,

1687
01:27:27,801 --> 01:27:31,850
there's got to be something to this man,
but if it's a million people and they're

1688
01:27:31,851 --> 01:27:34,610
roaring their approval,
well,

1689
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:40,210
and then when it's a whole nation,
it's like good luck with standing that 

1690
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:42,350
there's just not a chance.
How are you going to withstand that?

1691
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:48,250
Now you could be like Gandhi and you 
could have taken that into account 

1692
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:50,870
beforehand because he did he read 
tolstoy by the way,

1693
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:55,990
he was a student of tolstoy and that's,
it's very interesting because tolstoy 

1694
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:59,681
was the person who developed the 
techniques of nonviolence that Gandhi 

1695
01:27:59,681 --> 01:27:59,681
used.

1696
01:27:59,681 --> 01:28:03,580
And tolstoy was also a deeply religious 
writer apart from his novels,

1697
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:09,640
which are not,
I wouldn't say really in the religious 

1698
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:09,640
category,
although they're profound,

1699
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:14,730
um,
tolstoy stressed humility with 

1700
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:17,240
nonviolence.
He really stressed that.

1701
01:28:17,241 --> 01:28:20,120
And that's what Gandhi took to heart.
So he lived a very,

1702
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:20,780
very,
very,

1703
01:28:20,781 --> 01:28:23,690
very simple bare bones,
ascetic life.

1704
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:27,680
And that was to kind of see if he could 
keep his damn ego tamp down.

1705
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:30,470
Well,
the groundswell was building behind him,

1706
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,800
you know,
and he dressed really simply and he 

1707
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,421
didn't own much and he ate very simply 
and he just tried to stay away from the 

1708
01:28:37,421 --> 01:28:41,351
whole materialistic success element that
would be an element of what would turn 

1709
01:28:41,351 --> 01:28:42,620
them into an actor and also inflate his 
ego and you know,

1710
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:45,110
he seemed to do that pretty well.
You know,

1711
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:47,360
he certainly.
Well,

1712
01:28:47,361 --> 01:28:50,350
he led a nonviolent revolution that 
resulted in the,

1713
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:55,680
in the independence of India.
It also produced a terrible civil war 

1714
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,681
and the separate separation of the 
Muslim Indians from the Hindu Indians 

1715
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:02,080
and.
But I think you can precisely

1716
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,730
laid out at the feet of Gandhi.
Right?

1717
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:08,760
But,
but what I'm saying is that you have to 

1718
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,130
be an extraordinary person.
You have to be extraordinarily wise and 

1719
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:14,191
you have to take ridiculous precautions 
if you're going to put yourself in the 

1720
01:29:14,191 --> 01:29:17,911
public sphere like that and expose 
yourself to that kind of adulation 

1721
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:20,920
without becoming a puppet of the crowd.
And that's what happened to Hitler.

1722
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,350
I mean,
it's not like he wasn't also a conscious

1723
01:29:23,351 --> 01:29:26,620
manipulator and surrounded himself by 
people who were propagandists.

1724
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,960
And all of that,
so there was a conscious element,

1725
01:29:28,961 --> 01:29:33,961
but you've got to think these things 
through and see how that dialectic 

1726
01:29:33,961 --> 01:29:38,581
develops.
Like he learned how to appeal to the 

1727
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:39,190
darkest fantasies of the crowd.
He was really,

1728
01:29:39,191 --> 01:29:42,700
really good at it and that was a 
dialectic process,

1729
01:29:42,701 --> 01:29:47,701
right?
The crowd told them what they wanted to 

1730
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:47,701
hear and it's the crowds a mob at that 
point.

1731
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:52,770
So I don't have to take responsibility 
for the fact that I'm screaming my 

1732
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:56,281
approval when I'm surrounded by a 
million people so I can scream my 

1733
01:29:56,281 --> 01:30:00,691
approval for whatever I want forever.
Whatever dark revengeful fantasy might 

1734
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:04,060
be playing out in my imagination because
I'm not going to be held accountable for

1735
01:30:04,061 --> 01:30:04,180
it

1736
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:10,000
anyways.
The crickets confused and it's no wonder

1737
01:30:10,001 --> 01:30:14,320
it's like the public has rendered its 
judgment and the judgment is positive.

1738
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:19,030
So when I wrote the book on which this 
course is based,

1739
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,120
I was thinking,
how am I going to judge success?

1740
01:30:22,121 --> 01:30:22,810
And then I thought,
well,

1741
01:30:22,811 --> 01:30:26,950
there's sort of four,
there's a two by two matrix of success.

1742
01:30:26,951 --> 01:30:30,220
You could say it's a great book.
No one reads it.

1743
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,170
That happens.
So what do you,

1744
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:37,200
what do you do about that?
It's like Nietzsche and sold virtually 

1745
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:37,200
nothing in his lifetime.
Right?

1746
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,740
And you know,
that's happened to lots of artists.

1747
01:30:38,741 --> 01:30:42,040
So then it's a terrible book and 
everyone loves it.

1748
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:47,190
That happens too.
And then it's a great book and everyone 

1749
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:47,890
loves it and then it's a terrible book 
and everyone hates it.

1750
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,230
That's probably a better category 
actually,

1751
01:30:50,231 --> 01:30:52,960
that like it's a terrible book that,
and everyone loves it.

1752
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:57,960
I mean,
you wouldn't pick a terrible book that 

1753
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,691
everyone hates if you had a choice,
but at least the quality and the 

1754
01:31:00,691 --> 01:31:02,890
response match,
at least it's truthful light,

1755
01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:04,810
great book,
good response.

1756
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:10,290
But the problem with those four 
categories is you can't really tell 

1757
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:11,110
which category your production falls 
into,

1758
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:13,240
right?
Because how do you know?

1759
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:16,420
And you know,
I think you should assume horrible book,

1760
01:31:16,421 --> 01:31:20,230
bad response because that's the most 
likely of all four of those categories.

1761
01:31:20,231 --> 01:31:22,030
That's the one that's most likely to be 
true,

1762
01:31:22,031 --> 01:31:27,031
but just purely on,
on actuarial ground foot say so.

1763
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:28,600
Alright.
So anyways,

1764
01:31:28,601 --> 01:31:31,060
the cricket wanders away because he 
obviously,

1765
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:36,120
not only was he late for work that day,
but he turned out to be wrong about 

1766
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:36,120
everything.
So we,

1767
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:40,421
let's Pinocchio go off and his adventure
and Stromboli puts them in this little 

1768
01:31:40,421 --> 01:31:40,800
kind of like a,
uh,

1769
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:41,980
uh,
uh,

1770
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:44,140
traveling,
touring wagon,

1771
01:31:44,141 --> 01:31:47,560
you know,
and away they go.

1772
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,000
And the cricket thinks,
well,

1773
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,500
he is an of the conscience isn't needed 
anymore on this journey towards unearned

1774
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:54,310
celebrity.

1775
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:58,070
Well,
meanwhile,

1776
01:31:58,370 --> 01:31:59,980
back at the,
as they say,

1777
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:00,780
um,

1778
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,770
the puppet is supposed to come home 
after school,

1779
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:11,910
but he doesn't,
he doesn't show up.

1780
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:17,570
And the kitten and the fish and Japan,
we were all waiting there for him,

1781
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:23,760
ready to eat.
Excuse me.

1782
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:30,920
But he doesn't show up.
And so Japan goes out into the rain to 

1783
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:34,230
look for him and he can't find them.

1784
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:40,990
And then we're,
we see the inside of the traveling show 

1785
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:45,280
cart and Stromboli is having a snack and
counting all the money that he's made 

1786
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:51,790
from tonight's performance and 
hypothetically dividing it up with a 

1787
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:54,911
puppet.
So we've got this little stack of gold 

1788
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:54,911
and uh,
some of it's false.

1789
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:57,080
So somebody paid with a looks like a 
little Washer,

1790
01:32:57,081 --> 01:32:59,270
like a mechanical Washer,
and it's bent,

1791
01:32:59,690 --> 01:33:04,690
and so he curses about that for awhile 
even though it's interesting because 

1792
01:33:05,061 --> 01:33:07,070
he's made all this money,
it's been really successful.

1793
01:33:07,071 --> 01:33:10,910
But this one little error is enough to 
enrage him,

1794
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,060
which is very ungrateful and tyrannical.
It's like,

1795
01:33:14,061 --> 01:33:16,580
look,
you've got 100 gold pieces.

1796
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,880
Someone slipped you a fake one.
It's like you could have had 101.

1797
01:33:22,821 --> 01:33:25,340
It's still a pretty good day.
All things considered,

1798
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:30,370
you know,
you've got to make a bit of allowance 

1799
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:30,370
for error,
which is something a tyrant does not do.

1800
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:35,260
So and that's perfect because if you 
don't make allowance for error at all,

1801
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:41,260
then people are always guilty of 
something and if you're a tyrant that's 

1802
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:44,330
exactly what you want and people are 
always guilty of something.

1803
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:49,310
So the tyrant who's willing to exploit 
that is always on solid ground.

1804
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:50,570
So

1805
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:57,770
anyways,
he doesn't share with Pinocchio and he 

1806
01:33:57,770 --> 01:34:01,911
puts them in a birdcage jail.
And then he also shows them this other 

1807
01:34:01,911 --> 01:34:05,151
puppet that has an ax through him that 
was the previous puppet who didn't 

1808
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:10,610
precisely perform as he was supposed to.
And so there's a big threat there.

1809
01:34:12,141 --> 01:34:14,540
It's like you stay in that jail,
you do exactly what I want,

1810
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:19,100
or it's off to the woodpile for you to 
be burned.

1811
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And so well that that's just we're 
thinking about because that's kind of 

1812
01:34:25,181 --> 01:34:30,181
what happens with tyrants and so and,
and literally not just metaphorically 

1813
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:31,090
so.

1814
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:39,970
So the cricket is basically wondering 
what in the world he should do.

1815
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:43,770
And then the cart rolls by and he gets 
an inkling or is.

1816
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:48,780
And I don't quite remember this,
that Pinocchio is in there and might be 

1817
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:49,480
in trouble or he thinks that up.
I'm sorry,

1818
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:51,160
I can't remember that.
But he ends up anyways.

1819
01:34:51,161 --> 01:34:56,161
He ends up inside the car and he,
he finds the traveling part and he goes 

1820
01:34:56,161 --> 01:34:59,371
inside and then he tries to pick the 
lock because he's a bug you can climb 

1821
01:34:59,371 --> 01:34:59,990
inside.
He tries to pick the lock.

1822
01:34:59,991 --> 01:35:02,330
He tries to get Pinocchio out of the 
jail that he's been.

1823
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:04,910
And he sort of collaborated himself 
into,

1824
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,140
you know,
and it's,

1825
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:09,980
it's interesting because if you read,
for example,

1826
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:12,170
if you read Solzhenitsyn's Gulag 
archipelago,

1827
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:17,200
which I would highly recommend,
one of the things you find is that if 

1828
01:35:18,951 --> 01:35:22,490
you were arrested by the,
by the KGB,

1829
01:35:22,491 --> 01:35:25,010
by the secret police and in the Soviet 
Union,

1830
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:26,150
and you were

1831
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,160
hauled off to,
uh,

1832
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:30,230
to uh,
to,

1833
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,820
uh,
like a tribunal,

1834
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,920
a Jew before a judge.
They wanted you to admit that you were 

1835
01:35:37,041 --> 01:35:39,650
guilty.
You had to,

1836
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,360
like,
they torture you until you confessed,

1837
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:45,770
or you could just confess and that are 
always found that so mysterious.

1838
01:35:45,771 --> 01:35:50,771
It's like the kick down your door,
they know perfectly well that they 

1839
01:35:50,771 --> 01:35:52,190
haven't got any more on you than they've
got on anyone else.

1840
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:56,720
And yet you have to go through the damn 
trial and you have to admit that they're

1841
01:35:56,721 --> 01:35:57,440
right.
It's like,

1842
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:59,150
why?
Why do they even bother with that?

1843
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:02,660
Why don't they just throw your sorry ass
into the camp,

1844
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,490
which is essentially what's going to 
happen anyways.

1845
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:09,040
Why do they need your collaboration?
No,

1846
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:14,080
I've never quite figured that out.
I think it's partly because they're not 

1847
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:18,611
willing to let you stand in opposition 
to the rules because the mere fact that 

1848
01:36:18,611 --> 01:36:23,561
you will do that means that you exist as
something that is allowed to exist 

1849
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,810
outside the rules and they're not having
any of that,

1850
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:28,970
so that's part of it,

1851
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:33,650
but there's more to it.
There's more to it than that.

1852
01:36:33,651 --> 01:36:38,651
It's like the drama of collaboration.
So one of the things I learned about 

1853
01:36:38,651 --> 01:36:42,401
societies like the Soviet Union,
and this is true of all tyrannical 

1854
01:36:42,401 --> 01:36:45,520
societies,
is that the idea that that's top down 

1855
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:45,650
and that people are just following 
orders.

1856
01:36:45,651 --> 01:36:47,570
They're good people,
but they're just following orders.

1857
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:50,030
It's like you can forget about that.
That's a stupid theory.

1858
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:53,240
When a society becomes tyrannical like 
that,

1859
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:56,390
the tyranny exists at every single level
of the society.

1860
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:00,140
You tyrannized your own conscience.
So let's say you're a true believer.

1861
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:02,600
You're a true believer in Marxist 
Utopia,

1862
01:37:02,601 --> 01:37:05,360
let's say,
or national socialist third,

1863
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:10,361
right?
That's going to last a thousand years 

1864
01:37:10,361 --> 01:37:12,071
and be racially pure.
You really believed that and that's 

1865
01:37:12,071 --> 01:37:14,270
supposed to be a perfect state and 
that's already been delivered to you.

1866
01:37:14,271 --> 01:37:17,150
And so what that means is that in so far
as you're a true believer,

1867
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:22,151
your own suffering becomes heretical 
because to the degree that you're 

1868
01:37:22,151 --> 01:37:26,411
suffering and you're living proof of the
fact that the system is not delivering 

1869
01:37:26,411 --> 01:37:27,830
what it promised to deliver,
and so you have to suppress that.

1870
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:32,830
You have to become your own tyrant.
You can't admit that anything's gone 

1871
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:36,491
wrong,
and of course you can't talk about a 

1872
01:37:36,491 --> 01:37:36,500
tier family because one out of three of 
them are government informers,

1873
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:41,670
just like one out of three of everyone.
And you're certainly not going to 

1874
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:44,771
mention it in the workplace because 
unless you're a devout communist party 

1875
01:37:44,771 --> 01:37:45,170
member,
you're not going anywhere.

1876
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:49,550
And if any of your ancestors were like 
land owners or or bourgeoisie,

1877
01:37:49,551 --> 01:37:52,250
it's like you're done.
You're done class guilt,

1878
01:37:52,251 --> 01:37:54,080
man.
You're not going anywhere.

1879
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:58,680
And then every single level of the 
bureaucracy is exactly the same as that.

1880
01:37:58,681 --> 01:38:01,770
And on the top there is a tyrant,
but the tyrant is everywhere,

1881
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:06,540
everywhere from the peak to the soul.
It's all tyranny.

1882
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:10,620
And everyone participates in that by 
lying about everything.

1883
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,930
And that's why you see what happens 
next.

1884
01:38:12,931 --> 01:38:13,740
In the,
in the movie,

1885
01:38:13,741 --> 01:38:18,741
So Pinocchio was in jail and he,
he's there because he was naive and he 

1886
01:38:19,231 --> 01:38:24,231
allowed himself to be enticed to because
he did something that would've run 

1887
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:25,860
contrary to his conscience,
but the movie doesn't put up Straw man,

1888
01:38:25,861 --> 01:38:30,861
you know,
the poor damn puppet got tangled into 

1889
01:38:30,861 --> 01:38:30,861
this is conscience wasn't even around.

1890
01:38:30,861 --> 01:38:33,450
So you have to have some sympathy for 
them but doesn't matter.

1891
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:39,380
It doesn't matter because he ends up in 
jail and he can't get out.

1892
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:45,060
And the fact that it in some ways wasn't
his fault,

1893
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:48,360
doesn't change the fact that he's in 
jail and he can't get out.

1894
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:53,220
And then his is.
I was watching Louis c k the other night

1895
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:59,420
and he was talking about children lying.
He was talking about his nine year old 

1896
01:38:59,420 --> 01:38:59,430
daughter lying.
And he said,

1897
01:38:59,431 --> 01:39:00,210
well,
it's no,

1898
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:05,690
it's no wonder your children lie and 
it's no wonder it's impossible for you 

1899
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:10,041
to stop them because you know,
you're talking to someone who's his head

1900
01:39:10,561 --> 01:39:15,561
would scrape the roof.
They weigh like three times as much as 

1901
01:39:15,561 --> 01:39:18,441
you and they're capable of force and 
they're intimidating and they say to you

1902
01:39:18,901 --> 01:39:20,190
something like,
could you,

1903
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:23,460
could you take that last cookie after I 
told you not to?

1904
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,560
And you're thinking,
oh no,

1905
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:28,620
I took a cookie.
What am I going to do?

1906
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,930
And then you,
you,

1907
01:39:29,931 --> 01:39:32,880
you get a genius idea in your head which
children,

1908
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:37,970
smarter children learn to lie earlier.
Children with high Iq is learned to lie 

1909
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:39,450
younger and and Ck says,
well,

1910
01:39:39,451 --> 01:39:41,760
it's like you've just been handed a 
magic.

1911
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:44,280
Get out of jail free card.
You can just say,

1912
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:47,730
no,
I didn't take that cookie and worse than

1913
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:50,760
that,
it works in every single situation.

1914
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:55,300
If you get away with it and now you're 
supposed to learn not to do that.

1915
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:57,480
I said,
well great.

1916
01:39:57,481 --> 01:39:59,670
So that's the thing about Comedians,
you know,

1917
01:39:59,671 --> 01:40:04,671
they'll tell you the underlying truth,
which is why people think they're so 

1918
01:40:04,671 --> 01:40:05,700
funny,
like the gesture and it King's court,

1919
01:40:05,701 --> 01:40:10,701
right?
He's the only one who's allowed to tell 

1920
01:40:10,701 --> 01:40:10,701
the king the truth because he's beneath 
contempt.

1921
01:40:10,701 --> 01:40:10,890
That's what comedians do.

1922
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:12,750
And so.
Well,

1923
01:40:12,751 --> 01:40:13,920
so what happens is,
well,

1924
01:40:13,921 --> 01:40:15,720
Pinocchio Pinocchio's not very happy 
about this,

1925
01:40:15,721 --> 01:40:20,721
right?
It's really breaking them up and the 

1926
01:40:20,721 --> 01:40:21,180
blue fairy appears again from the star.
Same Way.

1927
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:26,181
So what this means is,
is I think this is right,

1928
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:31,610
this is something you've talked about it
and it was also extraordinarily 

1929
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:34,521
brilliant.
He said that it's one thing to break a 

1930
01:40:34,521 --> 01:40:37,620
rule when you don't really know the rule
you can,

1931
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:41,040
for whatever reason,
you seem to get a bit of a free pass for

1932
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:46,041
that,
but if then you know the rule and then 

1933
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:47,910
you break it anyways,
you get hit a lot harder.

1934
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:53,090
And I know that's true and I even think 
I figured out why it was true at one 

1935
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:53,740
point,
but I can't remember the moment,

1936
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,350
but there's something,
there's something about,

1937
01:40:56,380 --> 01:41:01,380
it's like the severity of a moral error 
isn't quite as massive if you're 

1938
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:05,610
genuinely ignorant and unconscious about
the rule and maybe it's because you're 

1939
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:09,220
not violating your own belief system as 
much when you engage in the activity.

1940
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:11,470
It's something like that.
So.

1941
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,040
So anyways,
Pinocchio is in there and he,

1942
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:19,270
he's partly at fault at least because 
he's naive and,

1943
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:24,800
and he's very desperate about it,
but it's also because his conscience 

1944
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:29,161
isn't functioning very well,
so he has his reasons and so whatever 

1945
01:41:29,161 --> 01:41:32,740
the blue fairy shows up again,
mother nature steps in to aid him.

1946
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:38,190
And so,
and that is true I would say because 

1947
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:41,070
it's not like you get walloped or killed
every time you make a mistake,

1948
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:43,810
right?
It's,

1949
01:41:43,811 --> 01:41:45,400
it's,
it's kind of interesting.

1950
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:49,560
And especially that's the case with kids
is like we have more leeway from,

1951
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,430
for them,
whether nature does,

1952
01:41:51,431 --> 01:41:54,330
that's a different issue.
But I would say yes because you know,

1953
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:57,130
kids are really cute and they're 
appealing and so,

1954
01:41:57,370 --> 01:42:02,370
and they're,
they're naive and they're kind of 

1955
01:42:02,370 --> 01:42:04,621
helpless.
They have those motions even that 

1956
01:42:04,621 --> 01:42:04,690
indicate helplessness and that's 
associated with the natural apprehension

1957
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:05,650
of cuteness.

1958
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:08,260
Right?
So cuteness is big eyes,

1959
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:11,830
small knows symmetrical features,
baby like features.

1960
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:14,070
I'm helpless movements.
Um,

1961
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:18,910
that elicits sympathy and compassion and
it doesn't cross species.

1962
01:42:18,911 --> 01:42:23,140
And so does the cry.
And my roommate when I was in college,

1963
01:42:23,141 --> 01:42:27,370
had a niece who is quite young,
boat year and half old,

1964
01:42:27,371 --> 01:42:30,910
I think,
and we had a cat wildcat and uh,

1965
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:37,150
and it was really fighty cat,
partly because of me because I would 

1966
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:38,140
always play with it and it would let him
fight with me quite a lot.

1967
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:39,720
So was a fighty cat.
And,

1968
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:40,330
and,
uh,

1969
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:43,210
that little girl would come over and,
you know,

1970
01:42:43,211 --> 01:42:48,211
maybe she'd cry that cat was like,
they are right now trying to figure out 

1971
01:42:48,211 --> 01:42:49,930
what was wrong and the like,
the cat would use its claws on me,

1972
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:52,390
but it would never use its claws on the 
little kid,

1973
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:53,740
you know.
And I thought,

1974
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:58,920
well that's,
that's indication of that cross species 

1975
01:42:58,920 --> 01:42:58,920
cuteness,
you know,

1976
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,010
and,
and you're all attracted to that more or

1977
01:43:00,011 --> 01:43:00,400
less.

1978
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:05,400
And the more maternal you are,
the more you're attracted to such 

1979
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:05,400
things.
But you know,

1980
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,250
you see something on Youtube and you go,
ah.

1981
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:08,170
And that's like,
that's so cute.

1982
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:08,740
It's like,
yeah,

1983
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:09,250
it is,
it,

1984
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:13,270
it appeals to exactly this.
It,

1985
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:14,710
it.
If it appeals to this,

1986
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:19,330
couldn't commentation of infantile 
features.

1987
01:43:19,510 --> 01:43:20,860
And,
and,

1988
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:25,861
uh,
it brings out compassion unless you're 

1989
01:43:25,861 --> 01:43:26,620
psychopathic,
so it's a good thing,

1990
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:29,170
but you know,
it can be manipulated,

1991
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:34,200
that's for sure.
Women actually manipulate it with 

1992
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:34,200
makeup,
which is quite,

1993
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:37,960
quite sneaky and go to them.
So anyways,

1994
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:42,460
so the blue fairy shows up,
so that's nature.

1995
01:43:42,461 --> 01:43:47,461
So what I'm saying is that nature will 
cut kids a break if you think of nature 

1996
01:43:47,461 --> 01:43:49,030
in the guise of,
well their mother for example,

1997
01:43:49,031 --> 01:43:54,031
but even the biology of other,
because we're wired to accept behavior 

1998
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:56,600
from children that we wouldn't accept 
from other people.

1999
01:43:56,990 --> 01:44:01,990
So nature will forgive.
So she shows up in your heavenly guys 

2000
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:07,430
and says what's going on?
And Pinocchio again,

2001
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:09,890
because he's not youth,
but also because he's not good.

2002
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:12,000
He's not evil either.
He's,

2003
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:14,570
he's neither or both.
It depends on how you look at it.

2004
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:19,990
And he also has no idea how smart he is 
and how smart he isn't or how smart the 

2005
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:21,960
person he's talking to his.
And uh,

2006
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:26,030
instead of admitting what he's done,
he lies about it.

2007
01:44:26,031 --> 01:44:31,031
And that's interesting because it does 
suggest that he understands at some 

2008
01:44:31,161 --> 01:44:34,660
level that he set himself up for this 
because you know,

2009
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:36,620
he could just say,
he could have just told the truth,

2010
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:41,950
this horrible Fox kidnap me and sold me 
to this slave holder,

2011
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:49,360
which is true.
It's a lot more true than the story he 

2012
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:49,790
tells.
He tells a story about some monster,

2013
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,830
you know,
a fictional monster.

2014
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:55,550
He coulda told even three quarters of 
the truth and how it work.

2015
01:44:55,551 --> 01:44:58,610
But he doesn't.
He just obscures the story entirely.

2016
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,130
And this is the part of the movie that 
people remember.

2017
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:05,120
And I'd edited this out for years when I
was talking about this movie.

2018
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:10,300
I forgot why it was so significant 
because nose grows right and it grows 

2019
01:45:12,111 --> 01:45:15,740
too ridiculous length.
And why is that?

2020
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:22,860
I think it was Mark Twain,
Samuel Clemens,

2021
01:45:22,861 --> 01:45:27,861
I think who said,
one of the advantages to telling the 

2022
01:45:27,861 --> 01:45:31,101
truth is that you don't have to remember
what you said and that God that's worth 

2023
01:45:31,101 --> 01:45:31,920
listening to because.

2024
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:40,680
So there's a bunch of things I've 
learned as a clinician and one of them 

2025
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:44,761
is because you're often in really weird 
situations with people if you're a 

2026
01:45:44,761 --> 01:45:46,150
clinician because things happen that 
don't happen normally and you don't know

2027
01:45:46,151 --> 01:45:51,151
what to do.
And so what I've learned is I just say 

2028
01:45:51,151 --> 01:45:51,151
what I just say,
what's happening,

2029
01:45:51,151 --> 01:45:52,450
whatever it is,
regardless of what it is,

2030
01:45:52,451 --> 01:45:57,451
you know,
I'll just try to describe it as 

2031
01:45:57,451 --> 01:45:57,670
accurately as I can and not worry about 
in some sense,

2032
01:45:57,671 --> 01:45:59,530
not worried about the consequences,
you know,

2033
01:45:59,531 --> 01:46:01,360
like I'm not going out of my way to 
cause trouble.

2034
01:46:01,361 --> 01:46:06,361
But if you're in a really,
and I'm telling you this can save your 

2035
01:46:06,361 --> 01:46:09,241
life at times,
especially if you're dealing with 

2036
01:46:09,241 --> 01:46:09,241
someone who's paranoid,
who's really paranoid,

2037
01:46:09,241 --> 01:46:11,690
you do not lie to someone who's paranoid
and violet.

2038
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:17,460
Because as soon as you lie,
you're aligned with the forces that are 

2039
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:20,551
persecuting them and they're going to be
because paranoid it makes people 

2040
01:46:20,551 --> 01:46:20,830
hypervigilant,
like they're on amphetamines.

2041
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:26,160
In fact,
you can make people paranoid by giving 

2042
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,561
them enough amphetamines and you can 
make paranoid people more paranoid by 

2043
01:46:28,561 --> 01:46:30,150
giving them amphetamines.
So they're hypervigilant.

2044
01:46:30,430 --> 01:46:33,190
Because they feel that everything is 
predatory and against them,

2045
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:38,460
and so they're watching you like you 
would not believe way more than you're 

2046
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:42,001
watching them.
And if you flicker ally while you're 

2047
01:46:42,001 --> 01:46:43,570
talking to them and they're really on 
the edge,

2048
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:45,310
you,
you're done.

2049
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:50,820
So it's what?
It's one thing to really know if you're 

2050
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:51,390
ever in a really bad situation and you 
don't know what to do,

2051
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:55,680
you tell the truth.
Minimally you don't disclose too much.

2052
01:46:55,681 --> 01:47:00,681
That's just another lie.
You tell the truth minimally and 

2053
01:47:00,681 --> 01:47:04,290
carefully and hopefully,
and you might get out of it,

2054
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:08,040
you might get out of it,
but if you falsify it,

2055
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:12,600
look the hell out.
So the truth is a real.

2056
01:47:12,601 --> 01:47:15,930
It's a real mechanism of protection in 
dangerous situations.

2057
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,510
You know?
So if someone's trying to intimidate you

2058
01:47:18,511 --> 01:47:20,290
and you,
you think they might get violent,

2059
01:47:20,291 --> 01:47:25,200
that they ask you if you're afraid,
then you tell them that you're terrified

2060
01:47:25,201 --> 01:47:27,450
and that you hope that things will go 
okay.

2061
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:28,710
Or you say,

2062
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:35,800
I'll give you an example.
One time I was in an airport and uh,

2063
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:41,630
we're in this lineup to fly back to 
Canada that said international flights.

2064
01:47:41,631 --> 01:47:45,190
And so as long line up like 50 people 
and we got it,

2065
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:50,530
I got about three from the front,
it was still like 40 people behind me 

2066
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:53,531
and the guy behind the counter decided 
that he was just going to shut down the 

2067
01:47:53,531 --> 01:47:53,960
line and that we could all go to this 
other line,

2068
01:47:53,961 --> 01:47:58,961
which was like 300 people long and I 
suggested that he not do that because 

2069
01:47:58,961 --> 01:48:03,911
we'd been standing there for half an 
hour and that he could just deal with 

2070
01:48:03,911 --> 01:48:05,780
the 20 of us that were less than and 
like have a clue.

2071
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,840
So he called the sheriff right away and 
this was down in Florida and it wasn't 

2072
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:15,551
that long after nine slash 11.
And so these guys came up and they were 

2073
01:48:15,551 --> 01:48:18,791
armed and they came and said,
looked at me because of course he told 

2074
01:48:18,791 --> 01:48:20,780
them that I was causing trouble,
which I wasn't.

2075
01:48:20,781 --> 01:48:22,100
I was just trying to not

2076
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:24,420
left.

2077
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:30,790
What would you say?
An arrogant bureaucratic scum rat take 

2078
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:34,601
advantage of me.
So which is not the same as causing 

2079
01:48:34,601 --> 01:48:34,601
trouble.
So anyways,

2080
01:48:34,601 --> 01:48:35,630
as soon as the cops came up,
I said,

2081
01:48:35,631 --> 01:48:39,110
look,
I'm going to do exactly what you tell me

2082
01:48:39,111 --> 01:48:42,080
to do right now and I'm not going to 
cause any trouble,

2083
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,570
but I would like you to hear what 
actually happened.

2084
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:49,990
And so that,
that's a good example of a situation 

2085
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:49,990
like that.
It's like if someone's got,

2086
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:52,580
you know,
Bravo Bravado,

2087
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:56,990
it's a very bad idea and I was going to 
do exactly what they told me because you

2088
01:48:56,991 --> 01:48:57,230
know,

2089
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:01,890
they didn't know who I was and I didn't 
know what they had been told.

2090
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:06,950
So anyhow,
the problem with lying is that it's a 

2091
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:11,871
hydro and kids find this out very early 
because you tell one lie and what 

2092
01:49:12,181 --> 01:49:14,850
happens is it has one of the 
consequences that you expect.

2093
01:49:14,851 --> 01:49:17,190
Maybe you'd get away with it,
but it has three or four others that you

2094
01:49:17,191 --> 01:49:19,860
don't expect.
And so it's like it grows some,

2095
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:25,340
some complexity and then you have to 
tack a lie on each of those little 

2096
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:29,331
complexity outcrops.
And then they grow three more 

2097
01:49:29,331 --> 01:49:31,680
complexities and soon this little light 
turns into great big ball of lies.

2098
01:49:31,681 --> 01:49:34,890
And at some point it becomes painfully 
evident to everyone,

2099
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:40,070
and by that time you're in such,
you see this with politicians like that 

2100
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,550
guy who was sexting.
Um,

2101
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:42,300
Anthony Wiener.
Yeah.

2102
01:49:42,301 --> 01:49:43,650
Perfect name for him,
man.

2103
01:49:43,651 --> 01:49:44,340
It's so funny.

2104
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:50,060
Uh,
I shouldn't make that comment because 

2105
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:50,060
it's so obvious,
but it's still funny,

2106
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:50,350
but you know,
he,

2107
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:52,330
that's exactly what happened to him.
It's like,

2108
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,710
it wasn't even so much the event because
people are stupid.

2109
01:49:56,711 --> 01:50:01,711
They make mistakes.
And actually the public is somewhat 

2110
01:50:01,711 --> 01:50:01,810
forgiving if you say,
yeah,

2111
01:50:01,811 --> 01:50:03,580
Jesus,
I'm a real moron and you know,

2112
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:06,400
like really seriously,
how could I do that?

2113
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:09,400
But I did.
And like I'll try not to do it again.

2114
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:14,700
But what happens with politicians is,
and I'm not speaking specifically of 

2115
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:19,081
politicians,
is they'll make an error and it gets 

2116
01:50:19,081 --> 01:50:19,540
exposed and then they make three others 
trying to cover it up.

2117
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:22,390
Happened with Nixon for example.
And then the whole thing just turns into

2118
01:50:22,391 --> 01:50:27,391
a complete scandal.
And maybe they could have got out of it 

2119
01:50:27,391 --> 01:50:28,690
at the beginning by just telling the 
truth.

2120
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:29,680
It's like,
yes,

2121
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:31,840
I'm an idiot.
You know,

2122
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:37,860
I'll try not to do it again.
Well that isn't what happens in this 

2123
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:41,791
case in Pinocchio grows this elaborate 
series of lies and the ferry is willing 

2124
01:50:43,421 --> 01:50:48,421
to be a little generous to him because 
he's little and cute and he's still a 

2125
01:50:48,421 --> 01:50:49,540
puppet and she tells him

2126
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:55,200
not to do that and that she's going to 
give them a pass this time,

2127
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:59,100
but that she isn't going to be able to 
intervene on his behalf again.

2128
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:04,340
And that's partly one of the things 
that's quite interesting about people 

2129
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:04,560
who have roots,
Soliah and ideas about children.

2130
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:07,740
So children are all good and they get 
corrupted by society,

2131
01:51:08,130 --> 01:51:13,130
which is half true because they're also 
not good and they get shaped and,

2132
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:17,310
and discipline by society.
But there were so many types.

2133
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:22,350
Softer are very interesting when their 
kids hit teenage years or when they're 

2134
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:25,620
judging,
like say criminal teenagers.

2135
01:51:25,621 --> 01:51:28,700
It's like the child is perfect until 
they hit like 11.

2136
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:31,590
Then they turned into a teenager and 
then they're like thugs.

2137
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:34,200
So they go from good to thug in one 
move.

2138
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:34,830
You know?
And,

2139
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:40,250
and you often see that in families too 
that have treated especially their 

2140
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:40,680
daughters like a princess,
you know,

2141
01:51:40,681 --> 01:51:45,681
and then they hit puberty and the 
parents who have princess them to death 

2142
01:51:45,681 --> 01:51:49,470
have no idea what to do with them.
And so then they become demonized and so

2143
01:51:49,471 --> 01:51:54,471
the,
the overly good that child turns into 

2144
01:51:54,471 --> 01:51:57,711
the overly wicked teenager and sometimes
they lack that out to one of the things 

2145
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,100
I've seen with girls who are

2146
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:05,780
held in princess esteem when they're 
little and their parents have too tight 

2147
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:07,440
of a grip on them and too much of a 
demand for good behaviors,

2148
01:52:07,441 --> 01:52:11,220
they'll find some nasty character to 
associate with who will tear them out of

2149
01:52:11,221 --> 01:52:12,430
the family.
You know,

2150
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:14,310
bikers are really good for that sort of 
thing.

2151
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:17,490
So you.
And especially if you have some vengeful

2152
01:52:17,491 --> 01:52:22,491
thoughts towards your parents,
nice biker is your perfect solution to 

2153
01:52:22,491 --> 01:52:22,491
that problem.

2154
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:35,340
Okay.
We'll go through this scene and then I 

2155
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:35,340
think we'll call it a day.
Okay.

2156
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:37,720
So now Pinocchio was gone free.
He's been united with his conscience.

2157
01:52:37,721 --> 01:52:42,550
He's learned a couple of lessons.
Don't be an actor and don't lie.

2158
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:44,630
And those things are quite similar,
right?

2159
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:48,110
And especially once you're caught in 
your actor trap,

2160
01:52:48,111 --> 01:52:50,510
don't lie to get out because that will 
just make it worse.

2161
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:55,850
So that's the first of his trials,
his moral trials on the road to becoming

2162
01:52:55,851 --> 01:52:57,110
real.
All right now,

2163
01:52:57,111 --> 01:52:59,210
now here we are at a different place.
We're at this,

2164
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:03,080
I think it's called the red lobster in.
It's a shadowy place,

2165
01:53:03,081 --> 01:53:04,430
right?
It's kind of cave like,

2166
01:53:04,431 --> 01:53:09,431
so it's like the,
it's an underground entrance to 

2167
01:53:09,431 --> 01:53:09,710
somewhere that's not good.
And so,

2168
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:12,470
and it's a foggy night and you can't 
really see.

2169
01:53:12,471 --> 01:53:15,050
So everything's murky and,
and gloomy.

2170
01:53:15,051 --> 01:53:20,051
They're.
And so inside we see the coachman and 

2171
01:53:20,051 --> 01:53:24,290
the Fox and uh,
had an acat and the coachman.

2172
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,430
The coachman is a bad guy.
He's that mask that we saw.

2173
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:31,580
First of all,
he's the archetype of that mask that was

2174
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,980
judgmental about Pinocchio having a 
voice.

2175
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:37,310
And it's like one of the things you said
about the shadow,

2176
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:43,060
and this is I would say,
one of the primary impediments to 

2177
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:45,080
enlightenment is that if you start 
looking at your motives for,

2178
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:46,920
for misbehaving,
and,

2179
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:49,580
and I mean by that,
something very specific.

2180
01:53:49,581 --> 01:53:54,581
I mean,
I don't mean that you're misbehaving by 

2181
01:53:54,581 --> 01:53:54,581
someone else's standards.
I don't mean that.

2182
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:59,860
I mean when you know by your own 
standards that you're doing something 

2183
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:00,800
that's devious or malevolent or 
underhanded,

2184
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:05,801
you know it and you still do it.
So it's your own judgment you're 

2185
01:54:05,801 --> 01:54:09,140
bringing to bear on yourself.
If you look at why you're doing that,

2186
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:12,710
the longer you look at it,
the deeper hole you dig.

2187
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:16,910
And so this is the Motif of Dante's 
inferno fundamentally.

2188
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:20,790
So Dante is inferno is a story about,
um,

2189
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:24,290
I can't remember his name,
unfortunately,

2190
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:25,670
might be Dante,
in fact,

2191
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:28,610
although I don't remember.
He's led into hell by Virgil,

2192
01:54:28,670 --> 01:54:30,050
who's an,
who's an ancient,

2193
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:35,470
who was an ancient philosopher,
thinker and hell has levels.

2194
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:39,860
And so the outer level is,
this is a Christianized version of hell.

2195
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,530
Um,
because there's hells of all sorts,

2196
01:54:42,531 --> 01:54:47,531
but this is a christianized version 
version and so the on the outermost 

2197
01:54:47,531 --> 01:54:51,430
levels of hell,
which is sort of like normal life are 

2198
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:54,851
the ancient philosophers and they're 
still in hell because they weren't 

2199
01:54:54,851 --> 01:54:55,100
Christian,
but it's kind of like,

2200
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,750
it's like cheap motel hell instead of 
the full pip thing,

2201
01:54:59,751 --> 01:55:04,520
you know?
And so then Dante goes deeper and deeper

2202
01:55:04,521 --> 01:55:06,770
into hell until it gets right to the 
bottom of it.

2203
01:55:06,771 --> 01:55:09,770
And it's been a while since I read it,
but if I remember correctly,

2204
01:55:09,771 --> 01:55:13,160
Satan himself is encased in ice at the 
bottom of hell,

2205
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:15,590
surrounded by people who betray others.

2206
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:20,980
And so Dante,
his notion was that the worst of all 

2207
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:23,801
possible violations of moral behavior 
was betrayal and that they're in the 

2208
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:25,980
deepest levels of hell.
And I,

2209
01:55:25,981 --> 01:55:30,981
I really liked that idea.
I think it's true because if you trust 

2210
01:55:30,981 --> 01:55:34,571
me,
then you're manifesting the necessary 

2211
01:55:34,571 --> 01:55:34,571
courage that put someone through life.
You know,

2212
01:55:34,571 --> 01:55:36,980
if you're smart,
you don't trust me cause you're naive.

2213
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:41,060
You Trust me knowing that I've full of 
snakes and so are you.

2214
01:55:41,061 --> 01:55:45,000
But maybe we could cooperate and move 
things along nicely,

2215
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:50,030
we know and we could reduce each other 
to the word to our word and we could 

2216
01:55:50,030 --> 01:55:51,030
cooperate,
but you're awake,

2217
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:56,650
you know,
and then I'd be trey that then I'm 

2218
01:55:56,650 --> 01:55:59,391
undermining your necessary faith in,
in life and humanity and you can really 

2219
01:56:00,421 --> 01:56:03,780
hurt someone that way.
Like the sometimes it's self betrayal,

2220
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:06,000
but you can really do someone in that.

2221
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,000
We can really traumatize them.
They can so that they can't recover and 

2222
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,601
so it's a really terrible thing to do to
someone and maybe it's the worst thing 

2223
01:56:14,601 --> 01:56:18,171
and that was don idea and it's tied in.
That makes very interesting reading.

2224
01:56:18,361 --> 01:56:21,870
If you read it at the same time as 
Milton's paradise lost because those are

2225
01:56:21,871 --> 01:56:25,020
metaphysical explorations.
This is what they are.

2226
01:56:25,021 --> 01:56:30,021
They're metaphysical explorations of the
terrible places you can end up and that 

2227
01:56:30,021 --> 01:56:34,731
people do end up and also a metaphysical
explanation of what spirit takes you 

2228
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:37,320
there.
So because you might ask,

2229
01:56:37,321 --> 01:56:42,321
well why do you be traced someone?
And that is a deep question and so 

2230
01:56:43,021 --> 01:56:48,021
you'll have your specific reasons.
But under that there'll be some other 

2231
01:56:48,021 --> 01:56:48,021
reasons.
And under that,

2232
01:56:48,021 --> 01:56:52,041
there'll be some other reasons and under
that there'll be some other reasons and 

2233
01:56:52,041 --> 01:56:55,431
if you go all the way to the bottom,
you come up with the ultimate reasons 

2234
01:56:55,431 --> 01:56:55,431
why you'd be trade someone.

2235
01:56:55,431 --> 01:56:57,570
And when you look at that,
that will not be pretty.

2236
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:02,960
That's when your proclivity for evil,
let's say you nights with the general 

2237
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:07,341
human proclivity for evil and you 
discover just exactly what you're 

2238
01:57:07,341 --> 01:57:09,690
capable of.
And so young's notion was that,

2239
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,760
well that was a full encounter with the 
shadow,

2240
01:57:11,761 --> 01:57:16,761
which is I suppose partly what this 
course is about because one of the 

2241
01:57:16,761 --> 01:57:18,660
things that I believe I told you at the 
beginning was that I was going to try to

2242
01:57:18,661 --> 01:57:23,661
help you understand how it might be that
you could be in Auschwitz guard and to 

2243
01:57:25,381 --> 01:57:28,560
really understand that that's a 
horrifying thing to understand.

2244
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:32,220
But I'll tell you,
if you want to grow some teeth,

2245
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:34,650
that's a really good thing to 
understand.

2246
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:38,250
So we were talking about your capacity 
to negotiate before.

2247
01:57:38,490 --> 01:57:43,110
Like if you aren't a monster,
you cannot negotiate.

2248
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:46,830
But if you,
if you've got that under control,

2249
01:57:47,730 --> 01:57:49,740
then you don't have to be a monster.

2250
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:52,980
It's really paradoxical.
So if you're just naive,

2251
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:58,040
well you end up in jail and marionette 
master has control over you.

2252
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:01,140
That's not helpful.
So that's not good.

2253
01:58:01,141 --> 01:58:03,600
That just means you're useless and you 
can be manipulated,

2254
01:58:03,601 --> 01:58:05,700
won't go out of your way to be 
malevolent.

2255
01:58:05,701 --> 01:58:08,060
But it's mostly because you just don't 
have the skills,

2256
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:12,030
the organizational skills or,
or even the depth to do that.

2257
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:14,640
You know you're good because you're 
harmless.

2258
01:58:14,641 --> 01:58:17,820
That's not good.
That's easily manipulated.

2259
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:20,340
And so you think,
well how do you get out of that?

2260
01:58:20,341 --> 01:58:23,310
Well,
partly you watch people because you know

2261
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:26,370
what their light because you know what 
you're like and that,

2262
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:30,270
but you also know what you could do and 
would do if you were pushed.

2263
01:58:30,271 --> 01:58:35,271
And so you don't have to show much of 
that when you're negotiating with 

2264
01:58:35,271 --> 01:58:35,970
someone for them to take you really 
seriously.

2265
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:39,210
So it's a strange thing,
you know.

2266
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:44,210
But one of the things you pointed out 
too was that what you most need to know 

2267
01:58:44,210 --> 01:58:46,270
will be found where you least want to 
look.

2268
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:51,540
And that's because you haven't already 
looked there and so it's a little 

2269
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:51,540
different for everyone,
right?

2270
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:56,521
Because you're a particular place you'd 
want to look isn't going to be the same 

2271
01:58:56,521 --> 01:58:59,581
as your replace,
but you're going to have a place you 

2272
01:58:59,581 --> 01:58:59,710
don't want to look and what you haven't 
discovered.

2273
01:58:59,711 --> 01:59:04,711
That's where it is.
And so that's partly going to be 

2274
01:59:04,711 --> 01:59:06,010
discovered by you looking at what you're
capable of,

2275
01:59:06,011 --> 01:59:08,380
what you're truly capable of.
And you know,

2276
01:59:08,770 --> 01:59:11,630
people especially on the Compassionate 
and say,

2277
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:16,680
well no,
I could never be like brutal like that 

2278
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:17,290
and that could be true,
but you can kill people with compassion.

2279
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:18,690
No problem.
It happens.

2280
01:59:18,691 --> 01:59:23,691
That's the Freudian eatable situation.
So think about working in a nursing 

2281
01:59:23,691 --> 01:59:23,691
home.

2282
01:59:23,691 --> 01:59:28,560
So there's actually a rule it's thumb,
which I also use to guide my 

2283
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:29,170
interactions with children and also with
my clients.

2284
01:59:29,171 --> 01:59:34,171
And I would say with people in general 
do not do anything for anyone that they 

2285
01:59:34,171 --> 01:59:36,700
can do themselves.
All you do is steal.

2286
01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:41,930
You just steal it from them.
So imagine you're working with really 

2287
01:59:41,930 --> 01:59:41,930
elderly people.
You know they have Alzheimer's.

2288
01:59:41,930 --> 01:59:44,860
It's like really easy to do things for 
them because while it isn't,

2289
01:59:44,890 --> 01:59:49,890
because it's really a hard job,
but it might be easier to do something 

2290
01:59:49,890 --> 01:59:51,640
for them then to let them struggle 
through it,

2291
01:59:52,330 --> 01:59:54,130
but you just speed their device.
Right.

2292
01:59:54,131 --> 01:59:59,131
By taking away the last vestiges of 
their independence and you do the same 

2293
01:59:59,131 --> 01:59:59,980
thing with kids.
It's like struggle through it.

2294
01:59:59,981 --> 02:00:02,470
Man.
Did you ever see my left foot?

2295
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:08,820
That's a great movie.
It's about this author whose name 

2296
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:08,820
escapes me at the moment.

2297
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:13,320
Brilliant.
It's brilliant movie and the person who 

2298
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:16,110
who played the part is Daniel Day Lewis.
I think he went to academy award for it,

2299
02:00:16,721 --> 02:00:20,140
but it's about this author in Ireland 
who was.

2300
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:24,880
I think he had cerebral palsy and all he
could really do was use his left foot.

2301
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:29,940
That was it.
The rest of him was pretty spastic and 

2302
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:30,250
not in not controllable,
but he was there.

2303
02:00:30,251 --> 02:00:35,251
He was very intelligent.
He was with it and his dad would not 

2304
02:00:35,251 --> 02:00:38,761
help him.
He had to drag himself up the damn 

2305
02:00:38,761 --> 02:00:39,400
stairs with his left foot.
He just would not help him.

2306
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:42,310
And what happened was he learned how to 
live,

2307
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:43,540
you know,
he actually,

2308
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:47,140
he could function and the movie does the
book,

2309
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:52,650
which is called my left foot and the 
movie does a lovely job of laying that 

2310
02:00:52,650 --> 02:00:55,411
out,
but you have to be one hardhearted son 

2311
02:00:55,411 --> 02:00:57,370
of a bitch to let your son crawl up the 
stairs with his left foot over and over.

2312
02:00:57,700 --> 02:01:00,520
You think about that.
But what's the alternative,

2313
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:02,290
you know,
if he would have been.

2314
02:01:02,510 --> 02:01:04,150
And of course he lays this out in the 
book,

2315
02:01:04,151 --> 02:01:09,151
if he would have been catered to,
he would have ended up just like you'd 

2316
02:01:10,241 --> 02:01:15,241
expect someone who is always catered to.
So it's a very nice lesson in the 

2317
02:01:18,551 --> 02:01:21,610
triumph of fostering independence over 
the,

2318
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:25,600
over to casual compassion.
That's what I would say.

2319
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:28,240
Oh,
so you look at the coachman here kind of

2320
02:01:28,241 --> 02:01:30,280
looks like a demented Santa Claus.
You know,

2321
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,930
it doesn't have a beard,
but he's,

2322
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:34,310
it's a nice touch on the animators 
parties.

2323
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:38,560
Even got the pipe and the red suit.
And so he's listening to the Fox and the

2324
02:01:38,561 --> 02:01:43,040
cat brag about how much money they made 
selling Pinocchio to the puppet master.

2325
02:01:43,041 --> 02:01:48,041
And how evil and terrible they are,
and they're bragging way and he's the 

2326
02:01:48,041 --> 02:01:48,041
real thing.
Hey,

2327
02:01:48,041 --> 02:01:49,370
he's,
he's the real thing.

2328
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:52,160
And he can see through their little 
petty,

2329
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:57,340
narcissistic,
grandiose tales of criminality and has 

2330
02:01:57,340 --> 02:02:01,301
nothing but contempt for it.
And you can see that in his facial 

2331
02:02:01,301 --> 02:02:04,661
expression.
It's like you sitting back a bit 

2332
02:02:04,661 --> 02:02:04,661
thinking,
keep talking.

2333
02:02:04,661 --> 02:02:05,360
Bucko pretty soon I'm going to have,
you're right where I want you.

2334
02:02:05,630 --> 02:02:10,630
And so the Fox and the cat are drinking 
beer and smoking cigarettes and talking 

2335
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:12,590
about how evil they are and,
and bragging about how they got one over

2336
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:17,591
on the water,
like a four year old real impressive 

2337
02:02:17,591 --> 02:02:18,350
guys.
Real impressive.

2338
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:20,650
And uh,
the,

2339
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:25,730
the,
the coachman is thinking up his own 

2340
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:27,611
nefarious schemes right now for what he 
might do with that puppet if he got his 

2341
02:02:27,611 --> 02:02:28,610
hands on him.
And so that's what he reveals himself,

2342
02:02:28,611 --> 02:02:33,611
right?
So what you see filmmakers just do it 

2343
02:02:33,611 --> 02:02:33,611
for a second.
And that's an archetype.

2344
02:02:33,611 --> 02:02:35,920
Old trip.
It's like you've got the Fox in the cat,

2345
02:02:35,930 --> 02:02:38,930
they're sort of petty examples of,
of criminality and evil.

2346
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:41,270
And then you've got the coachman and 
he's the real thing,

2347
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:43,490
but he's not really shown anybody who he
is.

2348
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:47,900
And then at one scene in the bar he lets
his guard down and he lets them see what

2349
02:02:47,901 --> 02:02:52,901
he's really like.
And so you see this all teeth and 

2350
02:02:52,901 --> 02:02:55,400
predatory eyes and glee all at the same 
time.

2351
02:02:55,401 --> 02:02:57,380
Right?
That's a bad combination.

2352
02:02:57,650 --> 02:03:00,800
I'm going to eat you and it's going to 
make me very happy.

2353
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:06,310
That's insanity.
You do not want to see that look on 

2354
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:06,310
someone's face.
And so that's the look.

2355
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:10,160
And the Fox is traumatized by that.
He just like,

2356
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:13,850
he thinks he's a bad guy and he's not.
He's just,

2357
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:19,180
he just can't be a good guy.
He hasn't got the talent to be a bad 

2358
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:19,180
guy.
So.

2359
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:21,820
And then he's talking to the coach when 
I'm bragging and the coach was,

2360
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:24,170
had enough of it and shows his real face
and it's like,

2361
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:30,190
that's not good.
The Fox gets a real glimpse into hell 

2362
02:03:30,190 --> 02:03:30,780
and that just terrifies.
Like he's and,

2363
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:35,940
and then a coach when the other thing 
the coachman does is reveal his plans 

2364
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:38,810
and his plans are to kidnap Pinocchio 
along with a bunch of other boys,

2365
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:43,730
had to take them to this place called 
pleasure island and the Fox knows what's

2366
02:03:43,731 --> 02:03:45,950
going on there.
And so it's,

2367
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:50,630
it's the foreshadowing of the next stage
of the adventure.

2368
02:03:55,660 --> 02:04:00,660
And so after the Fox and the cat or 
terrified the coachman who takes you 

2369
02:04:02,291 --> 02:04:07,291
along with him,
he has a little chat with them and they 

2370
02:04:07,291 --> 02:04:10,741
described exactly what they're going to 
do next and the Fox and the cat know 

2371
02:04:10,741 --> 02:04:11,740
perfectly well that they're over their 
head.

2372
02:04:12,010 --> 02:04:17,010
But at this point in their misadventures
there's no pulling back and I think 

2373
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:22,800
we'll stop there even though it's a 
little early because that was a lot of 

2374
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:23,440
material and this is a really good place
to stop.

2375
02:04:23,890 --> 02:04:28,890
And so I'd be happy to take some 
questions if you guys have some 

2376
02:04:28,890 --> 02:04:32,581
questions.
We could take questions for like 10 

2377
02:04:32,581 --> 02:04:34,820
minutes and then we'll call it a day.
So.

2378
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:38,840
And you can me a question about anything
you want.

2379
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:42,500
It's the beginning of the lecture,
but how do,

2380
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:45,210
how does morality from

2381
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:50,590
stronger and weaker to what's good and 
what is it?

2382
02:04:51,010 --> 02:04:56,010
Well,
I think it depends to some degree on 

2383
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:58,051
what you mean by stronger.
So physical strength is one element and 

2384
02:04:58,051 --> 02:05:02,490
like if you look at mythological heroes,
imagine that the stories of heroes are 

2385
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:06,820
fragmented elements of,
uh,

2386
02:05:06,910 --> 02:05:11,910
of the archetype and so one kind of 
archetypal hero obviously as someone 

2387
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:13,230
who's physically strong,
you know,

2388
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:16,300
you see that there's a great movie that 
you could watch about this.

2389
02:05:16,301 --> 02:05:21,301
It's called Hitman Hart.
It's one of the best documentaries I've 

2390
02:05:21,301 --> 02:05:21,670
ever seen and it's about this guy named 
Bret Harte.

2391
02:05:22,750 --> 02:05:26,830
Bret Harte was for a while the most 
famous Canadian on the planet and he was

2392
02:05:26,950 --> 02:05:30,130
a worldwide wrestling foundation,
I think.

2393
02:05:30,131 --> 02:05:31,600
What do they call it?
Wwf?

2394
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:34,990
Yeah,
he was there like lead good guy.

2395
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:40,770
And so he and wrestling,
I love the documentary because when I 

2396
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:41,320
was a little kid,
like four or five,

2397
02:05:41,321 --> 02:05:43,810
I used to watch his father whose name 
was Stu Hart,

2398
02:05:44,110 --> 02:05:48,940
who ran this channel,
this wrestling confederation in Alberta.

2399
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:52,930
And Stu Hart had,
I think eight boys and he trained all of

2400
02:05:52,931 --> 02:05:57,931
them to be pro wrestlers and part of the
movie is extraordinarily funny because 

2401
02:05:57,931 --> 02:06:01,390
Stu Hart is in it and he's really old.
He's like 85 and he's just barely.

2402
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:04,090
Can you imagine?
He was like a pro wrestler for 40 years,

2403
02:06:04,091 --> 02:06:09,091
like every joint is broken and he still 
big but he's just barely moving and this

2404
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:15,330
is this kid and another kid come over 
and stu is telling the story about how 

2405
02:06:16,391 --> 02:06:18,820
it used to take his boys into the 
basement and toughen them up.

2406
02:06:18,821 --> 02:06:22,920
And I think Brent called that the 
journey to pain or something like that.

2407
02:06:22,921 --> 02:06:27,921
His father would take all these kids 
down there and wrestle with them and 

2408
02:06:27,921 --> 02:06:28,780
push them right to the edge of their 
pain tolerance constantly.

2409
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:31,180
And so anyways,
they grew up tough.

2410
02:06:31,181 --> 02:06:33,220
There's no doubt about that.
And uh,

2411
02:06:33,340 --> 02:06:35,620
all his daughters married pro wrestlers 
to,

2412
02:06:35,621 --> 02:06:37,270
and I think he had seven daughters.

2413
02:06:37,480 --> 02:06:40,600
So he's quite the character anyways.
These two kids,

2414
02:06:40,601 --> 02:06:45,601
they're like their late adolescence,
early adulthood come over and one of 

2415
02:06:45,601 --> 02:06:47,560
them is pretty damn cocky and he's 
listening to Stewart.

2416
02:06:47,561 --> 02:06:49,180
He says something smart like,
well,

2417
02:06:49,181 --> 02:06:50,170
you know,
you were pretty,

2418
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:51,880
you were pretty tough with the old days.
Hey,

2419
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:53,560
and stew looks at them and says,
well,

2420
02:06:53,561 --> 02:06:58,561
why?
Why don't you come down to the basement 

2421
02:06:58,561 --> 02:06:58,561
with me?
And he says,

2422
02:06:58,561 --> 02:06:58,720
well look,
I don't want to hurt you old man.

2423
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:03,750
And so,
so the filmmakers follow them into the 

2424
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:06,901
basement day and,
and like they're kind of standing there 

2425
02:07:06,901 --> 02:07:08,920
and the old guy grabs him in a headlock,
takes him like,

2426
02:07:08,980 --> 02:07:10,100
he's like a snake,
a,

2427
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:15,210
he's got her in a headlock like so fast 
and then the kid doesn't know what to 

2428
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:15,210
do.
And then.

2429
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:16,120
So stew,
like,

2430
02:07:16,210 --> 02:07:17,740
who knows how to put a headlock on 
someone.

2431
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:19,810
He's flexing his,
his uh,

2432
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:22,030
his uh,
his forearm.

2433
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:24,160
Yeah.
Which is still not so bad.

2434
02:07:24,161 --> 02:07:26,830
A forearm and he's got this guy's face 
is just,

2435
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:28,300
he's just,
he's like,

2436
02:07:28,301 --> 02:07:33,301
he's stepped in a bear trap.
Plus he's absolutely shocked that this 

2437
02:07:33,301 --> 02:07:34,600
old guy got him.
And so he's kind of gasping.

2438
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,030
Stu says something like,
you watch,

2439
02:07:37,031 --> 02:07:42,031
if I flex this muscle just right,
and you can see this vein on his 

2440
02:07:42,031 --> 02:07:43,240
forehead start to pop out.
It's extraordinarily funny,

2441
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:48,860
20 ways Bret Hart plays out the good guy
archetype and Brett's like,

2442
02:07:49,001 --> 02:07:50,600
he's a solid guy,
but he's,

2443
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:55,760
I would say he's not particularly 
sophisticated and I'm not being cruel 

2444
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:59,431
about that.
I mean he had a great career and he's 

2445
02:07:59,431 --> 02:08:00,220
tough as a boot and so good for him.
But he plays out this,

2446
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:03,790
this good guy archetype and he gets 
tangled up in it.

2447
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:07,780
And now I don't remember your damn 
question but I am trying to answer it.

2448
02:08:08,130 --> 02:08:09,250
Tell me the question again.

2449
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:16,510
Oh yes,
yes.

2450
02:08:16,511 --> 02:08:17,290
Okay.
Exactly.

2451
02:08:17,291 --> 02:08:22,291
Well,
so one of the things I really liked 

2452
02:08:22,291 --> 02:08:22,840
about this movie was it showed me why 
people watched wrestling and I couldn't,

2453
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:26,950
I couldn't because certainly they are 
not appealing and I'm not being.

2454
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:32,970
There are different strata of conception
of abstraction that any entertainment 

2455
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,650
process has to appeal to.
And you know,

2456
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:41,670
most people don't go to movies and 
that's actually because it really is 

2457
02:08:41,670 --> 02:08:43,800
because movies operate at a level of 
sophistication that are too high,

2458
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:46,600
that is too high for many people just 
like novels.

2459
02:08:46,601 --> 02:08:49,000
I mean hardly anyone reads,
you know,

2460
02:08:49,001 --> 02:08:54,001
and if,
if you about 15 percent of the 

2461
02:08:54,001 --> 02:08:56,341
population might be 20 percent cannot 
read well enough to follow written 

2462
02:08:56,341 --> 02:08:59,140
instructions and so [inaudible] and 
people who are,

2463
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:04,350
maybe it's 15 percent of the population 
or 10 percent have never finished a 

2464
02:09:04,350 --> 02:09:04,350
book,
never.

2465
02:09:04,450 --> 02:09:06,250
And so,
and it is that high,

2466
02:09:06,930 --> 02:09:09,310
but you still,
you're still,

2467
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:14,430
the archetypes still needs to manifest 
itself at different levels and so it 

2468
02:09:14,430 --> 02:09:17,881
manifests itself in wrestling,
but even there where it is physical 

2469
02:09:17,881 --> 02:09:19,120
force,
it's not just physical force like it's a

2470
02:09:19,121 --> 02:09:24,121
drama between good and evil and you can 
see this so clearly and in there Brett 

2471
02:09:24,121 --> 02:09:25,930
Hart documentary because he's the good 
guy and you know,

2472
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:28,300
the bad guys are really over the top 
bad.

2473
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:33,300
It's a real drama.
It's like it's good versus evil in the 

2474
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:36,331
rain every time.
And hopefully good winds but good often 

2475
02:09:36,331 --> 02:09:36,331
gets,
you know,

2476
02:09:36,331 --> 02:09:40,621
maybe the bad wrestler brings two of his
friends in and they bring in chairs and 

2477
02:09:40,621 --> 02:09:40,930
they bashed the hell out of the good 
guy.

2478
02:09:40,931 --> 02:09:43,630
And the whole audience is just outraged 
by this.

2479
02:09:43,631 --> 02:09:47,200
And and the documentary does a lovely 
job of showing that,

2480
02:09:47,230 --> 02:09:50,500
but so even at the level of physical 
combat,

2481
02:09:50,501 --> 02:09:54,160
let's say you can't reduce what's good 
to what strong,

2482
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:59,580
it's just one element of it better to be
strong than to be weak and so you can 

2483
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:02,650
have a strong hero because it's better 
to be strong than to be weak,

2484
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:07,950
but it's better to be strong and kind 
than to be strong and it's better to be 

2485
02:10:07,950 --> 02:10:10,060
strong and kind and wise than to be 
strong and kind.

2486
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:10,870
And so.

2487
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:14,380
And that's true not only for human 
beings but it's even true,

2488
02:10:14,381 --> 02:10:19,381
let's say at the wolf for the chimpanzee
level because one of the things you see 

2489
02:10:19,381 --> 02:10:22,420
with the chimp dominance hierarchies if,
and I think I mentioned this before,

2490
02:10:22,421 --> 02:10:27,421
is if the leader,
the dominant male is really good at 

2491
02:10:27,421 --> 02:10:31,740
fostering social relations and being 
reciprocal in acts like grooming and 

2492
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:33,890
also paying attention to the females and
their offspring.

2493
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:39,280
His dynasty will be much more stable and
so strong might be good for one battle.

2494
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:44,780
It might be good for two battles,
but for 50 battles it's not optimized.

2495
02:10:45,290 --> 02:10:48,080
Especially because no law,
no matter how strong you are,

2496
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:50,970
someone can take you out.
So,

2497
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:56,360
so what happens is the idea of what's 
ideal becomes increasingly complex 

2498
02:10:56,391 --> 02:10:57,950
across time,
multifaceted,

2499
02:10:58,010 --> 02:10:59,990
right,
and so strength,

2500
02:10:59,991 --> 02:11:01,160
wisdom,
intelligence,

2501
02:11:01,161 --> 02:11:06,161
vision,
all these things are amalgamated into a 

2502
02:11:06,161 --> 02:11:08,561
single B and we'll talk a lot about that
because I want to show you how that 

2503
02:11:08,561 --> 02:11:13,061
happened in Mesopotamia because that's 
one of the first places where we have 

2504
02:11:13,061 --> 02:11:13,820
documentation about how that ideally 
merged.

2505
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:18,980
They have a god called Marduk and Martin
had 50 names and as far as I can tell,

2506
02:11:18,981 --> 02:11:23,981
the reason for that was that Martech was
an amalgam of the tribal deities of at 

2507
02:11:23,981 --> 02:11:28,331
least 50 tribes and and when the tribes 
were brought together and civilized,

2508
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:34,090
each of their gods who were ideals had 
to be a male debated in something that 

2509
02:11:34,090 --> 02:11:37,991
was a single,
a single dramatized representation of 

2510
02:11:37,991 --> 02:11:42,911
value.
Or there was no way that all those 

2511
02:11:42,911 --> 02:11:42,911
people could have lived together.
Right?

2512
02:11:42,911 --> 02:11:46,800
There are different value structures 
would have fragmented them and they 

2513
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:47,570
would have stated in a state of war.
And so the question is,

2514
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:51,920
what's the question you're asking?
If it's not strength than what is it?

2515
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:53,570
Well straight,
there's an element,

2516
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:58,600
but the Egyptians figured out that it 
was vision is actually the capacity to 

2517
02:11:59,271 --> 02:12:02,570
pay attention.
That was paramount and the Mesopotamians

2518
02:12:02,571 --> 02:12:07,571
have that figured out more or less too 
because they're god Marduk had eyes all 

2519
02:12:07,571 --> 02:12:08,120
the way around his head.
He could see everywhere.

2520
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:12,260
So seeing was a critical element of what
should be on top.

2521
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:15,350
And the other thing for the Mrs Heyman's
was the ability to speak.

2522
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:20,860
So by the time of Mesopotamia,
people had already dramatized the idea 

2523
02:12:20,860 --> 02:12:25,331
that the cardinal human attributes,
our vision and the ability to speak so 

2524
02:12:25,851 --> 02:12:27,770
and that'd be the ability to speak the 
truth,

2525
02:12:27,771 --> 02:12:32,600
to not just speak.
So other questions

2526
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:41,310
mean that wasn't really aware of.
So is that why we sort of considered,

2527
02:12:47,890 --> 02:12:52,890
because we were talking earlier that 
different levels of obstruction of 

2528
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:54,850
celebrity perspective,
more like reality TV.

2529
02:12:54,860 --> 02:12:59,620
Incredible being lower than a match than
a theater actor.

2530
02:12:59,630 --> 02:13:00,710
Then like a novelist.

2531
02:13:01,630 --> 02:13:03,730
Yes.
That's exactly why.

2532
02:13:03,731 --> 02:13:08,731
Because you see the less sophisticated 
the genre,

2533
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:18,510
the more the genre is like real life and
the more sophisticated it is,

2534
02:13:19,870 --> 02:13:24,340
the more it has abstracted out across 
instances of real life,

2535
02:13:24,341 --> 02:13:28,060
the fundamental lessons.
And that's what makes something profound

2536
02:13:28,061 --> 02:13:31,000
and deep.
It's abstracted from multiple.

2537
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:35,370
And that applies across multiple 
dimensions because that's what you want.

2538
02:13:35,530 --> 02:13:37,020
So like,
and here's why.

2539
02:13:37,170 --> 02:13:40,860
Fundamentally,
so there are,

2540
02:13:41,070 --> 02:13:43,890
you have a problem,
but that's not the problem.

2541
02:13:44,070 --> 02:13:48,930
The problem is that there are problems.
So the problem is a Meta problem.

2542
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:53,340
There are problems.
You need a solution to that.

2543
02:13:53,370 --> 02:13:58,370
That's not a solution to a problem,
that's a medical solution to the class 

2544
02:13:58,370 --> 02:13:58,920
of problems.
Right?

2545
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:04,340
Right.
And that's what people have been trying 

2546
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:04,340
to figure out ever since we were able to
actually figure things out.

2547
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:07,170
It's not how do you solve a problem,
how it's,

2548
02:14:07,171 --> 02:14:11,610
how do you act so that you solve the 
problem of problems and that's basically

2549
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:16,290
at least the complexity of life and the 
fact that you're mortal and vulnerable.

2550
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:17,160
So,

2551
02:14:17,660 --> 02:14:22,660
so follow up question from your book.
You have this sort of strata from play 

2552
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:28,180
all the way up to religion and then 
beyond that sort of looking back 

2553
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:29,220
practically with philosophy 
irrationality.

2554
02:14:29,420 --> 02:14:30,730
Yes.
Israel is.

2555
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:38,360
Well,
that's.

2556
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:39,570
That's a good one.
A good.

2557
02:14:39,950 --> 02:14:40,460
I would say,

2558
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:48,060
wait,
if you really want to think this 

2559
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:49,471
through,
the best way to do that is to read 

2560
02:14:49,471 --> 02:14:49,471
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky at the same 
time.

2561
02:14:49,471 --> 02:14:50,320
Now I'm sure there's other ways of doing
this,

2562
02:14:50,321 --> 02:14:55,321
but Nisha was actually quite heavily 
influenced by Dostoevsky more than 

2563
02:14:55,321 --> 02:14:59,071
people knew.
Although there are thought runs very 

2564
02:14:59,071 --> 02:15:00,790
parallel and so Dostoevsky is like the 
ultimate dramatist,

2565
02:15:00,940 --> 02:15:05,940
right?
He embodies his ideas and he has them 

2566
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:08,371
act out in a dramatic space.
It's literary whereas niche has taken 

2567
02:15:08,371 --> 02:15:10,180
that up one level of abstraction to this
semantic.

2568
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:11,290
He says,
well,

2569
02:15:11,291 --> 02:15:13,720
here's what's going on in an articulated
way,

2570
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:16,180
but he doesn't embody it in the story 
and you might say,

2571
02:15:16,181 --> 02:15:17,650
well that's.
That's higher,

2572
02:15:17,651 --> 02:15:22,651
but it's only hire in a way.
It's more abstract in that it's more 

2573
02:15:22,651 --> 02:15:27,211
like words.
Whereas what Dostoevsky does is half 

2574
02:15:27,211 --> 02:15:27,211
words and half images,
right?

2575
02:15:27,211 --> 02:15:31,600
Because when you read a novel,
what happens is that people say,

2576
02:15:31,690 --> 02:15:32,800
and the postmodernist say,
well,

2577
02:15:32,801 --> 02:15:34,570
where the hell's the meaning in that 
novel?

2578
02:15:34,570 --> 02:15:35,890
It's like,
it's not in the word,

2579
02:15:35,891 --> 02:15:37,750
it's not in the phrase,
it's not in the sentence.

2580
02:15:37,751 --> 02:15:39,170
It's not in the paragraph,
you know,

2581
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:42,070
where do you localize the meaning?
Great question.

2582
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:44,980
Their answers sucks,
but the questions great.

2583
02:15:45,310 --> 02:15:50,310
So,
but what happens partly when you're 

2584
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:53,161
reading a book is that a novel is that 
the words trigger representations in 

2585
02:15:53,981 --> 02:15:58,810
your imagination and a lot of the 
information from which a lot of what you

2586
02:15:58,811 --> 02:16:02,620
extract the information from is actually
your images,

2587
02:16:02,621 --> 02:16:07,621
stick representation of the words and 
that image is to representation is 

2588
02:16:07,621 --> 02:16:11,851
richer than the words because it's 
informed by all of your knowledge about 

2589
02:16:11,851 --> 02:16:12,770
people.
And so you,

2590
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:17,790
you know,
this happens because you go to a movie 

2591
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:17,790
like the Harry Potter movies and you 
say,

2592
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:19,120
that's not how I imagined it,
right?

2593
02:16:19,121 --> 02:16:24,121
The probability that there'll be a one 
to one correspondence between your 

2594
02:16:24,121 --> 02:16:25,540
internal representation of the book and 
the movie is zero,

2595
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:28,540
and usually the movie is less rich than 
the book.

2596
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:30,430
I,
I love movies.

2597
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:32,590
And they have their own place,
that's for sure,

2598
02:16:32,591 --> 02:16:37,591
but they're well mini series or the 
series now are more approaching the 

2599
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:41,650
complexity and depth of literature 
because they can extend across 20 hours,

2600
02:16:42,130 --> 02:16:43,120
you know,
and you know,

2601
02:16:44,430 --> 02:16:49,430
they don't have to compress a 12 hour 
reading experience into two hours of 

2602
02:16:49,430 --> 02:16:49,870
action.
So yeah.

2603
02:16:49,871 --> 02:16:54,871
And so what I was trying to do with that
hierarchy was to show how the knowledge 

2604
02:16:54,871 --> 02:16:55,570
moved.
Like first of all,

2605
02:16:56,260 --> 02:17:01,260
it's kind of implicit in your biology 
and then it's distributed into society 

2606
02:17:01,330 --> 02:17:06,330
and then by imitating society you make 
it part of your procedures and then you 

2607
02:17:06,330 --> 02:17:08,680
watch your own procedures and start to 
build a representation of them.

2608
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:11,170
And then you can articulate that 
representation.

2609
02:17:11,530 --> 02:17:14,680
And it's a,
it's a bootstrapping process too because

2610
02:17:14,830 --> 02:17:19,150
once you've made the representation that
can affect the way you behave.

2611
02:17:19,150 --> 02:17:20,950
And so they start to loop.
And so like.

2612
02:17:20,951 --> 02:17:22,450
So here's one thing,
one idea.

2613
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:27,870
So imagine that,
imagine that there's a type of male who 

2614
02:17:28,511 --> 02:17:32,200
tends to win dominance hierarchy contest
and to merge at the top.

2615
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:34,660
While that's the case,
that is the case.

2616
02:17:34,661 --> 02:17:39,661
And that's why you're the way you are.
And so what's happened among human 

2617
02:17:39,661 --> 02:17:39,970
beings,
this is so cool,

2618
02:17:39,971 --> 02:17:44,640
is that human females are choosy maters.
So about twice as many men,

2619
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:48,280
men fail in their reproductive efforts 
as females fail.

2620
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:53,820
Okay?
But the man who succeed are more 

2621
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:53,820
successful.
So women are on average,

2622
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:57,910
more successful and men are on average,
more failures and more successful.

2623
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:00,190
And I'm talking strictly about 
reproduction here,

2624
02:18:00,191 --> 02:18:03,580
although it generalizes to other areas,
but I'm talking about reproduction.

2625
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:07,240
So how does it work exactly?
Well,

2626
02:18:07,690 --> 02:18:10,390
the women have a real trouble,
real problem with mate selection.

2627
02:18:10,391 --> 02:18:12,490
It's like who the hell are you going to 
have as a mate?

2628
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:17,520
And it's too complex to work out.
So women in their genius don't they let 

2629
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:19,090
the men compete and then they peel from 
the top,

2630
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:23,890
acting out the assumption that the man 
who wins is the best man.

2631
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:27,220
And it's a good assumption because if 
you have a bunch of men competing,

2632
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:32,280
especially if they're competing across 
competitions and someone pops up at the 

2633
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:33,160
top,
you can think,

2634
02:18:33,161 --> 02:18:34,480
well,
they may not be worth much,

2635
02:18:34,481 --> 02:18:37,390
but they're better than anyone else at 
whatever it is that they're doing,

2636
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:42,600
and that makes men at the top of 
dominance hierarchy is very attractive 

2637
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:45,811
to women.
And then the women accelerate that so 

2638
02:18:45,811 --> 02:18:46,300
you can imagine they're more likely to 
reproduce.

2639
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:51,630
And so what happens is that the 
proclivity to emerge at the top of the 

2640
02:18:51,630 --> 02:18:54,850
set of dominance hierarchies becomes 
inbuilt into the biology across time.

2641
02:18:55,030 --> 02:19:00,030
And the women exaggerate that by 
differentially allowing them then to 

2642
02:19:00,030 --> 02:19:00,280
reproduce.

2643
02:19:00,550 --> 02:19:04,210
And that's also why their mother nature,
they really are mother nature.

2644
02:19:04,230 --> 02:19:06,130
There's,
it's not just a metaphor.

2645
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:11,610
And so then the representation and the 
biology start to tangle together and 

2646
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:12,910
that's like,
well,

2647
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:14,980
that's the difference between a meme in 
an archetype,

2648
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:21,000
right?
A meme is this idea that propagates 

2649
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,761
itself,
but an archetype is an idea that has 

2650
02:19:23,761 --> 02:19:26,071
propagated itself across such as massive
span of time that it's actually shaped 

2651
02:19:26,261 --> 02:19:28,730
the course of evolution.
And Man,

2652
02:19:28,780 --> 02:19:33,780
you can tell you already how this,
it isn't necessarily that you even have 

2653
02:19:35,121 --> 02:19:40,121
to compete with other men in order to 
see who wins as soon as you admire 

2654
02:19:40,121 --> 02:19:42,800
someone and that'll happen 
unconsciously.

2655
02:19:42,801 --> 02:19:44,420
You won't,
we won't be able to stop yourself.

2656
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:47,270
You've already elevated them in the 
dominance hierarchy contest.

2657
02:19:47,810 --> 02:19:52,810
The act of admiration is your 
recognition that you've met someone 

2658
02:19:52,941 --> 02:19:57,941
who's better at what ever it is that 
happens to be driving your admiration 

2659
02:19:57,941 --> 02:19:57,941
than you are.

2660
02:19:57,950 --> 02:19:59,120
And so,
and that's part,

2661
02:19:59,150 --> 02:20:02,480
that's partly the manifestation of just 
the idea as the,

2662
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:03,800
as the,
uh,

2663
02:20:04,130 --> 02:20:06,980
what would you say as the representation
of,

2664
02:20:07,050 --> 02:20:10,310
as the ideal.
And kids do that all the time.

2665
02:20:10,311 --> 02:20:15,311
They hear a worship other kids usually 
like a four year old will latch onto 

2666
02:20:15,311 --> 02:20:17,380
some six year old who will just follow 
her show photo everywhere,

2667
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:19,280
do exactly what they do.
And it's like,

2668
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:21,650
well,
why?

2669
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:27,400
Well,
because that person reps represents to 

2670
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:28,880
that child their next ideal there,
their conceptualization of the,

2671
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:30,800
of the,
of the place forward.

2672
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,860
So,
so.

2673
02:20:33,890 --> 02:20:38,890
Okay,
any other questions or should we maybe 

2674
02:20:38,890 --> 02:20:39,460
call it a day?
Okay.

2675
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:45,700
Oh,
when you said that the guy who was the 

2676
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:48,400
other thing was predatory bleeding,
which is insanity.

2677
02:20:48,430 --> 02:20:49,670
How do you define a Saturday in this?

2678
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:52,330
Well,
let's,

2679
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:57,360
let's call it what you don't want to 
counter alone in an alley at midnight 

2680
02:20:57,360 --> 02:21:01,600
and leave it at that.
But that is what I mean in this context.

2681
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:06,790
That's exactly what I meet.
And then not only is the person they're 

2682
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:09,720
waiting for you,
but they're looking forward to whatever 

2683
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:09,720
might happen.

2684
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:13,270
I just mean like in a psychological 
contract using that word safe because 

2685
02:21:13,270 --> 02:21:14,050
like as little connotation.
So I was thinking straddling.

2686
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:17,430
No,
well the movie provides the,

2687
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:22,510
the frame for the interpretation in this
particular situation and so he's the 

2688
02:21:22,510 --> 02:21:25,150
thing that hauls naive young boys off to
their doom.

2689
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:28,030
Okay.
So that's bounded.

2690
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:29,740
So yes.

2691
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:34,840
If you can elaborate a bit on.
You mentioned,

2692
02:21:34,841 --> 02:21:39,760
you talked about this mental process 
where people do the thing that's hard,

2693
02:21:39,761 --> 02:21:41,590
but let's,
let's start,

2694
02:21:41,591 --> 02:21:46,591
but still facing the shadow.
That's actually a really productive way 

2695
02:21:46,591 --> 02:21:51,441
of procrastinating.
Although it comes with its own problems 

2696
02:21:51,441 --> 02:21:52,740
of rationalization,
so reinforces certain circuits.

2697
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:56,590
I'll put it in a way that says that 
those can go away,

2698
02:21:56,591 --> 02:22:01,591
so you need to bring up the the other 
inhibitory circuits and they're just 

2699
02:22:01,591 --> 02:22:02,730
wondering if you could elaborate.
Well,

2700
02:22:02,731 --> 02:22:07,731
I can sure is in the realm of 
possibility around their understanding 

2701
02:22:07,731 --> 02:22:08,430
of,
well,

2702
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:13,290
I've derived out partly from my study of
addiction and also from my study of a

2703
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:17,660
recovery from posttraumatic stress 
disorder,

2704
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:22,690
but let's talk about addiction.
So there's a series of actions that 

2705
02:22:23,481 --> 02:22:28,470
occur before you take your cocaine.
Some of those are local.

2706
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:30,960
They are the things that happened 
immediately before and some of those are

2707
02:22:30,961 --> 02:22:35,961
distal.
They're farther back in the chain of 

2708
02:22:35,961 --> 02:22:36,980
events and when you.
When you have a hit of cocaine,

2709
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:40,260
it produces a dopaminergic burst and 
that feels really good,

2710
02:22:40,261 --> 02:22:44,670
but it also makes the circuits that were
immediately active before that grow.

2711
02:22:45,570 --> 02:22:49,140
That's what reinforcement is,
and then the growth is proportionate,

2712
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:54,680
not linearly,
but it's proportionate to how long 

2713
02:22:54,680 --> 02:22:56,280
before that event occurred.
The closer it is,

2714
02:22:56,281 --> 02:23:01,281
the stronger they're going to get,
but even the ones that are somewhat 

2715
02:23:01,281 --> 02:23:02,040
distal gets some reinforcement because 
you might say,

2716
02:23:02,041 --> 02:23:03,600
well,
what did you do before?

2717
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:07,320
You,
you found your latest fix and the answer

2718
02:23:07,321 --> 02:23:08,400
is well,
how long before?

2719
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:10,020
Well,
the closer,

2720
02:23:10,021 --> 02:23:13,350
the more reward and so what happens then
is that,

2721
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:16,250
so if you take that person out of the 
normal environment,

2722
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:19,550
you put them into a treatment center,
they're off.

2723
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:24,560
There are physical addiction,
which is a weird thing in the case of 

2724
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:26,760
cocaine,
but I'm like not that long a week.

2725
02:23:26,761 --> 02:23:30,900
I'll do it two weeks for sure.
Even heroin and alcohol for sure,

2726
02:23:30,901 --> 02:23:35,901
if you can get them through the seizure 
part without dying and so they're done.

2727
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,970
They're done on physiologically 
dependent anymore.

2728
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:43,360
But you let that person go and the first
thing that happens is,

2729
02:23:43,390 --> 02:23:47,310
is an old friend who he's always out 
doing drugs with shows up and bang,

2730
02:23:47,311 --> 02:23:52,311
he's craving like mad and that's because
that thing is in an area is not dead at 

2731
02:23:52,381 --> 02:23:56,780
all and it's.
It's activated by the q and it's a.

2732
02:23:56,860 --> 02:23:58,500
it's a circuit.
It's not.

2733
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:01,950
It's a personality.
It only wants one thing at once.

2734
02:24:01,951 --> 02:24:06,951
Cocaine,
it's going to suppress any non related 

2735
02:24:06,951 --> 02:24:08,220
thoughts and it'll use lies.
That's no problem.

2736
02:24:08,221 --> 02:24:11,640
Especially if lies have been reinforced,
which they certainly have.

2737
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:15,870
Where are you off to sun,
you know you'll have a live for that and

2738
02:24:15,871 --> 02:24:20,310
then 10 minutes later you have your drug
and so that little lie has just grown or

2739
02:24:20,311 --> 02:24:25,311
maybe you think you've tried to quit.
You think to hell with it and every 

2740
02:24:25,311 --> 02:24:26,640
time,
10 minutes before you take your drug,

2741
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:29,490
you think to hell with it and you do 
that a thousand times.

2742
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:31,830
Well,
believe me that to hell with it circuit,

2743
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:37,220
that sucker is strong and so it's alive 
and it's not like it just disappears.

2744
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:39,930
It can't.
It's you.

2745
02:24:39,931 --> 02:24:44,931
It's grown in there.
Now you can build another circuit to 

2746
02:24:44,931 --> 02:24:49,071
shut it down and you can help it 
decompose across time by not giving it 

2747
02:24:49,071 --> 02:24:53,361
what it wants,
but you're going to have to not give it 

2748
02:24:53,361 --> 02:24:56,091
what it wants and all of the multiple 
contexts that you've already associated 

2749
02:24:56,091 --> 02:24:56,091
with the drug.

2750
02:24:56,091 --> 02:25:00,950
Some of you have probably smoked and 
then tried to quit smoking and what 

2751
02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:01,620
you'll see is you get a craving when.
Well,

2752
02:25:01,621 --> 02:25:03,870
when you have a cup of coffee or when 
you're finished dinner,

2753
02:25:03,871 --> 02:25:08,871
when you're done.
Having a phone call or when you first 

2754
02:25:08,871 --> 02:25:09,570
get up in the morning or whenever you've
regularly had the drug,

2755
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:13,710
whatever you had the drug in 
relationship to even complex things like

2756
02:25:13,711 --> 02:25:18,711
ending a conversation will produce a 
cute craving and so then that can 

2757
02:25:18,711 --> 02:25:23,301
extinguish overtime if you punish it by 
either punishing it or not letting it 

2758
02:25:23,301 --> 02:25:28,230
what it's wants,
but a lot you have to build another 

2759
02:25:28,230 --> 02:25:30,220
circuit to just shut it down and then 
that circuits kind of fragile and stress

2760
02:25:30,221 --> 02:25:32,230
can often disrupt it so

2761
02:25:32,290 --> 02:25:37,110
that can be read about quitting smoking 
or things like,

2762
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:43,170
oh sure.
Well part of it while I begins a whole 

2763
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:43,630
different thing because it seems to have
a direct physiological effect,

2764
02:25:43,631 --> 02:25:45,460
but you know,
the,

2765
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:48,070
the,
the addiction has a cognitive component.

2766
02:25:48,071 --> 02:25:51,100
It's full of thoughts and desires and 
wants and you know,

2767
02:25:51,101 --> 02:25:56,101
you may have to build a,
you have may have to rebuild your whole 

2768
02:25:56,101 --> 02:25:57,550
personality in order to,
to get that thing cornered.

2769
02:25:58,060 --> 02:26:03,060
Religious conversion for example,
is in a really effective treatment for 

2770
02:26:03,060 --> 02:26:06,481
alcoholism.
That's partly why alcoholic alcoholics 

2771
02:26:06,481 --> 02:26:07,480
anonymous works for the people for whom 
it does work,

2772
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:11,140
but religious conversion,
which is total personality conversion is

2773
02:26:11,141 --> 02:26:16,141
actually one of the few things that we 
know of that's an effective treatment 

2774
02:26:16,141 --> 02:26:16,840
for alcoholism.
We don't know how to induce it,

2775
02:26:17,380 --> 02:26:22,380
but although that's not exactly true 
either because I'm in the early work 

2776
02:26:22,661 --> 02:26:27,661
with Lsd was lsd was quite promising as 
a treatment for for an alcohol addiction

2777
02:26:28,390 --> 02:26:32,470
and there's recent work with psilocybin 
and showing that if you.

2778
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:37,740
If people have a mystical experience 
when you give them suicide and their 

2779
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,710
success rate and quitting smoking is 
about 80 percent,

2780
02:26:38,950 --> 02:26:42,210
which is way higher than any 
pharmacological intervention for smoking

2781
02:26:42,211 --> 02:26:43,840
has ever beat.
So.

2782
02:26:44,490 --> 02:26:46,420
Alright,
we should probably call it a day,

2783
02:26:46,450 --> 02:26:48,280
so we'll see you in a week.
