1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,290
Okay,

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,060
so I guess the case that I was thinking 
last time,

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,120
at least in part,
was that you're one of one way of 

4
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:26,461
conceptualizing the fundamental problem 
that human beings face is to 

5
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:32,641
conceptualize it as an ongoing struggle 
with complexity and complexity emerges 

6
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,870
as a consequence of

7
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,660
the sort of finite boundedness of 
individual consciousness and the 

8
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,490
incredible excess of the unbounded every
way are everywhere else,

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,160
even including underneath that 
consciousness.

10
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:03,570
Because of course your individual 
consciousness depends on the function or

11
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,090
is related to the function of things 
that are so complex.

12
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:11,091
You can't even understand it.
So there you are surrounded by some 

13
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:15,891
things that you understand in an in an 
ocean of things that you don't 

14
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:19,701
understand at all and including things 
about yourself and it's not obvious at 

15
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:25,140
all how people solve that problem.
Because in some sense it's not solvable.

16
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,260
The fact that you don't have the 
cognitive resources or the conceptual 

17
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,521
resources to understand everything that 
you need to understand in order to 

18
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,390
properly orient yourself in the world.
Now obviously,

19
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:41,391
partly the way we deal with that is that
we cooperate with other people and so 

20
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:44,280
that radically multiplies our resources,
credibly multiplies our resources,

21
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,120
so and so.

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,190
It's something to consider always when 
so much of the political dialog that 

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,770
surrounds us now consists of a critique 
of,

24
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,160
of cooperative societies and,
uh,

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,360
an analysis of their oppressive nature.
Of course that's true because any 

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,200
cooperative system,
it specifies a certain endpoint and 

27
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,660
produces a value hierarchy of some sort.
Also simultaneously forces things into 

28
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,520
that value system.
And then rank orders,

29
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,180
people according to the value structure 
and so there an oppressive element to 

30
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,030
it,
but compared to being naked in chaos,

31
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,540
generally it's better now.
It doesn't always have to be because it 

32
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,560
can get murderous.
But generally speaking,

33
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:35,970
well look,
we're social animals.

34
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,980
It doesn't matter.
Our evolutionary pathway has already 

35
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,971
taken us here and so we're individuals,
but we're unbelievably social and so 

36
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,960
that's that.
So as far as I can tell,

37
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,280
we'd have to be completely different 
creatures not to fall,

38
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,380
not to take advantage of and fall prey 
to the problems with social being.

39
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,880
All right?
So

40
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,820
I think the way that the problem of 
complexity has been solved,

41
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:10,810
and this is the best argument I know of 
for the truth of the Darwinian notion of

42
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:15,811
evolution now,
I don't think that our models of 

43
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:16,990
evolution are complete by any stretch of
the imagination.

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,750
I,
I know they're not partly because of 

45
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,330
recent work done in epigenetics,
which suggests that you can acquire,

46
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,150
you can inherit acquired traits.
Right?

47
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:33,151
And when I went to university,
when I started going to university in 

48
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:33,850
the 19 eighties,
that was heresy really.

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,380
Like,
no,

50
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,530
you cannot inherit acquired traits,
but actually you can inherit acquired 

51
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,490
traits.
That's the field of epigenetic studies.

52
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:47,491
That and that.
That's a radical shift in perspective 

53
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:50,290
because we also don't know exactly what 
that means across any length of time.

54
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,630
And when you're thinking about 
evolutionary lengths of time,

55
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,780
you're thinking about three and a half 
billion years because that's the span of

56
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,160
time over which life evolved.

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,160
And so even things that don't have a 
overwhelmingly market potency for one 

58
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,870
generation can be unbelievably powerful 
across time.

59
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,290
And then there's also the issue of sex 
sexual selection,

60
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:16,291
because you know,
you'll hear darwinists continually 

61
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,921
describe the world and the evolutionary 
world as a place of randomness and 

62
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:22,360
that's not true and I don't know why 
they make that statement.

63
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,650
The mutations are random or quasi random
because we don't understand the 

64
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,910
mutations that well yet either.
And most mutations are deadly,

65
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,710
right?
Most mutations are deadly.

66
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:35,290
There's a set of them that are harmful 
but not deadly.

67
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:40,291
And then there's a tiny,
tiny proportion that could in principle 

68
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:44,460
produced some benefit to the next 
generation assuming environmental 

69
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,140
environmental shift,
say in the direction of the mutation.

70
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,800
So that's,
there's a randomness element to that.

71
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,600
We know that.
I mean,

72
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,610
part of the reason that you mutate or 
your cells mutate your DNA mutates is 

73
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:00,040
because of background levels of 
radioactivity.

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,920
And a lot of that's a consequence of 
solar activity,

75
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:07,921
right?
So cosmic rays come zipping through the 

76
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:09,931
atmosphere and they nail your DNA and 
produce minor alterations and that's a 

77
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:14,161
mutation.
And if you crank up the background 

78
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:14,161
radiation rate,
like say around Chernobyl,

79
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:18,541
then the mutation rate rises.
And there's definitely a random element 

80
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:22,291
to that and it's necessary for them to 
be a random element because as far as I 

81
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:27,961
can tell,
the only way you can beat a random 

82
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:27,961
environment is by producing random 
changes,

83
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,160
right?
So you know the idea,

84
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:35,161
basically the,
the environment isn't some static place 

85
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:38,020
that's selecting for higher and higher 
levels of fitness or not in any,

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,200
not in any.
It's certainly not doing that in any 

87
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,770
static way.
And so it's shifting around randomly and

88
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:49,771
then you know,
you have a structure that's been your 

89
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:51,250
species has a structure that's a 
consequence of this immense evolutionary

90
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:55,330
journey and it's moderating itself 
randomly within certain parameters.

91
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,920
The parameters being that most mutations
will kill you,

92
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,010
like alterations in your fundamental 
form generally tend to kill you.

93
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:05,630
So they're incremental and so the 
mutations are random and they match.

94
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:10,631
Hopefully they ratchet the randomness in
the environmental shift and so you can 

95
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,860
more or less keep up that way,
but then there's additional complicating

96
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:17,861
factors and they're not trivial.
And one of them is whatever epigenetics 

97
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:17,861
does.
We don't know anything about that yet.

98
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,550
But the second one is sexual selection.
And sexual selection is no joke.

99
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,760
It could be the primary thing is 
certainly one of the primary things 

100
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,540
that's driven human evolution and I 
think you can say that

101
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,870
you think about the environment.
Again,

102
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,980
let's think about the environment.
So you have a dominance hierarchy and 

103
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,330
that's really an old structure.
The dominance hierarchy,

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,820
300 million years old because it emerged
pretty much whenever there was,

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
whenever there was a nervous system,
emergent nervous system and whenever 

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,280
animals had to occupy the same 
territory,

107
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:54,610
they automatically organized themselves 
into something approximating a dominance

108
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,230
hierarchy.
So it's a very,

109
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:57,010
very,
very,

110
00:06:57,011 --> 00:06:59,590
very old structure.
It's older than trees.

111
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,620
It's older than flowers,
it's old.

112
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,880
And as far as real goes from a Darwinian
sense,

113
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,650
permanent is real.
And so when you,

114
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:11,440
you can say,
well,

115
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:16,441
you know,
our burial ancestors adapted themselves 

116
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:19,171
to treats and so the tree was a long 
around long enough to be a feature of 

117
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:23,911
the environment.
But the dominance hierarchy has been 

118
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,551
around a lot longer than trees.
And you can think of the dominance 

119
00:07:26,551 --> 00:07:27,400
hierarchy both as an adaptation to the 
environment,

120
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,640
because you'd kind of think about the 
dominant Turkey has a cultural 

121
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,221
construct,
but if a cultural construct lasts long 

122
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,450
enough that it becomes part of the 
environment and so the dominant Turkey's

123
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:40,930
part of the environment and what seems 
to happen roughly speaking,

124
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,300
and this is an oversimplification but 
we'll go with it,

125
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:48,301
is that males have a dominance hierarchy
and there's a relatively small number of

126
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:54,850
males that are relatively successful and
those successful males have preferential

127
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:59,851
access to female reproductive capacity 
either because the females actively 

128
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:02,860
choose the the more dominant males,
which is very,

129
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:07,861
very common or because the more dominant
males chase all the less dominant males 

130
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:11,470
away so that even if the females don't 
exercise choice,

131
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:16,471
which they often do,
then the only males left around that can

132
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:17,770
serve as reasonable.

133
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,800
Mating partners are the more powerful 
ones.

134
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,100
And so you think you get to really 
radical determiners of evolution as a 

135
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,550
consequence of that one.
Is that

136
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,430
each.

137
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,990
I'm not talking about female dominance 
hierarchies at the moment,

138
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,400
but I can talk about that,
but that's why this is an 

139
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,691
oversimplification,
but what happens is that the males 

140
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:44,470
obviously are selected for their ability
to move up dominance hierarchies 

141
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,010
obviously because the ones that are at 
the top of the dominance hierarchy 

142
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,250
reproduce preferentially and so that 
means the male dominance hierarchy 

143
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,061
becomes a method of selection,
but then allied with that is the female 

144
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:01,491
proclivity for choice on whatever 
dimension the dominance hierarchy 

145
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:05,391
happens to be arranged and so then 
female sexual selection also becomes a 

146
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:09,411
radical nonrandom selector of,
of,

147
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,470
of what,
what genetic material is going to move 

148
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:15,470
into the next generation.
And so I,

149
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,350
I failed to see how any of that can be 
separated from the emergence of complex 

150
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,910
nervous systems and mind over the course
of evolution because people aren't.

151
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,280
Creatures aren't making random choices.

152
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,550
They're not random at all.
So we even know such things like imagine

153
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:34,380
a peacock's tail,
you know,

154
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,840
it's covered with ice,
which is quite interesting because eyes 

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:39,990
of course attract attention and lots of 
animals have evolved.

156
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,050
I liked markets like moss.
There's moss that when they unfold your 

157
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,921
wings,
they have two big eyes on the back of 

158
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:48,921
them and that's to keep birds from 
eating them right?

159
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,251
Because the birds don't like being 
stared at so they stay away from the 

160
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:55,041
moths,
but so a peacock's tails is nothing but 

161
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,771
eyes and so it's very attractive and it 
shimmers and there's something about it 

162
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:58,680
that's beautiful,
which is quite interesting to.

163
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,890
The females have obviously been 
selecting the male peacock peacocks for 

164
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,100
beauty and they have this insane tail 
while.

165
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,530
So the evolutionary biologists have 
thought,

166
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:12,531
well,
what possible utility could that tail 

167
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:12,960
be?
Is it just maybe the females got fixated

168
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,520
on tail,
so to speak,

169
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:19,521
and you know,
you've got a bold would affect loop 

170
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:23,001
going there and the male peacocks just 
got bigger and bigger tales and it's 

171
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:23,001
just like an evolutionary dead end.

172
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:23,001
It's,
you know,

173
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:26,010
it's a positive feedback system that's 
gone out of control,

174
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,280
but they have done things that like look
at the symmetry and and and breadth say,

175
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:37,131
or the symmetry and size and overall 
quality of the male peacock's tail as a 

176
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,160
marker for physical health.
So reduce parasite load for example,

177
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:44,760
and it does turn out that the healthier 
male peacocks have better tail display.

178
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,360
And so the way what the female seemed to
be doing is using some marker or some 

179
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,280
set of markers as a proxy indicator for,
for,

180
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,700
for health.
And I think I think you could say with,

181
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,230
with reasonable,
you could say reasonable that reasonably

182
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:06,231
that female human beings do the same 
thing to male human beings and there's 

183
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:07,860
some of that vice versa too.
Like we evaluate each other,

184
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,060
for example,
for symmetry,

185
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:12,690
which is one of the elements of beauty 
because healthier people tend to be more

186
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:15,240
symmetrical and lots of animals use 
symmetry.

187
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,330
Butterflies,
butterflies won't mate with another 

188
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,930
butterfly if it deviates from symmetry 
by the tiniest amounts you can imagine.

189
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,200
So symmetry is a marker and there's 
other markers like shoulder width to 

190
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,210
waste with his wanton waste,
with to hip width is another,

191
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:33,390
that's usually what mail is.
Use that to evaluate females in part.

192
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,150
So there's lots of markers of health.
Um,

193
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,890
but it also looks to me like the,
the,

194
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,460
the data worldwide seems to indicate 
that women.

195
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,330
So imagine that women made to cross 
dominance,

196
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:49,530
hierarchies end up socioeconomically 
speaking and on average across cultures,

197
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:51,900
women go for men who are about four to 
five years older,

198
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,020
you know,
it varies in the Scandinavian countries 

199
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,020
that's shrunk a little bit,
but not that much.

200
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,620
And in other cultures it's bigger.
I would say that depends to some degree 

201
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,800
on difficulty of establishing economic 
independence,

202
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,220
right?
Because in richer countries it's easier 

203
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,220
to have enough economic independence if 
you're a male to be,

204
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,980
to be a useful participant in the 
process of having children.

205
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,500
Um,
but it doesn't matter.

206
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:19,501
Cross culturally,
it's still across an awkward man mate 

207
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:19,810
across and down.
They don't care much about socioeconomic

208
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:24,811
status.
Doesn't seem to be part of their 

209
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:25,060
selection method,
generally speaking.

210
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,110
So,
so I think that part of that is also the

211
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,000
ability of women to select for,
for male health,

212
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:39,001
it's something like that because it 
isn't that only that because if you're 

213
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,240
healthy and energetic,
you're much more likely to be successful

214
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,490
because it's very hard to be successful 
if you're ill.

215
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:43,540
Obviously.
I mean,

216
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,200
so because the competition is just too 
high and both,

217
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:52,201
both genders,
both sexes select each other for 

218
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:52,201
attractiveness,
both selector intelligence,

219
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,990
both at select for personality,
although the different,

220
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,920
there are differences there in terms of 
what's,

221
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,550
what stressed but so,
so,

222
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,800
so I think you can derive a couple of 
things out of,

223
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,680
out of this and this is where I think 
people are different than,

224
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,910
than other animals.

225
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,910
Importantly different is that,
so you imagine that there's tremendous 

226
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,340
selection pressure to,
uh,

227
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,440
towards the production,
let's say a man who are good at climbing

228
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:22,441
male dominance hierarchies or,
or climbing the male dominance 

229
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:26,341
hierarchy.
But the thing that's so interesting 

230
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:26,530
about people is that we've multiplied 
our dominance hierarchies.

231
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,070
You know,
if you take an animal that's got a 

232
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,420
rather static behavioral pattern,
then there's,

233
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,670
there's a single hierarchy.
Elephant seals are a good example of 

234
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,670
that.
So elephant seals,

235
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,590
the males are absolutely massive.
They're way,

236
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:43,591
way bigger than the females,
and they basically have harems roughly 

237
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:44,040
speaking,
and they,

238
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,190
they used physical prowess as their 
marker of status essentially.

239
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:51,370
And obviously size is a huge part of 
that because otherwise the male elephant

240
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,590
seals wouldn't be as,
they're massive.

241
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:58,591
These things are absolutely enormous.
And so it's just power slash health,

242
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,820
you know,
maybe aggression,

243
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:01,540
something like that.

244
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,130
It's whatever makes them more,
um,

245
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,580
suitable for the kind of physical combat
that elephant seals engage it.

246
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,180
So,
and the degree to which power is 

247
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,361
associated with dominance status in 
those sorts of situation seems to be 

248
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:22,030
associated with the size differential 
between males and females.

249
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,590
So the more power is an issue with 
regards to male competence,

250
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:31,591
the larger the bales are compared to the
females and the more likely the males 

251
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:32,440
are going to have a heroine relationship
with the females.

252
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,650
And you see that a little bit in human 
beings because men are bigger than 

253
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,020
women.
They're not overwhelmingly bigger.

254
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:39,910
That's sexual dimorphism.
And you know,

255
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,860
there's some men that are smaller than 
some women,

256
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:46,861
but on average men are tolerant there.
They have more upper body strength and 

257
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:50,251
so forth.
So there is a power element to male 

258
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,501
competition,
but it's not as extended as it would be 

259
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:53,570
among animals like elephants seals.

260
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,870
So in the elephant seal,
you see maybe there's one stable set of 

261
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,641
traits that's being selected for that 
makes the males more likely to 

262
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:03,950
reproduce,
but human beings,

263
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:08,951
we're very weird creatures because we're
so conceptually flexible and so what 

264
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:12,940
seems to have happened,
maybe we started male,

265
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:17,941
started selecting each other for 
dominance competitions for something 

266
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:19,520
like cognitive flexibility and 
conscientiousness.

267
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:24,521
It's something like that.
So that would be the ability to 

268
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:28,541
abstractly represent the world and then 
the ability to operate effectively 

269
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,021
within it to represent yourself socially
in a way and then to carry through with 

270
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:32,990
that because that enables people to 
trust you.

271
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,410
So it's something like that.
And so that produced cortical expansion 

272
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:44,111
and then women were selecting men who 
are good at that and that produced 

273
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,231
cortical expansion and then there's an 
arms race between women and men with 

274
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:51,671
regards to intelligence.
So the women kept up or they certainly 

275
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:51,671
kept up with,
with,

276
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,670
with intelligence as the evolutionary 
cycle continued.

277
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,450
But one of the consequences of selection
for cortical expansion and increased 

278
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,800
cognitive flexibility was that the 
number of dominance hierarchies that 

279
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,890
human beings can produce started to 
multiply.

280
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,310
Right?
Because there's all sorts of ways that 

281
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,721
you can be successful.
There's you think about how many ways 

282
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,841
you can be successful in a modern 
culture and you can be successful in 

283
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,110
dimensions that aren't really even 
associated with each other,

284
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,890
so you can be successful socially that 
that's what an extrovert would do.

285
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,680
You could be successful in terms of 
intimate relationships.

286
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,980
That's what a agreeable person would do.
A disagreeable person would be more 

287
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,690
successful with regards to competition.
A person who's high in neuroticism would

288
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:40,691
be would be trying to protect themselves
and to establish some sort of security 

289
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:44,800
and open person would be looking for a 
flexible creative environment and so 

290
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,851
there's this multiplicity of of ways 
that you can establish a dominance 

291
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,830
hierarchy and be successful in it and if
you're creative,

292
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:53,840
you can come up with your own damn 
dominance hierarchy,

293
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,550
which is exactly what you're doing.

294
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,480
If you're creative,
right?

295
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,510
You spin up a game that's your game and 
then you make the rules and that's hard 

296
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:03,850
because if you make a new game with new 
rules,

297
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,860
it's hard to monetize it,
but you can be the best at playing that 

298
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,251
game.
And so that's a huge advantage to being 

299
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:12,620
creative if you can pull it off.
So then you think,

300
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:17,621
well what's happened among human beings 
is the multiplication of the set of 

301
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:20,690
possible dominance hierarchies.
So it's become very broad.

302
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,720
And then you could say,
well what's what's driving selection now

303
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:28,721
is the ability to be successful across 
multiple sets of dominance hierarchies 

304
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,380
and that accounts at least in part for 
our cognitive flexibility.

305
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,580
And so that's really what a human being 
is a human being is a creature that has 

306
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,821
high potential for succeeding across a 
very wide range of potential human 

307
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:39,950
dominance hierarchies.

308
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,280
And so that gives us our transformative 
psyche.

309
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:48,281
That's the niche.
That's the niche that we've both 

310
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:49,530
produced and occupy.
And I think it's out of that,

311
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:54,531
that hero mythology emerges 
fundamentally because I think what the 

312
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,101
hero is,
the mythological hero is a 

313
00:17:58,101 --> 00:17:59,850
representation of that part of the 
psyche that's particularly good at being

314
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:02,310
successful across sets of dominance 
hierarchies.

315
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,580
And it's a very,
very biological way of thinking about 

316
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:07,580
it.
And I,

317
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,340
I,
I thought about this for a long time.

318
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:13,200
I can't see any way that that just can't
be the case in how else?

319
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,290
How else could it work if we had a fixed
behavioral pattern like beavers,

320
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,610
you know,
you were the most successful beaver.

321
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,580
If you build the best damn,
it's like fine.

322
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,240
Then you know what's going to be 
selected for it,

323
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:27,990
but that isn't what people are like and 
it's also why we're so multipurpose.

324
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,600
You know,
we have hands.

325
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,990
What?
What's a hand for?

326
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,310
What's the evolutionary function of a 
hand while you.

327
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,290
You can't specify that.
You could say it's something like,

328
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,650
well hand is useful for doing a whole 
bunch of different things with well and 

329
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,320
mouth.
Tongue,

330
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:48,321
same thing.
What are words for while it's the same 

331
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:48,660
thing,
therefore very there for communicating a

332
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,140
very wide range of information.
It's something like that.

333
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,840
So were were these weird general purpose
animals,

334
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:57,240
you know,
we're not great at any one thing,

335
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,620
but we can swim better than most 
terrestrial animals.

336
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,340
You know,
we can run faster than most animals and 

337
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,641
we can certainly run longer.
Like a human being can run a horse to 

338
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:11,520
death over the course of a week.
If they're in good shape,

339
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,230
so like we're really good at being 
multipurpose entity,

340
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,310
like a rat,
you know,

341
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:22,311
were they call rats,
weedy species because they can be 

342
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:22,311
anywhere.

343
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:24,170
They don't have a specific niche like,
you know,

344
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:29,180
there's animals down in the Amazon that 
are specialized for like one tree or one

345
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:34,200
type of tree in one tiny little area.
That's not what human beings like us.

346
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,270
We're,
we're like cockroaches and rats,

347
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:40,950
which is nasty comparison,
but we can go anywhere and thrive and so

348
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,730
and so.
Being particularly good at that,

349
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,120
being particularly good at being able to
go anywhere and thrive also seems to me 

350
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,780
to be a canonical element of the hero 
mythology.

351
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,910
So.
So.

352
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:54,930
Okay.
All right.

353
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,740
Now I started to introduce all those 
topics because I was trying to address 

354
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:08,400
the issue of how it is that we've come 
to deal with the fact that things are so

355
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:13,050
complex that we can't deal with them.
And so a huge part of the answer to that

356
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:16,740
is the Darwinian announcers.
One is while you keep up with things you

357
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:18,820
can't keep up with by changing 
unpredictably.

358
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,760
So there's,
here's an example,

359
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,690
you know sometimes if you're driving 
down the road and there's a deer on the 

360
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,171
road,
maybe you'll run into it and it'll 

361
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:32,480
instead of jumping out of the way,
it sort of jumps randomly and then you 

362
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:32,480
run into it.
You think,

363
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,321
well that's a pretty stupid strategy.
It's like natural selections at work 

364
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:40,731
there.
But it turns out the deer jump randomly 

365
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:41,520
when wolves are chasing them.
Well why would you do that?

366
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,930
Well,
because you can't predict it,

367
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,900
right?
If,

368
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
if something horrible is after you 
acting unpredictably is a pretty good 

369
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,591
strategy.
And that's basically what mutation does 

370
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:55,500
means the horrible thing that's after 
you always is the rapid transformation 

371
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,180
of the environment and the only thing 
you can possibly do in that,

372
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,210
in that case is capitalize on chance.
Okay?

373
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:06,211
So that's one thing.
So that's partly why the Darwinian 

374
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:06,211
story,
I think has to be right,

375
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,910
because the environment does move 
unpredictably and the only way you can 

376
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,550
keep up with something that's 
unpredictable,

377
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:18,590
to generate variance and hope that one 
of them has drawn the lucky lottery 

378
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:18,970
card.

379
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,070
But then there's these additional 
issues,

380
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:26,071
which is that we're also,
we also seem to be tightly selected for 

381
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:30,660
the capacity to cooperate and compete.
So that multiplies our cognitive 

382
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:30,760
ability.
That's a huge part of it.

383
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,300
And then we're also,
we also seem to have constructed 

384
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,300
ourselves,
so to speak,

385
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,390
through sexual choice into these general
problem,

386
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,730
general purpose,
problem solving creatures.

387
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:46,090
And so we've internalized some of the 
Darwinian process.

388
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:51,091
So you think,
well most animals will produce variance 

389
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:53,560
of themselves physically and then most 
of those variants die.

390
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,110
But human beings have built A.
Lance built a mechanism,

391
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,920
let's say that's like a game engine.
I think that's a really good,

392
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,040
you know how there are game engines now 
that people have devised their,

393
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,110
their,
their computational devices and you can 

394
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,630
take a game engine and you can generate 
games with it like computer games.

395
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,860
So I'm the game engine is a mechanism 
for producing games.

396
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,950
Well that's what our brains are like.
Our brains are game engines for 

397
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,101
producing games.
And so what happens is that when you 

398
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:29,010
think you produce an Avatar of yourself,
you produce a fictional world,

399
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:32,860
and that that Avatar and habits,
and maybe you produce multiple fictional

400
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:36,490
worlds and multiple avatars,
that's the EU that could be tomorrow,

401
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:40,570
which is what you're doing when you're 
planning and you walk the Avatar through

402
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,630
its potential routes and those that look
good and you keep and those that don't 

403
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:45,630
look good,
you kill.

404
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,970
And so you can then you can embody the 
ideas that you keep an act those out.

405
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:54,070
And hopefully the idea is that when you 
embody them,

406
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,350
you're successful and you don't get 
killed.

407
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,100
And so we're select.
We've also seen that when we've been 

408
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,100
selecting each other for cognitive 
prowess,

409
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,500
we've been selecting ourselves for the 
ability to generate avatars out of 

410
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,070
ourself and kill them instead of dying.

411
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,180
It's unbelievably brilliant.
And,

412
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,920
and that's really akin to the human 
discovery of the future,

413
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,950
right?
The future is a place where variance of 

414
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,781
you could exist.
It's something like that and other 

415
00:23:21,781 --> 00:23:21,781
animals don't seem to be able to do 
that.

416
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,790
So we're very sneaky and well so far 
doesn't seem to be working too badly,

417
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:28,810
although we haven't been around for very
long,

418
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:33,811
right?
I mean human beings of our particular 

419
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:34,330
sub species about 150,000
years,

420
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:38,020
something like that,
which is from an evolutionary timeframe.

421
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:40,570
It's like it's nothing,
you know,

422
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,590
it's 2080 year old man.
It's not very long,

423
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,400
you know,
if you think about it that way.

424
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,800
Okay.
So

425
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,820
now what I want to do is draw a 
relationship between that developmental 

426
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,931
process,
that evolutionary process and the 

427
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:06,930
emergence of these underlying 
motivational systems.

428
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,710
It's something like this.
So you imagine you go back in time to 

429
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,710
the emergence of the development of 
nervous systems.

430
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:18,050
So there's,
there's cells that creatures use to do 

431
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,720
produce,
motor output and there are cells that 

432
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,900
creatures use to map the patterns around
them onto themselves.

433
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:27,810
And so those are that sensory.
That's the sensory layer,

434
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,170
so to speak.
Imagine sensory layer,

435
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,920
nervous layer,
motor layer.

436
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,280
In simpler animals you just have sensory
motor cells.

437
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,600
Then they diversify sensory layer,
nervous layer,

438
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,980
motor layer.
In fact,

439
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,610
that's actually what you consist of when
you're first developing in utero.

440
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,940
After the blast site stage,
when your cells differentiate,

441
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:52,920
that's the differentiation.
Sensory layer,

442
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,780
nervous layer,
motor layer,

443
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,730
so then you think there's a sensory 
layer.

444
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,100
Now what's that sensory layer doing?

445
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,670
Think about the world as consists 
consisting of patterns of all sorts,

446
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,700
like maybe there's an animal in the 
ocean and it's being subjected to wave 

447
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,410
motion,
and so it's sensory systems map the wave

448
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,350
motion onto the motor output.
So if you look at a sponge,

449
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:21,351
for example,
sponges are good examples because 

450
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:22,010
they're sort of half unicellular animals
and half multicellular animals.

451
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:27,030
You can take a sponge and run it through
a colander and separate it out into 

452
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,900
cells in say in salt water and it'll 
assemble itself back into a sponge.

453
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,710
So it sort of at the.
Yeah,

454
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,500
amazing.
Hey,

455
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,220
it's kind of what you do in Utero it 
that the cells somehow know enough to 

456
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:44,091
communicate with another to one another 
to organize themselves into an 

457
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:44,730
organism's.
It's unbelievable.

458
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:49,731
We have no idea how people do that 
because when you're in the initial form 

459
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:54,021
blast site for them,
all those cells are identical 

460
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:56,181
genetically and then all of a sudden 
they differentiate and they moved to 

461
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:56,181
other places.

462
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,360
They're supposed to go.
We have no idea how that,

463
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,140
how the hell can that happen?
These cells are all identical except for

464
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:06,141
their position,
so they're obviously communicating with 

465
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:08,040
one another in some unbelievably 
complicated way and saying,

466
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:08,850
well,
you,

467
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,670
you're this sort of sell it and so 
you're going to differentiate that way.

468
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,680
God only knows,
but anyways,

469
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:18,681
sponges can do this.
Now a sponge isn't complicated enough to

470
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:21,810
have the sensory layer and the nervous 
layer and the motor layer.

471
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,600
It's just sensory motor cells,
if I remember correctly,

472
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:29,601
but what the sponges trying to figure 
out what is it wants to get water 

473
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:33,141
through its pores inside because that's 
how it eats and so there's wave motion 

474
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:37,971
constantly and so what's happening is 
the wave motion is a pattern and the 

475
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,120
sponge is reacting to that in a 
patterned way.

476
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,380
That's a really.
It's really useful to think about what 

477
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,080
responding to as patterns instead of 
objects because we think we react to 

478
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,011
objects,
but objects are actually a specific 

479
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,561
subcategory of pattern and so because 
they don't also helps to explain 

480
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:54,570
perception.

481
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,340
It's like,
well,

482
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,180
what does it mean for you to see 
something?

483
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,910
Well,
it means a bunch of things,

484
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:03,660
but one of the things that means is when
I look at that thing,

485
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,800
it manifests itself to me as a grippable
object.

486
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,980
I mean that that's built into the way I 
see it.

487
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,820
So if you think about the way that you 
see that on the surface there,

488
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:17,970
you can tell that it's separate from the
surface because it has a bit of a shadow

489
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:23,540
and it's a different color and it's 
obviously shaped for a hand and so that 

490
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,400
thing tells you when you look at it,
that is the grabbable object.

491
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:26,630
Well,
it's,

492
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,670
it's hand shaped like a stone tool would
be and so and the things around you in 

493
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:37,611
the world manifest themselves as 
patterns of utility that that's the 

494
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:38,160
appropriate way to think about it.
You say,

495
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:39,750
well,
what does this thing mean?

496
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,940
Because that's a hard question.
Well,

497
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,910
one of the things that your eyes do,
it's like,

498
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,080
imagine you've got this representational
surface at the back of your retina,

499
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,210
it's made out of pixels,
roughly speaking,

500
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:56,211
right?
Those are the cells and what it does is 

501
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:59,210
map that pattern onto your retinal 
pattern and then the retinal pattern 

502
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,980
propagates itself as a nervous pattern 
loan your optic nerve,

503
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,190
and then that manifests itself as a 
neurological pattern and that 

504
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,121
neurological pattern manifests itself as
an action pattern and so the meaning of 

505
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:14,460
the object is the action pattern that is
mapped onto the,

506
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,320
onto the percept.
And so what does this mean?

507
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,500
This is what it means.
Think this is a pay as Eddie and 

508
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,771
observation is like wonder many one,
right?

509
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,580
Because I'm acting like it's one,
but if I do this then it's many y one,

510
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,720
two.
Right there separately manipulable 

511
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,600
entities and so the concept of number is
in fact predicated,

512
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:52,971
at least in part on the idea of singular
usability,

513
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,390
but you're mapping.

514
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,020
It's like,
well,

515
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:56,220
what is this?
It's a key.

516
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,210
Well,
what does that mean?

517
00:28:57,211 --> 00:29:02,211
Well,
I mapping that shape into this motion 

518
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:02,211
for that action say,
well,

519
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:03,840
it's not just a key,
it's a weapon.

520
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Right?
And so that's because I've mapped it 

521
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,410
onto a different output pattern,
but if you think about perception as the

522
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:14,850
matching of patterns onto patterns,
it makes it makes way more sense.

523
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:19,851
You can really start thinking about how 
perception works because then you can 

524
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:20,220
also start thinking about unconscious 
perception.

525
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:25,221
So you know the,
the blind sight experiments show for 

526
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,710
example that if,
if you've had critical damage so you,

527
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,870
you think you're blind,
you can't see objects anymore,

528
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,290
but I show you a picture of a frightened
face.

529
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,110
You'll show us in skin conductance 
response to it and you think,

530
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:38,370
well,
how the hell can that happen?

531
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:43,371
It's like I have to see the face in 
order to infer the emotion in order to 

532
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:44,410
have the reaction.

533
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:44,830
It's like,
no,

534
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,480
you don't.
You don't need that at all.

535
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,840
You need a pattern recognition system 
that maps that right onto an amygdala 

536
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,150
output that produces physiological 
readiness.

537
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,090
You don't need the perceptible entity 
because you know,

538
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:03,091
you think you see something and then you
think about the thing and then you 

539
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:04,270
evaluate the thing and then you act like
you do do that,

540
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:07,780
but there are parts of you that don't do
that at all way faster parts,

541
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,140
more primordial parts,
and so another example would be Darwin's

542
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,060
trick with the snake that I told you 
about.

543
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:18,061
He'd go to this museum that had a cobra 
in a glass cage and the Cobra,

544
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:23,221
he'd put his face up to the glass cage 
and the Cobra would strike out him and 

545
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,341
he'd go like this,
and there was no way he could control 

546
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:26,341
that.
Well,

547
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:29,731
it's because the part of him that saw 
the snake wasn't the part that was doing

548
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:30,520
this.

549
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,580
There's a part of him that does this to 
snakes.

550
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,300
That's what it does and it's.
It's way faster than the per figure,

551
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:41,200
the to see the snake you have to the 
images.

552
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:46,201
Obviously the image,
the pattern is portrayed on the retina 

553
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:50,730
propagates backwards to see it.
It has to be elaborated up through a 

554
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,630
very complex set of neurological 
connections that takes time,

555
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,030
and so your dad,
well,

556
00:30:55,031 --> 00:31:00,031
the thing that snake means this,
that's like three neurons superfast,

557
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,560
and so what is a snake at that level of 
representation?

558
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:10,561
It's like a snake is that which makes 
you do this and then you could also say 

559
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:13,750
that at that level of representation,
everything that makes you do this is the

560
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:15,520
same thing,
right?

561
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:20,521
Because the same would be defined by the
pattern that you manifest in response to

562
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:25,801
that entity.
So then your nervous system is layered 

563
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:25,801
very,
very.

564
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,410
That's sensory layer neurological layer,
motor layer.

565
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,220
As you become more complex,
the sensory layer differentiates into 

566
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,251
the different sensory systems and the 
neurological level multiplies in terms 

567
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:44,071
of its potential number of connections.
So what happens is that you can map 

568
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,570
patterns that manifest themselves in 
multiple different ways,

569
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,320
in multiple different ways to multiple 
motor outputs.

570
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,360
So you start with a fixed action 
pattern,

571
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:53,460
which is just like this,
this,

572
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,820
the.
The sponge reflects what's the world to 

573
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,700
a sponge.
The world is what makes you go like this

574
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,170
or like that.
That's it.

575
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,620
That's the whole world.
The sponge has compressed the entire 

576
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:07,960
world into pores,
open pores closed.

577
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,970
That's,
that's it to states,

578
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,660
and then once the nervous system gets 
differentiated and the senses get 

579
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,340
differentiated,
so there's specialized kinds of cells,

580
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,690
then you can detect more forms of 
patterns.

581
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,920
You can produce more patterned output to
that,

582
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,130
but even more interestingly,
and this is where the nervous system 

583
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,360
starts to come into play,
that the mapping of the pattern onto the

584
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:39,361
output is no longer one to one.
You can use the same pattern roughly 

585
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:42,661
speaking to British,
all sorts different outputs that are 

586
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:42,800
context dependent because you might say,
well,

587
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,640
so okay,
I picked that up and you say,

588
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:50,480
well,
he picked that up.

589
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,230
It's okay.
Well,

590
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:54,660
what about that?
You think,

591
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:55,530
why you picked it up?
Well,

592
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:56,130
yeah,
yeah,

593
00:32:56,131 --> 00:33:01,131
I did.
Except that the pattern of musculature 

594
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:04,581
that I used to do this is by no means 
identical to the pattern of musculature 

595
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,000
that I used to do that.
Right?

596
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,120
I mean the fact that the orientation is 
different is actually extraordinarily 

597
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,120
important.
So,

598
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,500
so.
Well,

599
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:18,501
my point is,
is that were sufficient nervous 

600
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:21,390
complexity.
You can take the same thing,

601
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:26,510
so to speak and map that all sorts of 
different ways and human beings are 

602
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,570
unbelievably good at that.
Okay,

603
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:30,540
so now go back to when things were 
simple,

604
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,580
so there's single celled organisms will 
say,

605
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:39,581
and then they start to differentiate to 
some degree and they start to propagate 

606
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:43,300
and so then there's the environment 
starts to shift because the fact of the 

607
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,740
prevalence of all of these competitors 
means the environment isn't exactly the 

608
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,490
same as it was when that system first 
evolved.

609
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,600
New problems emerge and so then there's 
selection pressure on those creatures to

610
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:58,601
diversify to some degree and then the 
diversification produces a 

611
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:02,051
transformation in the environment and 
then there's pressure on those new 

612
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:05,860
entities to diversify some more.
And so you get this weird bootstrapping 

613
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,641
process.
Maybe the environment is one thing when 

614
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:12,851
there's 10 of you,
but a completely different thing when 

615
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:12,851
there's a thousand of you.
Right?

616
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:17,021
So just sheer multiplication is going to
transform the environment and so then 

617
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:21,280
the.
Because the environment has now become 

618
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,861
more complex than it was their selection
pressure to produce diversification in 

619
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:24,500
the underlying organisms.

620
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,780
And that took a long time to get off the
ground.

621
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:31,160
Like there were a single celled 
organisms for a huge span of history.

622
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:33,590
I mean if you look at evolutionary 
history,

623
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:38,950
the amount of time that there were 
single celled organisms is far longer 

624
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,970
than the time that there's been since 
there were multi celled organisms.

625
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:42,920
It's like,
it's like Moore's law,

626
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,360
you know,
the law that governs the,

627
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,520
the increase in computational power.
You can trace that back to about the 

628
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,810
year 1400,
something like that.

629
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:56,290
So it's been going on for a very long 
time and maybe you could make the same 

630
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,621
case from an evolutionary perspective.
It's like the flat part of the curve is 

631
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:00,650
really long.
But once it starts to move up,

632
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:05,651
it starts to move up really fast.
And obviously that's the position that 

633
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:09,101
we're in now.
So single celled organisms for a long 

634
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:09,101
time.

635
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:10,850
Then they started to diversify and then 
you could imagine,

636
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:14,240
well,
from the single cell organism,

637
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:18,380
you start getting multicellular organism
and then it ends up with this tripartite

638
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,210
structure,
sensory layer,

639
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,370
nervous layer,
motor layer.

640
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,050
And then that starts to differentiate.
And every time there's a differentiation

641
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:30,500
that's conserved and that's these 
systems,

642
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,890
the motivational systems he emerged a 
long,

643
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:38,220
long time ago as emergent solutions to 
emergent problems.

644
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,370
And you've conserved all of them.
I mean you've conserved your snake 

645
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,760
reflux,
which is like three neurons long,

646
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,370
so that's really,
really primordial,

647
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:52,610
but you've conserved,
you've conserved function at almost 

648
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,581
every temporal level,
so there's parts of you that are quick 

649
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:59,451
and dirty and parts of you that are slow
and sophisticated and a lot of the 

650
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,460
contents of consciousness is slow and 
sophisticated,

651
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,620
so it can't help you out in an 
emergency,

652
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,760
but it can do or consciousness seems to 
do is take your structure,

653
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,810
it analyzes the world's for,
for let's say,

654
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,690
mismatches between what you want and 
what's happening.

655
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,540
And then it either helps you all to the 
world.

656
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:23,541
So those mismatches go away or it turns 
inward and modifies the structures that 

657
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,030
you're using.
So if you're playing the piano,

658
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,230
you've got this automatized routine has 
very little to do with consciousness.

659
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,390
If you've practiced enough and you make 
a mistake,

660
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,710
you stop and you note the mistake,
new stop,

661
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,520
and then you slow it down and then you 
read,

662
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,090
you practice the new thing,
then you speed it up.

663
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:46,650
Then you speed it up,
speed it up,

664
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,890
and as you're doing that,
the neural representation shrinks until 

665
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,101
you've developed this little specialized
machine and then you run that a few 

666
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:58,611
times and now you can ignore it.
You can look at the notes and just play 

667
00:36:58,611 --> 00:36:59,550
and away you go,
and that's kind of what consciousness is

668
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:04,551
doing all the time.
You're laying out an automatized 

669
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:07,461
routine,
and then if that doesn't produce the 

670
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,110
intended outcome,
you stop.

671
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:15,170
You become conscious really because 
nothing like an error to make you 

672
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,411
conscious.
Then you do a high resolution analysis 

673
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:22,311
of the space in which the error emerged.
You rematch your motor output,

674
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:26,430
your perceptions and all of that to make
that error go away and away you go,

675
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,740
and so your consciousness is 
continually.

676
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,820
Your consciousness seems to be 
continually building your unconscious,

677
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,330
your procedural unconscious,
and so to some degree the purpose of 

678
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,470
consciousness is to make you functional 
unconsciously,

679
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,660
right?
Because that's way better.

680
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,180
You don't want to be conscious of most 
things because it's just,

681
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:50,330
what are you going to do?
Be Conscious of your digestive 

682
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:50,330
processes.
It's like,

683
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,300
no,
if you're good at something,

684
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:53,160
you hardly have to be conscious of it at
all.

685
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,250
So consciousness is something like an 
error detection and rectification 

686
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:58,410
system,
something like that,

687
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,480
and so you can say,
well,

688
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:03,870
you can practice being conscious because
what that means in some sense,

689
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,520
you're always attending to your errors.

690
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,780
Not seems to be a really intelligent 
thing to do if you don't take it too far

691
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:13,440
and collapse yourself because if you're 
always attending to your errors,

692
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,190
you're always improving your automated 
adaptability,

693
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,760
something like that,
right?

694
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:23,810
Pay Attention.
See if things are working out the way 

695
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:23,810
that you want them to,
and if they're not,

696
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,530
modify your,
your,

697
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,300
your approach,
your perceptions.

698
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:32,330
Okay,
so you have conserved these systems and 

699
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:36,050
the systems emerged to to solve the 
problems of the emergent complexity and 

700
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:40,621
you end up at birth with all of these 
conserved systems and so those would be 

701
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:44,401
proclivities that would enable you to 
manifest necessary realm of behaviors in

702
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,020
the social natural human environment,
something like that.

703
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:52,520
So you're basically prepared for that.
And I,

704
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:57,521
I told I,
we went through what those were last 

705
00:38:57,521 --> 00:38:59,521
time and you can break them down into 
self maintenance motivations and self 

706
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:01,660
propagation motivation,
something like that.

707
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,670
So,
okay,

708
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:08,671
now the question is how did those 
manifest themselves and that's where we 

709
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:10,840
get.
That's where we can make a shift,

710
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:15,841
say from evolutionary ideas and 
biological ideas to narrative ideas.

711
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,930
So I,
I made the case for you that you exist 

712
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:22,060
within.
Within this thing,

713
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:27,061
I've never figured out exactly what to 
call it because you can call it a game 

714
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:27,880
or you can call it a frame of reference,
which is pretty good one.

715
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,830
Or you can call it a story or you can 
call it a unit of perception,

716
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,560
but that's not exactly right because 
it's more than perception.

717
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,680
It's really this,
it's a really what it is is a micro 

718
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:40,690
personality.
It's,

719
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:45,691
it's your,
it's your personality as it manifests 

720
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:46,930
itself at it,
at the highest possible resolution.

721
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,270
That's what this is.
And so if I'm,

722
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:55,120
let's say I set myself the task of 
moving those keys from there to here.

723
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,650
So my perceptual frame is,
it's this thing I think,

724
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,670
well,
what's the world?

725
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:09,810
Everything else can be ignored.
I need to make an object out of my hand.

726
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,590
These keys,
that tiny spot on the table and,

727
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,670
and my goal is to transform this pattern
into that pattern and it's a pattern 

728
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,620
because it maintains itself across time,
right?

729
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:29,560
It's not like smoke or cloud.
It persists.

730
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,450
So there it is.
There it is,

731
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:32,590
there it is.
There it is.

732
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,870
That's a pattern that's extending across
time.

733
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:39,190
So I have this goal which is the 
transformation of this,

734
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:42,790
into that and that goal.
So that would be roughly speaking,

735
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:47,791
the goal is point b,
but you can't just think about this as 

736
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:48,730
something that's a goal because it isn't
just a goal.

737
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:55,020
There's a goal which is the end,
which is the end state of this entire 

738
00:40:56,431 --> 00:40:58,290
process.
The End State is,

739
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,740
I've moved the thing from here to here.
I've transformed this into this and I've

740
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:08,830
done it using action and that's so.
That's a useful thing to know too.

741
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:14,630
I have an abstract notion.
That's my decision that I'm going to get

742
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:19,760
the world to manifest this pattern 
instead of this one.

743
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,370
Okay,
so that gives me my target.

744
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:29,390
That's an abstraction,
but when I actually do the 

745
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,561
transformation,
that's not an abstraction because now 

746
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:34,640
I'm using actual action,
actual behavior,

747
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,850
and so I take this abstract micro 
personality.

748
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:41,540
This is the part that's operating on 
this tiny little section of the world.

749
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,350
I make the transformation and as soon as
I do that and other thing happens,

750
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:47,690
which is I don't need that anymore.
Right?

751
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:50,390
I moved to the next one of those,
whatever it happens to be,

752
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,660
and so one of the things we're going to 
have to figure out is what is the 

753
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,290
relationship between these things?
Because you're always in one of them and

754
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:02,291
they're scalable.
It's like when you're doing a specific 

755
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:05,201
action,
it's really high resolution and that's 

756
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:06,650
kind of where you want to be operating 
when you know what you're doing,

757
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:08,930
that's where you want to be operating,
roughly speaking,

758
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,920
when you're trying to do something new,
but it's scalable and so that's the 

759
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,781
framework which is constructed in part 
from these motivational systems that 

760
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:21,380
emerged over evolutionary history.

761
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,200
The framework specifies the current 
condition,

762
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,500
the desired condition and and the 
behavioral manifestations that are 

763
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,670
necessary to make the transformation and
so you can't think about it as a drive 

764
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,800
because it's instincts are often thought
about is drives or as a goal.

765
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:42,190
It's not correct because the thing 
actually determines your perceptions.

766
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:47,950
It determines what objects manifest 
themselves to you in the world or what 

767
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,581
patterns.
That's another way of thinking about it 

768
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:51,581
because like when I'm looking at this,
it,

769
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:54,050
it's hard to watch your own perceptions,
but when I'm looking at this,

770
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,110
I really.
I can see that chair,

771
00:42:57,111 --> 00:43:02,111
but if I didn't know it was a chair,
I wouldn't be able to tell by looking 

772
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:02,111
by,
by my visual input.

773
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:06,550
I can kind of see this one.
Although I really can't tell what color 

774
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:09,650
it is,
that one slightly clearer.

775
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,830
This is pretty blurry here,
like I can't see my fingers.

776
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:17,831
If I'm looking at the keys,
I can't see my fingers unless they move 

777
00:43:17,831 --> 00:43:19,280
and I'm very,
very focused on that.

778
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:24,281
So what happens is that all the rest of 
the world turns into a low resolution 

779
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:25,850
representations that vanishes on its 
periphery.

780
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,480
The resolution increases as as I moved 
towards the central part of my visual 

781
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,771
field and here it's sharp enough so that
I can actually see the letters on that 

782
00:43:35,771 --> 00:43:35,771
key.

783
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,720
So,
so my desire,

784
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,330
which I am indicating by the point of my
eyes,

785
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:45,530
is specifying the objects that I see and
specifying their level of resolution.

786
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,500
So you can't just call that a drive or a
goal.

787
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,000
It's,
it's,

788
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,360
that's not right.
It's,

789
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,140
it's the mechanism that makes the world 
manifest itself to you.

790
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,740
So that's,
that's unbelievably crazy thing is that 

791
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,740
the world manifests itself to you in 
keeping with your goals.

792
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:06,220
Now,
that doesn't mean that you can make the 

793
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:06,530
world do any old thing because it pushes
back,

794
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:08,900
right?
It objects to you so,

795
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:11,580
but still it's,
it's very strange thing that,

796
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,680
okay,
so fine.

797
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:18,770
So it specifies your perceptions,
your target,

798
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,980
the current reality and the likely 
procedure that you're going to use to 

799
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,150
make all of that interrelated,
but it does more than that.

800
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,180
So let's.
We're gonna we're gonna.

801
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,920
Look at it from a couple of different 
perspectives.

802
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:31,280
So the classic

803
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,260
and archaic way of thinking about 
perception is the world's full of 

804
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:39,260
objects.
You see the objects,

805
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:39,810
you think about them,
you evaluate them,

806
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,980
then you act on them.
It's like,

807
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:42,180
no,
that isn't how it works.

808
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:44,250
First of all,
the world is not made out of objects.

809
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:49,730
The world is made out of.
I think the world is made out of tools 

810
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,791
and obstacles and it's because you can't
not perceive the world in relationship 

811
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:56,100
to you and what you perceive actually or
the meaning of objects.

812
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:01,530
You precede the patterns and the tool is
something like a meaningful pattern or 

813
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:06,890
useful pattern.
It's something like that and so lucky 

814
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:06,890
look again,
you look at,

815
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,070
I might say to someone,
describe this room.

816
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,630
Now you're going to pick.
You're going to pick a level of 

817
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,631
description that's very particular,
you're going to pick one that other 

818
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:24,261
human beings could understand,
so it's going to be predicated on on 

819
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:24,261
your size,
for example,

820
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:26,880
and so you're going to be predicated on 
your knowledge that that other person is

821
00:45:26,881 --> 00:45:31,881
a lot like you and it has a lot of the 
same underlying structures and 

822
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:32,190
motivations.
So,

823
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,500
and that's an implicit predicate of your
description.

824
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:35,670
So we're going to say,
well,

825
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:40,671
it's kind of an ordinary classroom.
It's got 20 rows of tables that each 

826
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:45,060
have five chairs at it and each of them 
does have five chairs.

827
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:48,960
There's some posts that hold them up.
There's a couple of speakers,

828
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,030
there's a podium,
there's a screen,

829
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:54,240
there's some additional chairs,
there's a scattering of people,

830
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:57,840
there's some electronic equipment,
and so you know,

831
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:02,841
of course that there's an infinite 
number of things I could be describing 

832
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:02,841
in this room,
right?

833
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:05,670
Like I could be describing.
There's a lot of color variation in that

834
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,470
tile.
So if I look at it,

835
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:12,471
I can see that it's unlike the other 
tiles because the light is reflecting 

836
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:14,010
off it.
So it's got a shiny white element.

837
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,220
There's about,
God only knows a million different 

838
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:19,470
scratches in it,
each which are unique.

839
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,890
I can't even really tell what color it 
is.

840
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:24,450
It kind of looks like an off grayish 
green.

841
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:28,590
But if I was painting it to get a 
reasonable representation,

842
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:33,591
I'd had to have to have at least six or 
seven shades of green ranging from quite

843
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:40,281
dark to almost white.
And that's only if I look at it from 

844
00:46:40,281 --> 00:46:40,920
here.
If I look at it from here,

845
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,520
well then you get the point right.
I mean there is an infinite number of 

846
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,661
details in this room.
There's an infinite number of facts in 

847
00:46:50,661 --> 00:46:51,570
this room.
That's also why I don't believe that you

848
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:54,610
can derive an ought from an is.
It's like w,

849
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,520
you know,
that's the old human issue,

850
00:46:56,521 --> 00:47:01,521
right?
You cannot derive ethical guidelines 

851
00:47:01,521 --> 00:47:03,950
from factual knowledge and I think the 
reason for that is which facts are you 

852
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:04,390
going to pick?

853
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,720
How are you going to select them?
There's,

854
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,510
there's an infinite number of them,
even in a constrained situation.

855
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,760
So merely by attending to some and not 
attending to others,

856
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,850
you're already using an ethic because 
you can't attend to one thing and not 

857
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:27,131
another without being ensconced in one 
of these value structures because the 

858
00:47:27,131 --> 00:47:28,820
value structure is what determines the 
direction of your attention.

859
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,920
And so you can't make the argument that 
you're using the,

860
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:38,080
the infinite number of facts that are 
available at your disposal to govern how

861
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:40,990
you're looking at the facts you're not.
That isn't what you're doing.

862
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,870
It's not possible to do that.
So what do you do?

863
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:49,350
Well,
you described the things in the room 

864
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:52,261
that would be relevant to other people.
Otherwise you're going to bore them to 

865
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:52,540
death or they're gonna think you're 
insane,

866
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:53,950
you know,
so.

867
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:59,340
Or an artist maybe because an artist 
might do the kind of concentration on a 

868
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,701
detail that I just described,
but he's obviously or she's obviously 

869
00:48:02,701 --> 00:48:03,310
trying to paint the thing or represented
somehow.

870
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:05,170
So it's still too of like,
well,

871
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,330
why do you want to know that there are 
tables?

872
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:12,660
Well,
because you said at the why do you want 

873
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:12,660
to know if there are chairs?
Because you sit in them.

874
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,930
You know,
what about the screen or the camera 

875
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:16,930
equipment?
Well,

876
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,430
they're all usable tools and so that's 
what you describe.

877
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,600
You described the world at the level of 
usable tool or you might also say,

878
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,340
um,
you know,

879
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,980
look out for that girl who's third in 
the third row.

880
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:31,981
She's trouble and so you might call out 
someone if you're describing the room 

881
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:36,160
because there is somewhere in that room 
that if you go,

882
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:38,980
you're going to get into trouble and so 
and so.

883
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:41,380
Those are sort of the things that seemed
to me to be relevant.

884
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,960
There are too old to move you along your
way.

885
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:48,990
Facilitators,
that's another way of thinking about 

886
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,131
that and there are obstacles that get in
your way and there's a tiny set of 

887
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:51,610
those.

888
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:56,850
Otherwise you get overwhelmed.
You're not going to go anywhere where 

889
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:56,850
it's all obstacles,
right?

890
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,260
You don't even mind you,
you don't want to be in that place.

891
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,320
You want to be at a place where it's 
mostly this and then then there's the 

892
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,950
biggest category though.
This is what's cool,

893
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,900
this is,
and this is so important,

894
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:13,590
is the biggest perceptual category is 
that which is not relevant at this time 

895
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,780
because it contains everything you know 
like when you're.

896
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,820
When you're writing on this,
on this pad,

897
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,760
you assume the entire world around you 
is constant and therefore you can ignore

898
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,680
it.
It's everything out there.

899
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,050
All the transformations that are taking 
place.

900
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,260
You turn to zero and you just focus on 
maybe the space that's occupied by a 

901
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:40,051
single letter.
Your whole world shrinks down to just 

902
00:49:40,051 --> 00:49:40,390
that single letter and everything else 
is ignored.

903
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,820
Well,
what happens if something goes wrong?

904
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,100
This is the thing.
This is why this is his own port.

905
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:50,490
What happens if something goes wrong?
An indeterminate set of those irrelevant

906
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:56,250
entities has now become relevant.
That's the problem is the invisibility 

907
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,860
disappears and so for example,
you're all treating each other in this 

908
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:05,020
room right now as ignorable entities.
Roughly speaking,

909
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,080
you could all be blogs from a perceptual
perspective,

910
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:13,081
and if you look at how you see the room,
except for the person that you're 

911
00:50:13,081 --> 00:50:16,921
focusing on,
everyone else's a blob and some of them 

912
00:50:16,921 --> 00:50:17,770
are virtually invisible blocks and 
that's fine because they're.

913
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,680
You're adequately represented as a blob 
of less.

914
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:24,940
You do something that disturbs the 
ongoing flow of goal directed action.

915
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,650
Just like the gorilla thing,
right?

916
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:27,800
So

917
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,520
the damn gorilla was invisible because 
it didn't get in the way.

918
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,530
Even though you'd think.
Of course you'd see a gorilla.

919
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,560
It's like everything that doesn't get in
the way is invisible except for that 

920
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,791
small fraction of things that you can 
use for your purpose and that's how you 

921
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:46,340
perceive.
So it's so mind boggling that because it

922
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:48,950
puts perception into the realm of 
ethics,

923
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,640
it isn't what you'd expect.
You see what you're aiming at and you 

924
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,421
know that you know that you're standing 
on a street corner and you look up and 

925
00:50:58,421 --> 00:51:02,981
soon there's 10 advanced chimpanzees 
like you right beside you looking up to 

926
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:08,081
see what the hell it is that you're 
aiming at because they assume just by 

927
00:51:08,081 --> 00:51:11,531
watching you that if you're focusing 
your perception on something and you're 

928
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:13,310
fixated on it,
that it's relevant and important.

929
00:51:13,311 --> 00:51:18,311
It's tool like or maybe obstacle like 
it's relevant for some reason and so we 

930
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:21,940
live in a landscape of relevance and 
that's a mind.

931
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:27,010
To me that's an absolutely mind boggling
idea because that is way different than 

932
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,611
living in a landscape of facts.
It is not the same thing even a little 

933
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:34,811
bit and there are philosophers who've 
pursued that idea quite well.

934
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:38,230
I would say to quite an incredible 
degree.

935
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,060
High degree is probably the one who's 
done that more than anyone else,

936
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,810
but the the 19th century pragmatist,
we're very interested in that as well,

937
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,350
but the because you think hold the 
classic scientific ideas,

938
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:53,120
something like you perceive the universe
of facts and derive conclusions and act.

939
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,690
It's like,
no,

940
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:58,691
you don't.
You perceive a landscape of pre 

941
00:51:58,691 --> 00:52:00,620
categorized relevance that's dependent 
on your ethic.

942
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,820
Jesus.
It's so peculiar that and so that brings

943
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:09,230
up real questions like what ethic best 
structures,

944
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:12,890
your perceptions.
Well that is an interest.

945
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:15,590
That is the interesting ideas as far as 
I'm concerned.

946
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:16,610
Okay,
so.

947
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:21,730
So then we can make this a little bit 
more interesting I think is the right 

948
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:23,810
way of thinking about it.
Okay,

949
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:28,811
well,
so you've got tools and obstacles but 

950
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:30,611
they're not dead.
That's the other thing because we're in 

951
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:30,611
an ethical landscape because we're in a 
motivated landscape.

952
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,980
Whether something is a tool or an 
obstacle actually matters to you and we 

953
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:40,271
could actually define matter.
Matter is a weird word because there 

954
00:52:40,271 --> 00:52:44,171
are.
There's matter and then there's the 

955
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:46,100
things that matter and you could say the
world is made out of matter or you could

956
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:51,101
say that the world is made out of the 
things that matter and I would say you 

957
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,880
act like the world is made out of things
that matter.

958
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,650
You might say,
I don't believe that.

959
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:59,651
I believe it's made out of matter,
but no you don't because that's not how 

960
00:52:59,651 --> 00:52:59,651
you act.

961
00:52:59,651 --> 00:53:02,360
It might be what you say you do,
but it is not what you do.

962
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,910
So why did things matter?
Well,

963
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,030
first of all,
irrelevant things don't matter and thank

964
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:09,350
God for that,
right?

965
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:14,351
Because if everything mattered,
it's while you're either you're either 

966
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:19,390
in the midst of an Lsd trip or you're 
schizophrenic or you're in real serious 

967
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:25,631
trouble,
so you want most things to be 

968
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:28,361
irrelevant.
Now that's kind of dull and takes the 

969
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:29,400
glory and the glamor out of the world,
but from a cognitive perspective,

970
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:33,450
it's definitely an advantage.
So irrelevancy,

971
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,480
man,
that's critical and a huge amount of 

972
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,630
what you have done is learned 
irrelevance.

973
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,280
It's the basis of your cognitive 
knowledge is learned irrelevance.

974
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,390
What to ignore.

975
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,850
Okay,
fine.

976
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:51,690
So that's that Zeros things out to turn 
most of the world into zero.

977
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:57,860
Well then you have this small subset of 
things that are beneficial to you that 

978
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,820
you can use for the purposes of your 
current operation,

979
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
which we'll define in more detail.
You can use that for the purposes of 

980
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,540
your current job,
your current endeavor,

981
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,140
and then you have obstacles and so for 
example,

982
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,220
if I'm,
if I'm late for class,

983
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:19,221
so I'm in a particular state of mind and
I walk in here and I see that I'm going 

984
00:54:19,221 --> 00:54:20,880
to get a little burst of negative 
emotion,

985
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:26,300
it's irritation and the reason for that 
is that is not a recycling bin.

986
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:32,750
Then it's an obstacle that some dimwit 
left there just to annoy me and I mean,

987
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:39,030
you know what I mean?
That's how you react to the world in a 

988
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,660
situation like that.
It's like it's not a recycling bin.

989
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:45,290
If it's here and I don't want to stand 
there,

990
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,570
then it's a recycling bin.
If it's there,

991
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,400
it's an obstacle and as soon as I look 
at it,

992
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,880
it isn't that I see it and then get 
annoyed.

993
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:59,510
It's that annoyance is part of the 
perception because it's an obstacle in 

994
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:03,711
my pathway.
Then the emotion comes along with the 

995
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:04,200
perception.
It's not laid on top of it.

996
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:05,220
It's not,
oh,

997
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,240
that's A.

998
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,050
I don't think that's a recycling bin 
that's in the wrong place.

999
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,490
Now.
It's in my way.

1000
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:18,580
I should be annoyed.
That isn't what happens is the 

1001
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,040
annoyance.
My suspicions are that the dam annoyance

1002
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:24,041
is faster than the object perception 
because it's a more primordial circuit,

1003
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,930
so you actually.
That's now.

1004
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:29,090
There's a great book if you're 
interested in this sort of thing.

1005
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:34,390
There's a great book called an 
ecological approach to visual 

1006
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:38,741
perception,
which was written by a guy named Gibson 

1007
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:38,741
back in the seventies and it's 
brilliant.

1008
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:40,880
He,
his fundamental conclusion is,

1009
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:46,060
I think wrong,
but it doesn't matter that the book is 

1010
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,721
not only brilliant because see,
he was the guy that came up with the 

1011
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,961
idea of affordance and an affordance is 
something that affords some utility in 

1012
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,470
that can be positive or negative and he 
thought about the world as being full of

1013
00:55:57,471 --> 00:55:58,940
furniture,
roughly speaking,

1014
00:55:58,941 --> 00:55:59,720
something like that.

1015
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,720
And then what you saw,
what you perceived directly was the 

1016
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,250
affordance and so he imagined the visual
cliff experiment.

1017
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:12,730
So let's say I put a piece of glass over
top of this,

1018
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:14,800
the space between these two tables,
no chair there,

1019
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,510
and I take a duck and I put the dark 
here in the duck,

1020
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:19,550
walks out on the glass,
the duck doesn't care,

1021
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,740
it will just walk out and the glass 
wall,

1022
00:56:21,741 --> 00:56:24,790
it's an aquatic animal and if there's 
depth underneath that,

1023
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:27,880
it doesn't really bother a duck.
But if you put a human infant on,

1024
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,920
they're old enough to crawl,
the human infant will look over it and 

1025
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,030
that's not going on that glass.
And you might say,

1026
00:56:34,031 --> 00:56:39,031
well what is it c?
And you could say it sees a space 

1027
00:56:39,031 --> 00:56:41,491
between the two tables and infers that 
it might fall,

1028
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,480
but it's like eight months old.

1029
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,220
Like,
what the hell is it's inferring that no,

1030
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:47,950
it's not.
It sees a place to fall off of.

1031
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,880
And that's,
that's Gibson's fundamental point is 

1032
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,280
that you don't see a cliff.
You see a falling off place.

1033
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,240
And of course why wouldn't you see that?
Because if that isn't what you saw,

1034
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:03,241
you wouldn't be here because what of 
your dopey ancestors would've wandered 

1035
00:57:03,241 --> 00:57:05,650
off the cliff and died?
The ones that saw a falling off place,

1036
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:10,651
they just stayed away from that.
And you know if you have vertigo and 

1037
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:14,910
even if you don't,
if you're up on the 35th floor of an 

1038
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,150
apartment building and you walk out onto
the balcony,

1039
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:20,710
it's really interesting to notice your 
perception because you might think,

1040
00:57:20,711 --> 00:57:24,820
well,
you see the space and you become afraid.

1041
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:25,240
It's like,
no,

1042
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,550
you don't.
You walk closer to it in your body.

1043
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,900
You're.
You perceive the damn thing with your 

1044
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:33,900
body.

1045
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,330
You can also see it,
but you perceive it with your body.

1046
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:36,100
It's like,
don't go there.

1047
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:41,250
Don't go any closer and your whole.
There's an automatic mapping of that 

1048
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:45,970
place onto do this.
Go away from there and that's underneath

1049
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:48,520
and faster than the APP.
The actual quote,

1050
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,570
conscious object perception.
So anyways,

1051
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:56,380
the other thing about Gibson's book that
I love is he is so clear that guy,

1052
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:59,940
he's such a good writer because he takes
you through a very complex argument.

1053
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:02,230
But just a pristine example of 
reasoning.

1054
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:04,540
It's the whole book is reasoning.
It's brilliant.

1055
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,680
Brilliant.
So anyways,

1056
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:08,860
so if you want some background on that 
idea,

1057
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:13,861
the idea of perception of utility,
let's say that's a great place to look,

1058
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:17,860
but it's also we're thinking about it 
from a biological perspective because of

1059
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:22,861
bloody well,
of course you're going to see the world 

1060
00:58:22,861 --> 00:58:25,140
as what matters because you're the sort 
of creature that cares about what 

1061
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,410
matters mostly because you don't want to
die.

1062
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:32,250
So you can't remove the fact that you 
don't want to die from your perception.

1063
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:34,840
Well,
if you did,

1064
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,700
while you can imagine what would happen 
if you did,

1065
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:37,900
you know,
you,

1066
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:43,380
you do something like wander off a 
falling off place and that would be the 

1067
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,321
end of view.
So it's built into your damn 

1068
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:49,171
perceptions.
And so it's built into the facts that 

1069
00:58:49,171 --> 00:58:49,810
you see because there's an infinite 
number of facts.

1070
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,960
And so even just selecting the facts,
that's an ethical issue.

1071
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,280
So it's actually matters practically 
too,

1072
00:58:57,281 --> 00:59:02,281
because one of the things that I've come
to understand about political arguments 

1073
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:03,940
is,
well say people say,

1074
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:04,780
well,
you know,

1075
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:09,781
the,
the person on the other side of the 

1076
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:10,360
ideological continuum has different 
opinions than I do.

1077
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,870
It's like,
no,

1078
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:12,550
they don't.
Or maybe they do,

1079
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:17,850
but they don't see the same facts 
because the filter they use to select 

1080
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:22,861
from among the infinite number of 
available facts preferentially presents 

1081
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:26,870
them with the facts that are relevant to
them and that's already built into their

1082
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:27,350
ethic.

1083
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:32,950
And so one of the horrible things about 
political discussions is that you're 

1084
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:33,940
actually having a discussion about what 
the facts are.

1085
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:38,970
You say,
well the facts are the same for 

1086
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:38,970
everyone.
It's like,

1087
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,110
yeah,
it's like saying I have an infinite 

1088
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,110
library of books and you can come into 
it.

1089
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:42,690
It's like,
well,

1090
00:59:42,691 --> 00:59:45,740
you're going to pick out the same book.
Seems highly improbable.

1091
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:49,260
And that's the problem with facts.
It's like there's,

1092
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:54,470
there's a lot of them.
You know what you try to do something 

1093
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:54,890
like untangled the Israel Palestine 
conflict.

1094
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,530
I mean,
one of the things you just to start with

1095
00:59:57,531 --> 00:59:58,070
is like,
okay,

1096
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:00,260
how far back you're going to go?
Well,

1097
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:02,150
I would say it depends on what argument 
you want to make.

1098
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,700
You know,
if you want to make argument a,

1099
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:09,701
you go back 100 years.
If you want to make our B go back 3000 

1100
01:00:09,701 --> 01:00:12,581
years and then you could have an 
argument about which timescale you 

1101
01:00:12,581 --> 01:00:12,650
should use,
but it's not like it's obvious.

1102
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,690
You know,
is it 10 years?

1103
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,460
Is it one year?
Is it six months?

1104
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,900
Like is it's not 3000 years.
Is it 2,999

1105
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:23,630
years?
Like where are the borders of relevancy?

1106
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,880
When you're laying out the landscape of 
the argument,

1107
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,110
God only knows it's intractable

1108
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:38,160
and you know partly the way your 
temperament solves that problem because 

1109
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:38,160
it does is say,
well,

1110
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,961
create a creature like you with your 
temperament preferentially attends to 

1111
01:00:42,961 --> 01:00:45,721
this set of facts and that'll work 
because attending to that sort of fact 

1112
01:00:45,721 --> 01:00:48,970
is likely to produce a reasonable 
outcome for you in most circumstances.

1113
01:00:48,971 --> 01:00:53,971
And it's a way that you simplify the 
world and make a tremendous amount of 

1114
01:00:53,971 --> 01:00:57,241
the irrelevant a priority filters.

1115
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,540
Okay,
good.

1116
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:06,020
Now the next cool thing.
What happens when you see a tool?

1117
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,790
You're happy.
What tabs?

1118
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:14,800
When you see an obstacle,
you're unhappy and they're now you 

1119
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,390
understand emotions.
And that's so.

1120
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:20,720
That doesn't take much.
That's once you've got this initial 

1121
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:20,720
framework,
it's like,

1122
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:20,880
okay,
well what's an emotion for positive?

1123
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,930
Move forward?
Negative.

1124
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:29,190
Get Away indeterminant.
Stop.

1125
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,530
That's anxiety.
Stop.

1126
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,420
You're not.
You're not where you think you are.

1127
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,340
Your map isn't producing the desired 
outcome.

1128
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,320
It's wrong.
What should you do?

1129
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:41,610
You don't know.
Stop.

1130
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:46,050
Because if you don't know where to go,
there's no point in going anywhere.

1131
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,880
And then one,
prepare.

1132
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,670
That's anxiety.
Start prepare.

1133
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,260
While people hate that,
because,

1134
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,000
well,
for obvious reasons,

1135
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,190
prepare for what?
Everything.

1136
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,860
Yeah,
very,

1137
01:01:58,861 --> 01:02:02,920
very demanding.
Psychophysiological.

1138
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,800
And that's also something that's really 
worth knowing.

1139
01:02:05,801 --> 01:02:09,850
It's like anxiety isn't just a 
psychological state that's unpleasant.

1140
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:14,851
It's like you're revved up and you're 
burning resources like mad and you're in

1141
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:20,040
a biochemical state such that that's 
optimized for quick

1142
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,930
action,
but it's toxic.

1143
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:23,880
If you inhabit it for any length of 
time,

1144
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:29,930
so not knowing what to do,
that is not good and it isn't just that 

1145
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:30,300
it makes you feel bad,
it hurts you,

1146
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:32,070
it damages you,
it can kill you,

1147
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,110
it'll make you age,
it'll make you fat,

1148
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:39,111
it'll give you diabetes,
it'll suppress your immune system so 

1149
01:02:39,111 --> 01:02:40,050
you're more likely to develop cancer.
It'll damage your brain,

1150
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:45,051
your hippocampus.
It'll increase the probability that you 

1151
01:02:45,051 --> 01:02:47,631
have Alzheimer's.
It's like it's no joke that it's you're 

1152
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,170
running your machinery faster than you 
can replenish it,

1153
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:52,710
so it's not a state that you can be in 
it.

1154
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,750
It's not a state you can tolerate 
because it's anxious.

1155
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,280
Anxiety,
it's anxious,

1156
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:01,610
but it's also not a state you can live 
in and so I don't know where I am means 

1157
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:06,501
everything's relevant and I have to ramp
up my capacity for auction to deal with 

1158
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:07,620
that.

1159
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:13,220
Bad people do not like that.
We do not like not to be where we think 

1160
01:03:13,411 --> 01:03:15,030
we are.
We really,

1161
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:20,031
really,
really don't like that and we structure 

1162
01:03:20,031 --> 01:03:20,031
almost all over environment's 
constantly,

1163
01:03:20,031 --> 01:03:23,730
so that never happens.
We're all dressed the same with tiny,

1164
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:25,080
tiny variations.
You know,

1165
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:30,350
we all follow the same traffic laws,
everybody's behaving according to the 

1166
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:34,161
appropriate code in this room and 
everyone in this building is doing the 

1167
01:03:34,161 --> 01:03:37,311
same thing.
It's like we're doing everything we can 

1168
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:40,610
to make sure that everyone knows exactly
where they are and what they're doing 

1169
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:44,151
all the time,
and that's because when we're in that 

1170
01:03:44,151 --> 01:03:47,400
state,
we can advance cautiously using positive

1171
01:03:47,401 --> 01:03:50,790
things and maintain a modicum of 
positive emotion.

1172
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,880
That's what we're basically trying to 
do.

1173
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:56,010
Okay,
so you want to set up your world so that

1174
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,070
you're surrounded by things that move 
you along your way,

1175
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:03,000
that obstacles are minimized and that 
almost everything can be ignored.

1176
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:04,410
Okay,
so emotion,

1177
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:06,990
positive emotion.
That's dopaminergic,

1178
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:12,620
that's incentive reward.
You experience it in relationship to a 

1179
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:16,671
goal because you know most of the time 
when you talk to behavioral 

1180
01:04:16,671 --> 01:04:20,091
psychologists,
they'll tell you rewarding reward is a 

1181
01:04:20,091 --> 01:04:20,310
satiation consequence.
You're hungry,

1182
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:21,780
you get a piece of food that's 
rewarding.

1183
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,320
It's like that's,
that's conservatory reward,

1184
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,400
and that shuts down the motivational 
system.

1185
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,940
It's say it's satiating.
It makes you satisfied.

1186
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,300
That's not the same as incentive reward.
Incentive reward says,

1187
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:37,560
come this way.
Come this way,

1188
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,750
good things are over here,
good things are over here,

1189
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:43,740
and that's dopaminergic and that's the 
kind of reward people really like.

1190
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:48,980
We live for that.
So when you talk about positive meaning 

1191
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,420
in your life,
this is an oversimplification,

1192
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,650
but a tremendous amount of that is 
incentive reward.

1193
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,800
You're in a goal directed structure to 
value structure.

1194
01:04:55,801 --> 01:05:00,801
It's,
let's say it's fairly well developed 

1195
01:05:00,801 --> 01:05:00,801
because you're sophisticated.

1196
01:05:00,801 --> 01:05:01,380
Everything you do is linked to something
else.

1197
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,180
You move ahead,
it works,

1198
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,400
gets you move ahead at works.
Yes,

1199
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,460
and it's that constant moving ahead and 
the validation of the frame that makes 

1200
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:14,790
your life meaningful and so that also 
means no value system,

1201
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:20,120
no positive emotion,
which is another thing that's so much 

1202
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,341
worth knowing.
You know the postmodernists complaint 

1203
01:05:23,341 --> 01:05:24,430
about value systems constantly and they 
say,

1204
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:29,431
well,
the problem with a value system is that 

1205
01:05:29,431 --> 01:05:31,030
it includes some people,
winners and excludes other people.

1206
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:32,770
Losers sick.
Yes,

1207
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,380
that's true.
What's the answer?

1208
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:38,950
Flatten the value system.
So there's no losers.

1209
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:42,040
Find new winners either and if there's 
no.

1210
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:45,340
If the value system is flat,
there's no point b,

1211
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,610
what the hell are you going to do?
Where's your positive emotion?

1212
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:54,210
You had nothing to.
You're going to wander around being 

1213
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:54,210
happy that the value system is flat.

1214
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:54,210
It's like,
no,

1215
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:59,161
you're not.
Because when you flatten out value 

1216
01:05:59,161 --> 01:06:01,801
systems,
you don't get rid of suffering because 

1217
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:01,801
you can't.
All you get rid of is the possibility of

1218
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,720
positive emotion and that is not a good 
solution.

1219
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,170
So then you leave people with nothing 
but negative emotion.

1220
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,410
It's so naive.
Okay,

1221
01:06:11,411 --> 01:06:13,960
so good.
So now we know you're going from point a

1222
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:15,850
to point b.
you're doing that with an action.

1223
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,830
If,
if things are working out,

1224
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:21,490
if you see facilitators along the way 
that you can utilize your,

1225
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:24,760
you,
you get to kick a positive emotion.

1226
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:30,060
You know when you can.
You can even see that calibrated like 

1227
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:30,060
let's say you do better than expected on
a test.

1228
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:35,580
Yes.
It's like that's better than doing as 

1229
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:39,271
well as you expected because what the 
message is is that not only am I moving 

1230
01:06:39,281 --> 01:06:44,281
towards my desired goal,
but I'm moving along faster and with 

1231
01:06:44,281 --> 01:06:44,350
less effort than I thought.

1232
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:47,140
It's like bang,
positive reinforcement,

1233
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,160
right?
You think,

1234
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:50,200
yes,
well that's it.

1235
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:55,260
That's meaning,
that's a big chunk of meaning and so a 

1236
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:59,031
really meaningful event is one that gets
you to the next step and simultaneously 

1237
01:06:59,771 --> 01:07:04,771
increases the probability that you're 
going to get to all the steps after 

1238
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,801
that.
That's like a maximally meaningful 

1239
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:07,801
event.
So you know,

1240
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:09,940
you get a,
you're opening an envelope about whether

1241
01:07:09,941 --> 01:07:12,760
or not you got into medical school.
It's like you're going like this,

1242
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:13,450
right?
Why?

1243
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,700
Why are you shaking?
It's an envelope.

1244
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,770
No,
it's not.

1245
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:19,900
It's a portal,
right?

1246
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:25,080
It's a portal and what's in that 
envelope either puts you that way into 

1247
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,420
one world or that way into another and 
you think you're looking at it,

1248
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:29,590
you think,
well that's an envelope.

1249
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:32,530
It's like your body isn't thinking that.
Not for a bloody second.

1250
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:35,770
It knows perfectly well that that's a 
portal and you open it up.

1251
01:07:35,771 --> 01:07:40,771
It's like collapse the whole,
what would you call it,

1252
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:47,350
that whole avatar related future,
just those ashes or bang,

1253
01:07:50,301 --> 01:07:55,301
it springs into reality and you perceive
that and that you perceive all of that 

1254
01:07:55,301 --> 01:07:59,981
almost instantaneously and that produces
that radical transformation in emotion 

1255
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:06,220
so you're not reacting to the envelope 
or maybe the envelope is and what you 

1256
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,600
think it is,
or maybe the envelope isn't what you see

1257
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:11,750
and that's more accurate.
That's way more accurate.

1258
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:14,000
The envelope is way more than what you 
see.

1259
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:21,350
Okay,
good.

1260
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:23,270
Let's break for 15 minutes.
Okay,

1261
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:28,360
and then we'll,
we'll go ahead with the next part of 

1262
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:28,360
this.
Well,

1263
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,620
so that's just a transformation of the 
previous diagram.

1264
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,640
Well,
you're moving around long from what is 

1265
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:36,640
what should be.
We'll say

1266
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:42,630
as long as things are working out well,
then you're mildly happy and if they 

1267
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:43,050
don't work out well then you're 
downstairs.

1268
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,410
That's another problem.
You see,

1269
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:49,411
these are different sizes.
There's a reason for that and that's 

1270
01:08:49,411 --> 01:08:52,561
because negative emotion has more 
potency unit for unit than positive 

1271
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:57,181
emotion does.
And so what that means is that people 

1272
01:08:57,181 --> 01:09:00,541
are more reactive.
People hate a small loss more than they 

1273
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:04,621
like an equivalent gain,
and so we're tilted to some degree 

1274
01:09:04,621 --> 01:09:09,031
towards bias for negative emotion and 
that is also dependent on temperament 

1275
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:14,140
because somebody who's very,
very low in neuroticism,

1276
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,980
that's basically anxiety and emotional 
pain susceptibility,

1277
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:22,981
something like that.
So that would be the threshold for 

1278
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:23,110
experiencing a certain level of anxiety 
or emotional pain,

1279
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:25,780
but also the length of time that would 
take to recover.

1280
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,850
It's something like that.
And so,

1281
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:32,910
but for the standard human being,
loss hurts more than gain rewards.

1282
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:37,950
And so,
well,

1283
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,770
it's useful to know that because it 
helps you,

1284
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:44,340
it helps you understand yourself and 
other human beings,

1285
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:47,460
even if you're trying to motivate 
someone to do something,

1286
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:52,860
loss avoidance is often a powerful 
motivation as well as gain.

1287
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:54,380
So,
alright,

1288
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:56,280
prevention fundamentally.

1289
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:02,630
Okay,
so now here's another way of thinking 

1290
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:02,630
about this and this is a more abstract 
way of thinking about it.

1291
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:05,910
So we talked about the idea that the 
world might be divided into tools and,

1292
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:10,080
and um,
and obstacles and irrelevant things,

1293
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:13,170
most of which are irrelevant things.
That's a huge category.

1294
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:14,880
And that's the one you don't want to 
have disrupted

1295
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:21,910
and also that the obstacle category 
produces more emotion than the tool 

1296
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:23,930
category.
But here's another way of thinking about

1297
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:28,220
it and this is thinking about it more 
from a purely emotional perspective.

1298
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:30,670
When you think about the world as tools,
it's,

1299
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:35,770
it's dead practical and it sort of 
grounded in the idea of motor usage and 

1300
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:36,850
in some sense,
but you can,

1301
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:42,090
you can think in an analogical fashion 
about the same system in a slightly 

1302
01:10:44,391 --> 01:10:49,391
different matter.
You're in the situation that you're in 

1303
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:51,521
right now and that's not good enough.
And so that's another thing that's kind 

1304
01:10:51,521 --> 01:10:53,180
of interesting about people.
Is there a chronically dissatisfied with

1305
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:57,560
the way things are?
Well that's okay because you wouldn't be

1306
01:10:57,561 --> 01:11:02,561
motivated to move forward if you weren't
chronically dissatisfied with the way 

1307
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:03,140
that things are.
But it's kind of annoying,

1308
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:04,340
you know,
because you might think,

1309
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:06,410
well why aren't you just happy with what
you have?

1310
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:11,680
And the answer to that is generally 
because I don't know if it's going to 

1311
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,470
last.
And so that's part of it.

1312
01:11:12,471 --> 01:11:13,440
And the other is,
well,

1313
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:18,530
if the situation shifted a bit,
maybe I'd have more options and some of 

1314
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:20,370
that would be,
it would last longer and be more stable,

1315
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:23,460
it'd be more promising.
And so you can say,

1316
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:28,461
well,
you should be satisfied with what you 

1317
01:11:28,461 --> 01:11:30,021
have,
but it's kind of really a stupid thing 

1318
01:11:30,021 --> 01:11:30,240
in some sense to tell human beings 
because no matter what you have,

1319
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:32,640
it isn't going to solve your fundamental
problem.

1320
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:37,200
So the problem isn't going away and you 
can't fool yourself into saying,

1321
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:39,120
well,
what I have is great.

1322
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:44,240
You could say,
I could have a hell of a lot less and 

1323
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,601
that would be bad,
and most people have a lot less than me 

1324
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:47,601
and I should be grateful for what I 
have.

1325
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:49,290
That's fine,
that's perfectly reasonable.

1326
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:54,291
But you're stuck in this.
You're stuck with this chronic sense of 

1327
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:58,071
unfinished business.
And the reason for that is while you're 

1328
01:11:58,071 --> 01:11:58,290
permanently vulnerable,
so how else would you,

1329
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,800
how could it be otherwise?
And even if you've got your problem 

1330
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,601
solved,
then there's three or four people in 

1331
01:12:07,601 --> 01:12:07,601
your family that by no means have got 
their problem solved.

1332
01:12:07,601 --> 01:12:11,370
So the problem of problems never goes 
away.

1333
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:17,120
That's an existent.
That's a good thing to know 

1334
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:17,790
existentially too,
because it helps you calibrate your life

1335
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:20,190
properly because you might be thinking,
well,

1336
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:22,170
if I just got everything together,
you know,

1337
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:27,171
I'd hit some plateau of satiation and 
stability and then I would just be 

1338
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:27,171
there.
It's like,

1339
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:27,780
no,
that's never going to happen.

1340
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:32,900
It's never going to happen.
So you might as well just forget about 

1341
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,511
that and what you can sisyphus issue.
You know the guy who pushes the rock up 

1342
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,490
the road and up the hill and it rolls 
back down.

1343
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:42,000
I think it was Nietzsche who said,
we must presume sisyphus to be happy.

1344
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,440
Something like that.
Well,

1345
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:45,420
maybe you want to push your damn rock up
a hill,

1346
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,070
you know it's going to roll down again.
It's like,

1347
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,960
what are you going to do?
Just sit there by the rock.

1348
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:54,890
It's okay to be active even even if the 
problem you're trying to solve is not 

1349
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:58,671
fundamentally solvable.
That doesn't mean it isn't worth trying 

1350
01:12:58,671 --> 01:13:02,121
to solve.
So although people can despair about it 

1351
01:13:02,121 --> 01:13:02,430
and it's not surprising.
Okay,

1352
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:05,100
so another way that I should've really 
said,

1353
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:08,910
instead of predicted outcome here,
this is like an old model.

1354
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:13,911
This would be a model that I derived 
from work that was done at least 

1355
01:13:13,911 --> 01:13:15,540
initially in the sixties,
aren't even in the forties,

1356
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:21,170
but,
and that still underlies the thinking 

1357
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:24,381
of,
I would say the vast majority of 

1358
01:13:24,381 --> 01:13:24,381
psychologists,
it isn't that you're predicting outcomes

1359
01:13:24,381 --> 01:13:25,620
and and,
and failing.

1360
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:30,620
It's not that it's that you desire 
outcomes and sometimes you get an 

1361
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:33,891
undesirable outcome and it's really 
important to get that distinction 

1362
01:13:33,891 --> 01:13:37,491
correct because if you're thinking about
expectation is just a cold cognitive 

1363
01:13:37,491 --> 01:13:38,220
model,
it's like a rational model.

1364
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:40,890
I know the world,
I understand it's relationships.

1365
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:43,920
I can predict what's going to happen 
next if,

1366
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,690
and that's what I'm trying to do is 
predict it.

1367
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:46,590
It's like,
no you're not,

1368
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:51,650
you're not trying to predict it.
You're trying to get what you want from 

1369
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:55,551
it.
And there's a prediction element to 

1370
01:13:55,551 --> 01:13:55,551
that,
which is,

1371
01:13:55,551 --> 01:13:55,551
well,
you know,

1372
01:13:55,551 --> 01:13:59,330
I'm going to pick that up.
So that's a prediction and their work 

1373
01:13:59,330 --> 01:13:59,370
verifying my prediction,
but,

1374
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:05,270
but what's missing there is I want to 
pick that up and you can't throw that 

1375
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:10,011
out of the equation because as soon as 
you throw motivation out of the 

1376
01:14:10,011 --> 01:14:13,371
equation,
then you're stuck with the mystery of 

1377
01:14:13,371 --> 01:14:13,371
perception,
right?

1378
01:14:13,371 --> 01:14:16,710
How do you organize her perceptions?
Unless you want something when you 

1379
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:19,411
can't,
so you don't get to get rid of the want 

1380
01:14:19,411 --> 01:14:20,710
and just substitute cold expectation.
It's a slight of hand.

1381
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:25,630
And the cognitive behaviors stew that 
they almost always do that.

1382
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,340
That's how they.
Well,

1383
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:33,540
it's not like a conspiracy or anything.
It's perfectly reasonable to have a 

1384
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,090
simplified model for the way that people
act,

1385
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:39,091
but you don't want to throw motivation 
and emotion out of the equation because 

1386
01:14:39,091 --> 01:14:39,670
obviously there's or embodiment there 
are so important.

1387
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:45,660
Okay?
So forget predicted an unpredicted 

1388
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,210
desired an undesired.
Okay?

1389
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:49,450
So I come walking in here and I have 
this low level desire,

1390
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:54,451
which is to make my way to my podium 
with the least amount of effort 

1391
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,750
necessary.
And I see that,

1392
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:59,260
that chairs in the way and it's mildly 
annoying.

1393
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,120
And so there's something undesired 
there.

1394
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:04,430
So the desired outcome produces positive
emotion.

1395
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:07,000
That's promise.
What's technically speaking?

1396
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:12,030
You could also think about it as hope.
It's related to the attainment of a 

1397
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:13,240
goal.
It indicates the potential attainment of

1398
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:14,680
a goal.
That's what hope is,

1399
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:18,460
or what promise is hope is,
I can probably attain this school,

1400
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,540
promise his promises.
If something is promising,

1401
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:27,541
it indicates to you that you can 
probably attain the goal or if someone 

1402
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:31,500
makes a promise to you,
then they're telling you that they're 

1403
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:31,720
going to facilitate movement towards a 
goal,

1404
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:35,920
and so that's the emotional level that 
the dopaminergic system works on.

1405
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:40,921
Again,
it's promise or hope or or technically 

1406
01:15:40,921 --> 01:15:40,960
it's called incentive reward,
that that's the technical term,

1407
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:44,050
but it's the indication that something 
good is going to happen.

1408
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,270
Well.
So when I see a clear pathway,

1409
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:51,520
then I know I can make my goal pretty 
efficiently and so it's going to produce

1410
01:15:51,521 --> 01:15:52,770
just a well.

1411
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:55,630
I was going to produce enough positive 
emotion to make me walk forward.

1412
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:57,130
That's,
that's the right amount.

1413
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:01,990
So and so it's interesting.
So you can actually use this when you're

1414
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:04,390
thinking about room design or house 
designed.

1415
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:06,010
It's like,
so you're in a room,

1416
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:06,610
you think,
well,

1417
01:16:06,611 --> 01:16:08,440
what am I going to use this room for?
It's like,

1418
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,490
okay,
you sort that out.

1419
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,760
Well then you want to make the pathways 
to that use is clear and pristine as 

1420
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:18,780
possible,
unless you want to put in some 

1421
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:18,780
interesting variation just for 
decoration,

1422
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:23,191
but fundamentally what you're trying to 
do is to set up the environment so that 

1423
01:16:23,191 --> 01:16:27,100
it facilitates the actions you intend to
pursue there.

1424
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:30,040
If you go into your room and it's all 
covered with stacks of paper and they're

1425
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,450
all messy,
you know,

1426
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:36,451
and and you know the bed isn't made and 
there's rubbish everywhere by your 

1427
01:16:36,451 --> 01:16:37,270
definition of rubbish.

1428
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:42,660
Then what you're doing basically is 
walking into a room of snakes and it's 

1429
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:46,771
the same system that's responding to all
of those undone things that would 

1430
01:16:46,771 --> 01:16:47,950
respond to snakes.
You know,

1431
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,700
not like a Cobra that's right beside 
you,

1432
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:56,701
but it's the same damn circuitry.
That's the circuitry that responds to 

1433
01:16:56,701 --> 01:17:00,091
chaos.
It's the circuitry that responds to the 

1434
01:17:00,091 --> 01:17:01,540
dragon of chaos that makes you 
uncomfortable.

1435
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:03,530
In a room like that,
it's,

1436
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:08,670
it's not explored territory.
It's not a place where you can easily 

1437
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,580
see the proper relationship between the 
tools and the obstacles.

1438
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:12,860
It's not a place that you can make 
things irrelevant,

1439
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,510
not at all.
In fact,

1440
01:17:14,511 --> 01:17:18,020
it's a place full of obstacles.
How are you going to be comfortable in a

1441
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:23,021
room like that?
It's full of things that get in the way 

1442
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:26,081
of your goals.
You're going to be nervous in there all 

1443
01:17:26,081 --> 01:17:28,571
the time,
so it's like it's full of envelopes that

1444
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,030
you haven't opened and most of them have
bad news in.

1445
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,380
You're not going to be comfortable in a 
room like that.

1446
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:39,010
You think,
why can't you just ignore those 

1447
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:39,010
envelopes?
It's like,

1448
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:39,360
well,
it's a stupid way of looking at it,

1449
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:44,810
so promise produces hope slash pleasure,
curiosity.

1450
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,960
All the incentive reward related 
emotions sort of fit in that box and 

1451
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,451
then undesired outcomes produce threat.
There are threats and they produce 

1452
01:17:53,451 --> 01:17:55,940
anxiety,
but that's not even exactly right.

1453
01:17:56,660 --> 01:18:00,950
That's in an elementary discussion of

1454
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:04,950
the role of competitor systems in the 
brain,

1455
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:09,951
which we'll talk about in more detail.
The general notion is is that the 

1456
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:14,931
violation of an expectation produces 
anxiety and that that's a pretty good 

1457
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:19,371
model and you got some support from the 
psychophysiological pharmacological 

1458
01:18:19,371 --> 01:18:24,351
literature because if you give animals 
antianxiety agents like benzodiazepines 

1459
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:29,031
or alcohol or barbiturates,
they do respond less to the violation of

1460
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
quote expectancy.
It does dampen the response,

1461
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:38,420
but but it's an oversimplified model and
to get understanding of human behavior,

1462
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:41,760
correct,
you have to expand it a bit.

1463
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:43,770
It isn't precisely that

1464
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:48,410
unpredicted outcome is a threat and it 
produces anxiety.

1465
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:54,450
It's that unpredicted outcome makes the 
irrelevant relevant and it produces an 

1466
01:18:54,471 --> 01:18:57,260
undifferentiated emotional and 
motivational state.

1467
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:02,830
It's a better way of thinking about it 
because it isn't just that you don't 

1468
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:02,830
just get anxious.
For example,

1469
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:03,950
if something goes wrong,
you get anxious,

1470
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:05,840
you get angry,
you get curious,

1471
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,210
you get frustrated,
you get depressed,

1472
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:13,211
like it's a whole bursting forward of 
emotions and motivational states and 

1473
01:19:13,211 --> 01:19:16,550
that's because when something doesn't 
work the way it's supposed to,

1474
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:18,560
even when you just encounter an 
obstacle,

1475
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:24,130
it means that you're the way that you're
construing the landscape is wrong in 

1476
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:28,280
some manner and you don't exactly know 
what you're going to have to do in order

1477
01:19:28,281 --> 01:19:33,281
to fix that unless it's a very trivial,
trivial violation and it's one that you 

1478
01:19:33,281 --> 01:19:36,470
know immediately how to readdress.
Like if I'm again,

1479
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:45,090
so I come around the corner and I look 
at that chair and I'm annoyed because 

1480
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,050
it's in the way you might think,
well how annoyed should I get?

1481
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:51,260
And the answer should be something like 
your annoyance should be in proportion 

1482
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:52,980
to the amount of time and energy it will
take to move that chair.

1483
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:58,610
Right?
Because that's kind of like a proper 

1484
01:19:58,610 --> 01:19:58,610
perception.
So it's like I should be that annoyed.

1485
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:03,350
I should be annoyed enough so that I've 
indexed doing that because that does 

1486
01:20:06,331 --> 01:20:11,331
actually take some and energy.
And that actually has a cost and the 

1487
01:20:11,331 --> 01:20:14,181
fact that I have to pay that cost 
shouldn't be signified by something 

1488
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:14,910
because otherwise I wouldn't be 
sensitive to costs.

1489
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:18,900
And so the annoyance,
if it's in proportion to the effort,

1490
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,760
is exactly.
Index property.

1491
01:20:20,761 --> 01:20:25,761
Now often,
unfortunately you don't know how to 

1492
01:20:25,761 --> 01:20:26,430
index.
So you have an old car,

1493
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:31,110
you're driving to work,
someone bumps you from behind,

1494
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,730
and then your car doesn't work.

1495
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,150
It's like,
well,

1496
01:20:33,151 --> 01:20:35,280
how annoyed should you get?
You don't know.

1497
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:41,390
That's a problem.
And so then all of a sudden a bunch of 

1498
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:41,940
things that were irrelevant,
which is the whole damn car poof,

1499
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:47,120
become relevant.
Plus you have to deal with this person 

1500
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:47,120
that just ran into you and what are they
like?

1501
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,840
Well,
they're stupid enough to run into you so

1502
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:54,050
you don't know what else might be wrong 
with them and maybe they're going to be 

1503
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,661
a bunch of trouble and you have to get 
their insurance information and now 

1504
01:20:56,661 --> 01:20:59,271
you're on the side of the road and you 
don't know if you're going to go to 

1505
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,551
work.
And so that's when your emotions can 

1506
01:21:01,551 --> 01:21:04,191
unravel because they're trying to 
compute the effort and time you're going

1507
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,610
to have to take in order to rectify this
and this span,

1508
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:08,140
this,
the,

1509
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:10,070
the,
the what you'd call it,

1510
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:15,100
the domain that is opening up as a 
consequence of the problem isn't easy to

1511
01:21:16,081 --> 01:21:19,440
map and so you get stressed and you go 
home and say,

1512
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,330
I had a stressful day,
and the person says,

1513
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:21,840
what happened?

1514
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,550
While someone hit me on the highway?
And they go,

1515
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:24,510
oh,
that's terrible.

1516
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:25,920
They figured that out.
It's like,

1517
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:27,210
well,
I was in this little map.

1518
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:32,211
It was only this long.
I was just going from here to here and 

1519
01:21:32,211 --> 01:21:35,001
all of a sudden booth.
I didn't know where I was or how many 

1520
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:38,150
places I was going to have to wander 
around in before I could get that map 

1521
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:41,010
working again.
But the car is an invisible predicate of

1522
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:44,370
multiple potential future maps as well,
right?

1523
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:47,940
It's an axiom.
You make the map presuming that you have

1524
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:51,300
the car and the car isn't a metal thing 
with wheels.

1525
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:54,450
The car is a conveyance for moving you 
from point a to point b,

1526
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:59,780
and the fact that you have all these 
maps of moving from point a to b that 

1527
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:03,030
are predicated on that conveyance means 
that when it turns into a car instead of

1528
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:04,680
a conveyance,
poof,

1529
01:22:04,681 --> 01:22:07,470
all those maps become extremely 
complicated as well.

1530
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,370
And so your body goes,
well,

1531
01:22:09,371 --> 01:22:14,371
I'm.
My landscape is way more complex than I 

1532
01:22:14,371 --> 01:22:15,810
thought.
Up goes the heart rate up,

1533
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:17,910
close the cortisol,
all of that,

1534
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:23,150
right,
and you're more paralyzed and you can 

1535
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,920
like if you're a neurotic person,
let's say something like that can just 

1536
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:24,920
paralyze you.
You're done.

1537
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:27,600
You have to phone someone for emergency 
help,

1538
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:31,380
which means you're in a map that you 
cannot put your map back together.

1539
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,260
You have to call on outside,
help in order to do it.

1540
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:37,920
So and you might not even know how to do
that.

1541
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,100
Okay,
so that's another way.

1542
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:42,840
Now here's another way of thinking about
it.

1543
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:48,120
You want to stay inside this little map 
because it's working.

1544
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:50,340
You want to get from point a to point a 
to point b,

1545
01:22:50,341 --> 01:22:55,341
and this is good.
This indicates that you are moving 

1546
01:22:55,341 --> 01:22:58,041
forward,
that's the first thing it indicates and 

1547
01:22:58,041 --> 01:22:58,680
the second thing it indicates,
which is even more important,

1548
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:01,230
and you'll never hear this from 
behavioral psychologists,

1549
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:06,470
is that your map is correct,
so every time you move a little bit and 

1550
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:07,300
something that you want happens,
it says,

1551
01:23:07,301 --> 01:23:09,580
oh,
the game I'm playing is the right gate,

1552
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,500
and so not only does the reward indicate
progress,

1553
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:19,501
it indicates that the frame within which
progress is being calculated is the 

1554
01:23:19,501 --> 01:23:23,191
right frame and that's good because it's
the frame that makes things irrelevant 

1555
01:23:23,191 --> 01:23:27,930
and you want them to stay irrelevant.
So if you don't move forward and you 

1556
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:31,030
start to question the frame that's way 
worse than merely not moving forward.

1557
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,130
You get a bad exam grade,
what do you think?

1558
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,170
What the hell am I doing in university 
anyways?

1559
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:40,550
It's like probably that's not the first 
place you should go with that piece of 

1560
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:40,550
information and you think,
well,

1561
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:41,950
why?
Why is that worse?

1562
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:44,560
Well,
as far as I can tell,

1563
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:50,200
your map of view as a university student
is a comprehensive representation.

1564
01:23:50,201 --> 01:23:51,600
It tells you what you should do 
everyday.

1565
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:55,240
It kind of tells you where you're going 
into the future and if something emerges

1566
01:23:55,241 --> 01:24:00,241
as an the.
Normally you get worse grade than you 

1567
01:24:00,241 --> 01:24:00,400
expected and you blow that whole map.
It's like,

1568
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:05,460
okay,
what have you been doing for the last 

1569
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,141
four years?
What kind of high school student were 

1570
01:24:07,141 --> 01:24:09,361
you?
How clueless are you about how you're 

1571
01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:09,361
arranging your future?
What's your identity going to be?

1572
01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:13,621
If you're not going to be a student,
where are you going to end up in five 

1573
01:24:13,621 --> 01:24:13,621
years?

1574
01:24:13,621 --> 01:24:14,710
So like,
so it's like that little grade,

1575
01:24:14,711 --> 01:24:19,711
that bad grade is like a portal through 
which snakes can crawl and that's 

1576
01:24:19,711 --> 01:24:23,371
exactly how you respond to it.
Especially if you open the door too 

1577
01:24:23,371 --> 01:24:26,371
much.
Well maybe this means that I shouldn't 

1578
01:24:26,371 --> 01:24:26,371
be in university.
Well,

1579
01:24:26,371 --> 01:24:30,840
one of the rules is don't you want to.
You want to constrain the anomalous 

1580
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:34,270
event to the minimal necessary domain.
It's really,

1581
01:24:34,271 --> 01:24:39,271
really important.
You want to do that when you're arguing 

1582
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:39,271
with your partner,
which will do all the time.

1583
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:40,060
We have an argument,
well,

1584
01:24:40,061 --> 01:24:41,980
I should never have married you.
It's like,

1585
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:42,350
no,
no,

1586
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:45,220
that's not the first response.
That's a bad response,

1587
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:50,221
or here's a really good one.
You've always done that sort of thing 

1588
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,660
and you always will.
It's like,

1589
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:53,800
oh good,
great.

1590
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:58,830
It's like the only answer to that is to 
hit someone because like you're done 

1591
01:24:58,830 --> 01:24:58,830
right?

1592
01:24:58,830 --> 01:24:59,380
Your your life,
that you've always been like that.

1593
01:24:59,381 --> 01:25:02,380
There isn't a chance that you can be 
repaired and none of it is acceptable.

1594
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:07,800
It's like the person's gonna fight with 
you right away because what else are 

1595
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,381
they going to do?
So what you want to do is you want to 

1596
01:25:10,381 --> 01:25:10,420
minimize.
It isn't rationalization.

1597
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:11,140
You want to say,
okay,

1598
01:25:11,141 --> 01:25:13,900
this person did something that disrupted
our joint map.

1599
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:19,380
Okay,
what's the smallest possible thing they 

1600
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:19,840
could do to put it back together?
And you have to know,

1601
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:25,590
well,
we need to make a plan so you don't do 

1602
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:28,141
it again.
Or we need to have a discussion so that 

1603
01:25:28,141 --> 01:25:28,141
you know that it wasn't a good thing to 
do,

1604
01:25:28,141 --> 01:25:29,560
but I'm not going to go after your whole
character.

1605
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:35,270
I'm going to say when I come home and 
you're watching TV,

1606
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:39,400
just come to the door and say hello,
not,

1607
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,330
don't you love me?

1608
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,560
Or something like that.
It's like,

1609
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:41,840
no,
no,

1610
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,380
you just have to walk to the door and 
like give me a hug or something,

1611
01:25:44,381 --> 01:25:49,381
and then that's good enough,
and so then the other person might be 

1612
01:25:49,381 --> 01:25:50,560
able to tolerate that much corrective 
information.

1613
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:55,820
Maybe if you're kind of Nice about it 
and you also understand that they're 

1614
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:58,150
probably going to have something equally
horrible to say about you in the next 15

1615
01:25:58,151 --> 01:26:03,151
minutes because you're going to do 
something stupid so so you don't wanna 

1616
01:26:03,151 --> 01:26:07,830
you don't wanna open the door so that 
every possible snake comes crawling 

1617
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:11,561
through because that's a pathway to 
depression and you actually see that 

1618
01:26:11,561 --> 01:26:15,281
happening in depressed people is that 
every small event produces a cascade 

1619
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:18,680
through their entire value system and 
they ended up saying,

1620
01:26:18,681 --> 01:26:20,150
well,
that's just another reason that I should

1621
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:22,610
jump off a bridge,
and they really see it that way.

1622
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,670
It's really awful because they've got no
defenses.

1623
01:26:25,671 --> 01:26:26,360
It's like,
well,

1624
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:31,040
I didn't do so well in this course.
It's like I'm going to get a bad mark in

1625
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:36,041
the or in the exam.
I'm going to get bad mark in the course 

1626
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:36,530
that's going to screw up my ability to 
finish my degree.

1627
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,960
I'm never going to get into the field of
my choice.

1628
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:44,140
It's just another piece of indication 
that I'm useless and that life isn't 

1629
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:44,140
worthwhile.
Bang,

1630
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,130
I'm going to jump off a bridge and if 
you're really depressed,

1631
01:26:46,131 --> 01:26:49,700
it's like each of those things hits you 
with the certainty of truth.

1632
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,940
It's really not good and so you want to 
be careful.

1633
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:57,970
You want to be careful about walking 
down that pathway when you make a 

1634
01:26:57,970 --> 01:26:57,970
mistake,
you think,

1635
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:02,081
okay,
what's the narrowest framework of 

1636
01:27:02,081 --> 01:27:03,650
interpretation within which I can.
I can understand this.

1637
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:08,770
That will require minimal behavioral 
change to decrease the probability that 

1638
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:09,260
it will happen.
Again,

1639
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:13,130
it's mental hygiene fundamentally.
Yes.

1640
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:17,990
Yeah.
We'll get to that.

1641
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,970
We'll get to that.
That is the next question.

1642
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:22,340
It's because they don't exist in 
isolation,

1643
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,280
so and that's another thing.
Frequently when when you,

1644
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:28,640
when you hear behavioral accounts of 
cognitive processes,

1645
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:33,530
they generally only focus on it as if 
it's an isolated thing.

1646
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:34,660
It's not.
It is.

1647
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,650
It's scalable.
It's scalable.

1648
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:41,651
A bunch of ways it scalable temporarily 
because what you do now is associated 

1649
01:27:41,651 --> 01:27:46,091
with what you'll do tomorrow and that 
with what you'll do next week and so 

1650
01:27:46,091 --> 01:27:46,970
forth,
so it has to be scalable temporarily and

1651
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:49,550
it's also scalable socially,
right,

1652
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:53,330
so it has an effect on you that has an 
effect on your family that has an effect

1653
01:27:53,331 --> 01:27:58,100
on the community and so forth and so you
don't want to take.

1654
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:04,180
It's very difficult to think through the
effect of your actions and all those 

1655
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,270
scaling link level simultaneously,
but,

1656
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,920
but you have mechanisms that allow you 
to do that and we'll see.

1657
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,920
I think that the sense of let's assume 
that you're not lying to yourself 

1658
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,941
constantly so your head isn't full of 
chaos and garbage and you have 

1659
01:28:18,941 --> 01:28:19,940
reasonable relationships with people in 
the world.

1660
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:25,630
I think that this is leaping way ahead.
I think that your sense of meaningful 

1661
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:29,360
engagement with what you're doing is the
psychophysiological marker,

1662
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:34,660
that you're acting in a way that takes 
all of the stacked representations into 

1663
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:35,840
account simultaneously because you're.
You're,

1664
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:37,370
you're,
you're like,

1665
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:40,310
you're trying to figure out where you 
are and you might think,

1666
01:28:40,311 --> 01:28:41,990
well,
that means where I am in this room,

1667
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,830
but look,
this room is not a simple thing,

1668
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,290
right?
It's nested.

1669
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,480
It's,
it's a subset of the university that's a

1670
01:28:50,481 --> 01:28:52,850
subset of society.
It's a subset of your life.

1671
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:58,030
The room is a complicated thing and you 
need to figure out where you should be 

1672
01:28:58,030 --> 01:29:01,601
in the room and you can't do that shit 
surely with perception because all you 

1673
01:29:01,601 --> 01:29:03,720
see is me and some of the wall,
right?

1674
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:08,370
It's got this little narrow,
this little narrow portal,

1675
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:12,120
and so you can't really rely on your 
perceptions to Orient you,

1676
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,690
but you do Orient Yourself and I think 
what you do is you.

1677
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:18,000
It's engagement.
It's like,

1678
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:21,030
does this seem meaningful and deep and 
engaging?

1679
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:26,120
Yes.
Then it's an indication that it's 

1680
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,211
serving multiple masters simultaneously,
so both maybe both socially and also 

1681
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:35,061
temporarily,
and so I think the sense of meaning is 

1682
01:29:35,061 --> 01:29:37,380
actually an instinct that orients people
in time and space.

1683
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:42,560
It's not an EPA phenomena.
It's the most fundamental form of 

1684
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,651
perception and that's the only 
optimistic thought that I've ever been 

1685
01:29:45,651 --> 01:29:48,090
able to derive from psychology is that 
that actually could be true.

1686
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:53,091
It could be that the sense of meaning is
an orienting reflex and that would be 

1687
01:29:53,431 --> 01:29:55,830
wonderful if it was true because it 
would make it real,

1688
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,870
you know,
and it's one of the,

1689
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:03,350
you know,
the one of the devastating elements of 

1690
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,350
nihilism is something like,
well,

1691
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:07,791
who the hell cares what you're doing,
what differences are going to make in a 

1692
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:07,791
million years?

1693
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:07,791
It's like your sense of meaning is just 
an illusion.

1694
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:08,910
You know,
you're,

1695
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:12,960
you're limited creature in a limited 
place and nothing you do really matters.

1696
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:17,990
It's like that's a powerful argument,
especially if you're an objective 

1697
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:19,410
materialist in a reductionist.
It's a killer argument,

1698
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:24,830
but it looks to me like it's wrong.
It's actually wrong because meaning 

1699
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:26,190
looks to me like it's an actual 
phenomenon.

1700
01:30:26,191 --> 01:30:30,650
It does say that you're positioned 
properly between chaos and order,

1701
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:33,510
something like that.
It's a real so.

1702
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,390
Well.
So we'll see.

1703
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:40,470
We're gonna develop that argument 
because if,

1704
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:46,220
if it's real,
you want to know that because it gives 

1705
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:46,220
you something to stand on,
you know,

1706
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:48,210
maybe it's as real as pain,
but it's not pain.

1707
01:30:48,211 --> 01:30:51,840
It's something positive and you need 
something positive that you can rely on.

1708
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:57,380
All right,
so we're concentrating now on the 

1709
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:59,550
unpredicted outcome or the undesired 
outcome because we said,

1710
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:00,570
well,
that's like a portal.

1711
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:06,200
It's a portal through which doubt can 
pour and it's the thing that makes the 

1712
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,560
irrelevant relevant to get.
And so that's why I use this little 

1713
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:10,350
diagram.
It's like,

1714
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,720
oh,
that's a,

1715
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:16,910
that's a fear face roughly speaking,
and I put all those stripes on it to 

1716
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:22,431
indicate that it's not just fear,
it's preparation for all sorts of 

1717
01:31:22,431 --> 01:31:26,901
different,
for all sorts of different perceptions 

1718
01:31:26,901 --> 01:31:28,250
and all sorts of different motivational 
states.

1719
01:31:28,251 --> 01:31:32,580
So imagine what happens when something 
knocks you back on your heels.

1720
01:31:32,581 --> 01:31:34,440
It's like not only does your body 
prepare,

1721
01:31:34,441 --> 01:31:37,200
but simultaneously with all of that 
preparation,

1722
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,410
all sorts of fantasies are generated 
like,

1723
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,790
and what they are is all sorts of 
alternative worlds.

1724
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:45,990
Well why did this happen?
You go back into your past and you say,

1725
01:31:45,991 --> 01:31:46,710
well,
here's one route.

1726
01:31:46,711 --> 01:31:47,270
Well,
here's another.

1727
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,420
Here's another,
here's another.

1728
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:51,090
Here's another route,
like I don't know what I did wrong.

1729
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:56,090
I don't know what anybody did wrong,
but there's something back there that 

1730
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:56,820
someone did wrong and he can take people
years to sort that out,

1731
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,100
and so those fantasies are all 
generated.

1732
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:01,240
Then the same thing happens with the 
future.

1733
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:01,900
It's like,
well,

1734
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,970
what does this mean?
Well,

1735
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,000
it could mean this.
It could mean that it could be not 

1736
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:09,000
getting divorced.
It could mean I'm losing my house.

1737
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:09,310
It could mean I'll never talk to my kids
again.

1738
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,440
It could mean that my career is going to
collapse,

1739
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,620
right?
Or maybe I'll get,

1740
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,770
be able to get out of this stupid job 
that I've always hated.

1741
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:17,440
Something better will happen all at the 
same time.

1742
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:20,500
So that's,
that's the response to a normally.

1743
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:26,310
And the reason you respond that way is 
because you're no longer where you 

1744
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:26,310
thought you were.

1745
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:37,460
Okay?
So there's a simple way of looking at 

1746
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:37,460
it.
So what,

1747
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:39,300
what does an unpredicted or anomalous 
event mean?

1748
01:32:39,301 --> 01:32:42,780
And I think this is,
this is maybe the most important thing,

1749
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,960
the most important theme of the entire 
class might be what does an unpredicted 

1750
01:32:48,031 --> 01:32:53,031
or undesired outcome mean?
The only thing that would be equally 

1751
01:32:53,031 --> 01:32:53,850
important is what should you do about 
it?

1752
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:57,240
But we'll start with what it means.
And the answer is,

1753
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:58,530
well,
you don't know what it means.

1754
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:01,650
It could mean anything.
And that's a strange category,

1755
01:33:01,651 --> 01:33:06,651
right?
The category of the normalist events 

1756
01:33:06,651 --> 01:33:08,580
contains indefinite possibility.
So what the hell do you do about that?

1757
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:10,770
While you prepare to do a variety of 
things,

1758
01:33:10,771 --> 01:33:12,270
you can simplify it and say,
well,

1759
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:17,630
it's half threat because something bad 
might happen and it's half promise 

1760
01:33:17,701 --> 01:33:19,980
because something good might happen.
Okay?

1761
01:33:19,981 --> 01:33:21,340
So that's a good way of thinking about 
it.

1762
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:23,310
It's a portal.
All of a sudden,

1763
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:26,250
instead of the thing being irrelevant,
the thing is ambivalent.

1764
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,180
It contains some slice of all possible 
meanings,

1765
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:31,680
positive and negative.
Okay?

1766
01:33:31,681 --> 01:33:35,010
So you're trying to sort that out.
That's partly why it's so stressful to.

1767
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:38,220
And anger is a good response to that 
because anger is partly.

1768
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:42,390
It's partly an advanced emotion because 
it's got a positive emotion element,

1769
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:44,430
which is why anger can be righteous,
you know,

1770
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:48,270
but it's got a negative element to it's 
negative emotion and positive emotion at

1771
01:33:48,271 --> 01:33:49,890
the same thing,
same time.

1772
01:33:49,891 --> 01:33:52,350
So it's like the canonical stress,
emotion.

1773
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:54,840
So,
but it's very hard on people.

1774
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,960
Anger.
It's very cycle physiologically 

1775
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,301
demanding.
So I started with that model and then I 

1776
01:34:02,301 --> 01:34:03,240
developed it into this model which I 
liked better.

1777
01:34:03,241 --> 01:34:08,241
So you're moving from,
you haven't seen this because it's not 

1778
01:34:08,241 --> 01:34:11,301
in the book.
Moving from point a to point B and 

1779
01:34:11,301 --> 01:34:12,330
you're using your actions that you're 
known actions to get there.

1780
01:34:12,330 --> 01:34:13,730
Okay.
And what happens you,

1781
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,860
you run into an anomaly and it's like a 
hole.

1782
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:22,010
It's a hole through the map.
It's like a whole is burned in it or 

1783
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:22,350
something like that.
And the maps no longer relevant.

1784
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:27,620
And so what happens while you're 
positive emotion systems are activated 

1785
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,490
or disinhibited.
That's a better way of thinking about 

1786
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:33,801
it.
And your negative emotion systems are 

1787
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:33,801
disinhibited.
And what might those be?

1788
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:38,720
Well,
in positive emotion you have hope and 

1789
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,210
interest in exhilaration and curiosity 
and confidence.

1790
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,600
And in the negative emotional space,
you have anxiety and fear and hurt and 

1791
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,290
anger and guilt and shame and 
disappointment in disgust,

1792
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:51,291
like there's quite a stacking of 
emotions and you don't know which of 

1793
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:54,291
those is going to be useful and relevant
and so it all emerges at the same time.

1794
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:57,000
Now,
one,

1795
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:01,940
the questions that was being bagged,
let's say by this discussion,

1796
01:35:01,941 --> 01:35:06,941
was the idea of the relationship between
these frames of reference to one 

1797
01:35:06,941 --> 01:35:11,741
another.
I'm going to describe that relationship 

1798
01:35:11,741 --> 01:35:16,360
because one of the things that I want to
describe to you is how you determine how

1799
01:35:16,881 --> 01:35:18,690
upset you should be when something 
normal.

1800
01:35:18,691 --> 01:35:21,770
This happens because it's really hard to
figure out.

1801
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,420
Right?
So because,

1802
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:28,660
well you see this often,
especially if you're unsophisticated in 

1803
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:29,480
dispute settlement with an intimate 
partner,

1804
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:34,990
every little bump and the relationship 
is the potential disillusion of the 

1805
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:36,200
entire relationship.
That's actually why people get married,

1806
01:35:36,201 --> 01:35:37,430
you know,
just so you know,

1807
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:44,980
because this is built into marital vows,
I'm not leaving ever no matter what.

1808
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,200
It's like,
okay,

1809
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,720
well that definitely puts a boundary 
around our arguments,

1810
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:55,780
right?
Because I can't say every time you 

1811
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:58,121
manifest one of your flaws,
which you're likely to do just as often 

1812
01:35:58,121 --> 01:35:58,670
as me.
Well enough of this,

1813
01:35:58,940 --> 01:35:59,930
it's like,
that's horrible,

1814
01:35:59,931 --> 01:36:04,931
man.
If your whole life is while every time 

1815
01:36:04,931 --> 01:36:04,931
you get out of line,
I'm out of here.

1816
01:36:04,931 --> 01:36:05,390
It's like,
how the hell are you?

1817
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:10,450
First of all,
you're not going to admit to ever doing 

1818
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:10,450
anything wrong.
Second,

1819
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:12,340
you're going to be on your.
You're like,

1820
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:13,670
ah,
like a scared cat.

1821
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:16,160
The entire relationship because well,
who knows?

1822
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:17,930
It could just come to an end at any 
moment.

1823
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:19,180
It's like,
you know,

1824
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:20,240
people say,
well,

1825
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:23,150
if you're.
If the possibility of divorce is open,

1826
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,650
it makes you free.
It's like,

1827
01:36:24,651 --> 01:36:25,510
yeah,
that's what you want.

1828
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:27,140
You want to be free.
A really,

1829
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:30,440
really,
so you can't predict anything.

1830
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:34,130
That's what you're after.
It's a vow and it says,

1831
01:36:34,131 --> 01:36:39,131
look,
I know that your trouble me too,

1832
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:43,970
so we won't leave.
No matter what happens.

1833
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,530
Well,
that's a hell of a vowel,

1834
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:50,531
but that's why it's about right.
That's why you take it in front of a 

1835
01:36:50,531 --> 01:36:52,961
bunch of people.
That's why it's supposed to be a sacred 

1836
01:36:52,961 --> 01:36:52,961
act.
It's like,

1837
01:36:52,961 --> 01:36:53,780
what's the alternative?
What's the alternative?

1838
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,080
Everything is mutable and changeable at 
any moment.

1839
01:36:57,710 --> 01:36:58,340
Well,
go ahead.

1840
01:36:58,341 --> 01:36:59,060
You liver,
your liver,

1841
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:01,940
your life like that and see what you're 
like when you're 50 Jesus.

1842
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:03,920
It's dismal.
Two or three divorces.

1843
01:37:03,921 --> 01:37:07,010
Your family's fragmented.
You've got no continuity of narrative.

1844
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,260
It's not.
It's not good for the kids,

1845
01:37:09,261 --> 01:37:14,261
not by any stretch of the imagination 
and so it's a form of voluntary 

1846
01:37:14,901 --> 01:37:18,530
enslavement I suppose,
but it's also equivalent to the adoption

1847
01:37:18,531 --> 01:37:20,720
of a responsibility and there's more to 
it than that.

1848
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:23,750
If you can't run away,
then you can solve your problems because

1849
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:24,500
it might be,
okay,

1850
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:28,460
well I'm stuck with you,
so how about we fix things

1851
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,000
because the alternative is we're going 
to be in a boxing match for the next 40 

1852
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,160
years.
That's the alternative.

1853
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:40,610
So and you think you're going to fix 
problems without something like that 

1854
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:41,490
hanging over your head.
There isn't a chance.

1855
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:43,530
You'll just avoid them because that's 
what people do.

1856
01:37:43,531 --> 01:37:45,420
It's really hard to.
To solve problems,

1857
01:37:45,421 --> 01:37:48,270
especially in relationship.
We're having a fight and I find out that

1858
01:37:48,271 --> 01:37:53,271
it's because you're.
You were abused by your uncle when you 

1859
01:37:53,271 --> 01:37:53,310
were five or some God damn thing.
You know,

1860
01:37:53,311 --> 01:37:58,311
it's like it.
It's very to third sort of thing 

1861
01:37:58,311 --> 01:37:58,311
happens.
You,

1862
01:37:58,311 --> 01:38:01,980
there's the partner,
your partner's manifesting some weird 

1863
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:05,541
anomalous behavior.
You just can't make heads or tails of 

1864
01:38:05,541 --> 01:38:05,541
it.
That doesn't seem related to what you're

1865
01:38:05,541 --> 01:38:07,170
doing at all.
They don't want to talk about it.

1866
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:09,630
And so as soon as you bring it up,
they get mad.

1867
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:10,800
Then you bring it up again.

1868
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,920
They even get mad or and they tell you 
that you're not going to talk about that

1869
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:16,350
or they're going to leave and so maybe 
you really,

1870
01:38:16,351 --> 01:38:21,351
really persistent because you're kind of
a son of a bitch and then they break 

1871
01:38:21,351 --> 01:38:21,600
down and cry,
you know,

1872
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:26,660
and then they have this horrible memory 
that comes flooding forward that's 

1873
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:30,411
completely.
You don't know what to do with it and 

1874
01:38:30,411 --> 01:38:30,411
then you have to sort it out.
It's like,

1875
01:38:30,411 --> 01:38:31,560
you think you're going to do that unless
there's a good reason.

1876
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:37,310
You have to know we better start this 
out or we're going to be carrying it 

1877
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:38,550
around for the next 40 years.
That may be is enough motivation,

1878
01:38:38,551 --> 01:38:40,860
so you'll actually try hard to solve a 
problem.

1879
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:43,920
It's a lot easier to say,
well sorry,

1880
01:38:43,921 --> 01:38:45,820
we're not going there,
but then good.

1881
01:38:45,821 --> 01:38:47,640
And you'll have it every day.
Every day,

1882
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:49,650
every God damn day for the rest of your 
life.

1883
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,300
Anyways,
back to this.

1884
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:59,840
Alright,
so what's the relationship between your 

1885
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:00,450
frames of reference?
Well,

1886
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:01,500
we can.
We can.

1887
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:03,870
Well we,
let's do it this way.

1888
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,950
Let's see if I can think of a good.
Have a good example.

1889
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:13,790
Why did you get up this morning?
Okay.

1890
01:39:13,791 --> 01:39:18,791
Why?
Why did you want to come to class this 

1891
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:22,650
class?
Okay,

1892
01:39:22,651 --> 01:39:24,360
so why do you want to come?
This is a serious question.

1893
01:39:24,361 --> 01:39:25,410
Why did you want to come to class?

1894
01:39:28,530 --> 01:39:30,200
To get the knowledge that it's going to 
be.

1895
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:33,730
That is something I'm going to be tested
on.

1896
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:34,820
Okay.
Okay.

1897
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:39,940
Is there,
is there any reason other than the 

1898
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:43,001
testing that you came to class?
It's okay.

1899
01:39:44,491 --> 01:39:46,050
You can start.
This is not a trap.

1900
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:48,750
You can say whatever you want.
I'm just sitting there just they're just

1901
01:39:48,751 --> 01:39:53,751
straight questions.
Okay.

1902
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:01,310
So let's say no for the time being or 
not for reasons that you can immediately

1903
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,380
bring to mind.
Okay.

1904
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:05,000
Why does the test matter?

1905
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:07,270
For the degree?

1906
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,480
Okay.
Why does,

1907
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,280
why do you care about the degree?
To get a job.

1908
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:14,280
Okay.
Whose decision was it that you took?

1909
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:17,460
The degree that you're taking your.
Okay.

1910
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,230
Did your parents have any influence on 
that?

1911
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:20,890
No.
No?

1912
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:22,050
Okay.
Okay.

1913
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:24,270
What job are you after?
Psychology,

1914
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:27,390
psychology.
Clinical clinical psychologist.

1915
01:40:27,391 --> 01:40:30,670
Why do you want to do that again?
You don't.

1916
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:33,240
I'm gonna question you.
Until you run out of answers,

1917
01:40:33,241 --> 01:40:35,370
you will run out of answers.
So if this is the time,

1918
01:40:35,371 --> 01:40:36,420
that's fine.
Why do you want to.

1919
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:39,630
Do you want to do clinical psychology to
help people?

1920
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:40,950
To help people.
Okay.

1921
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:46,040
Okay.
Why is that more important to you than 

1922
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:46,040
making money?

1923
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:51,050
Because it helps me in interact.
How it sort of makes me happy to see 

1924
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,070
other people get over

1925
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,310
their pro.
Okay.

1926
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,110
Okay.
All right,

1927
01:40:56,111 --> 01:40:56,710
good,
good.

1928
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:59,830
Well that's pretty good.
You had lots of answers so sometimes you

1929
01:40:59,831 --> 01:41:02,140
can run people out of answers with about
three questions.

1930
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:03,350
So.
Alright.

1931
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:08,370
So small action perception,
nested in larger action perception,

1932
01:41:10,001 --> 01:41:13,650
nested in larger action perception all 
the way out to well,

1933
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:15,370
until you run out of answers 
fundamentally,

1934
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,240
right?
So,

1935
01:41:16,241 --> 01:41:19,390
and that's where it's at the edge where 
you run out of answers,

1936
01:41:19,391 --> 01:41:23,680
that's where metaphysics takes over 
because there's not an irrational domain

1937
01:41:23,681 --> 01:41:28,681
anymore.
You're in a metaphysical domain at that 

1938
01:41:28,681 --> 01:41:30,661
point and so you have implicit 
assumptions that you don't even know 

1939
01:41:30,661 --> 01:41:31,420
about that are working on,
on the fringes.

1940
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:33,250
And we'll talk about that a little bit.
Okay?

1941
01:41:33,251 --> 01:41:37,600
So,
so then we can take a category like,

1942
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:39,450
hmm,

1943
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:45,250
we'll do a micro analysis the same way.
So you're at home and you're tickling 

1944
01:41:45,501 --> 01:41:46,940
the baby.
All right?

1945
01:41:46,941 --> 01:41:49,010
So we'll note first.
That's not an abstraction,

1946
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:51,320
right?
There's an actual baby and you're moving

1947
01:41:51,321 --> 01:41:56,321
your fingers.
And so that's not just an abstract 

1948
01:41:56,321 --> 01:41:58,820
conceptualization.
It's also where your consciousness ends.

1949
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:01,610
You're tickling the baby,
but you don't know how you're doing it.

1950
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:06,640
You don't know the musculature,
you don't know how to manipulate the 

1951
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,190
little organs and everything.
You can just do it.

1952
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:12,310
So Bang,
you're out of the perceptual domain at 

1953
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:12,860
that point.
It grounds out in voluntary action.

1954
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:14,810
Alright,
so you're tickling the baby.

1955
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:20,500
What are you doing when you're tickling 
the baby while you're making the baby 

1956
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:20,500
laugh?
Okay,

1957
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:20,750
that's one way you're playing with the 
baby.

1958
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:21,590
Okay,
so fine.

1959
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:26,870
That's a subset of the activity.
Play with baby and you can play peekaboo

1960
01:42:26,871 --> 01:42:27,530
with the baby.

1961
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:32,530
You can tickle the baby,
you can clean the baby and all of that 

1962
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:32,750
can be part of playing and you might 
say,

1963
01:42:32,751 --> 01:42:37,751
well,
what are you doing when you're playing 

1964
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:37,751
with a baby?
And you'd say,

1965
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:38,000
well,
I'm taking care of my family and fine,

1966
01:42:38,001 --> 01:42:39,710
and then you think,
well what?

1967
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:41,750
What are you doing when you're taking 
care of your family?

1968
01:42:41,751 --> 01:42:42,410
And you might say,
well,

1969
01:42:42,411 --> 01:42:44,900
I'm being a good parent,
and then you might say,

1970
01:42:44,901 --> 01:42:46,820
well what am I doing when I'm being a 
good parent?

1971
01:42:46,821 --> 01:42:47,390
You might say,
well,

1972
01:42:47,391 --> 01:42:50,030
I'm being a good person.
And then you could say,

1973
01:42:50,031 --> 01:42:52,940
well why should you be a good person?
But we won't go any farther than that.

1974
01:42:52,941 --> 01:42:54,740
It's of because you can see that that's 
sort of the.

1975
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:57,680
In some sense,
that's an ultimate level of abstraction.

1976
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:00,200
Okay,
so you could.

1977
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:03,080
What do you do if someone comes up to 
you and you're tickling the baby and you

1978
01:43:03,081 --> 01:43:03,410
say,
well,

1979
01:43:03,411 --> 01:43:05,160
I'm being a good person.
They ask,

1980
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:06,710
what are you doing?
I'm being a good person.

1981
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:11,890
It's like it's a bit disjointed.
It doesn't what the person would expect 

1982
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:14,180
as an answer.
They expect something more local,

1983
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:19,420
but it's still true.
And so what's interesting is that when 

1984
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:20,990
you're doing something that's

1985
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:24,080
what.

1986
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:25,740
Well,
I would say worthwhile.

1987
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:28,140
That's probably the right way of 
thinking about it.

1988
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:33,380
You're doing a whole bunch of things 
simultaneously and you're not really 

1989
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:34,770
aware of all those things,
but you are in some sense,

1990
01:43:34,771 --> 01:43:35,920
you know,
because if the person,

1991
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:41,300
someone might come along and say,
well what kind of idiot tickles a baby 

1992
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:41,300
like that?
It's like,

1993
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,870
well,
what have they said?

1994
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:46,590
Well they've kind of nailed you here 
down on the micro tickle level,

1995
01:43:46,770 --> 01:43:48,000
but there are sort of also

1996
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:53,000
taking a pretty good crack at this high 
level system as well now.

1997
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:54,710
And that's a problem.
So let's say,

1998
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:57,740
well good parent is a subset of being a 
good person,

1999
01:43:57,741 --> 01:44:01,730
but there's all sorts of other baby.
You have to be a good partner.

2000
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:06,290
Maybe you have to be a good daughter.
Maybe you have to be a good nice,

2001
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,780
you know your,
your,

2002
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:14,560
your ability to function as a good 
person is composed of a very large 

2003
01:44:14,631 --> 01:44:17,150
number of hierarchically nested 
subsystems.

2004
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:20,750
And so when the person goes,
only an idiot would tickle the baby like

2005
01:44:20,751 --> 01:44:22,850
that.
And they go after that.

2006
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,690
You might think,
well,

2007
01:44:23,691 --> 01:44:26,940
how upset you should,
should you get an answer is well,

2008
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:28,910
how valid do you think their complaint 
is?

2009
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:32,360
So let's say maybe it only an idiot 
wouldn't take all the baby like that and

2010
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:35,450
you happened to be that idiot and so,
well maybe you're not a good person.

2011
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:40,450
And so what does that mean?
It means that the map that consists of 

2012
01:44:40,450 --> 01:44:42,620
all these nested subsistence has now 
become unreliable.

2013
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:45,740
And so how upset are you going to get 
about that?

2014
01:44:45,741 --> 01:44:46,280
Well,
you know,

2015
01:44:46,281 --> 01:44:51,281
maybe you had a bad day at work and 
you're kind of hypoglycemic and you had 

2016
01:44:51,281 --> 01:44:51,281
too much to drink the night before.
And so someone says,

2017
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:53,150
you know,
that's not how you take a baby.

2018
01:44:53,151 --> 01:44:55,520
You idiot and you cry.
Well,

2019
01:44:55,521 --> 01:44:57,080
why?
Well,

2020
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:01,730
it's a pretty high level blow and so 
it's the sort of thing you want to do if

2021
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:03,230
you want to do,
if you want to hurt someone,

2022
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:08,260
it's not a good way to teach someone 
because you teach them down at the 

2023
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:08,660
smallest possible level.
The micro,

2024
01:45:08,661 --> 01:45:08,990
no,
no,

2025
01:45:08,991 --> 01:45:13,991
you don't take all the baby like that.
You tickle a baby like this and you're 

2026
01:45:13,991 --> 01:45:16,460
doing a good job on everything else,
but if you're going to tickle the baby,

2027
01:45:16,461 --> 01:45:18,170
this is how you go about it and the 
person thinks,

2028
01:45:18,171 --> 01:45:18,710
well,
you know,

2029
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:22,040
I'm doing a fairly good job,
but it's got this little thing I have to

2030
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:27,020
work on and maybe I can manage it,
and so that works and that works and you

2031
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:29,840
can have some sympathy for the person at
the same time because you might say,

2032
01:45:29,841 --> 01:45:31,060
well,
I used to take a baby.

2033
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:32,830
He's like an idiot too,
but you know it's,

2034
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,150
it's fixable and most of use.
Okay?

2035
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,870
And that's a nice thing to do when 
you're arguing with someone.

2036
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:38,510
You say,
look,

2037
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:46,820
here's a bunch of things you're doing 
right that are related to this that are 

2038
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:49,761
important.
Here's this small thing that maybe you 

2039
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:50,490
could alter slightly and it would make 
me happy and maybe I'll return the favor

2040
01:45:50,491 --> 01:45:54,410
at some point and they think,
oh well maybe,

2041
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:59,810
maybe I'll do that maybe,
and then they practice doing it and you 

2042
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:00,570
can give them a pat on the head and then
you're both happy about that.

2043
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:03,930
That really works with people.
It really works.

2044
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:09,230
So okay,
so what you see is that these high level

2045
01:46:10,861 --> 01:46:13,620
abstractions,
let's call them ethical abstractions,

2046
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:19,430
are related to actions.
They're related and so you can see that 

2047
01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:23,931
relationship from the good person to 
doing something like tickle the baby 

2048
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:25,890
properly and then you can.
You can conceptualize it this way,

2049
01:46:25,891 --> 01:46:30,060
that you have this massive overarching 
map which is something like the story of

2050
01:46:30,061 --> 01:46:32,880
your life,
including its extension,

2051
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:38,000
the future,
and then it consists of these 

2052
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,310
subordinate maps which can be broken 
down all the way down to the level of 

2053
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:43,971
actions and so then that explains to you
to some degree how you can do the 

2054
01:46:43,971 --> 01:46:46,920
impossible job of calibrating your 
emotional response.

2055
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:52,700
Because roughly speaking,
emotional response should be 

2056
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:54,510
proportionate to the level that's being 
assaulted by the anomaly,

2057
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:56,610
right?
If it's way up here,

2058
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:59,850
you wrote your amcap because you want to
go to medical school,

2059
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:01,800
right?
And so now the envelope comes and you're

2060
01:47:01,801 --> 01:47:05,430
shaking away and the open ended,
it's like you got 25th percentile,

2061
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:08,040
just like a quarter of the people who 
take the test.

2062
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:09,300
Well,
what?

2063
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:11,160
What does that mean?
Well,

2064
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:14,460
this is all blown to hell,
that's for sure.

2065
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,670
And so God only knows how many of these 
things are going to go to.

2066
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:19,980
Maybe your study habits really need to 
be.

2067
01:47:20,690 --> 01:47:25,690
You know,
you have to reconstitute yourself all 

2068
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:25,690
the way down to the level of your 
habits.

2069
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:26,970
It's,
it can be devastating news.

2070
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:32,150
Now,
one of the ways to protect yourself 

2071
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:32,160
against something like that,
it's like don't have one plan,

2072
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:38,120
right?
If you're going to stake yourself on 

2073
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:38,120
something,
you should throw a couple of alternative

2074
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:40,020
scaffolds up beside you so that you have
somewhere to go.

2075
01:47:40,230 --> 01:47:41,940
You want to be a doctor?
Okay,

2076
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:44,880
well you could be a nurse.
It's like it's not a doctor,

2077
01:47:44,881 --> 01:47:49,881
but it needs cutting your throat.
You're still doing 80 percent of what 

2078
01:47:49,881 --> 01:47:54,171
you wanted to do,
so you want to and you want to think 

2079
01:47:54,171 --> 01:47:54,171
about this during your whole life,
man,

2080
01:47:54,171 --> 01:47:58,311
if you're going to take a high risk,
you want to scaffold yourself in other 

2081
01:47:58,311 --> 01:48:00,150
areas so that if it fails,
you don't bother them,

2082
01:48:00,151 --> 01:48:04,500
doesn't drop out and you die and it's 
also very much worth thinking about with

2083
01:48:04,501 --> 01:48:06,510
regards to setting up your life in 
general.

2084
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:11,900
It's like if you concentrate solely on 
your career,

2085
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:17,870
you can get along way in your career and
I would say that that's a strategy that 

2086
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:21,360
a minority of men preferentially do that
that's all they do.

2087
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:23,100
They worked like 70,
80 hours a week.

2088
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,440
They'd go flat out on their career.

2089
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:30,680
They're staking everything on the small 
probability of exceptional status in a 

2090
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,190
narrow domain,
but it's.

2091
01:48:32,191 --> 01:48:34,110
It's hard on them.
They don't have a life.

2092
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:36,090
It's very difficult for them to have a 
family.

2093
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:41,180
They don't know how to take any leisure 
activity like they get very one 

2094
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:41,180
dimension.
Now,

2095
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:45,140
it may be that that unit dimensionality 
is the price you have to pay to be 

2096
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:46,050
exceptional at one thing,
right?

2097
01:48:46,051 --> 01:48:51,051
Because if you're going to be something 
like a genius level mathematician and 

2098
01:48:51,051 --> 01:48:51,960
you want to do that for,
or scientists say,

2099
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:55,200
it's like you're in your lab,
you're in your lab all the time.

2100
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:57,600
You're working 70 hours a week or 80 
hours a week,

2101
01:48:57,630 --> 01:48:59,430
you're smart,
you're dedicated,

2102
01:48:59,431 --> 01:49:04,431
you're unidimensional,
and that's how you get to beat all the 

2103
01:49:04,431 --> 01:49:05,370
other people who are doing that.
It's the only way,

2104
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:07,410
but the problem is you don't get a life.

2105
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:12,800
Now,
if you love being a scientist and you 

2106
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,160
have that kind of focus of mind,
well first of all,

2107
01:49:14,161 --> 01:49:16,590
you're a rare person and second you're 
going to pay for it,

2108
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:18,600
but fine.
More power to you.

2109
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:21,540
But,
but it's,

2110
01:49:21,541 --> 01:49:24,570
uh,
it's a risky business to do that.

2111
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:26,880
You sacrifice a lot for it,
you know,

2112
01:49:26,881 --> 01:49:31,881
and I would say most often if you're 
speaking about having a healthy life,

2113
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:34,860
that isn't what you do.
You spread yourself out more.

2114
01:49:34,861 --> 01:49:36,390
So you know,
you have a family,

2115
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:41,780
you have some things that you do outside
of work that are meaningful to you and 

2116
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:42,900
useful you,
you have a network of friends,

2117
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:44,540
um,
that,

2118
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:45,660
that,
those three things,

2119
01:49:45,661 --> 01:49:47,680
a loaner for things,
a loner,

2120
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,980
plenty to keep you well oriented.
And then if one of those things 

2121
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:52,980
collapses,
you know,

2122
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:57,130
everything doesn't go now.
The price you pay for that is,

2123
01:49:57,430 --> 01:50:00,070
the more you strive to optimize that 
balance,

2124
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:05,310
the less likely you are to be 
fantastically successful at any single 

2125
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:05,310
one of them.

2126
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:06,310
But you might have a very,
you know,

2127
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:08,770
if you can consider your life as a 
whole,

2128
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:13,150
that might be a winning strategy.
One of the things Carl Young said,

2129
01:50:13,151 --> 01:50:18,151
I really liked this.
He thought that men went after 

2130
01:50:18,151 --> 01:50:20,800
perfection and when women went after 
wholeness,

2131
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:24,600
so there are different.
They're different value there,

2132
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:29,670
there are different,
there's something different at the top 

2133
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:31,921
of the value hierarchy.
So perfection would be steak it all on 

2134
01:50:31,921 --> 01:50:33,680
one thing and look for radical success.
Not all,

2135
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:35,380
not that all men do that because they 
don't.

2136
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:39,940
But what we're talking about extremes,
at least with regards to the men that do

2137
01:50:39,941 --> 01:50:42,160
that,
the wholeness ideas more like,

2138
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:42,890
well,
I want,

2139
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:46,120
I want.
It's like I want one thing in my life to

2140
01:50:46,121 --> 01:50:51,121
be 150 percent or I want five things in 
my life to be 80 percent.

2141
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:58,330
Well there,
there's a lot more richness in a life 

2142
01:50:58,330 --> 01:50:59,120
where you have five things operating at 
80 percent,

2143
01:50:59,121 --> 01:51:02,510
but you're not operating in any at any 
of them at 150 percent.

2144
01:51:03,050 --> 01:51:08,050
So,
and I really believe this because I've 

2145
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:10,241
watched men and women go through their 
careers now for a long period of time 

2146
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:13,571
and one of the things that,
there's lots of things that produced 

2147
01:51:13,571 --> 01:51:17,531
this,
but one of the things that I've noticed 

2148
01:51:17,531 --> 01:51:20,531
is that mostly women in their thirties 
bear bail out of unit dimensional 

2149
01:51:20,531 --> 01:51:21,260
careers.
They won't do them.

2150
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:26,920
They won't.
They won't put in the 80 hours a week 

2151
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:29,030
that they would have to put in in order 
to dominate that particular area.

2152
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:34,180
And it isn't.
The reason that they won't do it is 

2153
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:36,431
because they decide it's not worth it.
And no wonder because why would that be 

2154
01:51:36,431 --> 01:51:38,570
worth it?
You have to ask yourself that.

2155
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:39,710
It's like,
well,

2156
01:51:39,711 --> 01:51:41,330
you want to be an outstanding 
scientists.

2157
01:51:41,331 --> 01:51:42,020
Like,
okay,

2158
01:51:42,290 --> 01:51:45,350
really,
really that's what you want because that

2159
01:51:45,351 --> 01:51:46,790
means that's what you do

2160
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,680
[inaudible],
you're competing with other people,

2161
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:50,760
you know,
they're smart,

2162
01:51:50,761 --> 01:51:53,070
they're hardworking,
and if you want to be at the top,

2163
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:55,620
you have to be smarter and work harder 
than any of them.

2164
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,140
And working hard means working long 
hours.

2165
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:02,610
I mean it also means working diligently,
but in the final analysis,

2166
01:52:02,611 --> 01:52:07,611
it's also an additive issue.
If I'm smart and hardworking and I can 

2167
01:52:07,611 --> 01:52:10,050
crank out for 70 hours a week and you do
it for 30,

2168
01:52:10,370 --> 01:52:12,540
it's like in two years,
I'm so far ahead of you.

2169
01:52:12,541 --> 01:52:17,250
You will never ever catch up.
So anyways.

2170
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:22,540
And I think partly maybe part of the 
reason too that women are oriented that 

2171
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:22,570
way more than men.
I think there's two reasons.

2172
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:26,590
One is socioeconomic status does not 
make women more attractive on the mating

2173
01:52:26,610 --> 01:52:28,590
market,
but it does make men more attractive.

2174
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:31,290
And the second is women's timeframe is 
compressed,

2175
01:52:32,130 --> 01:52:33,300
right?
Because guys can always say,

2176
01:52:33,301 --> 01:52:38,301
well,
I'll have kids later and they can say 

2177
01:52:38,301 --> 01:52:38,301
that until they're like 80.

2178
01:52:38,301 --> 01:52:38,301
Whereas women,
it's like,

2179
01:52:38,301 --> 01:52:38,940
no way man.
You gotta get it.

2180
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:40,560
You gotta get it together by the time 
you're,

2181
01:52:40,650 --> 01:52:43,140
let's say 40,
but really probably by 35,

2182
01:52:43,141 --> 01:52:46,190
but definitely by 40 because it ain't 
happening.

2183
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:51,430
And that's bloody dreadful.
Like the most unhappy people you ever 

2184
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:52,190
see.
No,

2185
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:58,840
no.
One of the common roots to extreme 

2186
01:52:58,840 --> 01:52:59,300
unhappiness is to want children and not 
have the.

2187
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:01,460
I wouldn't recommend that.
You know,

2188
01:53:01,461 --> 01:53:03,020
you see couples who were in their 
thirties,

2189
01:53:03,021 --> 01:53:07,370
one couple in three over the age of 30 
has fertility problems that's defined as

2190
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:11,330
an inability to conceive after one year 
of trying one in three.

2191
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:14,270
So it's worth thinking about because 
people are very,

2192
01:53:14,271 --> 01:53:16,850
very unhappy if they want to have kids 
and then they can't,

2193
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:19,040
man,
you're in the medical mill for 10 years,

2194
01:53:19,041 --> 01:53:20,810
if that's,
if that's what happens to you.

2195
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:22,160
So.
Okay.

2196
01:53:22,161 --> 01:53:23,450
So anyways,
back to this.

2197
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:30,250
I think what I'll do,
what time it is,

2198
01:53:30,251 --> 01:53:33,720
it is it because I'd have to open up 
whole new can of worms,

2199
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:35,850
so to speak,
to do the next part.

2200
01:53:35,851 --> 01:53:40,851
So I think actually what I'm going to do
is just recap what we did and then stop 

2201
01:53:40,851 --> 01:53:42,990
or maybe we can have some questions or 
maybe we can call it an early day.

2202
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:44,610
Okay,
so what,

2203
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:49,050
what is the fundamental issue here?
What did we discuss today?

2204
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:54,440
All right,
so you're in a frame and we've laid out 

2205
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:55,150
its characteristics.
It has a goal in it,

2206
01:53:55,151 --> 01:53:58,620
it has a current position,
it has rules for operating within it.

2207
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:04,390
It governs your perceptions,
which is really critical thing to 

2208
01:54:04,390 --> 01:54:05,730
understand and we're all governing your 
perceptions.

2209
01:54:05,731 --> 01:54:10,731
It's,
it tells you what's useful to you and 

2210
01:54:10,731 --> 01:54:10,731
what gets in your way,
but most importantly,

2211
01:54:10,731 --> 01:54:11,220
it tells you what.
You don't have to pay attention to it.

2212
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:13,290
So as long as your damn frame is 
functional,

2213
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:18,470
you can ignore most of the world and 
that means your stress level is way 

2214
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:19,110
lower than it would normally be.
Okay?

2215
01:54:19,410 --> 01:54:21,360
So perception,
motivation,

2216
01:54:21,361 --> 01:54:23,250
all of that's integrated into those 
frames.

2217
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:28,550
And then the emotional element comes out
in that with you when you're within a 

2218
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:32,031
frame,
things that move you forward and 

2219
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:34,761
validate the framer positive and things 
that get in your way and invalidate the 

2220
01:54:34,761 --> 01:54:35,850
frame are negative,
and then the next issue is,

2221
01:54:35,851 --> 01:54:39,030
well,
if your frame is invalidated,

2222
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:44,120
exactly what does that mean?
And you can't answer that without 

2223
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:44,580
thinking about the hierarchy of frames 
because if you're lucky,

2224
01:54:44,581 --> 01:54:49,581
it just means your frame needs a minor 
alteration that would be equivalent to 

2225
01:54:49,581 --> 01:54:52,080
piaget in assimilation in some sense.
Right?

2226
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:54,630
You can stay in the frame.
You just make a small adjustment.

2227
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:00,920
I think the Piaget Eddie and distinction
between assimilation and accommodation 

2228
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:03,750
is technically inaccurate because it's a
continuum,

2229
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:04,740
right?

2230
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:07,860
I mean if I.
If I want to grab your pen,

2231
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:11,430
I have a little frame that will enable 
me to do that.

2232
01:55:11,431 --> 01:55:11,880
You say,
well,

2233
01:55:11,881 --> 01:55:14,010
I'm staying within the frame to move 
that out of the way,

2234
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:17,820
but actually I'm not.
What I'm doing is doing a very.

2235
01:55:18,210 --> 01:55:21,000
I'm doing a small micro revolution in 
the frame.

2236
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:24,600
Moving that to pick that up.
And so it's.

2237
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:29,900
I think accommodation.
There's no hard distinction between 

2238
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,620
assimilation and accommodation,
it's a continuum.

2239
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:32,880
So you'd say,
well,

2240
01:55:32,881 --> 01:55:35,250
if the top end of your map gets blown 
out,

2241
01:55:35,251 --> 01:55:40,251
that requires accommodation and if it's 
just a little micro change at the 

2242
01:55:40,251 --> 01:55:40,260
bottom,
that's assimilation,

2243
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:45,530
but there's no,
there's no real difference between 

2244
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:46,290
except for scale and there's kind of a 
continual scale,

2245
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:48,990
not an absolute dichotomy.
So.

2246
01:55:49,330 --> 01:55:50,400
Okay.
So anyways,

2247
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:55,490
back to the back to the emotion.
Something happens and it isn't what you 

2248
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:57,720
wanted.
What does that mean?

2249
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:00,210
Well,
it could mean anything.

2250
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:04,680
What you do is you start trying to micro
adjust the frame at the highest level of

2251
01:56:04,681 --> 01:56:09,681
resolution,
but then you might find that you can't 

2252
01:56:09,681 --> 01:56:09,681
do that.
So you have to jump up to the next one.

2253
01:56:09,681 --> 01:56:12,330
You have to jump up to the next one,
you have to jump up to the next one.

2254
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:16,230
And each time you do that,
the psychophysiological cost increases.

2255
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:17,490
So,

2256
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:25,700
okay,
so,

2257
01:56:25,790 --> 01:56:30,790
so we talked about the cost end of the 
spectrum and then we also talked about 

2258
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:31,920
the engagement end of the spectrum.
And so the idea would be,

2259
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:33,660
well,
if you're,

2260
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:36,690
if you're very much engaged,
say in,

2261
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:40,420
let's go do that again.

2262
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:45,830
If you find it very engaging to play 
with your baby,

2263
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:52,180
then you might be doing it in a way 
that's in indicating that you're taking 

2264
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:53,180
good care of your family,
that you're being a good parent and that

2265
01:56:53,181 --> 01:56:55,340
you're being a good person all 
simultaneously,

2266
01:56:55,540 --> 01:57:00,540
where there's rich meaning in that,
and you're the systems that orient you 

2267
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:00,710
with regards to meaning or saying,
look,

2268
01:57:00,711 --> 01:57:05,711
you're doing this microaction in a way 
that benefits the maintenance and maybe 

2269
01:57:05,711 --> 01:57:07,820
even the expansion of all the frames 
that exist above it.

2270
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:09,400
And that's,
that's,

2271
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:14,440
that's exactly what you want.
You want to be doing that all the time 

2272
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:17,111
if you can't.
And so that implies that you want to 

2273
01:57:17,111 --> 01:57:19,451
delineate out a pretty well developed 
value system so that you're not acting 

2274
01:57:20,181 --> 01:57:25,181
at odds with yourself.
And you also want to have that 

2275
01:57:25,181 --> 01:57:28,151
integrated within the broader society so
that society isn't existing towards you 

2276
01:57:28,581 --> 01:57:32,060
as a continual obstacle then making your
life miserable.

2277
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:34,130
So.
Okay,

2278
01:57:35,630 --> 01:57:40,630
good questions.
Any of that not make sense?

2279
01:57:43,561 --> 01:57:48,561
Or do you have any objections to it?
It's funny.

2280
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,200
It's funny,
I mentioned the word matter,

2281
01:57:54,201 --> 01:57:55,940
you know,
because things are made out of matter or

2282
01:57:55,941 --> 01:57:58,940
maybe they're made out of what matters.
But the word object is the same thing.

2283
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,870
You could say that the world is made out
of objects or you can say that the world

2284
01:58:02,871 --> 01:58:06,620
has made out of what objects and both of
those,

2285
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:08,250
both of those,
weirdly enough,

2286
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:10,220
furry,
they're equally true in some sense.

2287
01:58:10,330 --> 01:58:10,820
Question,

2288
01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:12,730
were you?

2289
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:18,240
Yes.

2290
01:58:20,410 --> 01:58:21,640
Queen b?

2291
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:30,140
No.
It's the serotonin system in all 

2292
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:30,140
likelihood.
So serotonin seems.

2293
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:33,630
So the question was positive emotions 
mediated by dopamine.

2294
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:36,240
When you're advancing towards something,
say,

2295
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:38,670
or when you have a cue that something 
good is about to happen.

2296
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:42,100
What is the system that mediates emotion

2297
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:43,360
at the satiation level

2298
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:46,400
be negative?
Yup.

2299
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:50,100
Yup.

2300
01:58:50,310 --> 01:58:51,180
Okay.
Okay.

2301
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:56,390
Well,
let's start with the satiation issue 

2302
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:56,550
that seems most deregulated by 
Serotonin.

2303
01:58:57,780 --> 01:59:02,780
The opiate issue is there are other 
forms of specific reward that don't seem

2304
01:59:02,791 --> 01:59:06,570
to be merely motivated or merely 
underpinned by dopamine.

2305
01:59:07,050 --> 01:59:08,700
And the opiate system would be one of 
those.

2306
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:13,880
There's an oxytocin system as well,
so there are other biochemical systems 

2307
01:59:14,911 --> 01:59:17,490
that are involved in more specific forms
of reward,

2308
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:22,820
but the thing that's common among 
instances that make it appear that 

2309
01:59:24,961 --> 01:59:27,060
you're moving forward is the 
dopaminergic element,

2310
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:28,230
roughly speaking,

2311
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:29,360
and then

2312
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:35,400
one of the things that happens if you're
hiring serotonin because you're more 

2313
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:39,241
dominant,
is that you're more satiated all the 

2314
01:59:39,241 --> 01:59:41,341
time.
That's why people who are low in the 

2315
01:59:41,341 --> 01:59:43,621
dominance hierarchy with decreased 
levels of Serotonin are more impulsive 

2316
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:47,800
and also more emotionally dysregulated.
They're more impulsive because,

2317
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:53,370
hey,
you take your positive thing when you 

2318
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:53,370
can get it,
and so they're.

2319
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:57,970
They're more dissatisfied.
They're more looking for anything that 

2320
01:59:57,970 --> 01:59:57,970
will produce a positive

2321
01:59:57,970 --> 01:59:59,440
outcome,
and then

2322
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:03,870
they're also more likely to experience 
dyfs negative emotion.

2323
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:07,350
Partly because their serotonin systems 
are lower,

2324
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:11,130
indicating their tenuous status in the 
dominance hierarchy.

2325
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:15,810
Meaning that everything they do that's 
uncertain is far more dangerous.

2326
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:22,610
So this is also why it's very difficult 
often when you're trying to treat 

2327
02:00:22,610 --> 02:00:26,271
someone who's depressed because you 
could say there's not much difference 

2328
02:00:26,271 --> 02:00:28,260
between being depressed and existing in 
the biochemical state.

2329
02:00:28,290 --> 02:00:31,170
That being at the bottom of the 
dominance hierarchy would produce,

2330
02:00:31,710 --> 02:00:34,920
in fact they're the same thing.
Well then the question is,

2331
02:00:34,921 --> 02:00:39,390
are you depressed or are you just at the
bottom of a dominance hierarchy?

2332
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:44,580
Because those are not like the 
symptomatology is very,

2333
02:00:44,581 --> 02:00:49,581
very similar,
but the cause and the cure are not the 

2334
02:00:49,581 --> 02:00:50,210
same.
You know,

2335
02:00:50,211 --> 02:00:52,920
because you might be at the bottom of a 
dominant Turkey because you just.

2336
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:57,150
Everything about your life is ruined.
So.

2337
02:00:57,151 --> 02:00:59,250
And of course your suffering.
Are you depressed,

2338
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,720
sir?
No,

2339
02:01:01,110 --> 02:01:03,690
not exactly.
You just have nowhere to go.

2340
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:05,490
So

2341
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:09,450
other questions?
Yes.

2342
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:15,840
Why pursue motivations that don't 
produce this residence?

2343
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:21,680
Okay,
so the question is why don't,

2344
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:24,990
why do people pursue rewards that don't 
produce this resonance?

2345
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:28,890
They don't have a value hierarchy.
So pleasure island.

2346
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:34,850
It's a good example.
Those kids that were brought there were 

2347
02:01:34,850 --> 02:01:34,850
lost.
So they didn't,

2348
02:01:34,850 --> 02:01:38,250
they didn't have anywhere to go.
They didn't have an identity.

2349
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:41,450
So they default to local pleasure

2350
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:47,900
and that's better than none.
Although the problem with local 

2351
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:50,721
pleasure,
while as the narrative made clear is 

2352
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:53,151
that you better look out if you're 
impulsive because it's going to kick 

2353
02:01:53,151 --> 02:01:56,751
back on you heart,
and the reason is you're only 

2354
02:01:56,751 --> 02:01:57,690
considering the immediate timeframe and 
the problem is,

2355
02:01:57,691 --> 02:02:01,920
is that things propagate across all the 
timeframes and so just because something

2356
02:02:01,921 --> 02:02:03,750
works really well,
this second,

2357
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:08,990
cocaine for example,
doesn't mean that it's a tenable 

2358
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:12,621
solution to the class of all problems.
So usually often people pursue local 

2359
02:02:15,571 --> 02:02:18,270
pleasure because that's the best they 
could imagine.

2360
02:02:18,271 --> 02:02:21,480
It's the best they've been taught.
They don't see another alternative.

2361
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:26,780
So it could be ignorance,
it can be they don't want to adopt the 

2362
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:29,331
responsibility because part of the 
problem with working at every level of 

2363
02:02:29,331 --> 02:02:31,350
the hierarchy simultaneously is that 
it's,

2364
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,320
it's,
well,

2365
02:02:33,330 --> 02:02:36,090
it's like dancing to a very complex 
waltz.

2366
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:41,120
Let's say.
You have to be paying attention to a 

2367
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:42,600
very large number of things 
simultaneously and doing things right.

2368
02:02:42,601 --> 02:02:46,610
It requires responsibility and so you 
know that's

2369
02:02:48,510 --> 02:02:50,640
it's a pain.
It's a weight.

2370
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:54,660
Part of the reason people drink alcohol 
is to get rid of their responsibility.

2371
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:59,720
I mean,
that's what you hear people drink 

2372
02:02:59,720 --> 02:02:59,720
because they have problems.
It's like,

2373
02:02:59,720 --> 02:02:59,750
yeah,
yeah,

2374
02:02:59,850 --> 02:03:04,850
no,
some people drink because they're 

2375
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:06,480
anxious and alcoholics drink because 
they're in withdrawal,

2376
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:11,780
but young people drink because they're 
sick and tired of being responsible 

2377
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:12,210
because it's annoying.
It's like,

2378
02:03:12,211 --> 02:03:17,211
so I'll drink enough.
I won't care about the medium to 

2379
02:03:17,211 --> 02:03:18,090
longterm consequences because alcohol,
that's exactly what alcohol does.

2380
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:22,620
It doesn't make you inderal of the 
medium to longterm consequences,

2381
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:26,760
but it makes you not care about them and
partly it's because it dampens anxiety,

2382
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:32,150
so it dampens anxiety,
leaves your positive emotion circuits 

2383
02:03:32,150 --> 02:03:34,890
intact,
so then you can go out there and do 

2384
02:03:34,890 --> 02:03:34,890
stupid,
fun things and that's like,

2385
02:03:34,890 --> 02:03:36,420
that's a party really.
Let's go do stupid fun things.

2386
02:03:36,630 --> 02:03:41,630
That's a party,
but the medium to longterm consequences 

2387
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:44,390
are.
It's risky.

2388
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:47,450
It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,
but it's risky.

2389
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:50,090
So yeah,
they don't know better.

2390
02:03:50,930 --> 02:03:54,890
That's the answer I would say.
So yes.

2391
02:03:56,070 --> 02:04:01,070
You were talking about responsibility.
It seems like that balance of burst into

2392
02:04:02,181 --> 02:04:04,430
a certain frame and

2393
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:09,910
now that's where conservatives and 
liberals don't get along because 

2394
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:11,610
conservatives do bind themselves to a 
particular frame.

2395
02:04:12,510 --> 02:04:17,510
They're conscientious and low in 
openness and the liberals say doesn't 

2396
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:18,750
that just bind you to a particular 
frame?

2397
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:21,930
And it's like,
yeah it does and that's a problem.

2398
02:04:22,170 --> 02:04:23,010
So yes,

2399
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:29,180
but in terms of being aware of the 
multiple levels it takes within a frame 

2400
02:04:30,430 --> 02:04:35,430
takes certain amount of tolerance of the
unbearable president for that to reach 

2401
02:04:37,651 --> 02:04:42,651
the edge of that frame to force a person
to see a different frame because that's 

2402
02:04:42,651 --> 02:04:42,990
something that sentence.

2403
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:48,110
Yes.
And that's actually where I stopped 

2404
02:04:48,110 --> 02:04:48,660
today because that's,
that's exactly right.

2405
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:53,720
So you're,
you're good because both the questions 

2406
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:53,720
you asked indicated that you're sort of 
at the next step in the,

2407
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:58,570
in the logic process because you asked 
about the relationship between these 

2408
02:04:58,570 --> 02:05:01,971
frames with you know,
in relationship to one another and that 

2409
02:05:01,971 --> 02:05:01,971
is the next issue.
It's like,

2410
02:05:02,290 --> 02:05:07,290
but responsibility and individuality,
but I'm curious about responsibility 

2411
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:09,420
implies a connection to other people.
Okay.

2412
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:14,420
Well what are the things.
One of the things we are going to talk 

2413
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:15,930
about in the classes is how you address 
the problem that you just described,

2414
02:05:15,931 --> 02:05:18,900
which is that this is the Peter Pan 
Story.

2415
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:21,870
Roughly speaking is Peter Pan is this 
magical boy.

2416
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:26,100
Pan Means Pan is the god of everything,
roughly speaking,

2417
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:31,130
right?
And so it's not an accident that he has 

2418
02:05:31,130 --> 02:05:33,030
the name Pan and he's the boy that won't
grow up and he's magical.

2419
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,800
Well,
that's because children are magical.

2420
02:05:34,801 --> 02:05:39,801
They can be anything.
They're nothing but potential and Peter 

2421
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:41,940
Pan doesn't want to give that up.
Why?

2422
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:44,130
Well,
he's got some adults around them,

2423
02:05:44,131 --> 02:05:47,100
but the main adult is captain hook.
Well,

2424
02:05:47,101 --> 02:05:49,050
who the hell wants to grow up to be 
Captain Hook?

2425
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:54,260
First of all,
you've got to hook second year a tyrant 

2426
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:58,550
and third,
you're chased by the dragon of chaos 

2427
02:05:58,550 --> 02:05:58,590
with a clock in its stomach,
right?

2428
02:05:58,590 --> 02:06:00,480
The crocodile.
It's already got a piece of you.

2429
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:03,060
Well,
that's what happens when you get older.

2430
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:08,120
Time has already got a piece of you and 
eventually it's going to taste for you 

2431
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:12,321
and eventually it's going to eat you.
And so hook is so traumatized by now 

2432
02:06:12,321 --> 02:06:16,970
that he can't help but be a tyrant.
And then Peter Parent looks at 

2433
02:06:16,970 --> 02:06:18,270
traumatized Herc and says,
well,

2434
02:06:18,271 --> 02:06:23,271
no,
I'm not sacrificing my childhood for 

2435
02:06:23,271 --> 02:06:23,271
that.
So that's fine.

2436
02:06:23,271 --> 02:06:25,520
Except the ends up Kenya lost boys it 
Neverland,

2437
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:27,300
well,
Neverland doesn't exist and who the hell

2438
02:06:27,301 --> 02:06:32,301
wants to be king of the lost boys and he
also sacrifice is the possibility that 

2439
02:06:32,301 --> 02:06:36,841
it held a real relationship with a woman
because that's Wendy Wright and she's 

2440
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:40,260
kind of conservative middleclass London 
dwelling girl.

2441
02:06:40,410 --> 02:06:42,330
She wants to grow up and have kids and 
have a life.

2442
02:06:42,331 --> 02:06:45,450
She accepts her mortality.
She accepts her maturity.

2443
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:49,340
Peter Pan has to contend himself with 
tinker bell.

2444
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:51,660
She doesn't even exist.
She's like,

2445
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:56,940
she's like the fairy of porn.
She doesn't exist.

2446
02:06:57,690 --> 02:07:00,870
She's the substitute for the real thing 
and so,

2447
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:02,820
but the dichotomy that you're talking 
about,

2448
02:07:02,821 --> 02:07:07,230
it's very tricky because there's a 
sacrificial element in maturation,

2449
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:12,860
right?
You have to sacrifice the pleura 

2450
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:15,321
potentiality of childhood for the 
actuality of a frame and the question 

2451
02:07:17,461 --> 02:07:17,790
is,
well,

2452
02:07:17,791 --> 02:07:18,900
why would you do that?
Well,

2453
02:07:18,901 --> 02:07:21,450
one reason is it happens to you whether 
you do it or not.

2454
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:26,750
You can either choose your damn 
limitation or you can let it take you 

2455
02:07:26,911 --> 02:07:31,911
unaware when you're 30 or even worse 
when you're 40 and then that is not a 

2456
02:07:33,061 --> 02:07:34,860
happy day.
You see,

2457
02:07:34,890 --> 02:07:39,890
I people like this and I think it's more
and more common in our culture because 

2458
02:07:39,890 --> 02:07:42,190
people can put off matt maturity without
suffering and immediate penalty,

2459
02:07:42,430 --> 02:07:46,660
but all that happens is the penalty 
accrues and then when it finally hits it

2460
02:07:46,661 --> 02:07:49,990
just wallops you because when you're 25 
you could be an idiot.

2461
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:53,770
It's no problem.
Even when you're out in a job search,

2462
02:07:53,771 --> 02:07:54,100
it's like,
well,

2463
02:07:54,101 --> 02:07:55,930
you don't have any experience in.
You're kind of clueless.

2464
02:07:55,931 --> 02:07:56,290
It's,
yeah,

2465
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:57,250
you're young,
you know,

2466
02:07:57,251 --> 02:07:58,240
it's no problem.
We can.

2467
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:00,760
That's what young people are like,
but they're full of potential.

2468
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:03,190
Okay,
well now you're the same person at 30.

2469
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:06,430
It's like people aren't so thrilled 
about you at that point.

2470
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:11,720
It's like,
what the hell have you been doing for 

2471
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:11,720
the last 10 years?
Well,

2472
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:11,720
I'm just as clueless as I was when I was
22.

2473
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:12,310
It's,
yeah,

2474
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:15,640
but you're not 22.
You're an old infant.

2475
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:18,970
Right?
And that's an ugly thing and old infant.

2476
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:21,860
So they.
The reason,

2477
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:26,940
part of the reason you choose your damn 
sacrifice because the sacrifice is 

2478
02:08:27,311 --> 02:08:32,311
inevitable,
but at least you get to choose it and 

2479
02:08:32,311 --> 02:08:35,011
then there's something that's even more 
complex than that in some sense is that 

2480
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:39,100
the problem with being a child is that 
all you are is potential and it's really

2481
02:08:39,101 --> 02:08:40,060
low resolution.

2482
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:42,070
You could be anything but you're not 
anything.

2483
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:45,430
So then you go and you do adopt an 
apprenticeship,

2484
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:51,060
roughly speaking,
and then you become at least you become 

2485
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:53,350
something and when you're something that
makes the world open up to you again,

2486
02:08:53,930 --> 02:08:56,290
you know,
like if you're a really good plumber,

2487
02:08:57,010 --> 02:08:59,080
then you ended up being far more than a 
plumber,

2488
02:08:59,081 --> 02:09:00,670
right?
You ended up being a good employer.

2489
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:05,760
Not,
not that plumbers are not putting 

2490
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:05,760
plumbers down.
It's like more power to plumbers.

2491
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:09,280
They've saved more lives than doctors.
So hygiene,

2492
02:09:09,281 --> 02:09:10,930
right?
So you know,

2493
02:09:10,931 --> 02:09:13,270
if you're a really good plumber,
well then you have some employees.

2494
02:09:13,271 --> 02:09:14,530
You run a business,
you,

2495
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:16,450
you make you,
you train some other people,

2496
02:09:16,451 --> 02:09:21,451
you enlarge their lives.
You're kind of a pillar of the 

2497
02:09:21,451 --> 02:09:21,451
community.
You have your family.

2498
02:09:21,451 --> 02:09:25,801
It's you can,
once you pass through that narrow 

2499
02:09:25,801 --> 02:09:30,030
training period which narrows you and 
constricts you and develops you at the 

2500
02:09:30,030 --> 02:09:31,030
same time,
then you can come out the other end with

2501
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:35,620
a bunch of new possibility at help at 
hand and young talked about that,

2502
02:09:35,621 --> 02:09:40,621
a thought that the proper part of the 
proper path of development in the last 

2503
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:46,710
half of life was to rediscover that 
child that you left behind as you were 

2504
02:09:46,710 --> 02:09:51,571
apprenticing and so then you get to be 
something and regain that potential at 

2505
02:09:52,451 --> 02:09:53,140
the same time.

2506
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:54,340
Very,
very smart.

2507
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:55,090
Well,
he was very,

2508
02:09:55,091 --> 02:09:57,680
very smart.
That's very wise,

2509
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:03,070
very wise thing to know,
so yep.

2510
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:07,880
Sacrifice.
We'll talk more about that too.

2511
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:11,390
You get to pick your damn sacrifice.
That's all.

2512
02:10:11,450 --> 02:10:16,450
You don't get to not make what your 
sacrificial whether you want to be or 

2513
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:18,200
not.
That's a good thing to know as well.

2514
02:10:18,770 --> 02:10:20,490
So even though it's rather,
you know,

2515
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:24,200
it's rough thing to figure out,
but other questions

2516
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:32,390
I have

2517
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:34,330
no one else.

2518
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:34,720
Okay.

2519
02:10:35,090 --> 02:10:40,090
That thing you just said about noticing 
it more and more people live into their 

2520
02:10:40,090 --> 02:10:40,820
20 [inaudible] yeah.
What do you think about that?

2521
02:10:40,821 --> 02:10:43,790
Where do you think that comes from in 
terms of culture?

2522
02:10:43,791 --> 02:10:44,240
We live in,

2523
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:49,930
think universities facilitate it because
you can go to university to not be 

2524
02:10:50,401 --> 02:10:55,401
something instead of going to university
to be something and that's it's pleasure

2525
02:10:55,641 --> 02:10:55,970
island

2526
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:00,250
and the price you pay for it,
especially in the U.

2527
02:11:00,250 --> 02:11:04,530
S is debt and you're enticed into it 
because the administrators can pick your

2528
02:11:04,531 --> 02:11:09,531
pocket,
so they rob your future self while 

2529
02:11:09,531 --> 02:11:11,640
allowing you to pretend that you have an
identity.

2530
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:17,420
Right?
Very nasty and you can't declare 

2531
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:17,670
bankruptcy with your student loans in 
the US,

2532
02:11:17,730 --> 02:11:22,170
it's indentured servitude and it is 
precisely pleasure island.

2533
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:27,200
It's exactly that.
And so tuition fees of short way out of 

2534
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,981
control and part of the reason that 
universities don't make more demands on 

2535
02:11:30,981 --> 02:11:32,520
their students and let them get away 
with all the things.

2536
02:11:32,521 --> 02:11:34,860
They let them get away with it because 
they're basically,

2537
02:11:35,130 --> 02:11:39,420
why the hell would you chase them out?
There are $100,000

2538
02:11:40,050 --> 02:11:45,050
or more so they can do whatever they 
want as long as you get to sell them to 

2539
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:47,370
the salt mines.
Right.

2540
02:11:49,150 --> 02:11:49,990
So,
and you know,

2541
02:11:49,991 --> 02:11:54,991
it's not the only reason because the 
other thing that's happened is that the 

2542
02:11:54,991 --> 02:11:57,991
rate of technological transformation is 
so fast now and the rate of turnover of 

2543
02:11:57,991 --> 02:12:01,771
things is that it's,
it is genuinely harder for people who 

2544
02:12:01,771 --> 02:12:01,771
are say 18 to 20.

2545
02:12:02,110 --> 02:12:04,000
When I was a kid,
roughly speaking,

2546
02:12:04,001 --> 02:12:06,120
the kind of rough patch for,
for,

2547
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:09,550
for life was probably 14 to 17,
something like that.

2548
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:12,160
Now it's,
I think it's 18 to 25,

2549
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:17,640
something like that.
And I think the reason for that is that 

2550
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:20,940
all the jobs that the bloody hippies 
complained about being doomed to in the 

2551
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:22,540
19 sixties have now disappeared.
Their problem was,

2552
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:27,600
oh my God,
I'm going to have to work for a 

2553
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:27,700
corporation and get a salary for the 
rest of my life,

2554
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:33,000
you know?
And then I'll just end up in with a 

2555
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:33,000
pension and that'll be my whole life.
It's like,

2556
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,471
well,
it seems like a lot better deal than an 

2557
02:12:37,471 --> 02:12:38,940
endless round of part time starbucks 
jobs.

2558
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,190
So,
you know,

2559
02:12:41,191 --> 02:12:44,010
some of it is that it's,
it's just,

2560
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:44,830
it's,
it's,

2561
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:47,410
there is a space now in our culture 
that,

2562
02:12:47,950 --> 02:12:52,420
that is lacking for people to make that 
transformation from,

2563
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:55,390
from adolescence into adulthood.
And so it's just,

2564
02:12:55,870 --> 02:12:58,400
it's,
it's the cost of that is for stalled,

2565
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:02,200
but it's not a good thing.
It's not a good thing

2566
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:11,220
they're seeing this person's eft,
but I've heard about things.

2567
02:13:17,530 --> 02:13:18,070
Well,
the,

2568
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:21,010
there's a couple of problems with the 
degrees is that everyone has one.

2569
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:23,410
That's the first one,
which.

2570
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:26,710
So because scarcity matters obviously.
Um,

2571
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:32,460
the second thing is,
is that the match between the degree in 

2572
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:33,000
the workplace has less and less self 
evident.

2573
02:13:33,370 --> 02:13:38,370
You know,
what should happen when you go to 

2574
02:13:38,370 --> 02:13:38,640
university is you should learn how to 
think and formulate arguments.

2575
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:40,980
You should learn to think,
speak and write.

2576
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:44,640
That's what the humanities are for.
They're to make you dangerous,

2577
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:49,790
right?
Because if you can think and speak and 

2578
02:13:49,790 --> 02:13:51,660
write your deadly in a complex job,
you're exactly what's necessary.

2579
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:56,930
But if you don't have that,
it's like what the hell good is the 

2580
02:13:56,930 --> 02:13:56,930
degree.
So I mean,

2581
02:13:56,930 --> 02:13:58,980
a degree in English literature doesn't 
prepare you for a job,

2582
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:02,280
it could make you think,
write and speak,

2583
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:05,640
which prepares you for any complex job 
and that's what's supposed to happen.

2584
02:14:05,641 --> 02:14:09,690
But increasingly I think that doesn't 
happen

2585
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:13,820
and the employers are waking up to this 
very rapidly.

2586
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:15,410
So,
and they're,

2587
02:14:15,470 --> 02:14:17,210
I mean,
they've already known that most for most

2588
02:14:17,211 --> 02:14:19,370
complex positions,
they have to train their people.

2589
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:21,080
Now they're thinking,
well,

2590
02:14:21,081 --> 02:14:23,540
why do I have to bother with the degree 
if I'm going to train them,

2591
02:14:23,541 --> 02:14:25,850
if it isn't bringing anything of value?
You see this.

2592
02:14:25,851 --> 02:14:30,851
And even fields like law.
When I went to do a debate at Queen's 

2593
02:14:30,851 --> 02:14:33,791
university three weeks ago,
I think they couldn't get anybody to 

2594
02:14:33,791 --> 02:14:33,791
debate me.
You know,

2595
02:14:33,791 --> 02:14:34,330
they,
the guy had to pay,

2596
02:14:34,350 --> 02:14:37,030
play devil's advocate.
We were talking about bill [inaudible].

2597
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:37,850
And I thought,
Jesus,

2598
02:14:37,851 --> 02:14:40,400
that's so pathetic.
I'm talking about legal matters.

2599
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:45,700
And I meant the world greatest.
One of the greatest universities in the 

2600
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:45,700
West,
you know,

2601
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:46,280
I mean,
it's in the top 200,

2602
02:14:46,281 --> 02:14:47,840
let's say.
Um,

2603
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:52,130
I couldn't get someone to argue with the
stupid psychology professor about law,

2604
02:14:52,860 --> 02:14:56,000
had to get a devil's advocate.
And so one of the things that was really

2605
02:14:56,001 --> 02:15:00,380
disheartening talking to the students 
was they told me four or five of them,

2606
02:15:00,381 --> 02:15:01,850
they're not learning a damn thing in 
law.

2607
02:15:01,851 --> 02:15:04,760
It's all social justice nonsense.
So like,

2608
02:15:04,910 --> 02:15:07,370
well good,
that'll do it in the profession.

2609
02:15:07,371 --> 02:15:10,670
It's being done in any ways because 
lawyers being replaced by automation.

2610
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:13,880
And so a lot of what they do is dig up 
information.

2611
02:15:13,910 --> 02:15:15,740
It's like,
well you can do that on your own.

2612
02:15:15,741 --> 02:15:20,360
And forms are proliferating like Matt.
So the law school should be teaching you

2613
02:15:20,361 --> 02:15:21,620
to be a monster.

2614
02:15:23,410 --> 02:15:26,590
You better be,
but you come out,

2615
02:15:26,591 --> 02:15:29,200
you're concerned with social welfare.
Oh God.

2616
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:30,730
It's like,
well,

2617
02:15:30,731 --> 02:15:35,731
there's just nothing to that.
It's like you can come out and say 

2618
02:15:35,731 --> 02:15:35,860
you're,
you want to be nice to people.

2619
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:37,390
Well that's nice.
Good.

2620
02:15:37,391 --> 02:15:42,391
You go right ahead.
Just like I'll go find someone who can 

2621
02:15:42,391 --> 02:15:43,990
do something and you can go be nice to 
people and see how effective that is.

2622
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:48,460
So it's a lot of things that are 
conspiring in the same direction.

2623
02:15:49,150 --> 02:15:51,310
People don't have to get married to have
sex,

2624
02:15:53,110 --> 02:15:55,030
so we have no idea what that's going to 
do.

2625
02:15:55,031 --> 02:16:00,031
Although we know one thing it's done is 
the only people that get married now or 

2626
02:16:00,031 --> 02:16:00,250
rich.
Right.

2627
02:16:00,251 --> 02:16:03,730
Which is another thing that's really 
comical because the feminist idea in the

2628
02:16:03,731 --> 02:16:05,740
sixties was that marriage was an 
oppressive,

2629
02:16:06,070 --> 02:16:07,750
oppressive,
patriarchal institution.

2630
02:16:07,870 --> 02:16:08,410
It's like,
okay,

2631
02:16:08,411 --> 02:16:13,411
fine.
Then why do only rich women get married 

2632
02:16:13,411 --> 02:16:13,411
now?
Because that's.

2633
02:16:13,411 --> 02:16:15,820
That is the case.
And so for poor women,

2634
02:16:15,910 --> 02:16:19,210
the dissolution of marriage has been an 
absolute catastrophe.

2635
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:22,480
They are so screwed because they have 
kids.

2636
02:16:23,170 --> 02:16:26,080
So they're working,
they've got their 90 hour work week,

2637
02:16:26,081 --> 02:16:27,130
man,
that's for sure.

2638
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:29,170
They're much less attractive to 
potential.

2639
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:33,670
So they get low quality men,
often parasitical and predatory.

2640
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:38,650
So they often have like jobs in retail 
for example,

2641
02:16:38,651 --> 02:16:43,651
which are just dreadful.
You don't even know what your schedule 

2642
02:16:43,651 --> 02:16:43,651
is going to be.
You get paid hardly anything,

2643
02:16:43,651 --> 02:16:44,650
you know?
It's really.

2644
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:47,590
But if you know,
most of the women who,

2645
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:52,950
who,
who are outspoken feminists are on the 

2646
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:56,260
successful end of the associate economic
distribution.

2647
02:16:56,310 --> 02:16:58,270
There are university students or people 
like that,

2648
02:16:58,330 --> 02:17:03,330
they don't even know any poor women,
so they have no idea what their lives 

2649
02:17:03,330 --> 02:17:05,770
are like and you would never know 
because they're at home working,

2650
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:10,830
you know,
they're either at their horrible job or 

2651
02:17:10,830 --> 02:17:10,830
they're at home slaving away with their 
kids.

2652
02:17:10,830 --> 02:17:12,670
So it's not like they're out there 
telling you what's wrong with them.

2653
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:13,900
So

2654
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:21,020
fix this Ita.
So sometimes he listed it as a lack of 

2655
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:25,750
critical thinking and language.
It's almost like it's like a logic 

2656
02:17:26,030 --> 02:17:31,030
association with punctuation of herbs 
and it feels sometimes they're lacking 

2657
02:17:31,030 --> 02:17:33,500
in this basic knowledge.
Just put two and two together.

2658
02:17:35,470 --> 02:17:40,470
The best way,
the best way to teach people critical 

2659
02:17:40,470 --> 02:17:42,751
thinking is to teach them to write.
And I made this little thing that I put 

2660
02:17:42,751 --> 02:17:42,880
online.
It's,

2661
02:17:43,530 --> 02:17:46,420
I don't know if maybe it is it in the 
site for 34 website.

2662
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:49,060
Did I post that rubric for Essay 
Writing?

2663
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:52,660
I don't think it actually went through.
I think it is still on 4:30.

2664
02:17:52,661 --> 02:17:52,840
That's fine.

2665
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:55,390
Is it not on for 34?
Is that not working?

2666
02:17:57,640 --> 02:18:01,210
Oh yeah,
it's still in corporate before 30.

2667
02:18:01,830 --> 02:18:02,550
Oh,
okay.

2668
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:04,950
Well there's an essay.
Hope that's too bad.

2669
02:18:05,250 --> 02:18:10,170
It's not on the site for 34 website even
because I updated it anyways.

2670
02:18:10,171 --> 02:18:13,740
I have this guide to writing this that 
if it isn't on the 4:34

2671
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:15,870
website,
it is definitely on the 4:30

2672
02:18:15,871 --> 02:18:20,871
website and it steps people through the 
process of writing because what's 

2673
02:18:21,391 --> 02:18:26,391
happened now,
it's very hard to teach people to write 

2674
02:18:26,391 --> 02:18:28,350
because it's unbelievably time intensive
and like writing marketing a good essay.

2675
02:18:28,410 --> 02:18:30,420
That's really easy.
Check a.

2676
02:18:30,990 --> 02:18:32,330
You did everything right,
right.

2677
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:34,680
Marketing a bad essay.
Oh my God.

2678
02:18:34,890 --> 02:18:36,480
The words are wrong.
The phrases are wrong.

2679
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:41,490
The sentence is wrong.
They're not ordered right in the 

2680
02:18:41,490 --> 02:18:43,311
paragraphs.
The paragraphs aren't coherent and the 

2681
02:18:43,311 --> 02:18:45,501
whole thing makes no sense,
so trying to tell the person what they 

2682
02:18:45,501 --> 02:18:45,660
did wrong.
It's like,

2683
02:18:45,661 --> 02:18:46,860
Whoa,
you did everything wrong.

2684
02:18:46,861 --> 02:18:51,090
Everything about this essay is wrong.
Well that's not helpful either.

2685
02:18:51,090 --> 02:18:56,090
You have to find the few little things 
they did half right and you have to 

2686
02:18:56,161 --> 02:19:01,161
teach them what they did wrong.
It's really expensive and so what I did 

2687
02:19:01,161 --> 02:19:05,310
with this rubric was trying to address 
that from the production side instead of

2688
02:19:05,311 --> 02:19:10,311
the grading side,
but the best thing you can do is teach 

2689
02:19:10,311 --> 02:19:11,580
people to write because there's no 
difference between that and thinking and

2690
02:19:11,581 --> 02:19:16,581
one of the things that just blows me 
away about universities is that no one 

2691
02:19:16,581 --> 02:19:18,540
ever tell students why they should write
something.

2692
02:19:19,020 --> 02:19:19,470
It's like,
well,

2693
02:19:19,471 --> 02:19:21,570
you have to do this assignment.
Well,

2694
02:19:21,590 --> 02:19:22,710
why are you writing?
Well,

2695
02:19:22,711 --> 02:19:23,700
you need the grade.
It's like,

2696
02:19:23,701 --> 02:19:28,701
no,
you need to learn to think because 

2697
02:19:28,701 --> 02:19:30,380
thinking makes you act effectively in 
the world.

2698
02:19:30,381 --> 02:19:33,650
Thinking makes you win the battles you 
undertake and those could be battles for

2699
02:19:33,651 --> 02:19:36,230
good things.
If you can think and speak and write,

2700
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:39,200
you are absolutely deadly.

2701
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:43,040
Nothing can get in your way.
So that's why you learned to write.

2702
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:48,070
It's like why not?
I can't believe that people aren't just 

2703
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:48,540
told that it's,
it's,

2704
02:19:48,541 --> 02:19:53,541
it's like it's the most powerful weapon 
you can possibly provide someone with.

2705
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:59,710
And I mean,
I know lots of people who've been 

2706
02:19:59,710 --> 02:19:59,710
staggeringly successful and watched them
throughout my life.

2707
02:19:59,710 --> 02:20:04,511
I mean those people,
you don't want to have an argument with 

2708
02:20:04,511 --> 02:20:07,121
them.
They'll just slash you into pieces and 

2709
02:20:07,121 --> 02:20:10,220
not in a malevolent way.
It's like if you're gonna make your 

2710
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:10,220
point and they're going to make their 
point.

2711
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:14,740
You better have your points organized 
because otherwise you are going to look 

2712
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:19,120
like and be an absolute idiot.
You are not going to get anywhere.

2713
02:20:19,700 --> 02:20:23,570
And if you can formulate your arguments 
coherently and make a presentation,

2714
02:20:23,571 --> 02:20:26,810
if you can speak to people,
if you can lay out a proposal,

2715
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:28,610
God,
people give you money,

2716
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:31,910
they give you opportunities,
you have influence.

2717
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:37,840
That's what you were at university for.
And so that's what you do is you 

2718
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:37,840
urinate,
you're in English,

2719
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:39,800
right?
You're in your new languages anyways.

2720
02:20:39,801 --> 02:20:40,640
It's like,
yeah,

2721
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:46,160
teach,
teach people to be articulate because 

2722
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:47,180
that's the most dangerous thing you can 
possibly be.

2723
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,430
So,
and that's motivating.

2724
02:20:49,431 --> 02:20:50,630
If people know that,
it's like,

2725
02:20:50,631 --> 02:20:52,370
well,
why are you learning to write?

2726
02:20:52,371 --> 02:20:54,080
Because your,
here's your sword,

2727
02:20:54,081 --> 02:20:55,850
here's your [inaudible],
right?

2728
02:20:55,851 --> 02:20:59,660
Here's your bulletproof vest.
Like you're learn how to use them,

2729
02:21:01,150 --> 02:21:05,450
but it's just,

2730
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:11,760
it's an endless mystery to me why that 
isn't made self evident.

2731
02:21:14,220 --> 02:21:14,660
So

2732
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:16,610
that's the sort of thing that can drive 
you mad.

2733
02:21:16,611 --> 02:21:19,340
Trying to sort out.
It's like people are,

2734
02:21:19,490 --> 02:21:24,490
there's a,
there's a conspiracy to bring people 

2735
02:21:24,490 --> 02:21:24,490
into the education system to make them 
weaker.

2736
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:25,640
So

2737
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:32,180
I guess that keeps the competition down.
Maybe that's one way of thinking about 

2738
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:34,560
it.
If your students are stupid,

2739
02:21:34,561 --> 02:21:35,700
they're not going to challenge you.

2740
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:42,800
So other questions,
disagreements.

2741
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:47,860
I mean it's a pretty harsh indictment of
the university system.

2742
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:56,040
You get depleted points that if you stay
a,

2743
02:21:57,780 --> 02:22:01,000
which is of course a really good point.
You,

2744
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:04,360
you have mobile mobility solution,
right?

2745
02:22:04,430 --> 02:22:08,480
Yeah.
But then is also like April.

2746
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:11,830
It's also assuming that you will always 
get to a solution.

2747
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:13,210
Yes,
true.

2748
02:22:15,810 --> 02:22:17,180
Yes,
yes,

2749
02:22:17,450 --> 02:22:17,800
yes.

2750
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:19,800
Analytic solution that will keep them

2751
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:21,800
true.
Well,

2752
02:22:21,801 --> 02:22:22,850
you know,
there used to be,

2753
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:24,980
before the divorce laws were really 
liberalized,

2754
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:29,760
there were there you could sue for 
irreconcilable differences and sometimes

2755
02:22:29,761 --> 02:22:31,770
people do find themselves in that 
situation.

2756
02:22:31,771 --> 02:22:34,200
It's like one person wants children in 
the other person doesn't.

2757
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:38,700
It's like that's a tough one.
It's a tough one to negotiate,

2758
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:44,270
so I'm,
I'm certainly not saying that just 

2759
02:22:44,270 --> 02:22:48,090
because you lock yourself into a,
like two cats in a barrel that,

2760
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:53,600
that will make you solve your problems 
because problems are hard to solve and 

2761
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:57,411
sometimes you can't solve them.
I was just pointing out what the cost 

2762
02:22:57,411 --> 02:23:01,311
of,
of leaving the back door or what the 

2763
02:23:01,311 --> 02:23:02,700
cost of leaving the back door open is 
and it's a big cost and you know,

2764
02:23:02,701 --> 02:23:07,701
one of the things I see too is that 
people's identities fragment 

2765
02:23:07,701 --> 02:23:08,300
increasingly across time.
You know,

2766
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:13,370
one of the things that you have as you 
age is something like the continuity of 

2767
02:23:14,041 --> 02:23:15,810
your life.
You know,

2768
02:23:15,870 --> 02:23:16,250
you,
you,

2769
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:21,320
you have someone that you're with,
you've tied your story together with 

2770
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:21,320
theirs.
You have children,

2771
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:25,740
maybe they have children.
It's like there's this continual payoff,

2772
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:30,830
so to speak,
in quality that you obtained from 

2773
02:23:30,830 --> 02:23:34,760
staying within that frame and you can 
jump out of that.

2774
02:23:34,921 --> 02:23:37,350
And I suppose to some degree that that 
provides freedom,

2775
02:23:37,351 --> 02:23:39,510
but it isn't obvious to me that there 
does that for people.

2776
02:23:41,450 --> 02:23:46,450
One specific relationship.
It's a email.

2777
02:23:48,820 --> 02:23:49,360
No,
but,

2778
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:54,420
but,
but it's also the case that sequential 

2779
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:56,851
relationships are unlikely to be that.
So look,

2780
02:23:57,111 --> 02:23:57,630
I,
I'm,

2781
02:23:57,631 --> 02:23:58,720
I'm not,
I'm not make,

2782
02:23:58,721 --> 02:24:01,790
I'm definitely not making a utopian case
for marriage.

2783
02:24:03,830 --> 02:24:08,830
I would like to hear the case for the 
boys from you because he made a really 

2784
02:24:08,830 --> 02:24:09,000
interesting,
right?

2785
02:24:09,001 --> 02:24:14,001
It says top points,
but at the same time I think there are 

2786
02:24:14,001 --> 02:24:16,020
relationships that are one.
Yup.

2787
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:19,560
And we,
if that's the case,

2788
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:24,860
then insistent them a cannot be good.

2789
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:25,850
Yeah.
Well that's,

2790
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:27,830
that's definitely the alternative 
argument.

2791
02:24:27,831 --> 02:24:31,580
And of course there are strong things to
be said on both sides,

2792
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:37,170
but see there's some,
there's some additional problems with 

2793
02:24:41,801 --> 02:24:45,340
divorce that people don't really grasp 
when they're young.

2794
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:49,060
Like the idea that you can be divorced 
once you have children.

2795
02:24:49,270 --> 02:24:51,880
That's kind of a stupid idea because you
can't,

2796
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,770
you can,
you can,

2797
02:24:54,250 --> 02:24:59,250
you can find a limited substitute for 
your initial freedom,

2798
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:05,280
but if you,
if you have kids and you try to get 

2799
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,981
divorced,
the probability that that's going to 

2800
02:25:07,981 --> 02:25:07,981
demolish your life is very,
very high.

2801
02:25:07,981 --> 02:25:09,580
First of all,
it's incredibly expensive.

2802
02:25:10,060 --> 02:25:14,500
So one or both of you is going to come 
out of that poor and

2803
02:25:16,450 --> 02:25:20,050
your market value has declined.
Let's say you're the woman who takes the

2804
02:25:20,051 --> 02:25:25,051
kids.
Your market value has declined 

2805
02:25:25,051 --> 02:25:25,051
radically.
You're going to be poorer.

2806
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:29,230
The man,
he's just a screwed because he is now an

2807
02:25:29,231 --> 02:25:32,050
indentured servant and there's no escape
from it.

2808
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:36,310
So it's.
And it's not so bad if you can negotiate

2809
02:25:36,311 --> 02:25:38,320
a peaceful separation and some people 
can,

2810
02:25:38,321 --> 02:25:40,870
but lots of times if you have a terrible
relationship,

2811
02:25:41,170 --> 02:25:44,230
it's not like negotiating and peaceful 
separation is all that easy,

2812
02:25:44,590 --> 02:25:47,770
but if you're at each other's throats,
good luck to you.

2813
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:51,430
I think it's roughly equivalent to 
having non fatal cancer.

2814
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:55,300
It is not pleasant.
It's a 10 year process,

2815
02:25:55,301 --> 02:25:58,270
15 year process.
It'll cost you $250,000

2816
02:25:58,510 --> 02:26:03,510
and it'll tear a big chunk out of your 
life and also it will really disrupt 

2817
02:26:03,510 --> 02:26:05,830
your relationship with your kids.
And you know,

2818
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:07,330
you bring kids into a step.

2819
02:26:07,330 --> 02:26:09,460
Parent family,
they do not do as well.

2820
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:13,030
Step parents are not as good as parents,
as biological parents.

2821
02:26:13,031 --> 02:26:14,680
And the data on that is clear.
Now,

2822
02:26:14,710 --> 02:26:19,710
obviously there are exceptions because 
there are terrible biological parents 

2823
02:26:19,710 --> 02:26:21,850
and there are wonderful step parents,
but if you look in aggregate,

2824
02:26:22,870 --> 02:26:26,800
it's not that easy to care for children.
You need everything.

2825
02:26:27,580 --> 02:26:31,450
You can binding you to them and if 
there's someone else's children,

2826
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:35,710
mostly they get in the way of the person
that you love,

2827
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,950
right?
Well,

2828
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:40,840
if I'm,
let's say you have a child,

2829
02:26:41,410 --> 02:26:44,110
I'll be right out.
Let's say you have a child and I want to

2830
02:26:44,111 --> 02:26:49,111
go out with you every second you spend 
with that child is the second you don't 

2831
02:26:49,111 --> 02:26:51,790
spend with me and,
and there's gonna be a price for that.

2832
02:26:51,791 --> 02:26:53,770
I'm not going to be happy about that.
And,

2833
02:26:53,790 --> 02:26:58,790
and if I have a child,
you're going to feel exactly the same 

2834
02:26:58,790 --> 02:26:58,790
way.
You might say,

2835
02:26:58,790 --> 02:26:58,790
well no,
I love children.

2836
02:26:58,790 --> 02:26:59,050
It's like,
yeah,

2837
02:26:59,051 --> 02:27:00,070
yeah,
sure,

2838
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:02,710
sure you do.
I doubt it.

2839
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:05,160
You might love your child.
And,

2840
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:07,750
and you know,
it's pretty specific the way that people

2841
02:27:07,751 --> 02:27:09,490
loved children.
So,

2842
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:14,370
and the rate of abuse for kids in step 
parent families is way higher than it is

2843
02:27:14,371 --> 02:27:16,870
in biological families.
There's not even any comparison.

2844
02:27:17,980 --> 02:27:19,900
So anyways.
