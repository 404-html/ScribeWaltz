1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,330
Yeah,

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,480
so last week I told you I offered you an
interpretation of foundational stories,

3
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:23,610
right?
More than two,

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,620
but roughly speaking to,
um,

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,200
the creation stories because there's two
of them in genesis and then also the 

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,311
story of the Buddha and I was presenting
you with a proposition and it's a multi 

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
layered proposition.
The proposition is that the archetypal 

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,760
story structure that we've already been 
discussing is reflected in detail in 

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,711
those stories and the archetypal story 
structure is something like the 

10
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:58,551
existence of a preexisting state where 
things are roughly functional so that 

11
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:03,681
you might think of that as the state of 
things going well and that's the state 

12
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:08,121
where your perceptions and your plans 
are sufficiently developed so that when 

13
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,260
you act them out in the world,
not only do you get what you desire,

14
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,950
but the story itself validates itself 
through your actions.

15
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:24,051
Right?
Because what happens when you act 

16
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:24,051
something out and you get what you 
intend.

17
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,220
Just like when you use a map and get 
where you're going.

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,530
Not only does that get you to where 
you're going,

19
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:30,720
but it also validates the plan or the 
map.

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,300
And so that's,
that's,

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,960
that's a definition of truth.
That's a pragmatic definition of truth.

22
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:41,961
This is the sort of thing that I was 
trying to have a discussion with about 

23
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:45,080
Sam Harris,
because the idea is that we have to 

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,980
orient ourselves in a world where our 
knowledge has always insufficient.

25
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,100
We never know everything about anything.
And so the question then is how can you 

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,791
ever make a judgment about whether or 
not you're correct and the answer to 

27
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:55,791
that is something like,
well,

28
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,620
you lay out a plan and you can think 
about it this way.

29
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,850
If this is actually an answer to the 
postmodernist problem of how is it that 

30
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,020
you determined whether or not your 
interpretation of the world is.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,420
We won't say correct because that's not 
exactly right,

32
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:14,421
but no,
the postmodernists subject say with 

33
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:16,791
regards to the interpretation of a text 
that there's a very large number of 

34
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:20,361
variations of ways in which that texts 
can be interpreted and that's actually 

35
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:21,600
true and need.
It's the same.

36
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,730
It's actually a reflection of a deeper 
claim,

37
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,730
which they always often sometimes also 
make.

38
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:27,690
Which is,
well,

39
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,290
if that's true for a text which isn't as
complex as everything,

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,470
although it's complex,
then it's even more true for everything,

41
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,450
which is to say the world lays itself 
out in a very complex manner and you can

42
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,030
interpret that in a very large number of
ways.

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,940
So who's to say which interpretation is 
correct?

44
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,100
Okay,
fair enough.

45
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,730
Which a reasonable objection and it's,
it's tied in with even a deeper problem,

46
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:55,731
which is the problem of perception 
itself because if the world is laid out 

47
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:57,870
in a manner that's exceptionally 
complex,

48
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,980
then how is it that you can even

49
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,180
perceive it?
Well,

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,220
that's,
that's partly the question that we're 

51
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,051
trying to answer and the answer to that 
is what you have evolved perceptual 

52
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:14,041
structures and they're actually oriented
towards specific goals and your 

53
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:14,590
embodied.
So the,

54
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,620
your embodiment as a goal directed 
entity is part of the solution to the 

55
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,200
problem of perception.
But it's more complicated than that.

56
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,130
So we could say,
well,

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,350
you come equipped and this was constant 
objection to pure reason essentially,

58
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,340
um,
that the,

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,760
the,
the problem is,

60
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:36,160
is the facts don't speak for themselves.
There's too many facts for them to speak

61
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:41,161
for themselves,
so you have to overlay on top of them 

62
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:41,161
and interpretive framework.
Well,

63
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:41,710
where does the interpretive framework 
come from?

64
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Well,
the right answer to that is something 

65
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:46,920
like it evolves,
right?

66
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,130
It's taken three and a half billion 
years for your perceptual structure.

67
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,550
You're a body perceptual structure to 
evolve and it's done that.

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I roughly in a trial and error process.
I don't think that exhausts what's 

69
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,140
happened over the course of evolution,
but it's a good enough shorthand for the

70
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:04,141
time being so,
so there's the constraints imposed on 

71
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,760
your perceptual structures by the 
necessity of survival and reproduction,

72
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,830
but there's other constraints imposed to
that.

73
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,010
You might regard to subsets of that.
One is that because you exist in a 

74
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,890
cooperative and competitive landscape,
the perceptual structures and plans that

75
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,920
you lay out,
we'll say the maps that you lay out have

76
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,210
to be negotiated with other people and 
so that put stringent constraints on the

77
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:28,030
number of interpretations that you're 
allowed to apply.

78
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,550
So you can think about this in a pig and
sense.

79
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,870
That is if there are children in a 
playground and they're trying to 

80
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,971
organize themselves to play,
they have to agree on a game and the 

81
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:42,811
game is of course a perceptual structure
and a goal directed structure and a 

82
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:47,041
structure that delimits action and 
interactions and so they at least have 

83
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:51,751
to settle on a game and so that 
constrains the set of possible actions 

84
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,651
and perceptions in the environment to 
those that are deemed socially 

85
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:55,651
acceptable.

86
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:56,020
And then you say,
well,

87
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:58,570
what are there further constraints?
And the constraints might be,

88
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:03,571
well,
let's play the game and see if it's any 

89
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:04,210
fun.
And that means that you have to take the

90
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:09,211
plan that you've organized consensually 
and then lay it out in the actual world 

91
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:10,020
and see if when you lay it out in the 
world,

92
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,220
it does what it's supposed to do.
In some sense,

93
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:17,221
what you're doing is testing a tool.
So the idea that the range of 

94
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:22,170
interpretations is infinite and 
unconstrained turns out to be incorrect 

95
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,500
and now it's that.
That is.

96
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,650
That doesn't mean it's easy to figure 
out how they're constrained,

97
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,160
but the technical suggested that,
well,

98
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:35,161
there's an infinite number of equally 
valid interpretations is just not 

99
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:36,010
correct.
It's not correct and it's not correct on

100
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,890
biological evolutionary grounds and it's
not.

101
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,310
It's also not correct on sociocultural 
grounds because it has to be negotiated 

102
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,331
and then you know,
piaget put a further constraint on that 

103
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:48,331
essentially by saying,
well,

104
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:52,630
not only does it have to be a game and a
game that attains its hands,

105
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,210
but it has to be a game that people want
to play.

106
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,420
So it also has to satisfy some element 
of subjective desire as well.

107
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,260
So that's three levels of constraint,
right?

108
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,440
It has to be a game you want to play.
It has to be a game that you can play 

109
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,950
with other people and it has to be a 
game that if you play with other people,

110
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,230
actually works in the world.
Okay,

111
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:15,350
well so much for an infinite array of,
of options.

112
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,540
It's a very constrained array of 
options.

113
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,150
Now,
and I think that the idea that I've been

114
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:25,151
proposing to you is that what evolved 
mythology does these representations 

115
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,970
that we've been dealing with these 
archetypal representations is sketch out

116
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,200
that landscape.
What is the landscape of playable games?

117
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:35,820
That's a good way of thinking about it 
and so it's.

118
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,830
It sets out a landscape.
It sends out a description of the 

119
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,351
landscape in which the game is going to 
be played as well as a description of 

120
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:47,120
the lens of of the game itself,
and so the landscape is roughly that.

121
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,950
The core,
the core archetype seems to be something

122
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:56,951
like it's it's.
It's something like the interplay 

123
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:00,731
between chaos and order and chaos is 
represented by the Serpentine Predator 

124
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,670
because we use our Predator detection 
circuits to conceptualize the unknown 

125
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,351
because what else would we do it that,
that that seems,

126
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,650
given that we're prey animals and given 
our evolutionary history,

127
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,430
it's very difficult to understand what 
else we could possibly do because the 

128
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,410
critical issue about venturing into the 
unknown is that you might die or perhaps

129
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,870
a slight variant of that is something 
might kill you,

130
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,340
but whatever.
Those are close enough.

131
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:33,341
To the same thing,
so chaos is what causes your 

132
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:34,850
deterioration and death and there's lots
of ways to conceptualize that,

133
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:39,851
but but a reptilian Predator 
fire-breathing reptilian Predator isn't 

134
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:41,690
a bad way to start.
And so the question is,

135
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,970
well,
what do you do in the face of that?

136
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,970
And one answer is you build 
circumscribed enclosures that's order 

137
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,330
and then also you act as the builder of 
circumscribed enclosure.

138
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,520
So that's partly the hero.
Now the hero is also though that's not 

139
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,030
good enough because the circumscribed 
enclosure isn't impermeable.

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,120
It can be invaded,
it will inevitably be invaded either 

141
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,770
from outside or from within.
Right?

142
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,210
And so we've been conceptualizing the 
Predator,

143
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:16,211
the malevolent Predator at multiple 
levels of analysis throughout our 

144
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:17,720
evolutionary history say,
but also in our symbolic history,

145
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,980
trying to understand the nature of that 
which invades the enclosure,

146
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,180
right?
And we can say,

147
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:24,770
well,
it's partly external threat,

148
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,100
it's partly social threat,
but it's also partly the threat that 

149
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,180
each individual brings to bear on the 
social structure because of our,

150
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,260
let's say our intrinsic malevolence.
And so that would be the snakes within.

151
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,070
And so that accounts for the analogy 
that the Christian analogy between the 

152
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,790
serpent in the garden of Eden and Satan,
which is a very,

153
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,380
very strange analogy.

154
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,380
It's not obvious at all why those two 
things would stack on top of one 

155
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,501
another,
especially given that when the creation 

156
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,621
story originally emerged in,
in the forum I talked to you about last 

157
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:57,000
week,
the story of Adam and Eve,

158
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,330
the idea that the serpent in the garden 
was also something that was associated 

159
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,261
with the adversary,
wasn't an implicit part of the story 

160
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:06,420
that God laid on afterwards.
Like,

161
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,490
well,
what's the worst possible snake?

162
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,560
Well,
that's a reasonable question.

163
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,310
And then a better question is what do 
you do about the worst possible snake?

164
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,670
And one answer is you face it,
but there's other answers to like you 

165
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,980
make sacrifices,
right?

166
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,850
And that's how you stave off the dragon 
of temporal chaos.

167
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:28,851
Roughly speaking,
is that you learn to conceptualize the 

168
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:32,001
future.
You see the future as a realm of 

169
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:34,371
potential threat,
and then you learn to give things up in 

170
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:35,280
the present and somehow that satisfies 
the future.

171
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,670
Now,
so maybe you're offering sacrifices to 

172
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:40,670
God and you think,
well,

173
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,121
why does that will take?
You've got to think about that 

174
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:44,121
psychologically.
Why does that work?

175
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,680
Well,
you could think about the spirit of God,

176
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:51,681
the father as an image istick 
representation of the collective spirit 

177
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:57,591
of the group.
We'll call it the patriarchy if you 

178
00:09:57,591 --> 00:09:57,591
want.
It doesn't matter.

179
00:09:57,591 --> 00:10:00,150
It's the thing that's common across the 
group as a spirit,

180
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,590
as a psychological force across time.
Why do you make sacrifices to that?

181
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,920
That is what you do all the time.
You're right now.

182
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:12,921
You're sacrificing your time to the 
spirit of the great father because your 

183
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:16,461
assumption is is that if you do what's 
diligent so you're not chasing impulsive

184
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:22,371
pleasure at the moment,
unless you're pathologically interested 

185
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,550
in this class or something like that,
you're not chasing impulsive interest.

186
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,480
You're sacrificing your impulsive 
interest to satisfy the spirit of social

187
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:32,481
requirement and so you're offering a 
sacrifice to that spirit in the hope 

188
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:36,921
that you can make a bargain with it so 
that it will reward you in the future 

189
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:39,690
and that reward will be part of partly 
the staving off of insecurity,

190
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,930
which is no more than to say that part 
of the reason that you're getting your 

191
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,681
degree is because you believe that it 
will aid you in finding employment and 

192
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,840
status and all the other things that 
will stave off the dragon of chaos.

193
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,260
So now those things were as as we've 
been at pains to point out is those 

194
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:03,651
things were acted out and then 
represented an image and story long 

195
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:07,071
before they could be fully articulated 
because we're building our knowledge of 

196
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:10,710
ourselves and also our social structures
and also the world from the bottom up as

197
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:15,711
well as from the top down.
There's an interplay between the two 

198
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:15,711
levels of analysis.
Okay.

199
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:18,120
And so,
so that's partly,

200
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,660
that's partly the archetipal 
underpinning and then with regards to 

201
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,390
the stories themselves,
you're,

202
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,920
you're in a map,
so to speak.

203
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:30,600
You're using a map and with any luck 
it's detailed enough so that you can use

204
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:34,200
it to get to the place that you want to 
go and sometimes you don't,

205
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:37,720
and that means that you have to 
recalibrate your,

206
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,810
your journey along the map,
which by the way is exactly what gps 

207
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,460
systems do when you go off the pathway,
right?

208
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,760
They stop.
That's an anxiety response from the GPS 

209
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:49,760
system.
They stop,

210
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,920
they recalibrate,
and they readjust the map now and then 

211
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,960
if you're unfortunate,
this very rarely happens anymore.

212
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,080
You'll be on a road that isn't mapped 
and then the GPS system doesn't know 

213
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
what to do.
While that happens in real life too,

214
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:07,321
I mean those are.
I'm using gps for a very specific 

215
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:09,601
reason.
Those are intelligent systems as far as 

216
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:11,881
I'm concerned.
Those are the closest things we ever 

217
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:12,040
designed to intelligence systems because
they can actually orient,

218
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,370
right,
they oriented in real time and they're 

219
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:17,370
unbelievably sophisticated systems,
right?

220
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,720
Because they required a huge satellite 
network and and so on,

221
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,060
and they're cybernetic systems.
Technically speaking,

222
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,430
they,
they respond very much like the way that

223
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,040
we respond.
So,

224
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,350
so anyways,
you know you're in,

225
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,380
you inhabit a map,
you try to adjust the resolution of the 

226
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,581
map so that it's more complex than it 
needs to be to get you from point a to 

227
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:38,581
point b.

228
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:41,620
that's it.
You want minimal resolution because that

229
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:45,100
enables efficient cognitive processing.
It doesn't overload you too much.

230
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,970
Like when I'm looking at this room,
if I look,

231
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,280
say I want to walk down this pathway,
basically what my mind does,

232
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,260
my perceptual field,
and you can detect this,

233
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,170
if I look straight ahead,
I could barely see you.

234
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:57,790
People on the periphery,
you're more like,

235
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,590
you're kind of like blurs you too.
I can tell that you have heads,

236
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,300
but that's about it.
When you move,

237
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:07,210
I can see your hand,
I can probably see your eyes,

238
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:12,211
but barely.
So you're all very low resolution and 

239
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:12,580
even though I can't detect it at the 
very periphery of my vision,

240
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:17,581
you guys are black and white.
So my color vision disappears at the 

241
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:18,220
periphery even though I can,
I can't actually perceived that.

242
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,160
So what happens is if I want to walk 
down here,

243
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,500
this pathway becomes high resolution.

244
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,650
It becomes marked with positive emotion.
All of this turns into low resolution 

245
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,850
back here.
It's not even represented and then I 

246
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:32,850
find out,
well,

247
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,031
am I doing this properly?
And the answer is while I walk forward 

248
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:39,190
and if I get to the goal,
then I've done it properly enough and if

249
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,440
one of you stand up and get in my way,
then I'm going to focus on you and 

250
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,580
assume instantly that I haven't mapped 
you properly,

251
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,440
right?
I,

252
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,610
I put you in the category of irrelevant 
entity when in fact you have to be in 

253
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:56,701
the category of strange object,
the thing that object and so well.

254
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,340
So then we inhabit those structures all 
the time.

255
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,500
We're in a structure like that,
a perceptual structure,

256
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,890
and if it's working,
then it's got the archetipal quality of 

257
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,740
paradise,
so to speak,

258
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:13,741
because it's axioms are correct and it's
functional and then now and then 

259
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,070
something comes along and that's what 
the snake is.

260
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,100
The eternal snake in the garden that 
pops up inside a structure and it turns 

261
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,541
out that the things that you weren't 
attending to are the most important 

262
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,970
things rather than the least important 
things and that what does that do?

263
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,360
It blows the map into pieces and that 
can happen at different levels of 

264
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,610
severity,
but at the ultimate level of severity,

265
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,770
it's apocalyptic,
right?

266
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Everything goes and that's a.
that's a traumatic intrusion and 

267
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,001
essentially the story of the Garden of 
Eden is the story of a traumatic 

268
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:49,090
intrusion.
That's exactly what it is,

269
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:53,120
and so what happens is that Adam Eve are
living in unconscious blasts,

270
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:55,220
roughly speaking,
everything's fine.

271
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:58,010
They're in their walled garden,
there in a paradise will state.

272
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,890
They're not aware of their own 
vulnerability or nakedness,

273
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:01,690
so they they,
they,

274
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,770
they're not suffering from negative 
emotion.

275
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,220
Something pops up that radically expands
their vision and all of a sudden now 

276
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,710
they can apprehend all sorts of things 
that exist as threats,

277
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,920
so that's their own nakedness and 
vulnerability and temporality itself 

278
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,731
because they become aware of the future 
and bang that state of being in that 

279
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,990
paradise is forever gone.

280
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,400
That's the strange thing about human 
beings is this is what happened to us,

281
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:33,401
I think,
is that our perceptions developed to 

282
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:36,431
such a degree that we could no longer 
ignore what was irrelevant.

283
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,580
We couldn't do it because we discovered 
roughly speaking,

284
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,510
once we discovered our finite 
limitations in time and space,

285
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,620
we discovered that we were surrounded by
infinite threat always,

286
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,370
and maybe that's why people are so hyper
awake because threat wakes you up while 

287
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,140
we're in a constant state of existential
threat.

288
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,020
Now the advantage to that is that we 
take,

289
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,580
we take arms up against a sea of 
troubles constantly.

290
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,140
That's the advantage,
right?

291
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,100
And We build enclosures and we take 
precautions for the future and we live a

292
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:15,101
very long time and we generally live 
quite safe lives compared to the lives 

293
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:18,140
we could live.
And so we've traded pain for anxiety.

294
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,610
That's another way of thinking about it.

295
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,280
Now.
It's still a pretty rough trade,

296
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,670
right?
Because who wants to be nervous all the 

297
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,801
time,
but you're alive and awake when you're 

298
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:32,081
nervous and it is a form of 
consciousness elevating activation.

299
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,450
That's another way of thinking about it.
So the story of Adam and Eve is the 

300
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,850
story of the eternal fall that that's 
what it is.

301
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,710
It says,
look,

302
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,980
you exist in these walled enclosures,
but there's something that lurks that 

303
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,840
will always knock you off your feet.
And then the question is what is that?

304
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,870
And the answer to that is being 
formulated over very long periods of 

305
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,380
time.
Partly it's the probability of predation

306
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,790
itself.
That's the snake,

307
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,790
the thing that can come in subtly and 
undermine you.

308
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,260
Okay,
but then that's,

309
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,680
that's what would you call it,
expanded upward to include the abstract 

310
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:13,481
snake,
which is that thing that can undermine 

311
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:13,481
your conceptual schemes.

312
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:17,230
So you have your actual territory and 
then you have your abstract to our 

313
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,260
territory and in your actual territory 
there are actual snakes and in your 

314
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,130
abstract territory there are abstract 
snakes,

315
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:27,310
right?
And then the worst snake of all his 

316
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,310
malevolence.
And that's.

317
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,670
I think that's technically correct 
because one of the things that you view,

318
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:36,671
for example,
when you're looking at posttraumatic 

319
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:36,920
stress disorder,
is that it's almost always the case that

320
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,500
someone who suffers from post traumatic 
stress disorder,

321
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:44,501
which you might think of as a real real 
life re incarnation of the fall,

322
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,560
is that people encounter something 
malevolent and it breaks them because 

323
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,670
it's the worst thing to understand.
It's like suffering is one thing,

324
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:54,250
man,
that's,

325
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:59,251
that's bad enough.
Vulnerability and suffering that's bad 

326
00:17:59,251 --> 00:17:59,970
enough,
but to encounter someone who wishes that

327
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:02,070
upon you and will work to bring it 
about.

328
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,320
That's a whole different category of 
horrible,

329
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,150
especially when it also reflect 
something back to you about yourself.

330
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,050
Because if someone else can do that to 
you and they are human,

331
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,110
that means that you partake of the same 
essence.

332
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,350
Strangely enough.
That's actually the cure to some degree 

333
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,740
to posttraumatic stress disorder is like
if you've been victimized,

334
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:27,741
you're naive and you've been victimized.
The way out of that is to no longer be 

335
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:31,401
naive and to no longer be victimized,
and that means that you see this 

336
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,030
reflected in the Harry Potter idea.
For example,

337
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:38,031
that the reason that Harry Potter can 
withstand voldemort is because he's got 

338
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:40,920
a piece of a is being touched by it and 
the way that you.

339
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,340
The way that you keep the psychopaths at
bay is to develop the inner psychopaths 

340
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,690
so that you know when,
when you see what right and then,

341
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:50,330
but that's a voluntary thing.
It's,

342
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:50,910
it's,
it's so.

343
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:52,340
It's like a.
it's like a,

344
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
a set of tools that you have at your 
disposal which has full knowledge of 

345
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:57,510
evil and that does.

346
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,210
Nisha said if you look into an abyss for
too long,

347
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,790
you risk having the abyss gaze back into
you.

348
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Right?
The idea is that if you look at 

349
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,651
something monstrous,
you have a tendency to turn into a 

350
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,160
monster and people are often very afraid
of looking at monsters.

351
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:14,130
Things exactly for that reason,
and then the question is,

352
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:15,660
well,
should you turn into a monster?

353
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:18,090
And the answer to that is yes,
you should,

354
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,870
but you should do it voluntarily and not
accidentally,

355
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,020
and you should do it with good in mind 
rather than falling prey to it by 

356
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,860
possession essentially.
Because that's the alternative.

357
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,200
And how does it possess you?
That's easy.

358
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,250
You're suffering makes you better,
your bitterness makes you resentful,

359
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,860
you're resentful,
means meat,

360
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:40,650
makes you vengeful.
And once you're on that road,

361
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:42,450
you go down that a little bit farther,
man.

362
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:49,010
Well you end up fantasizing in your 
basement about shooting up the local 

363
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,530
high school and then killing yourself,
right?

364
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,530
Because that's sort of the ultimate end 
of that line of pathological reasoning 

365
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,400
being should be eradicated because of 
its intrinsic evil and I'm exactly the 

366
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,721
person to do it and I'll cap it off with
an indication of my own lack of worth 

367
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:04,140
just to hammer the point home.
Right?

368
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:08,340
And if I can garner a little post post 
you fame along the way,

369
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,670
well that'll satisfy my primordial 
primate dominance hierarchy,

370
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,390
a imaginings to at least in fantasy.
So you know,

371
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:18,090
it's the full package.
If you want to go down that route and of

372
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:23,091
course people don't like to think about 
that sort of thing and it's no bloody 

373
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,330
wonder.
But without the capability for mayhem,

374
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:25,160
Europe,
you're,

375
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:28,000
you're a,
you're a potential victim to mayhem.

376
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,810
So you need your sword.
It should be sheath,

377
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,930
but you need to have it and it's very 
frequently the case.

378
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,630
If you treat someone with posttraumatic 
stress disorder,

379
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,020
there's two things you have to do.
You have to help them develop a very 

380
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,920
articulated philosophy of evil because 
otherwise their brain bothers him over 

381
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:47,300
and over and over.
Why?

382
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,860
Why were you so deal with naive?
How did you become victimized?

383
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,620
Why were you such as soccer?
These are good questions.

384
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,210
You don't want to have that happen to 
you again.

385
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,490
You don't want to be exploited twice.
Okay,

386
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:02,491
so your eyes have to open up.
We know the price of that from the 

387
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:02,491
Egyptian myth,
right?

388
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:04,870
You come into contact with seth.
What happens?

389
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:06,340
Even if you're a god,
you lose it.

390
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:07,870
I.
It's no joke,

391
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,370
man.
It's no joke,

392
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:14,371
and then the cure for that is the 
movement down into the underworld and 

393
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:16,810
the revitalization of the father.
That's the identification with the force

394
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:18,190
that created culture,
right?

395
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,800
And that then there's you and that 
together.

396
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Then you can withstand malevolence.
Maybe you could withstand tragedy and 

397
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,950
malevolence and then that's the whole 
secret,

398
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,540
right?
Because that's what you want in life,

399
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,870
you need to be able to withstand tragedy
and you need to be able to withstand 

400
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,420
malevolence because those are the 
forces.

401
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,680
They're always working against you,
and so it's.

402
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,810
This is associated with the union idea 
of incorporation of the shadow,

403
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,220
right?
You have to be.

404
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,640
We know this God,
we know how predators work with regards 

405
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,290
to children.
Even if you're a pedophilic Predator and

406
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,590
you're looking at a landscape of 
children,

407
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,950
the child that you're going to go after 
is the one that's timid and won't fight 

408
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,911
back.
You've picked your victim and predatory 

409
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:04,900
people in general are exactly like that 
man there because they're predators.

410
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,290
They're not going to attack someone 
who's who's going to fight back.

411
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,770
In fact,
the issue is likely not to even come up.

412
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,160
They're going to be looking for someone 
one way or another that cannot 

413
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,930
conceptualize what they are and then 
perfect.

414
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:25,010
It's open season and it's open season,
and so if you're treating someone with 

415
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,131
posttraumatic stress disorder,
first they need an introduction to the 

416
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:32,731
philosophy of malevolence and second,
they have to learn to become dangerous 

417
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:35,020
because that's the only way out.
What's the alternative?

418
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,300
To get these recurrent thoughts about 
their vulnerability in the face of 

419
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,900
malevolence and their own naivety 
because by definition,

420
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:46,390
if someone's psychopathic has exploited 
you,

421
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:47,990
you're too naive.
It's.

422
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,200
It's a definitional issue.
You can say,

423
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,430
well,
that's no fault of mine.

424
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,830
How the hell could I be prepared?
Fair enough,

425
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:58,831
man.
Perfectly reasonable objection doesn't 

426
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:00,340
solve your problem because it's an.
It's an eternal problem,

427
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:05,341
right?
The internal problem is how do you deal 

428
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:05,341
with tragedy and malevolence and you can
say,

429
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:05,740
well,
I'm not prepared.

430
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,970
It's like,
yeah,

431
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,490
fair enough.
Unsurprising.

432
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,650
Especially if you were over protected as
a child.

433
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,100
It's not a good idea to overprotect your
kids because the snakes are going to 

434
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,830
come into the garden no matter what you 
do,

435
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,310
and so then you,
instead of trying to keep the damn 

436
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:23,740
snakes away,
what you do is you are a mere child with

437
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:28,741
something that can help them chop them 
into pieces and make the world out of 

438
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,131
them so that the trick for human 
thriving in the face of suffering and 

439
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,720
malevolence is strength,
not protection.

440
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,380
It's a completely different idea.
We also know this clinically.

441
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,530
We know for example,
that if you treat people with exposure 

442
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,980
therapy for agora phobia,
which is roughly speaking,

443
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,450
the fear of chaos,
I would say the fear of everything.

444
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,720
You don't make them less afraid.
You make them braver.

445
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,870
It's not the same thing because with an 
agoraphobic,

446
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:58,871
see what happens to them is is the fault
they never conceptualized death and 

447
00:23:58,881 --> 00:23:59,360
suffering.

448
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,860
They're naive,
right?

449
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,070
It never enters their theater of their 
imagination and it's because they're 

450
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,500
protected from it,
but then something happens.

451
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:11,501
This,
this often happens to women in their 

452
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:13,211
forties because they're.
They're the people most likely to 

453
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:14,070
develop egret phobia.
Something happens there,

454
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,420
they've been protected from chaos by 
authority their entire life,

455
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:22,421
so maybe they had an overprotective 
father and then they went to an 

456
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:25,660
overprotective boyfriend and then they 
went to an over protective husband and 

457
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,501
maybe they were willing to be subjugated
to all three of those because of the 

458
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:29,690
project protection,
right,

459
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:34,930
so so that's the bargain.
They stay weak and dependent and maybe 

460
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,161
they have to because that's the only way
they can appeal to the person who's 

461
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:42,461
hyper protective,
but the price they pay for that is that 

462
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,490
they're not sufficiently competent and 
then something happens in their life.

463
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,520
Often in their forties,
they develop heart palpitations.

464
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Maybe as a consequence of menopause.
Their heart starts to beat a radically 

465
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:52,280
and they think,
oh,

466
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,030
no,
death.

467
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,690
It's like,
well,

468
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:55,850
who are you going to talk to about that?
Right?

469
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:58,640
There's no protection from authority for
that,

470
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,880
or maybe their friend gets divorced or 
maybe their sister dies or something 

471
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,211
like that.
It brings up the specter of mortality 

472
00:25:07,211 --> 00:25:09,940
and maybe the specter of malevolence and
mortality and it brings it up in a way 

473
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,170
that authority recourse to authority 
cannot solve,

474
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,990
and so then they have panic attacks.
What happens?

475
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,100
They go out,
they get afraid,

476
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:21,101
they feel their heart beating.
Then they get afraid of their heart 

477
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:21,101
beating because they think,
oh no,

478
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:21,620
I'm going to die,
and they think,

479
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,870
oh no,
I'm going to die and I'm going to make a

480
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:26,930
fool of myself while I'm doing it and 
attract a lot of attention.

481
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,070
So the two big fears come up,
mortality and social judgment,

482
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,690
and then they have a panic attack.

483
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,730
It's like fight or flights going out of 
control.

484
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,320
Very,
very unpleasant.

485
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,290
Then they start to avoid the places 
they've had a panic attack.

486
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,540
Then they end up not being able to go 
anywhere.

487
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,970
So then tie A.
Matt has come back,

488
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:46,760
write a huge monster,
a little victim,

489
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,050
and so what do you do with them?
Well,

490
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,190
there no saying no.
There's no tire map that's done right 

491
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,760
there.
Naivety is over.

492
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,320
They've had a direct contact with the 
threat of mortality and social judgment.

493
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:05,530
They've met the terrible mother and 
they've met the terrible father and 

494
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,230
there's no going back.
There's no saying,

495
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,640
oh,
the world is safe.

496
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,590
It's not safe.
Not at all.

497
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,250
It's not safe.
The fact that you think it's safe means 

498
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,431
that you were living in an unconscious 
bubble that was sort of provided to you 

499
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:22,450
by your culture.
It's a gift and now that's been 

500
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,270
shattered and so now what do you do?

501
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,870
Well,
the answer is you retreat until you're 

502
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,870
in your house and there's nowhere you 
can go.

503
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,600
You're the ultimate frozen rabbit,
right?

504
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,150
And your life is hell because you can't 
function.

505
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,440
The alternative is let's take apart the 
things you're afraid of.

506
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,330
Let's expose you to them carefully and 
programmatically,

507
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,320
and then you'll learn that you can.
You're actually tougher than you think.

508
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,830
You never knew that and maybe you didn't
want to take on the responsibility 

509
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,610
because you know people play a role in 
their own demise,

510
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:58,611
so to speak.
When you had opportunity to go out and 

511
00:26:58,611 --> 00:26:59,370
explore or withdraw because you were 
afraid,

512
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:01,650
you chose to withdraw because you were 
afraid.

513
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,870
So it's not only that you were over 
protected.

514
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:08,871
Often it's that you were willing to take
advantage of the fact that you are 

515
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:11,160
overprotected and run back there 
whenever you had the opportunity,

516
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,710
you know,
so maybe you're a kid in the playground,

517
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:13,890
right?

518
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,350
And you're having some trouble with 
other kids and you know,

519
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:21,351
in the back of your mind,
I should deal with deal with this 

520
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:21,351
myself,
but you go and tell your mom and get her

521
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:23,760
to intervene and you know that that's 
not right.

522
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,860
You know that you're breaking the social
contract,

523
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,320
but it's easier.
And so that's what you do.

524
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,220
You run off to an authority figure and 
hide behind the great father,

525
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,630
right?
Roughly speaking,

526
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,540
while the problem with that is you don't
learn how to do it yourself.

527
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,420
So then you have to relearn it painfully
when you're 40.

528
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,720
So then you take people out,
you say,

529
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:44,310
well,
what are you afraid of?

530
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,050
Rank it from one to 10.
So 10 is make a list of 10 things.

531
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:51,540
You're afraid of the least.
The thing that we're least afraid of.

532
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,150
We'll call number 10.
So we'll start with that.

533
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:54,960
Okay,
well,

534
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:56,370
I'm afraid of elevators.
Okay,

535
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:58,530
well let's,
let's look at a picture of an elevator.

536
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,800
Let's have you imagine being in an 
elevator.

537
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:06,801
Let's go out to an elevator and let you 
watch the terrible jaws of death open 

538
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:08,910
because that's how you're responding to 
it symbolically,

539
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,100
right,
and you're going to do that at it.

540
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,170
At the closest proximity you can manage.
You find out,

541
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:17,640
you go do that.
It works.

542
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:23,090
You're nervous as hell,
especially from an anticipatory 

543
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,090
perspective,
shaking.

544
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,030
You go out,
you stop,

545
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,580
you watch it happen,
and he actually calmed down.

546
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:28,650
You do that 10 times and it no longer 
bothers you.

547
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,140
Well,
what you've learned that you didn't die,

548
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:36,141
but more importantly than that,
you've learned that you could withstand 

549
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:40,581
the threat of death.
That's what you've learned and then you 

550
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:41,190
move a little closer and then you move a
little closer and then you move a little

551
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,750
closer and finally you're back in.

552
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,020
What's no longer the elevator from a 
symbolic perspective.

553
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:47,040
It's a tomb,
right?

554
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:47,670
It's,
it's,

555
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,750
it's a place of enclosure and isolation 
and you learn,

556
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,330
hmm,
turns out I can withstand that,

557
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,590
and then you're much more together,
much more confident,

558
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,340
and that's often one of the things that 
often happens in situations like that.

559
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:07,341
I've seen this multiple times,
is that if you run someone through an 

560
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:10,020
exposure training process like that and 
toughen them up,

561
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:15,350
they'll often start standing up to 
people around them in a way they never 

562
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,441
did before because they wouldn't stand 
up for themselves before because they 

563
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:20,250
weren't willing to undermine the 
protection.

564
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,380
See,
if you're protecting me,

565
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,740
I can't bother you because I can't 
afford to forsake your protection,

566
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,130
so if I'm going to play that game,
I'm going to be high hide behind you,

567
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,460
then I can't challenge you.
So that's no good because that's 

568
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:37,530
sometimes why people.

569
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,560
You see this with guys very frequently.
They're still deathly afraid of their 

570
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,080
fathers judgment when they're in their 
thirties or forties.

571
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,980
It's like,
well,

572
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:49,981
why not?
Because they still want to believe that 

573
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:52,681
there's someone out there that knows,
and so they're willing to accept the 

574
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:53,950
subjugation because it doesn't force 
them to challenge.

575
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:58,951
The idea that there's someone out there 
that knows because that's the advantage 

576
00:29:58,951 --> 00:29:59,110
of having your father as a judge,
right?

577
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,330
Because he knows,
well,

578
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:06,331
what if he doesn't?
What if no one knows any better than 

579
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:06,331
you?
Well,

580
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:10,231
that's a rough thing.
You don't until you realize that you're 

581
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:10,231
not an adult,
right?

582
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:14,490
That's really technically the point of 
realization of adulthood is that no one 

583
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,210
actually knows what you should do more 
than you do.

584
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,550
I mean,
it's a horrible realization because what

585
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:23,551
the hell do you know?
It's a terrible realization and people 

586
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:26,641
will often pick slavery,
permanent slavery to the spirit of the 

587
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:28,540
great father,
let's say over that realization and it's

588
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:33,541
completely understandable,
but the problem with it is that there's 

589
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,961
more to you than you think,
and so if you continue to hide behind 

590
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:40,351
that figure,
then you never have a chance to 

591
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:41,380
understand that there's more to you than
you think far more time than you think.

592
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,530
Maybe there's enough to you so that you 
can actually withstand the threat of 

593
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,020
mortality without collapsing.
Maybe even withstand the threat of 

594
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,170
malevolence without collapsing.
Who knows?

595
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,400
It's certainly possible,
and it's not an abstract question,

596
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:02,430
it's exactly the sort of question that 
you address in the psychotherapeutic 

597
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:07,051
process.
It's always the question that you 

598
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:09,361
address and the answer is often in the 
affirmative because people can get 

599
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:13,711
unbelievably tough and you know that 
because people work in emergency wards 

600
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:13,960
in hospitals,
right?

601
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:17,440
Or they work in,
in palliative care wards or they work as

602
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:22,441
mortuary assistance.
I mean these people have bloody rough 

603
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:22,441
jobs,
you know,

604
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:24,460
are there on the front line of police 
investigation into,

605
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:29,590
you know,
highness child abuse crimes and so 

606
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,410
they're confronting malevolence on a 
regular basis and you know,

607
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,460
those are very stressful jobs,
but people do them and some people do 

608
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,110
them without even being damaged by them.

609
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,080
Although that's a harder thing because 
you can see horrible things,

610
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,760
you know,
things you will never forget.

611
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,340
So,
so I would say the story in the story of

612
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:53,050
Adam and Eve is a Meta story and it's a 
metta story for two reasons.

613
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:58,290
One is it's about how stories transform 
because Adam and Eve are in this 

614
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,770
unconscious paradise and then it 
collapses.

615
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,530
And that happens to every potential 
story.

616
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,660
Right,
that's niches realization.

617
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:05,290
He said,
look,

618
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,770
imagine that you live within a belief 
system and then something arises to 

619
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,341
challenge the belief system.
Not only does the belief system 

620
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:15,130
collapse,
but something worse happens.

621
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,360
Your belief in belief systems collapses,
and that's the road tonight.

622
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,780
Now it doesn't have to because you can 
jump from one belief system to another,

623
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,350
but sometimes that doesn't work is that 
you do a medic critique and you say,

624
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:31,351
oh,
I was living in this protective 

625
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:31,351
structure and it turned out to be 
flawed.

626
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:36,150
Okay?
One alternative is jumped to another 

627
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,131
protective structure.
Find another alternative is protective 

628
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:39,410
structures themselves are not to be 
trusted.

629
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,880
Bang,
you're in chaos.

630
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,560
How the hell are you going to get out of
that?

631
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,620
That's the pathway denialism.
While you can,

632
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,320
you can.
You can work your way through that.

633
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:51,320
That's difficult,
or you can do what young would regard as

634
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:56,321
a soul damaging move and you can 
sacrifice your new knowledge and re 

635
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:58,520
identify with something real rigid and 
restricted,

636
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:03,260
which is what I would say is happening 
to some degree with the people in Europe

637
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,380
who are turning to a regressive 
nationalism.

638
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,620
As an alternative to the current state 
of chaos,

639
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,340
it's like I know that that people need 
to identify with local groups.

640
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:16,160
I understand that,
but the risk,

641
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,640
the danger of making the state the 
ultimate God and that's order,

642
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,680
but that's not a good replacement for 
chaos.

643
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,900
It's just another kind of catastrophe,
right?

644
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,300
Too much order,
too much chaos,

645
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,800
both.
Catastrophes.

646
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,250
You want to stand in the middle somehow 
and mediate between the two and that's 

647
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,031
where you have your real strength 
because then it isn't that you've 

648
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:40,001
discovered a safe place because even the
bloody right wingers or after a safe 

649
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:40,580
place,
right?

650
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,160
They just want it to be the state.
Yeah,

651
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:44,270
exactly.
Well,

652
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:49,271
there's no safe places and the next 
issue is do you really want a safe 

653
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:49,930
place?
Is that what you want?

654
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,140
You want to be so weak that you want to 
be protected from threat.

655
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,470
What the hell kind of life is that?
You're a paralyzed rabbit in a hole 

656
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,330
that's no life for a human being.
You should be confronting danger and the

657
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:07,331
unknown and mlevel.
It's because and the reason for that to 

658
00:34:07,331 --> 00:34:07,610
his pit.
This is the weird paradox.

659
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,740
This is,
and I believe this is the paradox,

660
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,410
first of all,
that was discovered in part by a Buddha,

661
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:15,140
but also laid forth very clearly and 
Christianity,

662
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:20,141
which is that the p,
the solution to the problem of tragedy 

663
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:26,080
and malevolence is the willingness to 
face the who the hell would ever guessed

664
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,890
that.
It's completely paradoxical.

665
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,620
It's a completely paradoxical 
suggestion,

666
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,180
is that,
well,

667
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:35,360
why does it work well?
Because the more you confront the two of

668
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:37,820
them,
the more you grow and maybe you can grow

669
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:42,821
so that you're actually larger than the 
chaos and malevolence itself and you 

670
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:42,821
think,
well,

671
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:44,030
what's the evidence for that?
And that's easy.

672
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,450
That's what people do.
That is how we learn.

673
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:50,360
Like every time you expose your child to
something new,

674
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,520
a playground,
what are they exposed to?

675
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,060
Chaos and malevolence.
Now there's more to it than that 

676
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,000
obviously because kids play and they,
you know,

677
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:01,700
they promote each other and they form 
friendships and all of that,

678
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:06,701
but in the playground itself,
there is the complexity of the social 

679
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:08,000
structure and the malevolence of the 
bully.

680
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,600
It's right there and you throw your kid 
in there and you say adapt,

681
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,280
and they do.
Okay,

682
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:16,630
so they can do it at a small scale.
It's not trivial,

683
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:18,530
but the playground is a complicated 
place.

684
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,600
The kid can adapt.
Well,

685
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:25,810
how much can you scale that up?
Can you scale that up to from the chaos 

686
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:31,661
and order and malevolence of the 
playground to chaos in order and 

687
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:31,970
malevolence itself?
Well,

688
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,130
that's the question.
Well,

689
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,440
I don't think there's any reason to 
answer that in the negative,

690
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:43,300
so because we don't know the full extent
of a human being and it is the problem 

691
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,340
that's worked out.
So in the Buddhist story,

692
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:45,960
for example,
what happens after,

693
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,280
so Buddha's world collapses in the same 
way that Adam and Eve's world collapses,

694
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:54,480
it's a consequence of repetitive 
exposure to mortality and death.

695
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,510
What happens to Buddha as he realizes 
that the little protected city that his 

696
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:01,980
father made for him,
the walled garden,

697
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:05,520
it's exactly the same motif that's in 
this Adam and Eve story is,

698
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,640
is it's,
it's what it's.

699
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,230
It's fatally flawed.
That kind of protection cannot exist and

700
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:15,210
he discovered that in pieces,
right?

701
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:18,060
Which is exactly what happens to 
children is that they go out,

702
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,600
they discover a limit,
they run back and the parents can help 

703
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:23,600
them with the limit.
They run out,

704
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,720
they discover limit.
They run back,

705
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,900
but some at some point they run out,
they discover a limit.

706
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:32,901
They run back and the parents have 
nothing to say to them because they've 

707
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:33,680
hit the same limit that the parents hit.
Just like,

708
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,040
well,
what are you gonna do with your life?

709
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,670
How are you going to.
How are you going to operate in this 

710
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:40,670
architectural universe?
While your parents can only say,

711
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,070
well,
they can say you identify with the 

712
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,500
proper archetipal figures they do that.
They at least act that out for you,

713
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:50,910
but at some point it's a problem that 
they cannot solve for you without making

714
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:51,630
you weaker.

715
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:57,290
That's the thing you know.
So it's an interesting thing that I've 

716
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,921
learned in therapy because one of the 
things you have to learn as a therapist 

717
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:03,780
is how do you not take your client's 
problems home with you?

718
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:09,110
It's very common existential problem 
that beginning therapists face because 

719
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:14,781
they're afraid.
It's like while you're dealing with 

720
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:14,781
people all the time who have serious 
problems,

721
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:16,830
sometimes it's mental illness,
although less frequently than you think,

722
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,580
and sometimes it's just that they're 
having a good catastrophe right there.

723
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,040
Their parents have cancer or something 
like that,

724
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,020
or their father has Alzheimer's and 
they're unemployed.

725
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:30,050
They have a drug problem or they have an
schizophrenia son or like these aren't 

726
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,470
mental illness problems,
right?

727
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:36,471
Those are just catastrophes,
and so people are discussing those with 

728
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:39,891
you all the time.
How do you avoid being crushed by that 

729
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:39,891
or avoid taking it home?

730
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,910
And the answer to that is you don't 
steal the problem,

731
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,750
that that's the answer.
It's like you have some problems.

732
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,560
If you come and talk to me,
I'll help you figure out how to solve 

733
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:51,690
them.
I will not tell you how to solve.

734
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,990
I won't steal your problems because what
we're trying to do in therapy is number 

735
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,050
one,
solve your problem.

736
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:03,140
Number two,
turn you into a great solver of 

737
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,020
problems,
and the second one is way more important

738
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:07,770
than the first one,
and so you never solve someone's problem

739
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,160
by removing from them the opportunity to
solve their problem.

740
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,710
That's theft.
That's the eatables situation.

741
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,980
That's the eatables situation.
That's the over protective mother.

742
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:22,210
No father can play that role too.
We're talking about architectural 

743
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,190
representations.
It's like all protect you at the cost of

744
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:27,390
your ability to protect yourself.
No wrong.

745
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,100
That's the,
that's a sin.

746
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,730
That's a good way of thinking about it.
That is not what you do with people,

747
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,740
not with your children,
not with your partner,

748
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,210
not with yourself.
You don't do that.

749
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:42,040
That destroys people's adaptive 
competence and it and it disarms them in

750
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:45,460
the face of chaos and malevolence and 
that's a terrible,

751
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:50,620
you know,
send someone out are unarmed in a world 

752
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,130
like that,
it's a terrible thing to do so.

753
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,740
And if people aren't strong enough to 
manage it,

754
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:58,741
then they get resentful and then when 
you get the downhill spiral that goes 

755
00:38:58,741 --> 00:38:59,350
along with that.
Okay,

756
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:03,330
so the Med is story is partly you're in 
your,

757
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,460
you have a map,
but it's insufficient and things will 

758
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,520
come up to disrupt it and sometimes the 
disruption is catastrophic.

759
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,730
Everything falls apart.
That's what happens to the Buddha and 

760
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,761
that's what happens to Adam and eve and 
the rest of the biblical stories are 

761
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:18,760
actually an attempt to put that back 
together.

762
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,550
Now that that's been assembled,
as I said,

763
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:23,950
it's been assembled over centuries,
right?

764
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,480
Okay.
We've got the problem.

765
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,660
The problem is the apocalypse,
the ever present reality of the 

766
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,770
apocalyptic fall,
that's the problem,

767
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:33,970
and so you could say,
well,

768
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:38,971
what is that?
It's the insufficiency of all potential 

769
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:39,010
conceptual schemes,
right?

770
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:44,220
Your conceptual schemes are insufficient
to deal with the complexity of the 

771
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:44,220
world.
It's a permanent problem.

772
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:49,410
So what do you do?
You stop relying on your conceptual 

773
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:49,410
schemes.
That's part of the answer.

774
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,390
You start relying on your instead on 
your ability to actively generate 

775
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:59,341
conceptual schemes in the face of chaos 
and malevolence and so that makes you 

776
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:03,460
someone that identifies with your 
creative capacity,

777
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:07,570
your creative,
courageous capacity for articulation and

778
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:12,571
action in the face of the unknown rather
than some formulaic approach to the 

779
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:16,921
territory and that is not and that the 
idea is that that elevates your 

780
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:21,451
character to the point where you can 
withstand tragedy and malevolence 

781
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:24,961
without becoming corrupt and that 
provides a permanent solution to the 

782
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:24,961
problem.

783
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,220
Well then you might say,
cynically,

784
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,640
what's your evidence that that's a 
permanent solution and answer that is 

785
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,020
while the evidence isn't all in yet,
first of all,

786
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:40,021
because people only live that way 
partially and so we haven't put the 

787
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:44,341
hypothesis to the full test and second,
we don't know what our limitations are.

788
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,430
We have no idea what our limitations are
and they're.

789
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,090
They're both greater and lesser than we 
imagined because you know,

790
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:56,110
you have to ask yourself like if people 
stopped adding voluntarily to the misery

791
00:40:56,741 --> 00:41:00,430
of the world and devoted themselves to 
setting things straight,

792
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:02,920
setting themselves straight and setting 
the things around them straight,

793
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,280
what would happen and the answer to that
is,

794
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,610
well,
there'd be a hell of a lot less 

795
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,591
unnecessary misery in the world.
So that might not be a bad place to 

796
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:13,600
start.
But apart from that,

797
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:18,601
there's very little that we can say,
could we overcome the catastrophe of 

798
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:18,601
mortality?

799
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,000
Why not?
You think that's beyond our capacity?

800
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,780
Could we make the world a place where no
one was suffering anymore than necessary

801
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:28,690
and still allow the world to exist?
Well,

802
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,810
possibly because we don't know the 
limitations of our capacity.

803
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,120
We're only running it 40 percent if 
that.

804
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:38,720
I would say if we don't make full use of
all the people that are in the world,

805
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:43,721
we don't have our situation set up so 
that the gifts that they could offer to 

806
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:49,151
everyone are fully realized.
We haven't set the systems up for that 

807
00:41:49,151 --> 00:41:53,651
yet,
so we waste people like mad and then we 

808
00:41:53,651 --> 00:41:56,271
waste ourselves like mad and so I would 
say this is something also.

809
00:41:56,361 --> 00:42:01,361
That's one of the things that's really 
interesting about the Old Testament 

810
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:01,361
Jews.
This is,

811
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:05,291
I think one of the reasons that their 
book has become so central is because 

812
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:09,070
what happens in the old testament after 
the fall is that Israel produces a 

813
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,170
series of states,
right?

814
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,090
Rise of state and then a fall and then a
rise of another state and then a fall.

815
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:16,970
So it's the same thing except it's 
happening at a political level.

816
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,910
The political state rises,
it gets corrupt,

817
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
it falls,
it rises out of the ashes again,

818
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:28,060
gets corrupt and falls.
I think that happened six times in the 

819
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,851
old testament and one of the things 
that's very interesting is the reaction 

820
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:33,110
of the Jews.
They always say it was our fault.

821
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,960
Instead of taking the Cain and Abel 
route,

822
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:38,150
so we're not going to tell you that 
Kayden enabled story right away.

823
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,950
Instead of taking the Cain and Abel 
route,

824
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:42,260
they always say,
if the state collapsed,

825
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:45,770
it was because we did something wrong.
That's very different than saying,

826
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,140
you know,
it's arbitrary fate.

827
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,320
It's the nature of arbitrary fate or the
structure of reality that we're doomed 

828
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,821
to collapse into chaos and that's an 
indication of the corruption of being.

829
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,030
While you can take that route if you 
want,

830
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:04,490
it's the corruption of being well,
good luck with that.

831
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,090
So what are you going to do about that?
That's easy start.

832
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,190
You'll start to work for the destruction
of being.

833
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,070
That's what you will do.
The alternative is to say,

834
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,400
this terrible thing happened and somehow
it's my fault.

835
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,070
Well,
at least that really opens you up to the

836
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:24,071
pathway to doing something about it and 
maybe it's actually the case may be 

837
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:26,030
terrible things happen because you're 
just not who you should be.

838
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,830
At least it's a night,
you know?

839
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:29,330
That's true to some degree,
right?

840
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,420
You'd know it because things happen to 
you all the time and you think,

841
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:33,110
well,
you know,

842
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,090
if I just would've played that game 
straight,

843
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:37,670
if I were to put this thing in order,
that wouldn't have happened.

844
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,570
It's like,
okay,

845
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:41,330
fine.
What's the ultimate extent of that?

846
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:45,950
Dostoyevsky said at one point that every
human being was not only responsible for

847
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:50,951
everything that happened to him or her,
but also simultaneously responsible for 

848
00:43:50,951 --> 00:43:52,040
everything that happened to everyone 
else.

849
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,690
Now it's a very,
it's A.

850
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,720
I would say it's almost a hallucinogenic
idea,

851
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,290
right?
It's a,

852
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,500
it's a transcendent idea and it can go 
very wrong.

853
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,930
Sometimes depressed people,
for example,

854
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,100
get hyper responsible for what's 
happened and just crushes them.

855
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,390
And so it's,
it's a,

856
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,080
it's a mode of thinking that can produce
its attendant pathologies,

857
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,320
but there's something about it that's,
there's something about it that's 

858
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,830
metaphysically true.
So.

859
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:24,610
Alright,
so I'm going to tell you the story of 

860
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:24,610
Cain and Abel.
Now I really liked this story.

861
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:24,610
It's,
it's,

862
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,810
it's very short.
It's only about a paragraph long,

863
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:31,811
which is very interesting because it.
It's one of these examples where it's 

864
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:32,850
like a genie.

865
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,060
That story,
there's so much condensed into it that 

866
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,620
it's almost unbelievable and there's 
even ambiguity condensed into it,

867
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:41,580
which is,
which is very,

868
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:46,581
very interesting because it actually 
makes the story more complex and 

869
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:46,890
sophisticated.
So let me tell you the story now.

870
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,920
The first thing I want to tell you some 
things about the story first,

871
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:54,921
so we've got the original paradisical 
state and then the collapse and so now 

872
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,340
metaphysically speaking,
we're in,

873
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:01,370
we're in the collapse.
We're in when we're in the post fall 

874
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,580
condition were still occupying a 
mythological landscape,

875
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,970
right?
This isn't history as we normally 

876
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:07,970
understand it.
It's at history,

877
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:11,990
so when we talk about Cain and Abel,
Cain and Abel were actually talking 

878
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,600
about the first two real human beings 
because Adam and eve,

879
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,480
they were created by God and being we're
in paradise,

880
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,380
and so that's not the normative 
condition of human beings,

881
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:22,590
right?

882
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,390
That's a.
that's a special time.

883
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,660
That's outside of normal time and space.
Cane enabled by contrast there in 

884
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,311
history because in some sense,
history actually starts a couple of 

885
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:34,311
times in the Old Testament,
right?

886
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:39,201
It starts with the creation of being.
It starts with the formation of the 

887
00:45:39,201 --> 00:45:39,450
garden.
It starts with the fall.

888
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:42,950
It starts with Cain and Abel.
It starts over again with Noah,

889
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:47,951
and then it starts with Abraham,
which is really where what we would 

890
00:45:47,951 --> 00:45:48,570
recognize more as conventional history 
begins,

891
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,360
so there's a number of starts of 
history,

892
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:54,330
but this is one of the Cain and Abel are
the first two human beings.

893
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,730
Who are they?
They're the adversarial brothers,

894
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,570
hero and adversary there types of Christ
and Satan,

895
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,920
so well known supposition.
You see that hostile brother Motif,

896
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,720
while it's an architectural motif and 
the hostile brothers are the part of you

897
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:14,721
that's striving for the light,
that's one half and the part of you 

898
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:17,970
that's embracing the darkness,
and so that's part of you.

899
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,930
It's part of the social structure.
That's seth and Cyrus.

900
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,540
It's part of the natural order in some 
sense.

901
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:28,380
That's the benevolent and destructive 
elements of nature,

902
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:33,830
right?
You see that negativity running through 

903
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,261
all the architectural representations,
but cain and Abel are the hostile 

904
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:39,831
brothers and the Kay Kane is roughly 
that part of you that says,

905
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,780
Oh,
to hell with it and means it right,

906
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:48,050
and that means you will work for your 
own pain and destruction at the same 

907
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,530
time that you're working for the pain 
and destruction,

908
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,680
not only of your brother,
but all but more particularly of the 

909
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,830
brother that you admire because that's 
actually a lot more entertaining,

910
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:00,860
right?
If you're gonna become destructive and 

911
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,020
you go destroy something bad that hardly
qualifies as destruction.

912
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:08,190
What you want to do is find something 
great and destroyed that.

913
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,830
That's destruction,
that's revanche.

914
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,510
None of this putting punishment where it
deserves to be.

915
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,720
What you want to do,
and this is partly why the story of 

916
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:20,880
Christ is archetipal and archetipal 
stories.

917
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:24,180
When you cannot push beyond what's the 
worst possible punishment,

918
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,470
what's the worst possible punishment 
meted out for the least the least,

919
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,830
the most innocent person.
You hit an archetypical and there so you

920
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:36,080
define most innocent person.
You can do that anyway.

921
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,210
You want to find most innocent person.
Define worst possible punishment,

922
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:45,450
conjoin the two things.
You get an archetypal story and the 

923
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,120
reason for that is you can't push beyond
it,

924
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,320
and so if you want to destroy something,
you want to destroy an ideal,

925
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,590
not something that's flawed,
and so cain and Abel are set up exactly 

926
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:58,891
that way.
So I'll read you the story and I'll 

927
00:47:58,891 --> 00:47:59,410
interleave some interpretations along 
with it.

928
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,020
So,
and Adam knew eve,

929
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:07,021
his wife,
and she conceived and bore Cain and 

930
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:07,540
said,
I have gotten demand from the Lord,

931
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,890
and she again bare his brother Abel and 
Abel was a keeper of sheep,

932
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,680
but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

933
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,520
Okay,
so April's a shepherd and Cain is a 

934
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,940
farmer.
The shepherd is a archetypal symbol 

935
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,930
because the shepherd is the leader of a 
flock and the shepherd is the heroic 

936
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:31,981
leader of a flock.
And the reason this is Middle Eastern 

937
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:31,981
mythology,
let's say,

938
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:31,981
well,
if you were a shepherd,

939
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:36,930
what did you do?
You took your slingshot in your stick 

940
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:37,000
and you defended your nice,
juicy,

941
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:39,430
plump,
delicious sheep against Lions,

942
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,290
right?
So it was no joke,

943
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:41,850
man,
you,

944
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,880
you were a tough cookie if you were a 
shepherd because while you were acting 

945
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,821
as the guardian of of that,
you're acting as the Guardian against 

946
00:48:50,821 --> 00:48:51,490
predation,
roughly speaking,

947
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:53,290
and you aren't armed very well.
I mean,

948
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:55,630
well you can just think about it for a 
minute.

949
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,610
It's time to think about fighting off a 
lion with a,

950
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,630
with a slingshot or with a bow and Arrow
or with a spear.

951
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,660
I mean you have to have a lot of courage
to manage that,

952
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:09,661
especially successfully.
So Abel was a keeper of sheep and Cain 

953
00:49:09,661 --> 00:49:11,170
was a tiller of the ground,
which isn't as heroic role.

954
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,320
And so right off the bat,
you get this dichotomy between the two 

955
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,340
roles.
It's also of great interest that Cain is

956
00:49:18,341 --> 00:49:20,890
the older brother and Abel is the 
younger brother.

957
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:25,891
And you see that very frequently in 
mythology because the older brother is 

958
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:26,440
the one that's privileged by status,
right?

959
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,870
So he's got.
He's got privilege,

960
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,850
Kate,
because he's the elder brother.

961
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,880
That also means that if there are 
possessions to be handed down to 

962
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,000
generations,
the older brother gets them.

963
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,650
Now,
interestingly enough,

964
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:44,130
pain has privileged,
but he's not the one that's favored by 

965
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:46,651
God.
That and I think that's absolutely it's 

966
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:48,370
absolutely brilliant that it's set up 
that way because it's actually able.

967
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:53,610
Who doesn't have the right that the 
first board has who actually turns into 

968
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,990
the person who's the proper 
manifestation of the ideal?

969
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,030
It's because cane has things given to 
them.

970
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,650
You might think,
well that's great.

971
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:02,020
He's privileged.
What a wonderful thing for cane.

972
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:07,260
It's like,
don't be so sure about that and partly 

973
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,650
because one of the things that you'll 
find because of many of you will be well

974
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:13,651
off when you have children is one of the
problems with being reasonably wealthy 

975
00:50:13,651 --> 00:50:18,031
when you have children,
is that you deprive them of privation 

976
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:22,440
because a lot of what makes people 
mature is necessity and if you have,

977
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,690
for example,
if you have more money than you know 

978
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,551
what to do with roughly speaking,
it's very difficult to say no to your 

979
00:50:29,551 --> 00:50:32,150
children when they want something 
because why are you going to say no?

980
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,740
You can just provide it.

981
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:39,250
Well,
what makes you think that that's what 

982
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:39,250
you should do,
but you can have anything you want.

983
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:39,980
Well,
what happens?

984
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,790
You devalue what you want and your 
desires continued to grow.

985
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,800
Well,
that's not very helpful,

986
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,000
so it's not obvious at all that 
providing people with an excess,

987
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:55,030
let's say a privilege is something 
that's good for them from a 

988
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:57,971
psychological perspective.
They need to hit the proper limitations 

989
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:02,740
and if you're a fortunate,
it becomes very difficult to deprive 

990
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,480
your children properly,
so you'll,

991
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:10,540
you'll fight with that.
It's a big problem and that's what 

992
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:10,540
happens when you get spoiled children 
roughly speaking,

993
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,450
right?
They get every.

994
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,910
They get everything by doing nothing.
Well,

995
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:17,030
that's not a good lesson because that 
won't work in the world.

996
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,890
It'll work very counterproductive.
Lee,

997
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,440
and in process of time,
it came to pass that cain brought of the

998
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:27,260
fruit of the ground and offering unto 
the Lord and Abel.

999
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,560
He also brought of the firstlings of his
flock and of the fat thereof,

1000
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,500
and the Lord had respect unto Abel and 
his offering,

1001
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,740
but unto Cain and his offering,
he had no respect and Cain was very 

1002
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,000
wroth angry and his countenance fell.
Okay,

1003
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:46,001
so again,
there's a tremendous amount packed into 

1004
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:48,431
that.
This is the first time that we see the 

1005
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:48,431
motif of sacrifice.
Right?

1006
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:53,231
And so I mentioned to you before how 
these archaic people conceptualize the 

1007
00:51:53,231 --> 00:51:53,450
world,
right?

1008
00:51:53,451 --> 00:51:58,451
It's a dome with a disk of land and 
underneath that a disc of water fresh 

1009
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:01,700
and underneath that a disc of salt 
water.

1010
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:05,180
So that's the world.
And then up in the heavens,

1011
00:52:05,181 --> 00:52:07,850
that's where God is.
And so God's up in the sky.

1012
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:10,850
And we talked about why that might be 
and part of that is,

1013
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,500
well,
when you look at the night sky,

1014
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:17,770
you look at what transcends your current
reality and you look at what inspires 

1015
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:18,380
our.

1016
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,580
So there's a,
God exists where all is experienced,

1017
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:24,710
fine.
That's a perfectly reasonable.

1018
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:29,950
That's a perfectly reasonable hypothesis
when you think that what you're trying 

1019
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:30,950
to do is formulate what constitutes the 
transcendent.

1020
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,690
Because if you exist within a conceptual
structure and you encountered that which

1021
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:40,691
is outside the conceptual structure,
you will feel all and that's a 

1022
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:42,320
combination of fear paralysis,
right?

1023
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:46,700
And the combination of overwhelming 
possibility and you can experience that.

1024
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:48,920
For example,
if you listen to a great piece of music,

1025
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,860
what happens?
The hair on the back of your neck stands

1026
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:53,180
up.
Why?

1027
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,900
Because you're a prey animal and you 
just puffed up to look bigger.

1028
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:00,800
That's why you have that experience is 
pilot erection and it's part of all.

1029
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,970
So when you see a cat puff up,
because a big dog is in front of it,

1030
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,770
that's what the cats feeling.
It's like,

1031
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,780
oh my God,
puff.

1032
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,450
Right?
So when you encountered that,

1033
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:15,050
which transcends your,
your limited sphere of apprehension than

1034
00:53:15,051 --> 00:53:16,880
you experienced,
or you look at the night sky,

1035
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:18,860
that's what happened.
Music can do that.

1036
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,160
And all sorts of things that we do can 
evoke that sense.

1037
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,520
And so they located the transcendent 
value in that which inspired off fight 

1038
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,040
reasonable.
Now you can argue about the utility of 

1039
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,950
the personification,
right?

1040
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:39,951
Because God,
the father was personified in human 

1041
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:39,951
form,
but that's a very sophisticated idea too

1042
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:42,510
because as we already found in the Old 
Testament,

1043
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:47,890
there is an association between whatever
God is Yahuah or below him and and 

1044
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:54,411
creating order out of chaos and 
something about each individual human 

1045
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:57,360
being and so I don't believe that the 
personification of God,

1046
00:53:57,361 --> 00:54:01,800
the father in the Old Testament is 
archaic and primitive at all.

1047
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,920
I think it's one of the most 
sophisticated things that people ever 

1048
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:06,920
developed.

1049
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,280
The idea is that the ultimate 
transcendent value is the capacity to 

1050
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,230
generate order out of chaos using 
linguistic ability,

1051
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,260
let's say,
and that each person has that as an 

1052
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,201
essential element of their being.
It's like argue with fat far you get 

1053
00:54:21,201 --> 00:54:25,160
that is one hell of a vicious 
conceptualization and I would also say 

1054
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,940
it's the bedrock upon which our legal 
system rests so you don't move that 

1055
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:33,470
easily.
You move that and many things fall and 

1056
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:33,470
there are things that you may say you 
don't believe,

1057
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,550
but you act them out all the time.
In fact,

1058
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:38,940
if you didn't act them out,
people would set you straight very,

1059
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:42,480
very rapidly because basically what 
other people want from you,

1060
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,850
even though they don't conceptualize it 
in this terms,

1061
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:49,290
is that you accord them the respect due 
the the incarnation of the logos.

1062
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,620
That's exactly what it means to interact
with someone properly.

1063
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,220
So it's you can say what you want about 
what you believe.

1064
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:58,500
It doesn't matter what matters is what 
you act out.

1065
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,840
All right,
so,

1066
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:03,900
oh,
so now we have this conceptualization of

1067
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:08,901
what's transcendent that's emerged as a 
part partially perhaps as emotional 

1068
00:55:08,901 --> 00:55:11,880
contagion,
that which inspires awe is that which is

1069
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:16,881
transcendent and it's associated with 
these underlying ideas about the 

1070
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:20,691
creation of order out of chaos and the 
instantiation of that spirit in human 

1071
00:55:20,691 --> 00:55:21,600
beings.
That's all lurking in the background,

1072
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,900
and then we have this other idea which 
we already talked about,

1073
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:29,901
which is that there is a patriarchal or 
paternal spirit that represents the 

1074
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:31,860
community at large,
stretched across time.

1075
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,440
You can think about that as the spirit 
of the ancestors,

1076
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,360
so it's the past.
It's the president,

1077
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:38,190
but that's also projected into the 
future.

1078
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:43,490
That's the thing,
you bargain with four year life in the 

1079
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:46,671
future,
I'm going to sacrifice myself to get a 

1080
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:46,671
degree.

1081
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:50,030
Why is that?
Because the spirit of my culture will 

1082
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,060
reward me in the future.
That's the sacrifice.

1083
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,810
Okay?
Well,

1084
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,750
it doesn't people.
We were chimpanzees for God's sake.

1085
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,330
It took us a long time to figure this 
out.

1086
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:02,570
Chimpanzees,
don't sacrifice the present for the 

1087
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:02,570
future.
You know,

1088
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:06,201
you gotta ask yourself,
how long did it take human beings to 

1089
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:08,190
figure out that there was a future and 
then what to do about it?

1090
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:13,670
I mean,
this isn't something we didn't go from 

1091
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:13,670
chimpanzees to fully articulated human 
being in one,

1092
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:18,440
in one step.
It was created knowledge in that was 

1093
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,690
extraordinarily painful.
What did we learn from observation?

1094
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:26,680
Something like storing up goods for the 
future helps us live.

1095
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,110
Imagine how difficult that is.
You know,

1096
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:31,120
marriage and that you're a,
you're a farmer.

1097
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:36,330
Back when it was an extraordinarily,
you are barely scraping out a living 

1098
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:36,580
doing that.

1099
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,590
It was hand to mouth at best.
All right,

1100
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:41,470
so now it's winter and you've got your 
damn seeds in your cellar,

1101
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,180
right?
What are you going to do?

1102
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:44,680
You're starving,
you can eat them,

1103
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:50,420
or are you going to wait and plant them 
again in the spring because that's your 

1104
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,341
damn choice,
and so the people who decided to eat 

1105
00:56:53,341 --> 00:56:55,510
them while some of the people who 
decided to save them died,

1106
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,090
well,
let's say more of the people who decided

1107
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:03,091
to eat them died and so this sort of 
knowledge was was gathered in 

1108
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
unbelievable agony.
You don't get what what you have what 

1109
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,601
you want right now for you.
That's nothing because you're very much 

1110
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:13,060
accustomed to getting what you want all 
the time right now,

1111
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:16,720
roughly speaking,
compared to people who live from hand to

1112
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:20,110
mouth,
but back when things were much rougher,

1113
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:24,490
the idea that you had to sacrifice 
something of value now to be paid off in

1114
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:24,940
the future.

1115
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,830
Man,
that was a rough thing to accept.

1116
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,130
Okay,
so what happened?

1117
00:57:28,131 --> 00:57:33,131
So people figured this out.
Somehow they figured out that you could 

1118
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:36,421
make an offering of something you valued
and that might help set the world 

1119
00:57:36,421 --> 00:57:37,930
straight.
How do they conceptualize that?

1120
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,830
While they conceptualized it ritually,
they were acting it out to begin with.

1121
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,340
It's like the Piagetian idea,
you know when I,

1122
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:50,410
when I look at that top part of the 
looking is this right?

1123
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:55,411
It's the adjustment of my body to the 
shape of the Cup as part of my 

1124
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:55,420
understanding.
Well,

1125
00:57:55,421 --> 00:58:00,421
Piaget's PA,
one IMPINJ's great observations is that 

1126
00:58:00,421 --> 00:58:04,440
we use our bodies to represent things 
long before we understand what it is 

1127
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,941
that we're representing,
which is to say no more than we act 

1128
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:10,000
things out were dramatic creatures,
right?

1129
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:15,030
We use drama and the the sacrificial 
ritual is a drama that points to a 

1130
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:21,301
higher psychological truth and the 
higher psychological truth is let go of 

1131
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:25,441
what's him let go of what you value now 
and perhaps that will pay off multi 

1132
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,370
manifold in the future.

1133
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,470
You're making a bargain and then you 
might say,

1134
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,120
well,
who are you making a bargain with?

1135
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,310
And you could say,
well nature,

1136
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:38,260
but that's not exactly right.
It's not exactly right because let's say

1137
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:43,261
I have something of value in the social,
in the social organization and I'm going

1138
00:58:44,591 --> 00:58:46,650
to.
I'm going to let it go because I'm.

1139
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:50,560
I'm relying on a corresponding reward or
a greater reward in the future.

1140
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,380
It's a contractual relationship with 
other people.

1141
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:57,520
It's not a relationship with nature,
it's that we've organized ourselves into

1142
00:58:57,521 --> 00:59:02,521
a social structure and we're willing to 
maintain the integrity of the social 

1143
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:06,340
structure across time so that if I give 
up something now,

1144
00:59:06,341 --> 00:59:11,341
I can be paid for it in the future,
and the rule of the deal is that we're 

1145
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:14,440
going to try to keep the future the same
as the president so that those contracts

1146
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:16,840
can be,
can be met in the future.

1147
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,750
That's money.
That's what money is,

1148
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,410
right?
Here's some money.

1149
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,930
You've made a sacrifice.
That's why you get the money.

1150
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:29,050
What is the money signify?
It's a promise from the community that 

1151
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:34,690
the Labor that you invested,
we can be stored and then brought 

1152
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:38,450
forward for your own purposes in the 
future.

1153
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,730
So it's actually part of the social 
contract.

1154
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:45,731
So the thing you're sacrificing to is 
the spirit of society that produces the 

1155
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:51,161
social contract,
and so that's conceptualized as God the 

1156
00:59:51,161 --> 00:59:51,161
father.
Well,

1157
00:59:51,161 --> 00:59:53,450
how else would you conceptualize it?
It's,

1158
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,150
it's the spirit of the dominance 
hierarchy.

1159
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:58,730
That's the right way to think about it.
So it's the.

1160
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It's what's common across all the 
members of the dominance hierarchy 

1161
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,000
across time.
Well,

1162
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,260
it's something you can negotiate with 
true or not,

1163
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,660
but what the hell do you think you're 
doing when you make a contract?

1164
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,670
What's the law?

1165
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:15,700
It's all of this.
It's the manifestation of that 

1166
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,220
patriarchal spirit across time and space
and what do you do?

1167
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:17,840
You sacrifice to it.
Well,

1168
01:00:17,841 --> 01:00:20,300
so back 40,000
years ago,

1169
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:21,350
5,000
years ago,

1170
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,780
however old the story as it's probably 
older than that,

1171
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:29,080
this is the best people could do with 
regards to realization and they go to 

1172
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,990
quite right because they also noted that
God was happier if you actually 

1173
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:37,331
sacrificed something of value and so 
there's a tremendous complexity and not 

1174
01:00:38,091 --> 01:00:39,800
idea because one of the things I could 
say,

1175
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:41,180
and this is something you've pointed 
out,

1176
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:44,180
let's say you're miserable and unhappy.
Okay,

1177
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:49,460
here's a cure.
Find what's valuable and let it go.

1178
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,680
So we could say,
well,

1179
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:56,681
maybe it's a relationship that you have.
Maybe it's relationship with your 

1180
01:00:56,681 --> 01:00:56,681
parents,
right?

1181
01:00:56,681 --> 01:00:58,880
And the relationship is pathological,
but you're locked into it.

1182
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:03,881
You value it and no wonder because it's 
a relationship with your parents and 

1183
01:01:03,881 --> 01:01:04,100
your suffering terribly because of it.

1184
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,570
Well,
what do you do?

1185
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,860
Maybe you let it go.
It's a sacrifice and the idea is that,

1186
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:11,420
well,
that'll clear the future for you.

1187
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:17,040
Well,
very frequently when people are 

1188
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,761
suffering terribly,
not always because sometimes you just 

1189
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:19,940
suffer stupidly,
blindly and without recourse,

1190
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:22,250
you know you get cancer and then you 
die,

1191
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,530
so we have no idea how to deal with 
that,

1192
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:29,830
but sometimes the reason that you're 
suffering is because you just won't let 

1193
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:30,680
go of the thing that's biting you and 
you think,

1194
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:35,681
well,
I can't let go of on and I've had 

1195
01:01:35,681 --> 01:01:37,301
clients like this.
I can't stop communicating with my 

1196
01:01:37,301 --> 01:01:39,461
mother who phones me three times a day 
everyday of my life and never says 

1197
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:40,310
anything that isn't unbelievably 
critical and demeaning.

1198
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,350
I can't let that go.
It's like,

1199
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,250
wow,

1200
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,890
that's not such a good idea.
The funny thing too,

1201
01:01:47,891 --> 01:01:49,960
often when people let something like 
that go,

1202
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:55,440
it goes away,
sorts itself out and then comes back so 

1203
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,161
they don't even end up losing it,
but unless they're willing to let it go 

1204
01:01:59,161 --> 01:01:59,980
to sacrifice that they make no headway 
whatsoever.

1205
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,400
And so one of the rules is if people are
impeding your development,

1206
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,080
you sacrifice your relationship with 
them,

1207
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:09,730
right?
It's a very,

1208
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:10,900
very rough rule.

1209
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:11,910
So

1210
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:21,010
in process of time it came to pass that 
cain brought of the fruit of the ground 

1211
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,140
and offering unto the Lord and Abel.
He also brought of the firstlings of his

1212
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:25,160
flock and of the fat thereof.
Now that's interesting.

1213
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,720
This is,
this is where a close reading matters,

1214
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:30,320
so we don't know what Kane's offering 
is.

1215
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:35,390
It's not much described,
but we do know something about ables 

1216
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,810
offering and what we know is that by the
standards of the time,

1217
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:42,050
it's a high quality offering.
So it's the firstborn and it's the fat 

1218
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:42,450
high calorie,
right?

1219
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:43,320
I mean,
you know,

1220
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,580
we think of fat as a dietary danger,
but if you're hungry,

1221
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,380
that's really wrong,
right?

1222
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:51,390
Because fat is unbelievably high 
calorie,

1223
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:56,570
and so what's happening is the story 
points out quite clearly that what able 

1224
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:57,330
decides to offer to God is of high 
quality.

1225
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,890
So it's the real thing.

1226
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,510
It's the real thing.
He,

1227
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:02,220
he's,
he's paying a price.

1228
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,200
Okay.
And so then it's burned.

1229
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,420
While why is it burned?
Well,

1230
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:12,060
you know,
this is back again thinking from an 

1231
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:12,060
archaic perspective.
Well,

1232
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,201
gods in the sky,
you can't throw your lamb up into the 

1233
01:03:15,201 --> 01:03:15,660
sky,
it'll just fall back down and so,

1234
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:20,810
but people knew because they've mastered
fire that smoke and savor rose and so 

1235
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:25,020
you can detect the quality of an 
offering as a consequence of burning.

1236
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:30,021
And then that would go up in the spirit 
of the fire would go up to the sky and 

1237
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:32,970
God could detect whether or not you're 
offering was of reasonable quality.

1238
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,340
You know,
it's concretized obviously,

1239
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:40,341
but you don't want to make the 
assumption that the people who were our 

1240
01:03:40,341 --> 01:03:43,460
forebears were stupid just because they 
thought using metaphors that aren't the 

1241
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,961
same as our metaphors.
They were still mapping out the damn 

1242
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:47,961
territory.

1243
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:47,961
You know,
and,

1244
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:49,020
and,
and you look,

1245
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:54,021
you can read a book like you're above 
the authors of the book or you can read 

1246
01:03:54,021 --> 01:03:55,860
a book as if it might have something to 
teach you.

1247
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:01,580
And I would say,
well sometimes the book isn't worth 

1248
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,130
reading,
but if a book has been around for a very

1249
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:07,131
long period of time and a very large 
number of people have thought that 

1250
01:04:07,131 --> 01:04:08,610
perhaps there's something in it.
Sometimes they're right.

1251
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:14,330
So,
and it's a tricky thing and it might 

1252
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:16,851
also depend on how you read it,
but I've found that this sort of 

1253
01:04:16,851 --> 01:04:20,421
investigation was a lot more useful if I
started from the presupposition that 

1254
01:04:20,421 --> 01:04:21,840
maybe there was something I didn't know.
Instead of,

1255
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,790
you know,
so funny.

1256
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:28,791
For example,
I taught a first year course about 10 

1257
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:31,701
years ago on the psychology of religion 
and it was so interesting dealing with 

1258
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,271
the 18 year old students because they 
are completely dismissive of religious 

1259
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:35,310
ideas.

1260
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:36,480
And I thought,
God,

1261
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:38,760
you guys,
you don't know anything yet.

1262
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:43,890
You have this specific kind of blindness
that a set of very intelligent social 

1263
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:46,710
psychologists also identified,
which was blindness blindness.

1264
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:49,080
Because it actually turns out that the 
least,

1265
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:53,850
the less you know about a topic,
the more you'll overestimate the quality

1266
01:04:53,851 --> 01:04:55,740
of your knowledge.
And so I thought,

1267
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:55,990
well,
we're,

1268
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,000
we're in this situation where kids who,
who don't even know how to act in the 

1269
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:01,650
world,
they don't know anything,

1270
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,800
will come to university and start off 
with a proposition that they're astute 

1271
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,580
critics of Judeo Christian culture,
which of which they know nothing.

1272
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:11,130
They know nothing about it.
They knew nothing about history.

1273
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:13,650
They know nothing about philosophy,
nothing about literature,

1274
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:18,830
but they're absolutely certain that 
they're correct there in the criticisms 

1275
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:21,670
that they're bringing forth.
It's absolutely unbelievable.

1276
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:27,300
So anyways,
and it's not helpful because then you 

1277
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,260
don't,
you don't get to learn and you want.

1278
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:34,950
Well she,
you know what happens if you don't 

1279
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:34,950
learn.
Okay.

1280
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,040
So anyway,
so it looks like ables doing a good job.

1281
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:41,670
That's the implication.
The story doesn't say Abel is doing a 

1282
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:44,770
really good job with his sacrifices.
It just hints at it.

1283
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,890
And I liked that because.
Because it leaves that ambiguity.

1284
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:52,891
It's like maybe you're working really 
hard and your brother's working really 

1285
01:05:52,891 --> 01:05:56,941
hard and you really can't tell the 
difference between your quality of work 

1286
01:05:56,941 --> 01:06:00,331
and his quality of work,
but for some reason he succeeding like 

1287
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:00,490
map that happens,
right?

1288
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:02,500
Because there's an arbitrary element to 
life.

1289
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:07,800
And so the story he says,
well the Lord has respect unto Abel and 

1290
01:06:07,811 --> 01:06:11,380
his offering and there's an implication 
that maybe the reason for that is that,

1291
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:16,650
you know,
canes offerings are a little second 

1292
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,781
rate,
but the story doesn't come over and out 

1293
01:06:18,781 --> 01:06:18,781
and club you over the head with that 
idea.

1294
01:06:18,781 --> 01:06:20,560
It just leaves it as a,
as an ambiguous possibility.

1295
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:25,561
And the reason for that is sometimes you
make sacrifices and maybe they're even 

1296
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:27,250
real ones and they don't pay off or they
pay off for someone better.

1297
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:32,550
And so there is this arbitrary nature of
that the transcendent that you're 

1298
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:37,501
attempting to deal with it rewards and 
doesn't reward more or less of its own 

1299
01:06:37,501 --> 01:06:42,061
accord or there's an element of that.
And so it's ambiguous in the text even 

1300
01:06:42,061 --> 01:06:45,250
though there's a hint that perhaps Abel 
is doing a better job than kate.

1301
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,160
So I like that.
I think it's very sophisticated.

1302
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,010
So what happens?
Well,

1303
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:53,800
Kane makes his offerings and God isn't 
happy with them.

1304
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:58,270
Now we don't know how cain figures out 
that God isn't happy with his offerings.

1305
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:03,630
We get some hints of that too.
But the story does tell us that's what 

1306
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:07,141
happens.
And so then we get the psychological 

1307
01:07:07,141 --> 01:07:07,141
response on the part of cane.

1308
01:07:07,141 --> 01:07:08,800
Now one response could be,
Jesus,

1309
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:11,440
I must be doing something wrong.
I better straighten myself out,

1310
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:16,800
you know,
I better come up with a better quality 

1311
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,170
offering and try that again.
That isn't what happens.

1312
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,440
What happens instead is that cane 
becomes angry wroth and his countenance 

1313
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,170
fault.
And so what does that mean?

1314
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:24,750
It means this,
right?

1315
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:29,470
It means he is not happy.
He's angry and out for revenge.

1316
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,680
And so one of the,
I've been thinking about this a lot 

1317
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,951
lately with regards to the literature on
inequality because there's a very good 

1318
01:07:37,951 --> 01:07:39,040
literature that shows,
for example,

1319
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:40,390
that there's,
there's a,

1320
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,480
there's a measure called the Gini 
Coefficient and the Gini Coefficient is 

1321
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,980
a numerical index of the relative 
inequality of a geographical locale.

1322
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:53,340
So for example,
if you went to Newfoundland where 

1323
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:53,340
everyone is roughly not very rich or 
North Dakota,

1324
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:57,160
say almost everyone there is say lower 
middle class,

1325
01:07:57,161 --> 01:07:58,930
something like that,
or upper working class,

1326
01:07:58,931 --> 01:07:59,560
something like that.

1327
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:02,800
Very little variability,
low Gini Coefficient,

1328
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:05,320
okay?
And if you go to Miami Beach,

1329
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:07,870
say where everyone's rich,
low gini coefficient,

1330
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:12,220
because it isn't an index of absolute 
wealth or absolute poverty,

1331
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,710
it's an index of relative poverty.
And so if everyone's rich,

1332
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:18,050
the relative poverty is low,
and if everyone's poor,

1333
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:23,140
the relative poverty is low.
Now one question is where's the crime?

1334
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,860
And you might think,
well,

1335
01:08:24,861 --> 01:08:28,520
the crime is where the absolute poverty 
is high,

1336
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:29,960
right?
Or the absolute wealth is low.

1337
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:32,360
That's where the crime is.
That's wrong.

1338
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:38,470
If it's.
If things are relatively distributed in 

1339
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:40,400
an egalitarian manner,
the male on male crime,

1340
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:44,480
especially homicide is low and it's also
the case where everyone is rich.

1341
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,890
But if you go into places where there 
some rich people but not very many,

1342
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:53,980
and there's a lot of people who are 
comparatively poor than the male 

1343
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:57,041
homicide rates,
rates and violent crime rates amp up 

1344
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:57,041
substantially.

1345
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:58,700
And it's a consequence of male on male 
competition,

1346
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:04,180
and so what you could derive from that 
and maybe even reasonably is that you 

1347
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:08,501
should flatten out the damn income into 
distribution because you're 

1348
01:09:08,501 --> 01:09:10,760
destabilizing the society by 
facilitating male criminal aggression.

1349
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,920
You can make a good case for that.
You know,

1350
01:09:12,921 --> 01:09:17,921
in,
in places like Columbia where the Gini 

1351
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:20,890
Coefficient got unbelievably extreme,
society got so violent that it could 

1352
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:21,530
barely hold itself together.
So,

1353
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,800
so you,
you can make a conservative argument for

1354
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:29,801
redistribution of income using the 
observation that if the income 

1355
01:09:29,801 --> 01:09:33,341
distribution gets too extreme,
the whole bloody thing starts to 

1356
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:33,341
destabilize.
It might fall,

1357
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:34,880
but,
but then you also might say,

1358
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:40,110
well wait a minute,
is it any quality that's driving the 

1359
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:43,310
violence or is it resentment of the 
inequality that's driving the violence?

1360
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:49,240
Now,
that's a tough question because you 

1361
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:49,240
might say,
well,

1362
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:49,910
what if the game is rigged and there's 
no way of moving up the power hierarchy?

1363
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:55,270
Well then maybe anger and,
and the desire for revolution is the 

1364
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:58,361
appropriate response.
But that doesn't really mean to me that 

1365
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:01,780
the response should be that sort of 
thing that you see in hygienic 

1366
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,170
coefficient neighborhoods,
which is interracial,

1367
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:08,240
intra racial violence between men.
So for example,

1368
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:10,490
in neighborhoods where there's high 
murder rates,

1369
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:15,110
the murders are always between young men
and they're always within race.

1370
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:20,860
And so that doesn't seem to me to be 
exactly a politically revolutionary 

1371
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:20,860
move,
right?

1372
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:24,070
It's more like it's more like a violent 
competition for the sake of,

1373
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,970
of,
of attaining status.

1374
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,650
And you might say,
well that's reasonable,

1375
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:32,651
but because the inequality is there and 
men need to find status because it's 

1376
01:10:32,651 --> 01:10:37,091
part of what drives them forward.
It's part of what makes them attractive 

1377
01:10:37,091 --> 01:10:37,091
to women.
It's a necessity.

1378
01:10:37,091 --> 01:10:37,550
Well,
the question is,

1379
01:10:37,551 --> 01:10:41,660
do you attain status through destruction
or do you start making your offerings,

1380
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:43,100
putting your offerings in order?

1381
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:48,340
And that's something we really need to 
figure out because that's a fundamental 

1382
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:48,770
political question.
It's a fundamental political question.

1383
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:54,310
Anyways.
What happens in this story is that cane 

1384
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:56,921
decides that the fact that God isn't 
accepting his offerings means that he's 

1385
01:10:56,921 --> 01:10:59,810
entitled to become angry and,
and,

1386
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,960
and negative.
It's those two things or both put 

1387
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:04,960
together,
right.

1388
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:05,300
He's raw,
he's angry,

1389
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:08,510
and he's also depressed and so he's in a
state of mind that,

1390
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,600
well,
I think the best characterization for 

1391
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:13,770
that is hostile resentment because it's 
unfair.

1392
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:14,820
It's like,
yeah,

1393
01:11:14,821 --> 01:11:16,710
it's unfair,
so what going to do about it?

1394
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:20,730
Can you get destructive about it?
Are going to change your approach?

1395
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,570
Well,
Kane,

1396
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:25,470
he does the ultimate thing and this is 
what people do when they do the ultimate

1397
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:30,471
thing because that kind of hostile 
resentment has an architectural end 

1398
01:11:30,471 --> 01:11:34,901
point and the architectural end point is
the point that you get when you're 

1399
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:38,631
hostile and resentful because you 
haven't been successful and then you go 

1400
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:42,051
sit in your mother's basement for about 
10 years and then you start imagining 

1401
01:11:42,051 --> 01:11:45,681
just how nice it would be if you shut up
the local high school so that everybody 

1402
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:48,771
knew your name and what happens is you 
go from I'm irritated because things 

1403
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,220
aren't working out for me very well too.

1404
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,630
I'm irritated.
Nine and a hate.

1405
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:54,810
Those people for whom things are working
out well too.

1406
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,960
I'm irritated and I hate the fact that 
the world is set up so that this has 

1407
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,651
happened to me and then you go to well 
because I'm irritated and hate the 

1408
01:12:03,651 --> 01:12:04,020
world.
I'm going to do whatever I can that will

1409
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:08,700
destroy most rapidly and with the,
with the highest possible amount of pain

1410
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:13,701
and suffering conceivable and at that 
point then you don't just go shoot up 

1411
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:18,141
the high school.
You go up and shoot up the elementary 

1412
01:12:18,141 --> 01:12:20,211
school and so if you're wondering what 
kind of pathway people walk down to get 

1413
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:24,531
to that point,
that's the pathway and the ultimate cap 

1414
01:12:24,531 --> 01:12:24,531
of that as well.
I'll,

1415
01:12:24,531 --> 01:12:24,740
I'll get,
I'll,

1416
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:29,850
I'll kill the kids because.
Well we already know that killing the 

1417
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:33,021
innocent,
there's a lot more effective than 

1418
01:12:33,021 --> 01:12:33,021
killing the guilty and then just to cap 
it off,

1419
01:12:33,021 --> 01:12:36,381
I'll blow my head off at the end just to
show you just how God damn pointless it 

1420
01:12:36,381 --> 01:12:36,381
all is.

1421
01:12:36,381 --> 01:12:40,020
And so that's the logical extension of 
keynes attitude and you might think,

1422
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:43,080
well that's a bit of an overriding and I
will say it's not an overriding and all.

1423
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:47,700
It's exactly what happens in the text.
So it's exactly what follows it so far.

1424
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:51,180
So Kane is not happy.
And so who was he not happy with?

1425
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:54,810
Well,
he's not happy with God.

1426
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,880
And so what does that mean?
Well,

1427
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:01,970
we've already unpacked this.
He's not happy with the social contract 

1428
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:03,300
because that's part of the spirit,
the patriarchal spirit,

1429
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:08,301
let's say.
Then there's more to it than that 

1430
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,210
because we already,
we've already analyzed what God,

1431
01:13:09,211 --> 01:13:11,730
the idea of God might represent in the 
background of this story.

1432
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:16,850
He's not happy with the transcendent.
He's not happy with the idea of the 

1433
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:16,850
logos,
all of that.

1434
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:22,220
No faith in the transcendent,
nothing but he does nothing but despise 

1435
01:13:22,241 --> 01:13:27,241
the social contract.
And he's got no faith whatsoever in the 

1436
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:30,780
logo.
So let's say the word that brings chaos 

1437
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:33,291
out of order,
he's all got nothing but contempt for 

1438
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:33,291
all of that.
And you know,

1439
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:33,630
certainly,
you know,

1440
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:35,580
people like that and if you don't know 
them,

1441
01:13:35,581 --> 01:13:40,581
you just go on youtube and read the 
comments and you'll see all sorts of 

1442
01:13:40,581 --> 01:13:40,581
people like that.
So.

1443
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,310
So anyways,
so God has a little chat with him and he

1444
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:44,680
says,
well,

1445
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:47,970
W W,
why are you angry and and why?

1446
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,210
Why are you upset?
And cain says,

1447
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,250
and God says,
if you do well,

1448
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:56,250
won't you be accepted?
And if you don't do well,

1449
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,400
sin lies at your door and unto thee 
shall be his desire and thou shalt rule 

1450
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:01,590
over him.
Okay?

1451
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,920
That's a very mangled translation I 
would say.

1452
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:10,100
So I'm going to take it apart.
So what God says is while you're angry 

1453
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:10,110
and you're upset,
it's like,

1454
01:14:10,111 --> 01:14:11,650
well,
what's your problem?

1455
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:16,090
And then God tells kate if you did 
things properly,

1456
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:17,650
they would work out for you.
Well,

1457
01:14:17,651 --> 01:14:22,651
it's the last thing he wants to hear it 
because what cain wants to believe is 

1458
01:14:22,651 --> 01:14:25,801
that the reason he's not doing very well
is because there's no sense having any 

1459
01:14:25,801 --> 01:14:26,770
faith in the logos.
The transcendent is,

1460
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:31,890
is evil and aimed exactly against him.
And the entire social contract is 

1461
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:32,980
faulty.
That's what he wants to hear,

1462
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,870
but that isn't what God says.
God says,

1463
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,860
well,
wait a minute,

1464
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:38,800
maybe you're doing something wrong.

1465
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:40,000
Well,

1466
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,080
that's maybe a worse message than 
everything else is corrupt.

1467
01:14:44,081 --> 01:14:49,081
It's like you're having a problem 
because you're just not everything you 

1468
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:49,081
could be.
Well,

1469
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:51,730
and then God says something really nasty
and you can't tell from this lines.

1470
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:55,030
I read a bunch of translations to try to
figure out exactly what it meant.

1471
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:57,520
So this is what God tells kate.
He says,

1472
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:02,530
you're in a room in a house and there's 
something at the door,

1473
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:05,620
and he uses a metaphor.
God uses metaphor.

1474
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:10,860
It's a sexually aroused predatory cat 
and you invited in even invited.

1475
01:15:12,101 --> 01:15:16,510
Did you know that it has evil intent.
You invited in to mate with you,

1476
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,430
right?
And you're.

1477
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,710
It's,
it's union with you.

1478
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:22,660
This,
this malevolent force,

1479
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:27,870
this sexual union with you has produced 
an offspring and that offspring is what 

1480
01:15:28,421 --> 01:15:33,421
possesses you.
And so not only have you done something 

1481
01:15:33,421 --> 01:15:33,421
wrong,
you've,

1482
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:39,330
you've invited the spirit of wrong doing
into your life and you creatively 

1483
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:43,261
intermingled it with it voluntarily to 
bring forth a monster of your own 

1484
01:15:43,391 --> 01:15:45,670
creation.
So that's what God tells Kane.

1485
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,450
So like,

1486
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,580
look,
it's bad enough that God says,

1487
01:15:50,581 --> 01:15:52,110
you know,
you should get your act together because

1488
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:57,170
maybe that's why things aren't going so 
well for you before you criticize the 

1489
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:58,650
transcendent and the world and the 
structure of being.

1490
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:01,590
Maybe you're doing something wrong,
but it's worse than that.

1491
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:03,270
He says,
not only are you doing something wrong,

1492
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:06,720
you bloody well know you're doing 
something wrong and you and you're doing

1493
01:16:06,721 --> 01:16:11,721
it creatively and with intent,
so not only are things not going well 

1494
01:16:11,721 --> 01:16:15,591
for you,
but you've played a creative role in 

1495
01:16:15,591 --> 01:16:17,970
producing that situation and so god 
basically says,

1496
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:21,210
I am taking zero responsibility for 
rejecting your sacrifice.

1497
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:25,200
It's all on you.
And so kane leaves and he's like,

1498
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:30,320
seriously?
Not Happy with that response because he 

1499
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,340
wanted to hear Pat,
pat,

1500
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:35,400
you're a victim of circumstance and 
everything's conspiring against you.

1501
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:40,401
And really being God,
I should get my act together and just 

1502
01:16:40,401 --> 01:16:40,401
give you what you want.

1503
01:16:40,401 --> 01:16:42,900
Because obviously being God I'm wrong 
and you're right.

1504
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,080
Well that isn't what happens.
It's exactly the opposite of that.

1505
01:16:46,081 --> 01:16:47,850
It's completely on you.
That's the,

1506
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,580
that's the judgment.
And so kane leaves and believe me,

1507
01:16:50,581 --> 01:16:52,530
he's,
he was wroth before it.

1508
01:16:52,531 --> 01:16:56,400
His countenance had fallen before,
but it's nothing like it is now.

1509
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,980
And so he's hits the next stage and he 
thinks,

1510
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:02,160
okay,
I'm going to take my revenge.

1511
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:07,340
What am I going to do?
I'm going to find the most innocent and 

1512
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:08,670
worthwhile thing that's favored of God 
and I'm going to kill it.

1513
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,970
And that's what he does.
And it doesn't matter.

1514
01:17:10,971 --> 01:17:14,390
That's his brother and able.
We know we're drawing the inference.

1515
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:16,430
Ables done the right things.
Everyone likes him.

1516
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:19,610
Everything's flourishing for Abel.
He's a good guy.

1517
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:21,920
He's one of those people that you meet 
that has everything,

1518
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:23,600
and then you meet them and you wish you 
could hate them,

1519
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:25,310
but you can't because they're really 
good people.

1520
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:28,700
And then you're really hate them because
not only do they have everything,

1521
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:32,150
but it appears that they deserve it.
And there's nothing that sort of sits in

1522
01:17:32,151 --> 01:17:34,880
your soul and rots it more than that 
realization.

1523
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:39,620
And so that's the situation with Cain.
And cain thinks Cain talked with Abel,

1524
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:44,621
his brother,
and it came to pass when they were in 

1525
01:17:44,621 --> 01:17:44,630
the field that Cain rose up against 
Abel,

1526
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:46,100
his brother,
and slew him.

1527
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:49,820
So that's so interesting because look,
look what happens to cane here.

1528
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,470
So he's not doing well.
He's separated from the transcendent and

1529
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:59,471
from society.
He's bitterly resentful and now he goes 

1530
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:01,430
out and kills the very thing that he 
most wants to be.

1531
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:03,860
So he destroys his own ideal,
right?

1532
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:08,410
He just demolishes his own ideal.
That's how far his resentment has pushed

1533
01:18:08,411 --> 01:18:09,290
him.
And so he's,

1534
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:12,770
he's done right?
But it doesn't matter because it enables

1535
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:13,700
them to take revenge.

1536
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,560
So he doesn't care.
It's like,

1537
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:20,590
it's like the suicidal school shooter 
that blows off his head at the end of 

1538
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:21,200
his mayhem.
It's like it doesn't matter to him.

1539
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:25,640
It's part of the same art form.
And the Lord says unto Cain,

1540
01:18:25,641 --> 01:18:28,190
where is Abel lie brother?
And cain said,

1541
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:29,270
I know.
I don't know.

1542
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,980
Am I my brother's keeper?
While that's a good question,

1543
01:18:31,981 --> 01:18:34,370
and that's why it's posed in the story,
because they answered that it's supposed

1544
01:18:34,371 --> 01:18:36,590
to be yes.
And God says,

1545
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:41,591
what have you done?
The Voice of your brother's blood cries 

1546
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:44,381
unto me from the ground.
That's actually the Motif that 

1547
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:48,590
Dostoevsky explorers,
I would say in crime and punishment,

1548
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:53,620
because what happens is that was calling
the coffee's cane for all intents and 

1549
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:54,200
purposes,
and he commits a murder,

1550
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:58,180
but he gets away with it well,
so he thinks so.

1551
01:18:58,181 --> 01:19:01,820
He thinks no one suspected.
He buries the money.

1552
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:05,960
He can't stand to touch the body.
He buries it in a in an abandoned lot,

1553
01:19:05,961 --> 01:19:08,990
and he's drawn there now and then to 
look at where it is,

1554
01:19:08,991 --> 01:19:13,991
but he can't touch it because the money.
It's so funny because the money before 

1555
01:19:14,031 --> 01:19:19,031
he kills the pawnbroker is not the same 
as the money after he kills the pawn 

1556
01:19:19,031 --> 01:19:23,791
broker.
And the risk only cough before he kills 

1557
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:26,891
the pawnbroker is not the same as the 
risk and cost after he kills the pole 

1558
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:26,891
broker.
In fact,

1559
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:31,690
they're not the same at all.
And so the scarlet macaw is tormented by

1560
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:33,320
God,
you could say,

1561
01:19:33,321 --> 01:19:36,710
but not from the external world.
He sets the crime up quite nicely.

1562
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:42,010
It's that this,
this spirit against which he 

1563
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:44,981
transgressed,
tortures him from within and there's no 

1564
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:48,581
escape from it,
and so eventually what happens in crime 

1565
01:19:48,581 --> 01:19:51,431
and punishment is was called Nicole.
Cough continues to manifest himself as 

1566
01:19:51,431 --> 01:19:55,751
guilty in every possible way until he 
receives the punishment that he desires 

1567
01:19:55,751 --> 01:19:57,680
because it's the only way that he can 
set things right.

1568
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:59,390
He actually,
he actually,

1569
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:05,080
he essentially turns himself in 
eventually because he can't tolerate 

1570
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,620
what he's done so well.
So that's the idea.

1571
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,440
The Voice of your brother's blood cries.
I'm to me from the ground.

1572
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:18,500
It's guilt and now you're cursed from 
the earth which has opened her mouth to 

1573
01:20:19,651 --> 01:20:22,320
receive your brother's blood from thy 
hand.

1574
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:28,250
When you till the ground,
it will not henceforth yield to you its 

1575
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:28,920
strength,
a fugitive and a vagabond,

1576
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:31,510
shall thou be in the earth,
you know?

1577
01:20:31,511 --> 01:20:36,511
And you might say,
well why does God not just strike caden 

1578
01:20:36,511 --> 01:20:41,000
dead?
And answer to that perhaps is that 

1579
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:47,070
wouldn't be sufficient punishment.
That's what it looks like to me.

1580
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:50,820
It's like what's the punishment?
You live with what you did.

1581
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:57,600
Right?
And I don't want anybody taking you out 

1582
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:57,600
either because then you won't have to 
live with what you did.

1583
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:01,480
So that's the punishment.
And cain says unto the Lord,

1584
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:03,340
my punishment is greater than I can 
bear.

1585
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:04,090
It's like,
yeah,

1586
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:09,780
behold you have driven me out this day 
from the face of the earth and from thy 

1587
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:13,081
face shall I be here.
That's the same as what happens to Adam 

1588
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:13,081
in the garden of Eden.
Remember,

1589
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:15,160
Adam hides from God and he has his 
reasons.

1590
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:19,060
And now cain is alienated from God.
There's no real,

1591
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:24,810
there's no reconstructing that 
relationship he's put himself by 

1592
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:28,711
violating his contract,
but say with the transcendent and also 

1593
01:21:28,711 --> 01:21:29,950
with society and also with his own 
spirit,

1594
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,920
he's put himself outside the possibility
of redemption.

1595
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:36,400
And that's why he says the punishment is
greater than I can bear.

1596
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,380
There's no hope left,
right?

1597
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:40,840
So he's in hell for all intents and 
purposes,

1598
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:49,240
behold,
that has driven me out to stay from the 

1599
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:49,240
face of the earth and from thy face 
shall I be hidden.

1600
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,770
I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in 
the earth.

1601
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:54,190
And it shall come to pass that everyone 
who finds me will kill me,

1602
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:57,910
and God says,
therefore whoever slayeth Cain,

1603
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,490
vengeance shall be taken on him.
Seven fold.

1604
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:04,720
And the Lord set a mark onto Cain,
lest any finding him should kill him.

1605
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:05,900
Now,
that's interesting.

1606
01:22:05,901 --> 01:22:07,930
And you think,
why in the world would God protect cane?

1607
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:13,440
Well,
the next part of the story actually 

1608
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:13,440
tells you that you have a family.
I have a family.

1609
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:16,360
Your brother kills my son.
So what do I do?

1610
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:22,200
I come and I kill your father and your 
cousin and then you think,

1611
01:22:22,331 --> 01:22:24,580
well,
I killed your father and your cousin.

1612
01:22:24,581 --> 01:22:27,640
I'm going to come back and I'm going to 
kill four of your people.

1613
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,710
And then I come back and say,
yeah,

1614
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:32,200
no problem.
It's 16 to you this time.

1615
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,990
And then you come back and you say,
16 a,

1616
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:38,110
let's try for 32.
And so this is what happens.

1617
01:22:38,111 --> 01:22:41,290
This is actually why justice systems are
set up by the way you go.

1618
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:46,440
There's a bunch of reasons justice 
systems are set up and one is to punish 

1619
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:46,720
the guilty.
That's one.

1620
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:51,900
The other is to have the guilty repent 
that's to to maintain social order.

1621
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:57,210
That's three.
Here's another one that no one ever 

1622
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:58,000
thinks about.
Back 30 years ago,

1623
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:04,170
the governor of Massachusetts,
whose name I forget was running for 

1624
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,110
president,
and while he was governor,

1625
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,130
Massachusetts,
he

1626
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:08,770
had released a number of prisoners,
one of whom his name was,

1627
01:23:08,771 --> 01:23:12,460
I think Willie Horton.
It doesn't really matter.

1628
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:15,400
And when Willy was released on this 
program,

1629
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,940
he went out and raped someone and 
perhaps killed them.

1630
01:23:18,941 --> 01:23:20,320
I can't remember,
but it doesn't matter.

1631
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:25,630
The rape is good enough.
And the governor was asked during a 

1632
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:30,391
debate what he would do if a release 
prisoner had raped his daughter or his 

1633
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:33,780
wife,
and he gave a very weak answer.

1634
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,800
Uh,
what was his name?

1635
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,050
He gave a very weak answer.
Something about,

1636
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:40,810
you know,
letting the law take its due course.

1637
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:42,100
And that's the wrong answer,
right?

1638
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:47,220
The right answer is I would be compelled
with every fiber of my being to hunt 

1639
01:23:48,191 --> 01:23:50,320
that person down and to tear them into 
bits,

1640
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,560
but I won't do it.
Now,

1641
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:53,860
what's,
uh,

1642
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:58,861
what's the purpose of the justice system
is to alleviate you from the 

1643
01:23:58,861 --> 01:24:01,720
responsibility of revenge.
That's what it's for,

1644
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:05,590
because otherwise what happens,
you kill one.

1645
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:07,900
I killed two.
You kill for kill eight,

1646
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:12,960
you kill 16 and soon everyone's at war.
And so God protects cane to stop that 

1647
01:24:14,531 --> 01:24:19,531
from happening,
to stop the feud from emerging because 

1648
01:24:19,531 --> 01:24:22,711
those things can go forever and then 
from transforming the entire society 

1649
01:24:22,711 --> 01:24:23,560
into a state of war.
And so what's also.

1650
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,420
So I'll tell you the rest of the story.

1651
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:31,510
And Kane went out from the presence of 
the Lord and dwelt in the land of nod on

1652
01:24:31,511 --> 01:24:35,340
the east of Eden and Cain knew his wife 
and she conceived and bare enoch,

1653
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:37,270
et cetera.
So now you have a genealogy,

1654
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:39,250
right?
So came starts to have a family,

1655
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:44,251
you have a genealogy.
And so a number of people are named in 

1656
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:44,260
the lineage.
And so,

1657
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:49,440
and it tells you what,
this is sort of an attempt to describe 

1658
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,190
how things came about.
So this is like the naming of the heroes

1659
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:56,191
of old.
And so you have a enoch who builds a 

1660
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:59,671
city.
You have a gal who is the father of 

1661
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:01,900
those who dwell intense,
and of those who have cattle,

1662
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:07,960
you have juvenile who was the father of 
of musicians and Zillah who bore 

1663
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,700
tubilcain.
Tubilcain is a very interesting person 

1664
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:17,190
by tradition.
Tubal cocaine is the first artificer of 

1665
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:18,610
weapons of war,
so keynes,

1666
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:23,611
descendant after multiple generations is
the person who produces weapons of war.

1667
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:25,810
All right,
and so,

1668
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:31,190
so there's another bit of the story 
within which that needs to be placed in 

1669
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:34,290
context.
And lamech,

1670
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:40,260
who's one of the grandchildren of Cain 
says unto his wife at Wives Adah and 

1671
01:25:44,101 --> 01:25:49,101
Zillah hear my voice.
You wives of Lamech Hearken unto my 

1672
01:25:49,101 --> 01:25:51,930
speech for I have slain a man to my 
wounding and the young man to my hurt.

1673
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:54,120
Okay,
so what he's saying is he,

1674
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:59,570
he's been involved in a murder if can be
avenged.

1675
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:04,010
Sevenfold truly Lamaq 70 and seven.
And

1676
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:09,010
so there's the implication there that 
the tit for tat process has begun.

1677
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,600
Cain killed Abel.
Abel Caine's children killed seven 

1678
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,200
canes,
grandchildren kill 70 fold,

1679
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:23,590
and then tubal cane pops up on the 
horizon and he's the person who makes 

1680
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:28,570
artifices of war.
And so the story in its fragmentary 

1681
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:32,441
manner ties the individual's 
psychopathology that's resentful and 

1682
01:26:32,661 --> 01:26:36,620
revenge seeking to the proclivity for 
broad scale warfare.

1683
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:41,830
And this really hit me because I was 
interested particularly in what was 

1684
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:45,611
happening in the Nazi camps with the 
guards because the guards were 

1685
01:26:45,611 --> 01:26:48,860
gratuitously cruel and I was very 
curious about that.

1686
01:26:48,861 --> 01:26:53,861
And so here's an interesting story.
This was in a book called a ordinary 

1687
01:26:53,861 --> 01:26:55,460
Germans,
Hitler's willing executioners.

1688
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:58,100
And it was a book that was written about
30 years ago.

1689
01:26:58,101 --> 01:27:03,101
The challenge,
the idea that the Nazi phenomenon was 

1690
01:27:03,101 --> 01:27:03,650
topped down order following,
which I don't believe,

1691
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,490
by the way I think that that's a very 
weak,

1692
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:07,760
weak hypothesis.

1693
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:13,330
Fascistic societies are fascistic at 
every single level of organization 

1694
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:15,650
spiritually within the family,
within the local community.

1695
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,510
It's like a holograph.
It's the same,

1696
01:27:17,511 --> 01:27:19,790
absolutely everywhere.
It's not top down.

1697
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:25,120
I mean,
there are leaders who get produced and 

1698
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,711
maybe they catalyze it,
but to blame it on the leaders is to 

1699
01:27:26,711 --> 01:27:27,650
forget about the process by which the 
leaders come to be.

1700
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,440
So No,
you don't get a pass that way.

1701
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,450
So here's one of the things that 
happened,

1702
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:37,160
um,
as the Nazis started to lose the war.

1703
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
So here's what you should have done.
If you are a Nazi and he wanted to win 

1704
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,341
the war,
you should have enslaved the Jews and 

1705
01:27:45,341 --> 01:27:47,381
the Gypsies and had them work right?
You should have had them work for the 

1706
01:27:47,381 --> 01:27:51,440
benefit of the victory and then if you 
wanted to liquidate them afterwards,

1707
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:52,940
that's the logical thing to do.

1708
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,270
If you want to win and we assume that 
Hitler wanted to win,

1709
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,520
but that's not a very intelligent 
assumption.

1710
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,760
Why would you assume that he wasn't 
exactly a good guy?

1711
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:06,880
So why should we assume that he was 
aiming at the good that he was 

1712
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:07,160
promoting,
even in his own terms,

1713
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:12,550
right?
The glorious everlasting for Third 

1714
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:12,550
Reich,
right?

1715
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:16,580
That'll rule for a thousand years and be
a bastion of civilization and music 

1716
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:17,870
because that's the sort of thing he 
purported to be interested in.

1717
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:23,380
Well,
so what do you do with the Jews and the 

1718
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:23,380
Gypsies?
Well,

1719
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:23,380
round them up,
fine.

1720
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:24,170
Enslave them,
fine.

1721
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,500
You don't kill them.
You certainly don't devote a substantial

1722
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:32,501
proportion of your war resources well,
you're losing to accelerate the rate at 

1723
01:28:33,201 --> 01:28:38,201
which the extermination is taking place 
because that's a bit counterproductive 

1724
01:28:38,201 --> 01:28:42,040
unless what you're aiming at is the 
maximum possible mayhem in the shortest 

1725
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:42,200
period of time.
Well,

1726
01:28:42,201 --> 01:28:44,570
so what happened as the Germans started 
to lose the war,

1727
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:47,420
get Hitler lose faith in his own 
ability.

1728
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:52,480
No,
he believed that the Germans had to be 

1729
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,180
traded with weakness and so he's 
perfectly willing to accelerate the rate

1730
01:28:53,181 --> 01:28:58,181
at which Germany was losing the war,
and so when Hitler and his minions have 

1731
01:28:58,181 --> 01:28:58,550
the choice,
here's the choice.

1732
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:02,040
You can suspend your unnecessary 
demolition

1733
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:07,040
of people when the damn war and then 
pick it up afterwards or while you're 

1734
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:12,021
losing.
You can just accelerate the mayhem even 

1735
01:29:12,021 --> 01:29:14,391
though it's counterproductive.
It's like what'd they pick while they 

1736
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:15,330
pick to accelerate the mayhem,
and so to me,

1737
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:18,840
there's an old psychoanalytic idea.
I think this was derived by young.

1738
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,190
If you can't figure out what someone is 
doing or why,

1739
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:26,970
look at the outcome and infer the 
motivation.

1740
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:29,640
If it produces may him.

1741
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:33,940
Perhaps it was aiming at me hip.
Now,

1742
01:29:33,941 --> 01:29:36,220
you know,
you have to use that dictum carefully.

1743
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:38,050
If someone's irritating,
you know,

1744
01:29:38,051 --> 01:29:40,690
maybe it's because you're irritable,
had you should sort yourself out,

1745
01:29:40,691 --> 01:29:45,691
but maybe it's because they're actually 
aiming at irritating you and that's the 

1746
01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:47,200
actual motivation.
So perhaps not,

1747
01:29:47,201 --> 01:29:49,960
but it's another tool in your analytical
armament.

1748
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:53,650
So and so you see,
well,

1749
01:29:53,651 --> 01:29:56,140
this is the thing about warfare that's 
so interesting about,

1750
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,260
about,
because you can,

1751
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:03,390
you can attribute it to territoriality.
You can attribute it to a war for 

1752
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:03,970
resources.
That's what the,

1753
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:07,060
I would say wretchedly,

1754
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:13,910
simple minded economists presume people 
fight over scarce resources.

1755
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,560
It's like,
hey,

1756
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:19,020
we're a little bit more sophisticated 
than that.

1757
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,540
And first of all,
what resources are you talking about?

1758
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,310
The bloody anyway,
it had nothing.

1759
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:25,200
They live perfectly well.
What did they have?

1760
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:27,030
Snow and seal,
blubber,

1761
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:32,510
you know,
people can live and unbelievably 

1762
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,431
deprived conditions,
and so the idea that there are natural 

1763
01:30:34,431 --> 01:30:38,451
resources that we fight over because 
there's a shortage of them is a pretty 

1764
01:30:38,451 --> 01:30:38,970
oversimplified view of human beings.
It's like,

1765
01:30:38,971 --> 01:30:40,050
well,
why do people fight?

1766
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:45,290
Well,
maybe they fight sometimes for good 

1767
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:45,290
reasons,
but very,

1768
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:48,171
very frequently they fight for bad 
reasons and those bad reasons are our 

1769
01:30:48,171 --> 01:30:50,520
personal as well as sociocultural and 
economic.

1770
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:52,470
You know,
if you were announced a prison guard,

1771
01:30:52,471 --> 01:30:57,471
for example,
whatever pathologies you were carrying 

1772
01:30:57,471 --> 01:31:00,351
around in your destructive little soul,
whatever element of Cain was deeply 

1773
01:31:00,351 --> 01:31:03,831
embedded in you had the opportunity to 
be manifest fully at every moment of 

1774
01:31:03,831 --> 01:31:03,831
your waking existence.

1775
01:31:03,831 --> 01:31:06,060
Right?
You had these people who were completely

1776
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:08,910
beholden to you with no rights 
whatsoever,

1777
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:13,350
to whom you could do whatever you're 
evil little heart determined think,

1778
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:18,351
well,
maybe that was a motivation for putting 

1779
01:31:18,351 --> 01:31:18,351
them there to begin with and all the 
cover story about,

1780
01:31:18,351 --> 01:31:22,700
well,
we're trying to build the Third Reich 

1781
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,321
and we're trying to stabilize the state 
and we're trying to do all these good 

1782
01:31:24,321 --> 01:31:27,141
things.
Maybe that's just a cover story for the 

1783
01:31:27,141 --> 01:31:29,211
real motivation,
which is nothing but but what the 

1784
01:31:29,211 --> 01:31:30,360
construction of death camps had killed 6
million people.

1785
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:35,510
How about that?
And the obliteration of 120 million 

1786
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:38,070
people on the planet and the and the and
the and the leaving of European runes.

1787
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:42,570
Maybe that was the motivation or are we 
going to attribute to Hitler the highest

1788
01:31:42,571 --> 01:31:44,400
possible motives?
Say No,

1789
01:31:44,401 --> 01:31:46,650
it's an archetype of manifestation of 
cane.

1790
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:49,140
Now he's going to put up a front that 
says,

1791
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,340
well,
I'm your savior.

1792
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:51,300
It's like,
well,

1793
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,700
disruptive people think that Kayden is 
their savior.

1794
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,520
Let's take a break for 15 minutes.
So okay,

1795
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:03,910
so

1796
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:13,470
the next thing that happens,
these stories were so together,

1797
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:19,231
right?
To make something that resembles a 

1798
01:32:19,231 --> 01:32:20,380
coherent text and there's this literary 
analytic.

1799
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:26,830
No,
there's a literary technique known as 

1800
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:28,730
autonomy and autonomy is the 
juxtaposition of two things beside one 

1801
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:31,960
another with the implication that 
because they're juxtaposed,

1802
01:32:31,961 --> 01:32:34,660
they are causally,
they're related in some important matter

1803
01:32:34,661 --> 01:32:39,661
to one another,
and so the stories are sequenced and the

1804
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:44,900
there's an implicit.
The stories are sequenced in a 

1805
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:48,691
particular manner and you might operate 
under the assumption that that 

1806
01:32:49,181 --> 01:32:54,181
sequencing occurred because the 
sequencer who was an editor or a group 

1807
01:32:54,181 --> 01:32:56,320
of editors,
they call that person the redactor,

1808
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:01,340
but they have no idea if it was one 
person or many people who organized 

1809
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:01,720
these texts into something resembling a 
coherent story.

1810
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:06,990
So imagine the story's evolved somewhat 
independently and then they were 

1811
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:10,060
organized so that they produced what 
approximated the coherent narrative.

1812
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:14,440
It's not entirely coherent because there
are paradoxical claims,

1813
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:17,350
say at the level of the sentence.
So for example,

1814
01:33:17,351 --> 01:33:22,351
the creation order in the first story of
genesis isn't exactly the same as the 

1815
01:33:22,351 --> 01:33:26,191
creation order in the second story and 
you know people who insist upon the 

1816
01:33:26,191 --> 01:33:30,301
literal truth of the Bible,
whatever that means is are bothered by 

1817
01:33:30,301 --> 01:33:34,651
those contradictions and turn themselves
into knots trying to iron them out and 

1818
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:34,651
fair enough,
right?

1819
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:35,680
Because you want the story to be 
coherent,

1820
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:38,200
but you know that sort of.

1821
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:44,140
It's important,
but it's also beside the point.

1822
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:49,170
You don't want to focus on one level of 
analysis at the exclusion of all the 

1823
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,991
other levels of analysis.
That's probably the right way to think 

1824
01:33:51,991 --> 01:33:51,991
about it.
Now.

1825
01:33:51,991 --> 01:33:56,520
The fact that these stories are 
sequenced in a particular manner and 

1826
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,341
that that kind of makes sense,
implies that there's some sort of 

1827
01:33:59,341 --> 01:33:59,740
narrative coherence underneath driving 
forward.

1828
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:04,600
Otherwise they would be nothing but a 
random assemblage of stories and they're

1829
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:06,430
by no means random.
That's for sure.

1830
01:34:06,431 --> 01:34:11,431
They're selected and edited and put 
together in a particular manner by and 

1831
01:34:11,431 --> 01:34:13,510
then stored that way and dealt with in a
particular manner by thousands of people

1832
01:34:13,511 --> 01:34:14,530
over many,
many years.

1833
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:18,910
What happens after Cain and Abel is 
while there's an interlude,

1834
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:23,940
which is this interlude and it's kind of
a bridge and there's a lot packed into 

1835
01:34:25,271 --> 01:34:27,430
it too,
although I'm not going to take it apart,

1836
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:32,431
very much so,
so this is after after Cain and Abel 

1837
01:34:32,431 --> 01:34:34,810
Story and it came to pass when men began
to multiply on the face of the earth and

1838
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:39,811
daughters were born unto them,
that the sons of God saw the daughters 

1839
01:34:39,811 --> 01:34:43,021
of men,
that they were fair and then took them 

1840
01:34:43,021 --> 01:34:45,151
wives of all which they chose,
and there were giants in the earth in 

1841
01:34:45,151 --> 01:34:45,151
those days.

1842
01:34:45,151 --> 01:34:50,010
And also after that,
when the sons of God came into the 

1843
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:50,010
daughters of men and they bare children 
to them,

1844
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:52,720
the same became mighty men which are of 
old men of renown.

1845
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,080
Okay,
so I already pointed out that if you go 

1846
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,421
back just a little bit,
you see that the descendants of cain are

1847
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:06,770
represented as founders of of 
institutions.

1848
01:35:06,771 --> 01:35:08,990
Right there are

1849
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:17,720
in our norco builds the city and a and 
add a or Jibo who was the father of 

1850
01:35:18,431 --> 01:35:20,890
those who dwell in tents and of those 
who own cattle.

1851
01:35:20,891 --> 01:35:24,300
And then there's Jubal who's the father 
of all that are musicians and so on.

1852
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:29,320
So one of the things that you see in,
in myths very frequently is that if 

1853
01:35:29,861 --> 01:35:32,800
there's a pattern of behavior that's 
characteristic of the culture,

1854
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:36,370
that pattern of behavior is attributed 
to a hero.

1855
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:39,580
Who was in the past who was the first 
person who did that?

1856
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,580
And so you might say,
well what does that mean?

1857
01:35:42,581 --> 01:35:47,581
Well,
it means in part that there was a first 

1858
01:35:47,581 --> 01:35:49,801
person who did that,
although more likely there was an 

1859
01:35:49,801 --> 01:35:52,711
assemblage of people who aggregated that
particular ability say the ability to 

1860
01:35:52,711 --> 01:35:55,000
play music across a very large amount of
time.

1861
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,490
But these are preliterate people,
right?

1862
01:35:57,491 --> 01:35:59,200
And they're trying to remember the past.

1863
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,440
And so what happens,
Mircea Eliade documented this quite 

1864
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:07,021
well,
is that that aggregation of people gets 

1865
01:36:07,021 --> 01:36:09,790
collapsed into a single Meta person.
And that's the hero of old.

1866
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:15,210
And so,
and we already talked about how this 

1867
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:15,250
works is that you know there are 
admirable people and then you can tell a

1868
01:36:15,251 --> 01:36:20,251
story about an admirable person and then
you can extract a story out of the set 

1869
01:36:20,251 --> 01:36:24,271
of admirable people and you keep 
building higher and higher order 

1870
01:36:24,271 --> 01:36:27,700
admirable people until you extract out 
at the top what's ultimately admirable,

1871
01:36:27,970 --> 01:36:30,160
and this is actually an indication of 
that process.

1872
01:36:30,161 --> 01:36:32,860
So curry,
the giants that are being referred to in

1873
01:36:32,861 --> 01:36:37,861
this particular phrase,
are they heroes of the past who 

1874
01:36:37,861 --> 01:36:40,540
established the traditions on which the 
society exists.

1875
01:36:40,541 --> 01:36:43,480
And so that's all compacted into this 
little paragraph.

1876
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,960
So this little paragraph here,
there were giants in the earth in those 

1877
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,401
days and after that,
when the sons of God came into the 

1878
01:36:53,401 --> 01:36:53,401
daughters of men and they bare children 
to them,

1879
01:36:53,401 --> 01:36:56,080
the same became mighty men which were of
old men of renown.

1880
01:36:56,170 --> 01:37:01,170
While you could hardly say,
I think there's very little difference 

1881
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:04,360
between what I just told you and what 
this story says mean.

1882
01:37:04,361 --> 01:37:08,440
It says it as if it was something that 
literally occurred.

1883
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:12,220
But in some sense it doesn't exactly say
that.

1884
01:37:12,221 --> 01:37:12,880
It says,
well,

1885
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:16,300
the ancient landscape was the landscape 
of heroic adventures.

1886
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,080
It's like,
well,

1887
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,700
we do that to our own history,
right?

1888
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:22,000
I mean even when we consider it literal 
history,

1889
01:37:22,001 --> 01:37:26,440
we don't pick people at random to 
historicize.

1890
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:31,441
We picked people who had some 
substantive impact and tell stories 

1891
01:37:31,441 --> 01:37:36,391
about them and they're emblematic in 
some sense of the spirit of striving 

1892
01:37:36,391 --> 01:37:40,981
that characterize this humanity.
And so you can't have history without 

1893
01:37:40,981 --> 01:37:45,841
something pathologization because the 
mythologized occurs at the level of the 

1894
01:37:45,841 --> 01:37:50,551
selection of the entities about which 
you're going to weave the historical 

1895
01:37:50,551 --> 01:37:50,560
tale.
So.

1896
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:52,010
Okay.
So anyway,

1897
01:37:52,011 --> 01:37:55,230
so there's little,
there's a little interlude there that,

1898
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:58,500
that talks about the appearance of 
heroes in the past,

1899
01:37:58,501 --> 01:38:00,930
but then it's just,
that's just done with very,

1900
01:38:00,931 --> 01:38:05,630
very rapidly.
And then we move into another story.

1901
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:10,040
This is the story of Noah.
So the way it looks to me is that

1902
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:18,060
the part of genesis that I'm going to 
talk to you about ends with the flood 

1903
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:22,551
myth and also with the Tower of Babel.
And so the flood myth is the desert 

1904
01:38:22,551 --> 01:38:24,720
demolition of everything that came 
before and the Tower of Babel.

1905
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:28,980
In some sense is exactly the same thing,
so there's too chaotic.

1906
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,950
I mean it's like the fall occurs in 
stages.

1907
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:36,980
There's paradise and then Adam and eve 
fall into culture and then Cain and 

1908
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:40,911
Abel.
Cain falls into chaos and then the 

1909
01:38:40,911 --> 01:38:42,990
entire society falls into chaos and the 
flood comes in,

1910
01:38:42,991 --> 01:38:47,991
the Tower of Babel is produced,
and then that's the end of the truly 

1911
01:38:47,991 --> 01:38:51,570
archaic parts of the Bible,
and so what that seems to me,

1912
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:54,090
what's happening,
it's very sophisticated,

1913
01:38:54,091 --> 01:38:59,091
is that there's an implicit causal 
narrative being warrant woven about the 

1914
01:38:59,581 --> 01:39:04,581
manner in which Kane responds and the 
probability that human beings are going 

1915
01:39:04,581 --> 01:39:09,141
to deteriorate and the flood is going to
come so and God saw that the wickedness 

1916
01:39:09,141 --> 01:39:13,170
of man was great in the earth and that 
every imagination of the thoughts of his

1917
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:18,171
heart was only evil continually and it 
repented the Lord that he had made man 

1918
01:39:18,511 --> 01:39:23,511
on earth and it grieved him at his heart
while we already encountered a story 

1919
01:39:23,511 --> 01:39:23,511
like that once already,
right?

1920
01:39:23,511 --> 01:39:27,910
That happened in the Marta story where 
timeout and ab sue give rise to the 

1921
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:32,970
elder gods and they kill app suit,
which was not very smart idea,

1922
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:38,210
right?
They demolished the substructure of 

1923
01:39:38,210 --> 01:39:39,870
their stable society and of course chaos
comes flooding back.

1924
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:45,140
Well,
what does it mean to say that human 

1925
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,710
beings,
let's see,

1926
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,390
to say that

1927
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:55,020
the wickedness of man was great in the 
earth and that every imagination of the 

1928
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:58,261
hearts of his thoughts of his heart was 
only evil continually is not much 

1929
01:39:58,261 --> 01:40:02,011
different than to say that people are 
acting in a manner that demolishes the 

1930
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:02,860
cultural structure.
Now,

1931
01:40:02,861 --> 01:40:07,861
we've already even pointed out that the 
cultural structure that happens in this 

1932
01:40:07,861 --> 01:40:11,020
story was produced by the heroic giants 
of the past.

1933
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:16,080
Right,
and we've also noted that what Cain is 

1934
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:19,321
objecting to in this came like manner is
the social structure which isn't 

1935
01:40:19,321 --> 01:40:22,711
rewarding and properly and the 
transcendence that's above that and the 

1936
01:40:22,711 --> 01:40:24,370
spirit of logos itself.
He's rejecting all that.

1937
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:28,180
Okay,
so the issue here is that when that sort

1938
01:40:28,181 --> 01:40:32,620
of evil is produced exactly as when 
Appsu is slade,

1939
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:35,140
slade,
I guess that's right by the,

1940
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:37,690
by the elder.
Gods then all hell breaks loose.

1941
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,690
All chaos comes back now.
Tie Matt,

1942
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:44,760
if you remember correctly,
is the god of the salt water goddess of 

1943
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,761
the salt water,
and so the return of Tire Matt and the 

1944
01:40:47,761 --> 01:40:49,120
flood,
our mythologically similar ideas.

1945
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:53,950
Now Elliot has taken apart flood myths 
from all over the world and he two

1946
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,700
brilliant comments about them and 
they're also akin to some degree to what

1947
01:40:57,701 --> 01:41:01,330
you can see in the Egyptian story about 
seth and the corruption of the state.

1948
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:06,900
So because the Egyptians figured out 
that there's always a power working 

1949
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:07,960
within this state,
let's say that corrupted it.

1950
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:10,540
Now that was set and that was always 
working for its overthrow.

1951
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:15,630
It's an idea like Satan and I said that 
the word Seth becomes the word Satan 

1952
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:17,050
through Coptic Christianity.
So,

1953
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:22,860
so the iliads idea was this,
that things fall apart of their own 

1954
01:41:22,961 --> 01:41:27,961
accord merely because they age that 
that's the first motif in the flood 

1955
01:41:27,961 --> 01:41:28,750
story.
And that's only to say that if you build

1956
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:33,751
something,
it indicates if you build something and 

1957
01:41:33,751 --> 01:41:34,300
you just leave it the hell alone,
it will assume not work.

1958
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:35,680
Right?
And that's entropy.

1959
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:40,950
So one of the reasons that the flood 
always threatens is merely because of 

1960
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:45,061
entropy and you see that reflected in 
the Egyptian story because one of the 

1961
01:41:45,061 --> 01:41:45,061
reasons that,
oh,

1962
01:41:45,061 --> 01:41:49,960
cyrus falls prey to seth is because he's
old.

1963
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:54,460
He was a great hero when he was young 
and created the Egyptian state,

1964
01:41:54,461 --> 01:41:57,940
like the men of renown.
But now he's old and it's worse.

1965
01:41:57,941 --> 01:42:00,190
He's willfully blind,
but that's the next thing.

1966
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:05,460
But the fact that he's old is just to 
start things fall apart of their own 

1967
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:06,400
accord.
So once something is given to you,

1968
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:11,020
you have to maintain it just to ensure 
its continued existence.

1969
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:16,021
And so you actually,
you actually have a contract with most 

1970
01:42:16,021 --> 01:42:16,180
of the things that you own.
It's like a,

1971
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:21,450
it's like a moral contract.
Let's say you have a car or you've 

1972
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:24,550
decided that you're going to sacrifice 
to have the car and so you've.

1973
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:29,640
You've performed an ethical calculation,
but the car was only worth the sacrifice

1974
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:34,980
as long as it functions as a car.
And so what that means is that to 

1975
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,310
justify the sacrifice you've made,
to have the car,

1976
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,930
you have to maintain the car.

1977
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:43,260
Because otherwise you're acting out the 
proposition that the thing that you 

1978
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:45,400
sacrificed for actually didn't have any 
value and so your obliterating that as a

1979
01:42:45,401 --> 01:42:50,401
useful contract and you run into the 
situation where the car will just 

1980
01:42:50,401 --> 01:42:53,380
deteriorate of its own accord and then 
you won't have a car at all.

1981
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:54,610
Well,
so let's say,

1982
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,870
how do you speed the process by which 
your car deteriorates?

1983
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:00,070
Well,
that's easy.

1984
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:03,580
You're driving it along the road and it 
starts to make a ticking noise,

1985
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:03,990
tick,
tick,

1986
01:43:03,991 --> 01:43:04,360
tick,
tick,

1987
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:09,361
tick,
and you think I should go have that 

1988
01:43:09,361 --> 01:43:09,361
ticking noise checked because you've 
heard it and then you think,

1989
01:43:09,361 --> 01:43:10,480
no,
it won't matter.

1990
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:11,680
It's like,
yeah,

1991
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:17,250
probably it'll matter.
And what does matter mean while it 

1992
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:17,290
matter his mother,
that's chaos to you,

1993
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:22,291
no matter,
but what it means is that that little 

1994
01:43:22,291 --> 01:43:23,560
ticking noise is the birthplace of tie a
mat in your car.

1995
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:28,560
That's a good way of thinking about it 
is that it's your first indication that 

1996
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,400
the dragon of chaos is going to manifest
itself in your car.

1997
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:33,100
That happens when you.
I've got a funny story about that,

1998
01:43:33,101 --> 01:43:37,960
so I had a friend in in graduate school,
someone I really liked,

1999
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:43,230
but I wouldn't call her Mcelliott and 
mechanically inclined let's put it that 

2000
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:46,390
way and she had an old Honda and those 
things were notorious for rusting out.

2001
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:48,760
This is 30 years ago when they were 
first produced.

2002
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:53,761
They weren't adapted well to Canadian 
winters and we used to go into her car 

2003
01:43:53,761 --> 01:43:57,821
and her Honda and it got a little on the
scary side because it was so rusty 

2004
01:43:57,821 --> 01:44:01,151
underneath that you can actually see 
through the floorboards and that 

2005
01:44:01,151 --> 01:44:03,320
actually made me nervous because if you 
can see through the floorboards,

2006
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,040
that means that they're not really 
floorboards.

2007
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:11,050
What they are is like rust and so I 
mentioned the fact that that might be a 

2008
01:44:11,691 --> 01:44:14,240
problem to her a couple of times,
but she was sort of blind about it.

2009
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:17,930
And one day she was driving down St 
Lawrence Street in Montreal,

2010
01:44:17,931 --> 01:44:20,510
which is the main street running roughly
north and south.

2011
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:25,750
And her hood popped up.
It bent and popped up spontaneously and 

2012
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:29,951
so she was really curious about that.
And so she was with this friend of hers 

2013
01:44:29,951 --> 01:44:31,490
who was just as clueless mechanically as
she was,

2014
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,740
which is really quite remarkably 
clueless.

2015
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:39,130
And so they pulled off into a service 
station and had the guy come out and 

2016
01:44:39,130 --> 01:44:39,330
look at it and well,
he,

2017
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:44,620
he opened the hood obviously.
And what had happened was the body had 

2018
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:45,800
fallen off the frame.
So.

2019
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:49,220
And what had happened was the shock,
which is like supposed to be attached to

2020
01:44:49,221 --> 01:44:51,290
the car,
had pushed up through the,

2021
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:53,810
through the,
the hood.

2022
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:58,650
So literally the car body had fallen 
onto the ground and.

2023
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:01,040
But she was,
she managed to drive the cart.

2024
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:01,910
Okay.
So look,

2025
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:07,150
that's,
I wouldn't exactly call that willful 

2026
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:08,060
blindness because perhaps there is an 
element of willful blindness.

2027
01:45:08,061 --> 01:45:09,470
She didn't know anything about 
mechanics,

2028
01:45:09,471 --> 01:45:11,000
but you get the point,
right?

2029
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:13,940
It's like,
let's say she would have been in a fatal

2030
01:45:13,941 --> 01:45:15,320
accident.
You might say,

2031
01:45:15,321 --> 01:45:18,410
well you can shake your fist at God for 
producing the circumstances,

2032
01:45:18,411 --> 01:45:23,411
but you know,
the fact that you could see through the 

2033
01:45:23,411 --> 01:45:23,500
floorboards,
that's probably something that you might

2034
01:45:23,501 --> 01:45:26,390
have paid attention to.
And so it's always the question is,

2035
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:31,540
if things fall apart around you,
to what degree is it the mere tendency 

2036
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:35,180
of things to degenerate entropically 
because they do that of their own accord

2037
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:40,510
or have you sped the probability of 
decay by failing to pay attention when a

2038
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:44,060
little snake manifests itself inside 
your paradise.

2039
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:46,130
And it's always.
It's always a question.

2040
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:49,160
So here's a.
here's an example,

2041
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:50,780
an interesting example.
I think.

2042
01:45:50,781 --> 01:45:55,781
So I thought about the actual floods,
like the New Orleans flood.

2043
01:45:56,540 --> 01:46:01,540
Okay.
So New Orleans is built where there are 

2044
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:04,391
floods,
everyone knows that and it's a major 

2045
01:46:04,391 --> 01:46:06,341
port in the United States.
A huge part of American trade goes down 

2046
01:46:06,341 --> 01:46:06,980
the river to New Orleans.
So there was a reason it was built where

2047
01:46:06,981 --> 01:46:11,981
it was,
even though it was a dangerous place to 

2048
01:46:11,981 --> 01:46:11,981
build it.
And in order to maintain New Orleans,

2049
01:46:11,981 --> 01:46:13,520
they had to build these levees that kept
the water back.

2050
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:16,190
Now the American,
what is it?

2051
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:19,940
American Army Corps of Engineers,
if I remember correctly,

2052
01:46:19,941 --> 01:46:23,480
it was responsible for building and 
maintaining the levies and the dikes.

2053
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:27,050
Okay.
Holland is also built underwater.

2054
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:32,320
As you may or may not know,
and they built huge dykes to keep the 

2055
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,130
ocean back so they can reclaim the land 
and that's basically Holland.

2056
01:46:34,131 --> 01:46:39,131
Holland is an unbelievably organized 
society and part of the reason is is it 

2057
01:46:39,131 --> 01:46:43,381
isn't land.
It's underwater and so if you're not 

2058
01:46:43,381 --> 01:46:45,551
bloody well awake in Holland,
then the ocean comes in and you all 

2059
01:46:45,551 --> 01:46:49,001
drowned and so the Dutch are very,
very careful about such things and they 

2060
01:46:49,001 --> 01:46:50,050
build their dikes so that they

2061
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:55,070
calculate storm intensity and then they 
calculate the intensity of the worst 

2062
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:58,911
storm in 10,000
years and then they build the dikes to 

2063
01:46:58,911 --> 01:47:02,151
withstand that storm.
The Army Corps of Engineers built the 

2064
01:47:02,151 --> 01:47:05,301
dikes in New Orleans to withstand the 
worst storm in 100 years and they knew 

2065
01:47:05,301 --> 01:47:09,381
that was insufficient and New Orleans,
Louisiana is an unbelievably corrupt 

2066
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:13,371
state and you can't dump money in there 
to fix things because people just steal 

2067
01:47:13,371 --> 01:47:14,490
the money.
So and then nothing gets fixed.

2068
01:47:14,491 --> 01:47:19,491
And so then what happens?
There's a hurricane and then what 

2069
01:47:19,491 --> 01:47:19,491
happens?
There's a flood and everybody says,

2070
01:47:19,491 --> 01:47:21,870
why would God send the flood?
And the answer to that is,

2071
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,330
well,
was there a flood or where the dikes not

2072
01:47:24,331 --> 01:47:27,150
high enough?
And that's what's so interesting is that

2073
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:32,390
it's always,
this is a great father versus great 

2074
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:34,500
mother conundrum.
If the system fails,

2075
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:40,160
is it because of the surround 
overwhelming the system or is it because

2076
01:47:40,201 --> 01:47:44,370
the system was insufficiently awake and 
doomed itself?

2077
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Okay,
so elliot is take on the flood myth is 

2078
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,161
this,
God comes along and floods the world 

2079
01:47:52,161 --> 01:47:52,161
periodically.
Why?

2080
01:47:52,161 --> 01:47:54,120
And that that's the catastrophic influx 
of chaos,

2081
01:47:54,121 --> 01:47:59,121
right?
Chaos will wipe you out from time to 

2082
01:47:59,121 --> 01:47:59,121
time.
Why?

2083
01:47:59,121 --> 01:48:03,320
Well,
entropy does in your conceptual schemes 

2084
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:03,810
and your willful blindness speeds the 
process.

2085
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:06,320
And remember that's what the Egyptians 
said about.

2086
01:48:06,321 --> 01:48:06,930
Oh,
Cyrus,

2087
01:48:06,931 --> 01:48:08,460
right?
They said he was,

2088
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:09,510
oh,
he was a great king,

2089
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:11,820
a man of renowned,
but he was old,

2090
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:18,170
but he was also willfully blind and it 
was the combination of his agent is 

2091
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:21,720
willful blindness that allowed seth to 
chop them up into pieces and depose him.

2092
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:23,490
And so with that,
fair enough,

2093
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:24,690
it's brilliant,
right?

2094
01:48:24,691 --> 01:48:29,691
It's like why does states fall apart?
Because the structures get old and no 

2095
01:48:29,691 --> 01:48:33,480
one's taken care of them,
and people have their eyes closed and so

2096
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:34,590
it's the same situation.

2097
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:36,270
It's the same situation in the flood 
myths.

2098
01:48:36,271 --> 01:48:36,930
It's like,
well,

2099
01:48:36,931 --> 01:48:38,010
yeah,
things fall apart.

2100
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:43,050
They're going to flood,
but if you were awake enough and you 

2101
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:46,401
were on top of it,
then you could continually stave that 

2102
01:48:46,401 --> 01:48:48,060
off and actually partly what you're 
doing because you're alive,

2103
01:48:48,061 --> 01:48:51,750
is staving off entropy like you're an 
anti and tropic process.

2104
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:57,050
It's a really good definition of life.
There's a great physicist named Erwin 

2105
01:48:57,050 --> 01:48:57,570
Schrodinger who wrote a book called what
is life,

2106
01:48:57,571 --> 01:48:59,400
and that's the fundamental thesis of the
book.

2107
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:01,530
You're always trying to stave off 
entropy.

2108
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:03,510
What's the best way to stave off 
entropy?

2109
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:04,770
Decay,
chaos.

2110
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:07,620
Keep your eyes open.
That's the rule.

2111
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,690
Shut your eyes especially to things you 
know.

2112
01:49:09,691 --> 01:49:14,691
You should see the flood comes and 
that's the evil of man that's laid out 

2113
01:49:14,691 --> 01:49:18,000
in this story because that's the worst 
sort of perhaps it's not the worst.

2114
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,640
It's one of the primary sin,
so to speak,

2115
01:49:20,641 --> 01:49:23,490
that will bring about the flood.
We already talked about the other things

2116
01:49:23,491 --> 01:49:25,470
that characterized canes,
attitude,

2117
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:30,700
so cool,

2118
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:39,750
so God's upset because he had made man 
on earth and it grieved him at his 

2119
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:39,750
heart,
and God says,

2120
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:44,191
I will destroy man,
whom I've created from the face of the 

2121
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:46,591
earth,
both man and beast and the creeping 

2122
01:49:46,591 --> 01:49:47,020
thing and the fowls of the air for I 
repent.

2123
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:52,170
I've made them.
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the 

2124
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:52,170
Lord.
Okay,

2125
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:54,770
so that's an interesting thing.
So here what we have is the.

2126
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:59,590
The question is the whole world's in 
chaos at this point,

2127
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:03,070
right in this point in the story.
And the chaos is a multiple sorts.

2128
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:08,310
It arose from the fall.
It rose from the emergence of self 

2129
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:08,310
consciousness.
It emerged safe.

2130
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:11,590
It rose from the sins of cane,
like things are not going well.

2131
01:50:11,591 --> 01:50:16,591
It's multiple levels of collapse and 
it's got to the point where God saying 

2132
01:50:16,591 --> 01:50:20,371
this is a mess,
like it's such a mess that the whole 

2133
01:50:20,371 --> 01:50:20,371
thing has to be washed away.

2134
01:50:20,371 --> 01:50:22,630
The first fall wasn't enough.
Even canes collapse wasn't enough.

2135
01:50:22,631 --> 01:50:25,330
We're going to just scrub the whole 
bloody thing clean.

2136
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:30,690
So it's,
it's the ultimate in traumatic 

2137
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:30,690
collapses.
The question is,

2138
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:35,130
well,
what do you do in the face of the 

2139
01:50:35,130 --> 01:50:36,490
ultimate in traumatic collapses and the 
answers in the story.

2140
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:40,870
So Noah is someone who finds fate,
who finds favor in the eyes of God.

2141
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,070
So he's like,
Abel,

2142
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:44,050
there's something that Noah is doing 
right.

2143
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:46,960
It's going to enable him to ride out the
storm.

2144
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,540
And so the question here,
it's the same question.

2145
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:52,480
Do you want to have a life where there's
newell storms

2146
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:56,890
or do you want to have a life where you 
can ride out the storms?

2147
01:50:57,790 --> 01:50:59,140
That's the issue,
right?

2148
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:01,210
Are you behind the dikes or do you build
a boat?

2149
01:51:01,230 --> 01:51:03,300
Do you captain the boat?
That's the same idea.

2150
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:08,350
So the idea here is that the thing that 
rides out the chaos is the thing that 

2151
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:11,320
builds and captains the boat.
It's another dominance hierarchy idea.

2152
01:51:11,321 --> 01:51:13,450
What should be at the top?
Well,

2153
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:18,590
it's,
it's the top of something that doesn't 

2154
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:18,590
get flooded out as well.
What should be at the top?

2155
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:22,770
Well,
it's to be the boat builder and to be 

2156
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:23,140
the captain of the boat,
it's not to be hidden from the flood.

2157
01:51:23,170 --> 01:51:24,640
Precisely.
And so,

2158
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:25,510
I mean,
here's,

2159
01:51:25,511 --> 01:51:26,830
uh,
here's,

2160
01:51:26,831 --> 01:51:29,320
here's something to think about.
Identity,

2161
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:33,010
identity politics,
because that's what we're up to our neck

2162
01:51:33,011 --> 01:51:33,910
in.
Okay?

2163
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:37,810
Are you who you are?
Can I box you it?

2164
01:51:38,110 --> 01:51:41,110
Will you accept that as an identity?
So I could do that lots of ways.

2165
01:51:41,230 --> 01:51:42,520
You're male,
you're Asia,

2166
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:43,930
you're young,
right?

2167
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:49,020
There's things about you that I can 
derive because of your putative 

2168
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:52,681
membership in a set of different groups.
The problem with doing that is that the 

2169
01:51:52,681 --> 01:51:56,050
number of groups that I can assign 
youtube is without end.

2170
01:51:56,890 --> 01:52:01,120
So I have to pick arbitrary groups to 
assign you to and you can accept that if

2171
01:52:01,121 --> 01:52:06,121
you want,
but there's no evidence that those are 

2172
01:52:06,121 --> 01:52:07,921
the proper canonical groups.
But maybe you're happy about that 

2173
01:52:07,921 --> 01:52:10,891
because now you've been assigned 
membership in a group and that's your 

2174
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:10,891
identity.
Okay?

2175
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:11,620
So the question is,
well,

2176
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:16,420
fine,
what happens when that identity is flown

2177
01:52:16,421 --> 01:52:18,760
into pieces?
Then what?

2178
01:52:20,630 --> 01:52:21,950
Well,
here's,

2179
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:26,980
here's the answer to some degree and 
this is the answer that's embedded in 

2180
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:31,631
the story of Noah.
If you want it withstand chaos.

2181
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:39,440
Do you want to be who you are or do you 
want to be the thing that changes who 

2182
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:43,701
you are constantly.
That's the question and that's the 

2183
01:52:43,701 --> 01:52:43,701
difference.
That's the difference.

2184
01:52:43,701 --> 01:52:46,100
There's a categorical difference in are

2185
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:51,100
you who you are or are you the thing 
that could continually be more than you 

2186
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,990
are and that's the thing that isn't the 
stable identity.

2187
01:52:53,991 --> 01:52:58,991
It's not the initial state.
It's also not the state of being in 

2188
01:52:58,991 --> 01:53:00,770
chaos that nihilistic state,
let's say,

2189
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:06,160
and it's not even the state of 
reformulation that occurs after you've 

2190
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:09,461
gone through the process.
It's the state of continually going 

2191
01:53:09,461 --> 01:53:12,971
through the process so you can identify 
with the thing that trends you could 

2192
01:53:12,971 --> 01:53:17,201
identify,
identify with the thing that you are or 

2193
01:53:17,201 --> 01:53:18,170
you can identify with the thing that 
transforms who you are.

2194
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:24,430
Right,
and that's the same as the state 

2195
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:24,650
subjugating itself to the individual 
because the individual is the thing that

2196
01:53:24,651 --> 01:53:27,360
transforms the state and what the state 
should do.

2197
01:53:27,361 --> 01:53:32,361
The states necessary because obviously 
it organizes all of us into peaceful 

2198
01:53:32,361 --> 01:53:34,130
cooperation and competition,
the states necessary.

2199
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:37,340
Then the question is,
is the state the highest good?

2200
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:38,840
And the answer to that is,
well,

2201
01:53:38,841 --> 01:53:41,630
it can't be because it's old and dead 
and blind,

2202
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:43,850
and so if the state becomes the highest 
good,

2203
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:48,410
then you're occupied by the spirit of 
something that's old and dead and blind.

2204
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,440
Well,
that's not only not good for you because

2205
01:53:51,441 --> 01:53:56,441
then you're old and dead and blind,
but it's also bad for the state because 

2206
01:53:56,441 --> 01:53:57,350
as soon as the state gets old and dead 
and blind,

2207
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:00,680
God gets unhappy with it and the chaos 
comes in and washes it away.

2208
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:05,120
So it seems like a bad solution.
So what's the proper solution?

2209
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:10,870
You subordinate your group identity to 
the identity that transforms your 

2210
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:10,870
identity,
right?

2211
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:15,790
And this state subordinates.
It's power to the vision and 

2212
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:18,590
articulation of the individual because 
that's what revives the state.

2213
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:22,460
And so that's what these stories are 
trying to stumble towards.

2214
01:54:22,461 --> 01:54:27,461
Roughly speaking.
So Noah found grace in the eyes of the 

2215
01:54:27,461 --> 01:54:27,461
Lord.

2216
01:54:27,461 --> 01:54:29,720
Why?
While Noah was a just man and perfect in

2217
01:54:29,721 --> 01:54:31,970
his generations and Noah walked with 
God,

2218
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:35,720
now you remember in the Adam and Eve 
story,

2219
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:42,010
Adam was walking with God to begin with,
but then he got all self conscious and 

2220
01:54:42,010 --> 01:54:43,910
hid behind a bush and when God came to 
walk with him,

2221
01:54:43,911 --> 01:54:47,260
he blamed his wife for his 
insufficiencies,

2222
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:50,090
which I still think that's such an 
unbelievably comic story.

2223
01:54:50,091 --> 01:54:52,790
I just can't believe it.
It's so absolutely ridiculous,

2224
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,240
but that's exactly what happened.
While you have no adhere and Noah.

2225
01:54:56,510 --> 01:55:01,510
Noah is like a counter,
another counterpart to some degree to 

2226
01:55:01,510 --> 01:55:04,541
kate as adjustment and he walks with God
and so he's oriented properly and 

2227
01:55:04,541 --> 01:55:06,500
because he is oriented properly,
when the flood comes,

2228
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:10,820
not only does he managed to get through 
it as an individual,

2229
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:15,300
he manages to get through it with his 
family and he saves and while he saves,

2230
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:16,760
he roughly saves the world.

2231
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:18,620
That's how the story puts it forward.
I mean,

2232
01:55:18,621 --> 01:55:20,750
it's an arc and it's full of animals and
you know,

2233
01:55:20,751 --> 01:55:23,540
it's,
it's got a child's story element to it.

2234
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:25,670
In fact,
I suspect it probably was the story that

2235
01:55:25,671 --> 01:55:27,230
was primarily told to children.
You know,

2236
01:55:27,231 --> 01:55:30,410
it's like a fable,
but it's a fable with punch,

2237
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:32,780
like the Pinocchio Story,
a fable with punch.

2238
01:55:32,781 --> 01:55:33,830
It's like,
well,

2239
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:36,170
yeah,
there's gonna be a flood.

2240
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:39,140
There's always a flood.
There's always a flood.

2241
01:55:39,141 --> 01:55:41,420
So who are you?
If you want to get through the flood,

2242
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:44,220
well then you're noah.
You're the that builds the boat.

2243
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:48,120
You're the thing that acts justly.
You're the thing that walks with God.

2244
01:55:48,121 --> 01:55:51,540
We already know what that means.
You identify with the transcendent.

2245
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:52,650
That's Japan.
Oh,

2246
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:57,720
pointing to the star before the 
transformation process that occurs with 

2247
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:02,001
Pinocchio.
It's you're identifying with a 

2248
01:56:02,001 --> 01:56:04,071
benevolent spirit of the state,
so you have a relationship with the 

2249
01:56:04,071 --> 01:56:05,250
transcendent and the benevolent spirit 
of the state,

2250
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:10,430
and you're also identified with the 
capacity to generate chaos out of order 

2251
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:12,840
and the reverse.
That's what it means to walk with God.

2252
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:15,300
Roughly speaking,
it's across all of those dimensions.

2253
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:20,510
So what does that do?
It gives you the power to withstand the 

2254
01:56:20,510 --> 01:56:24,501
flood and to bring people and and being 
itself and civilization along with you.

2255
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,880
And that's the story of Noah.
So it's a precursor,

2256
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:30,960
it's,
it's another.

2257
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:34,020
Abel is a precursor to the idea of the 
Redeeming Messiah,

2258
01:56:34,230 --> 01:56:39,230
right?
Noah is a precursor to the idea of the 

2259
01:56:39,230 --> 01:56:39,230
redeeming messiah.

2260
01:56:39,230 --> 01:56:42,780
You could think about the best pro tow,
Messiah's or pro tow Meta heroes,

2261
01:56:42,781 --> 01:56:45,300
something like that.
And they manifest themselves.

2262
01:56:45,301 --> 01:56:50,301
They're part of the giants that walked 
in the past and they're embodied their 

2263
01:56:50,301 --> 01:56:54,771
attempts embodied in story to elucidate 
this triangle that's at the top of the 

2264
01:56:55,051 --> 01:56:55,770
pyramid,
right?

2265
01:56:55,771 --> 01:56:57,510
The eye that's at the top of the 
pyramid.

2266
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:01,440
So,
so I won't tell you the rest of the Noah

2267
01:57:01,441 --> 01:57:05,380
story because I don't think it's 
necessary for us to,

2268
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:07,570
to,
to,

2269
01:57:08,290 --> 01:57:11,640
to delve into the more narrative 
details,

2270
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:15,870
um,
but I do want to.

2271
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:21,680
So it's a pretty rough.
I can point it out in some pretty rough 

2272
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:21,680
story.
Every living substance was destroyed,

2273
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:26,031
which was upon the face of the ground,
both men and cattle and creeping things 

2274
01:57:26,031 --> 01:57:27,180
and the follow the heaven and they were 
destroyed from the earth.

2275
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:30,660
And Noah only remained alive and they 
that were with him in the Ark.

2276
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:32,800
It's very terrifying story,
you know,

2277
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,050
and,
and,

2278
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:39,070
uh,
it's worth attending to because we are 

2279
01:57:39,070 --> 01:57:39,070
currently in a period of extreme chaos.

2280
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:41,820
So,
okay,

2281
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:44,460
so anyways,
works out God's had enough.

2282
01:57:44,461 --> 01:57:46,830
He's killed,
he's killed enough of everything.

2283
01:57:46,831 --> 01:57:49,290
It's a,
it's a traumatic occurrence.

2284
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:52,590
We can put it that way.
The waters recede and God,

2285
01:57:52,830 --> 01:57:57,830
a God has done for the time being.
And so then this is what happens at the 

2286
01:57:57,830 --> 01:58:01,800
end.
So the arc settle down there,

2287
01:58:01,801 --> 01:58:05,460
unloading it and creation is reborn.
And so then you think,

2288
01:58:05,461 --> 01:58:07,890
well,
what sets things right?

2289
01:58:07,891 --> 01:58:09,510
Again,
between man and God,

2290
01:58:09,511 --> 01:58:14,511
and the story says that Noah built an 
altar unto the Lord and took of every 

2291
01:58:14,511 --> 01:58:18,270
clean beast and of every clean foul and 
offered burnt offerings on the altar.

2292
01:58:18,271 --> 01:58:23,271
So it's the same idea here.
It's that same idea that you started to 

2293
01:58:23,271 --> 01:58:26,571
see emerging in the Cain and Abel Story.
What is it that sets things right 

2294
01:58:26,571 --> 01:58:27,060
between man and God?
Sacrifice.

2295
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:28,940
So the flood comes,
then no,

2296
01:58:28,941 --> 01:58:31,470
it makes the proper sacrifices,
right?

2297
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:33,780
It's part of reestablishing the proper 
order.

2298
01:58:33,781 --> 01:58:38,160
He makes the proper sacrifices and so 
god is happy with the sacrifices,

2299
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,800
which is a good thing,
given that he's pretty ordinary

2300
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:42,540
and,
um,

2301
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:46,830
and,
and the Lord smelled a sweet savor.

2302
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:51,860
So remember I told you before that the 
reason people thought that this would 

2303
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:55,251
work for us because the smoke would rise
up and God would be able to detect 

2304
01:58:55,251 --> 01:58:57,300
whether or not the,
the sacrifice was of high quality.

2305
01:58:57,330 --> 01:58:59,730
While you have it written right there,
you know,

2306
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:00,900
very,
uh,

2307
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:04,200
concretized image of,
of,

2308
01:59:04,650 --> 01:59:06,960
of the archetypal spirit,
right?

2309
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:09,840
The Lord smelled a sweet savor and said 
in his heart,

2310
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:13,230
I will not curse the ground anymore for 
man's sake,

2311
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,500
for the imagination of Man's heart is 
evil from his youth.

2312
01:59:16,530 --> 01:59:19,980
Neither will I against smite anymore 
every living thing as I have done.

2313
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:25,220
So that's pretty nice is noah sacrifice 
actually calms down God down to the 

2314
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:26,520
point where he says,
well,

2315
01:59:26,521 --> 01:59:28,410
I'm not going to wipe everything out 
again.

2316
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:30,060
It's like,
well,

2317
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:31,710
fair enough,
you know,

2318
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:37,040
but I would consider it somewhat of a 
tenuous contract because we've seen more

2319
01:59:37,291 --> 01:59:42,291
than one example in the recent century 
where we came bloody close to wiping 

2320
01:59:42,511 --> 01:59:46,160
everything out again,
while the earth remains,

2321
01:59:46,161 --> 01:59:48,680
seed time and harvest and cold and heat 
in summer and winter,

2322
01:59:49,290 --> 01:59:51,350
day and night shall not cease neither.
Again,

2323
01:59:51,351 --> 01:59:54,650
will I be any more every living thing as
I have done.

2324
01:59:55,730 --> 01:59:57,230
So.
All right,

2325
01:59:57,500 --> 01:59:59,900
so that's that.

2326
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:05,030
He basically tells noah the same thing 
again,

2327
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:07,550
that he told Adam at the beginning of,
of the,

2328
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:10,640
of the genesis story.
So fine.

2329
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:15,700
And then he,
he tells them a bunch of rules which I 

2330
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:15,700
could go into,
but at the moment I won't,

2331
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:16,250
but I want to show you that

2332
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:23,470
basically what God,
I guess I should do this to some degree.

2333
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:30,390
God lays out a bunch of rules so you 
could think about it as a precursor to 

2334
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:31,660
what happens in the story of exodus 
where the 10 commandments are revealed.

2335
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,880
So this is like a foreshadowing of that 
story.

2336
02:00:35,070 --> 02:00:36,940
No.
What makes the proper sacrifices?

2337
02:00:36,941 --> 02:00:37,750
And God says,
okay,

2338
02:00:37,751 --> 02:00:38,680
fine.
Here's the rules.

2339
02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:43,120
Follow these rules and then they're laid
out and things will go okay with you.

2340
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:45,340
That's the covenant.
That's the agreement between the end.

2341
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:48,550
You could say that's the agreement 
between the individual and the spirit of

2342
02:00:48,551 --> 02:00:50,430
the state.
That's one way of looking at it,

2343
02:00:50,431 --> 02:00:55,431
but it's not enough because it isn't 
merely the spirit of the state that's 

2344
02:00:55,431 --> 02:00:57,460
being negotiated with.
It's the spirit of the state.

2345
02:00:57,850 --> 02:01:02,850
It's the spirit of that which transcends
the state and it's the spirit of the 

2346
02:01:02,850 --> 02:01:03,430
moral order that's within the 
individual.

2347
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:06,160
All three of those things are being 
negotiated simultaneously.

2348
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:10,120
The proper sacrifices are made,
the proper rules are laid out,

2349
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:15,330
and the.
And the idea is that there'll be a good 

2350
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:15,330
balance between order and chaos as a 
consequence,

2351
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:17,080
as long as people continue to play by 
the rules.

2352
02:01:17,530 --> 02:01:21,520
So that's the awkward fundamentally so 
far that seems to work out.

2353
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:24,630
And then

2354
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:27,480
this one I think is extremely 
interesting.

2355
02:01:27,481 --> 02:01:30,540
It's also very short.
It took me a very,

2356
02:01:30,541 --> 02:01:33,540
very long time to,
to understand this.

2357
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:40,220
Alright,
so this is after

2358
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:45,220
the story of Noah.
So what happens is you get this 

2359
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:46,750
situation where things descend into 
chaos and there's a great flood.

2360
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:48,890
So that's sort of like the ultimate 
chaos story.

2361
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:53,600
And I think of it as a if there's.
So you mentioned when things fall apart,

2362
02:01:53,601 --> 02:01:56,660
one possibility is that they fall into 
chaos.

2363
02:01:57,230 --> 02:01:59,450
The other possibility is something like

2364
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:03,360
they become hyper

2365
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:07,950
conceptualized in hyper orderly and so 
then the state itself,

2366
02:02:07,951 --> 02:02:11,910
which would be the antidote to chaos 
actually becomes a source of pathology.

2367
02:02:12,330 --> 02:02:17,330
And I think that that's what's being 
hinted at in the story of the Tower of 

2368
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:21,140
Babel.
So here's what happens is that human 

2369
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:21,140
beings,
I'll read it to you,

2370
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:23,100
this is,
this has to do with Noah's descendants.

2371
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:28,220
It's a flip into another story.
And it came to pass as they journeyed 

2372
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:28,590
from the east.
Oh yes.

2373
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:32,820
And all the days of Noah were 950 years 
and he died.

2374
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:37,500
New Story and the whole earth was of one
language and one speech.

2375
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:41,820
Everybody is getting along fine in their
tribal organization.

2376
02:02:41,821 --> 02:02:46,821
Let's say it's homogenous.
They can all speak to one another and 

2377
02:02:46,821 --> 02:02:49,791
they all speak the same language.
And it came to pass as they journeyed 

2378
02:02:49,791 --> 02:02:53,601
from the east,
that they found a plain in the land of 

2379
02:02:53,601 --> 02:02:53,601
Shinar and they dwelt there and they 
said to one another,

2380
02:02:53,601 --> 02:02:56,130
Goto let us make brick and burn them 
thoroughly,

2381
02:02:56,340 --> 02:03:00,630
and they had brick for stone and slime 
had they for mortar and they said,

2382
02:03:00,631 --> 02:03:05,631
go to go to let us build a city and a 
tower whose top may reach unto heaven 

2383
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:13,250
and let us make a name lest we be 
scattered abroad upon the face of the 

2384
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:13,250
whole earth.

2385
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:14,250
Okay,
so what's happening here?

2386
02:03:19,170 --> 02:03:21,510
Only the bare.
This is this.

2387
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:24,900
What this story means is very deeply 
implicit in the story.

2388
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:30,020
It's hinting at it and I think it's 
because it was really beyond the power 

2389
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:31,830
of the conceptualization of the people 
who generated this story.

2390
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:35,550
To elaborate it to any great detail,
but I think what it means is this,

2391
02:03:35,551 --> 02:03:35,790
is that

2392
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:41,780
there's a guy named Robin,
I think Robin Dunbar,

2393
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:47,320
and one of the things that Dunbar has 
done is do a very detailed correlation 

2394
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:51,170
analysis of cortical expansion and group
size.

2395
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:56,620
And what he showed is that if you,
if you plot primates bicortical size,

2396
02:03:58,580 --> 02:04:02,480
let's say you correct it for body size,
you plot primates by critical size,

2397
02:04:02,481 --> 02:04:05,210
and then you plot the size of their 
social groups.

2398
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:08,870
You see a very tight relationship 
between the size of the social group and

2399
02:04:08,871 --> 02:04:13,871
the size of the cortex.
The optimal human social group is like 

2400
02:04:13,871 --> 02:04:13,871
200 individuals.
It's something like that,

2401
02:04:13,871 --> 02:04:18,820
which is maybe roughly the number of 
people that you can reasonably track on 

2402
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:18,820
facebook.
After that.

2403
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:19,430
It's like,
well,

2404
02:04:19,431 --> 02:04:21,140
there's names,
but you don't know those people.

2405
02:04:21,470 --> 02:04:26,470
You're not capable of tracking social 
dynamics there any more complex than 

2406
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:30,971
that,
partly because you have other problems 

2407
02:04:30,971 --> 02:04:32,411
to solve.
And so one of the things that has been 

2408
02:04:32,411 --> 02:04:34,811
observed is that human groups tend to 
fraction eight if they start to exceed 

2409
02:04:34,811 --> 02:04:38,741
200.
And maybe that's partly because you 

2410
02:04:38,741 --> 02:04:38,741
can't keep track of the complexity,
but there's another

2411
02:04:38,741 --> 02:04:43,220
constraint which is you want your group 
to be big enough so that it protects 

2412
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:46,761
you,
but you want it to be small enough so 

2413
02:04:46,761 --> 02:04:47,460
that you can climb to the top.
Because when the group gets really,

2414
02:04:47,461 --> 02:04:48,300
really,
really,

2415
02:04:48,301 --> 02:04:51,960
really big,
well maybe it can protect you,

2416
02:04:51,961 --> 02:04:54,200
although it also doesn't give a damn 
about you,

2417
02:04:54,201 --> 02:04:57,210
like once your won $60,000
of the group,

2418
02:04:57,211 --> 02:05:02,211
like you are at the University of 
Toronto where one 30 million of the 

2419
02:05:02,211 --> 02:05:04,470
country or maybe one slash 300 million 
of Europe,

2420
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:08,340
which is partly why Europe is going to 
fragment because that's just not enough,

2421
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:13,610
right?
You're just not enough there that this 

2422
02:05:13,610 --> 02:05:13,610
group is too big.
What happens?

2423
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:19,010
You keep aggregating the group.
It gets more and more powerful and you 

2424
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:22,851
can think of that as something that has 
the capacity to replace the 

2425
02:05:22,851 --> 02:05:22,950
transcendent.
Right?

2426
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:26,280
We'll make a society that's perfect.
It's like a Utopian vision.

2427
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:27,900
That's what I see happening in this 
story.

2428
02:05:27,901 --> 02:05:28,680
It's like,
well,

2429
02:05:28,681 --> 02:05:33,681
make something so great on the part of 
human beings that it will reach up to 

2430
02:05:33,681 --> 02:05:37,641
heaven itself,
which means it will take the place of 

2431
02:05:37,641 --> 02:05:37,641
God.
That's what it means.

2432
02:05:37,641 --> 02:05:38,770
That's exactly what the Communists did 
in Soviet Russia,

2433
02:05:38,771 --> 02:05:41,010
and that's what they tried to do in in 
China too,

2434
02:05:41,011 --> 02:05:44,070
and so that's why you ended up with 
people like Stalin as the God,

2435
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:46,710
so you talk about getting what you 
deserve.

2436
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:52,220
So anyways,
so you build these monolithic 

2437
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:56,360
enterprises that we,
let's call them state enterprises and 

2438
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:59,301
the idea there is that the state,
the hyper organized and all inclusive 

2439
02:05:59,301 --> 02:06:03,180
state can bring about utopia.
That's what it means to reach to heaven.

2440
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:06,900
So what happens?
So God gets wind of that and he says,

2441
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:12,340
the Lord says the Lord came down to see 
the city and the tower which the 

2442
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:13,830
children of men built,
and the Lord said,

2443
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:19,310
behold the people is one and now they 
all have one language and this they 

2444
02:06:19,310 --> 02:06:21,480
begin to do and now nothing will be 
restrained from them,

2445
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:23,520
which they have imagined to do.

2446
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:29,360
Go to let us go down and therefore 
confound their language that they may 

2447
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:29,670
not understand one another's speech.
Well,

2448
02:06:29,671 --> 02:06:33,750
it's interesting because it sort of the 
story kind of portrays it as jealousy on

2449
02:06:33,751 --> 02:06:34,710
God's part,
right?

2450
02:06:34,711 --> 02:06:35,220
It's like,
oh,

2451
02:06:35,221 --> 02:06:37,510
these,
these human beings there,

2452
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:42,840
they're building so magnificently that 
they're starting to challenge my 

2453
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,311
dominion while while I'm going to go 
down there and play a trick or two on 

2454
02:06:46,311 --> 02:06:46,311
them,
and that'll,

2455
02:06:46,311 --> 02:06:46,920
that'll take care of that.
So what happens?

2456
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:53,360
The people within the group gets bigger 
and bigger and bigger and bigger and 

2457
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:53,360
bigger,
and what happens?

2458
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:55,410
It starts to fragment.
That is what happens.

2459
02:06:55,440 --> 02:07:00,440
That's exactly what happens.
That's part of the reason why the 

2460
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:03,600
totalitarian state enterprise to replace
the transcendent with structure.

2461
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:07,350
That's one of the reasons it's doomed.
As you pull more and more people in,

2462
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:11,490
what happens is you start to pull in 
chaos itself and that starts to fragment

2463
02:07:11,491 --> 02:07:11,880
the order.

2464
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:15,750
Here's an interesting thing.
I think that's happening with the.

2465
02:07:15,810 --> 02:07:20,810
So the lgbt power groups are exclusion 
excluded groups,

2466
02:07:21,091 --> 02:07:26,091
right?
And so it started out with gay rights 

2467
02:07:26,091 --> 02:07:26,220
and then one of the things that's 
happened that's so interesting,

2468
02:07:26,221 --> 02:07:31,221
so you could think of,
there was a normative group and there 

2469
02:07:31,221 --> 02:07:31,221
was excluded people.
Okay.

2470
02:07:31,221 --> 02:07:34,260
And so one section of the excluded 
people stood up and said,

2471
02:07:34,261 --> 02:07:35,000
hey,
you know,

2472
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:40,110
enough of this exclusion,
so we're gonna categorize ourselves and 

2473
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:41,230
we're gonna fight for recognition as the
excluded,

2474
02:07:41,231 --> 02:07:44,830
we're going to fight to be included.
But what happens is,

2475
02:07:44,831 --> 02:07:48,580
well it's l and then it's lb and then 
it's lbg and then it's lgbt.

2476
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:53,790
And the last thing I saw which was 
actually handed to the medical students 

2477
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:55,840
at the University of Toronto,
there's 20 letters.

2478
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:57,520
Why?
Well,

2479
02:07:57,521 --> 02:07:57,910
because

2480
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:06,100
you can't.
This is tangentially related to this 

2481
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,280
story only.
You can't come up with a category of the

2482
02:08:07,281 --> 02:08:12,281
things that don't fit inside categories 
because there's an infinite number of 

2483
02:08:12,281 --> 02:08:16,241
things that don't fit inside categories.
And so when you try to build a category 

2484
02:08:16,241 --> 02:08:20,771
out of all and categorical entities,
all that happens is it starts to 

2485
02:08:20,771 --> 02:08:22,130
fragment because there's actually no 
unity there.

2486
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:27,250
And one of the things you are starting 
to see is that there's power battles 

2487
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:28,190
emerging on the part of the excluded on 
the left.

2488
02:08:28,370 --> 02:08:33,370
And it's inevitable because I think 
that's what this story is trying to 

2489
02:08:33,370 --> 02:08:37,421
represent is that you can't build the 
state up beyond a certain size if you 

2490
02:08:37,971 --> 02:08:39,710
do,
it will fragment and fall apart.

2491
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:42,860
The people within it will no longer 
speak the same language and they'll,

2492
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:45,260
they'll,
they'll disperse themselves to different

2493
02:08:45,261 --> 02:08:50,261
corners of the earth.
And so I think we're actually in real 

2494
02:08:50,261 --> 02:08:53,111
danger of forgetting this.
And one of the things that I saw read a 

2495
02:08:53,111 --> 02:08:56,951
couple of ominous things.
So if you plot the size of economic 

2496
02:08:56,951 --> 02:08:59,540
catastrophes over the last 30 years,
they're getting bigger each time.

2497
02:09:00,410 --> 02:09:01,700
So that's scary.
Now,

2498
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:06,760
part of that is because the world 
economy is getting bigger and so maybe 

2499
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:09,971
you have to control for that.
But the magnitude of the chaos has been 

2500
02:09:09,971 --> 02:09:10,640
increasing with each collapse.
Okay.

2501
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:21,120
I,
one of the things that came out of the 

2502
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:23,071
last collapsed 2008 was the government 
rescuing collapsed companies like Aig 

2503
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:26,800
and the Royal Bank of Scotland,
which by the way was the biggest company

2504
02:09:26,801 --> 02:09:28,060
in the world.
No one knows that.

2505
02:09:28,061 --> 02:09:31,120
But Royal Bank of Scotland collapsed.
It was the biggest company in the world.

2506
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:35,860
And Aig was the insurer of insurers and 
so it collapsed too.

2507
02:09:36,010 --> 02:09:38,440
They were rescued by the government and 
maybe fair enough.

2508
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:44,100
But one of the motifs that came out of 
that was the idea of too big to fail.

2509
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:47,260
Well,
this story says,

2510
02:09:47,290 --> 02:09:52,290
wait a second,
it says two big means definite failure.

2511
02:09:53,890 --> 02:09:58,890
It means inevitable failure.
And that strikes me as highly probable 

2512
02:09:58,890 --> 02:10:01,030
is there's a warning in this story,
although it's,

2513
02:10:01,410 --> 02:10:01,930
it's,
it's a,

2514
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:03,400
it's a bear story,
right?

2515
02:10:03,401 --> 02:10:06,040
It's only four or five lines.
It's just the outlines,

2516
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:08,050
but it's placed in a very particular 
place.

2517
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:09,700
It's placed right after the flood,
right?

2518
02:10:09,701 --> 02:10:10,720
It's like,
well,

2519
02:10:10,721 --> 02:10:12,730
there's the nihilistic chaos of the 
flood.

2520
02:10:12,731 --> 02:10:17,731
And then there's the temp totalitarian 
temptation to build hyper structures 

2521
02:10:17,731 --> 02:10:19,810
that can theoretically replace the 
transcendent.

2522
02:10:20,050 --> 02:10:25,050
But what happens,
you build the hyper structure and it 

2523
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:26,880
fragments from within,
and then people don't speak the same 

2524
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:27,220
language and they and they distribute 
themselves,

2525
02:10:27,221 --> 02:10:29,230
sort of chaotically on the surface of 
the earth.

2526
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:30,400
So

2527
02:10:33,090 --> 02:10:35,810
therefore is the name of it called 
Babel.

2528
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:39,680
Because the Lord did there confound the 
language of all the earth.

2529
02:10:39,950 --> 02:10:44,950
And from thence,
did the Lord scatter them abroad upon 

2530
02:10:44,950 --> 02:10:47,621
the face of all the earth?
I think the other issue too is that 

2531
02:10:47,621 --> 02:10:49,370
what's the problem with the 
homogenization of a group?

2532
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:54,960
It's like you bring everyone into the 
group and then they're all the same 

2533
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:54,960
uniformity.
Well,

2534
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:56,450
the advantages,
you can understand everyone,

2535
02:10:57,740 --> 02:10:59,840
the disadvantages,
there's no variability left,

2536
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:01,220
right?
There's no variability.

2537
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:06,400
Everyone is a clone of everyone else and
that's great if you know where you're 

2538
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:07,130
going and you know how to get there,
but it's really,

2539
02:11:07,131 --> 02:11:12,131
really bad if the underlying structure 
shifts on you because the fact that 

2540
02:11:12,131 --> 02:11:16,691
you're adapted to one situation,
hyper adapted to one situation might 

2541
02:11:16,691 --> 02:11:20,210
mean that your content completely not 
adapted to the next situation.

2542
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:23,000
You build groups that are too big and 
too homogenous.

2543
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:28,420
They're effective,
but only within the limited range of 

2544
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:29,420
their map.
And if the map no longer functions,

2545
02:11:29,421 --> 02:11:34,421
then the whole thing sinks.
And that's I think what happens in this 

2546
02:11:34,421 --> 02:11:34,421
particular story.
And then okay,

2547
02:11:34,421 --> 02:11:38,951
at the end of that,
then what happens is that soon 

2548
02:11:38,951 --> 02:11:39,380
afterwards,
I think perhaps immediately afterwards,

2549
02:11:39,590 --> 02:11:42,740
the story of Abraham,
he merges and that's really.

2550
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:47,360
I would say that's when the the prime 
myths,

2551
02:11:47,361 --> 02:11:47,970
the prime,
oh,

2552
02:11:47,971 --> 02:11:52,070
myths take on a more historical element 
and history,

2553
02:11:52,090 --> 02:11:57,090
you know,
roughly speaking history as we know it 

2554
02:11:57,090 --> 02:11:57,090
begins something like 6,000
years ago,

2555
02:11:57,090 --> 02:12:01,990
so and then.
Then the rest of the biblical stories 

2556
02:12:01,990 --> 02:12:01,990
proceed at pace.
From there,

2557
02:12:01,990 --> 02:12:06,520
what basically happens is that as 
something that was well mapped out by 

2558
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:09,680
northrop Frye and you think at the 
University of Toronto that you all would

2559
02:12:09,681 --> 02:12:13,250
have been encouraged to read northrop 
frye because he was perhaps the greatest

2560
02:12:13,251 --> 02:12:18,251
literary scholar that the University of 
Toronto ever produced and what He.

2561
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:21,110
He outlined the old testament very 
interestingly,

2562
02:12:21,111 --> 02:12:26,111
he said that what happens after these 
initial stories is that the state 

2563
02:12:26,111 --> 02:12:30,130
arises,
so it's like the Tower of Babel is 

2564
02:12:30,130 --> 02:12:32,050
continually rebuild over and over and 
it's the state of Israel's.

2565
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:34,210
The Israelis Israelites get their act 
together,

2566
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:36,170
build a state.
What happens?

2567
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:39,380
They get corrupt.
A prophet comes up and says,

2568
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:44,440
you better watch out because what you're
doing is not making God happy and the 

2569
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:47,340
profits are very brave because they come
forward that the kings are authoritarian

2570
02:12:47,341 --> 02:12:48,800
and they can kill them.
At an instant,

2571
02:12:48,801 --> 02:12:51,860
but the profits are moved by walking 
with God,

2572
02:12:51,861 --> 02:12:53,660
let's say,
for lack of a better argument.

2573
02:12:53,661 --> 02:12:54,980
They come to the king and say,
look,

2574
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:57,110
you're not caring for the widows and the
children.

2575
02:12:57,800 --> 02:13:02,800
Right?
And you think that's okay because 

2576
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:02,800
they're weak.
It's not okay.

2577
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:05,770
You're breaking the covenant.
You're breaking the rules and the price 

2578
02:13:05,770 --> 02:13:06,260
for that is what we really saw.

2579
02:13:06,290 --> 02:13:11,290
The price for that is a flood.
It's like get your act together or 

2580
02:13:11,290 --> 02:13:13,961
you're going to be sorry.
Now sometimes the kings to whom the 

2581
02:13:13,961 --> 02:13:13,961
prophets speak,
listen,

2582
02:13:13,961 --> 02:13:18,550
but often they don't and then the whole 
bloody state is demolished and then 

2583
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:18,560
isn't real.
Lights are back.

2584
02:13:18,561 --> 02:13:21,830
Like they're enslaved or they get wiped 
out by their enemies are like,

2585
02:13:21,831 --> 02:13:26,831
it's a complete bloody catastrophe that 
lasts for centuries and then they kind 

2586
02:13:26,831 --> 02:13:30,721
of struggled back up and make another 
state and then they get arrogant and 

2587
02:13:30,721 --> 02:13:32,040
then it gets corrupt and then a profit 
comes along and says,

2588
02:13:32,910 --> 02:13:34,590
you know what happened last time?
It's like,

2589
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:36,000
well,
that was 600 years ago,

2590
02:13:36,001 --> 02:13:41,001
right?
And I knew everything now so I don't 

2591
02:13:41,001 --> 02:13:41,700
have to pay any attention to you.
It's they ignore it and then because the

2592
02:13:41,740 --> 02:13:46,740
and the prophet say,
you are violating a fundamental moral 

2593
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:46,740
order,
you're supposed to as king,

2594
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:50,580
you're supposed to be subject to 
something higher than yourself.

2595
02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:55,670
Right?
It's like the idea that the 

2596
02:13:55,670 --> 02:13:56,100
Mesopotamians had that the emperor was 
supposed to be an emissary of Marduk.

2597
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:58,950
That's why he was the emperor because he
was a good Marduk.

2598
02:13:58,951 --> 02:14:03,951
He could confront chaos and make order.
That was what gave him his sovereignty 

2599
02:14:03,951 --> 02:14:06,450
or the Egyptian Pharaoh was a 
combination of Osiris and horus.

2600
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:10,440
That's what gave him sovereignty and so 
the idea was you get to be king,

2601
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:15,810
but you have to act out the spirit of 
being king and if you don't do that,

2602
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:20,940
then well king or not all hell's gonna 
break loose for you.

2603
02:14:21,690 --> 02:14:23,280
And that's what the profit is 
continually say,

2604
02:14:23,281 --> 02:14:24,580
but the Israel lights,
you know,

2605
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:27,810
they don't pay enough attention and they
continued to get absolutely demolished.

2606
02:14:27,811 --> 02:14:32,811
And so the Old Testament can be read at 
least in part as the description of a 

2607
02:14:32,811 --> 02:14:37,791
sequence of the rise and fall of states 
and their descent into corruption and 

2608
02:14:37,791 --> 02:14:42,471
chaos.
And so we'll leave it at that because I 

2609
02:14:42,471 --> 02:14:43,170
want to tell you the next part of the 
story,

2610
02:14:43,171 --> 02:14:46,500
the last part of the story,
roughly speaking in our next lecture,

2611
02:14:46,501 --> 02:14:51,501
which is also the last lecture.
So we've got about 12 minutes if we want

2612
02:14:52,411 --> 02:14:57,411
it.
So if anybody has any questions you can 

2613
02:14:57,411 --> 02:14:58,140
ask them are we can and if you don't 
then we could call it a day.

2614
02:14:58,530 --> 02:15:01,020
So does any.
Well,

2615
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:04,410
it's a lot of information.
So.

2616
02:15:04,820 --> 02:15:07,350
And it's a lot of strange inflammation.
So I'm curious,

2617
02:15:07,351 --> 02:15:07,820
you know,
if,

2618
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:10,560
if,
if what you make of it,

2619
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:25,860
you were talking about your why is why 
is it a similar size,

2620
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:28,960
which is American.

2621
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:34,020
You think the right and left can talk to
each other.

2622
02:15:34,270 --> 02:15:37,000
You think they speak the same language,
right?

2623
02:15:37,770 --> 02:15:40,950
You see it that fragmenting occurring 
and they really are.

2624
02:15:41,220 --> 02:15:43,370
Not only are they speaking different 
languages there,

2625
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:45,390
they really are speaking different 
languages.

2626
02:15:45,391 --> 02:15:47,340
It's the right way of thinking about it.
Yes,

2627
02:15:47,341 --> 02:15:48,630
it's very,
very dangerous.

2628
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:51,420
You know,
I think the US worked for a long time,

2629
02:15:51,450 --> 02:15:54,150
first of all because it didn't always 
have 300 million people.

2630
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:56,550
It's a lot of people to put under one 
umbrella.

2631
02:15:56,850 --> 02:16:01,540
Now the utility of the American system 
is that it is a hierarchy,

2632
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:03,640
right?
There's individuals,

2633
02:16:03,641 --> 02:16:05,110
families,
towns,

2634
02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:09,730
states underneath a somewhat loose 
federal structure and that sort of.

2635
02:16:09,910 --> 02:16:14,910
So it's not a.
it's not a monolith where everyone has 

2636
02:16:14,910 --> 02:16:16,720
to speak precisely the same language.
It's got some flexibility built into its

2637
02:16:16,721 --> 02:16:18,110
structure because it's,
it's,

2638
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:19,210
it's,
it's,

2639
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:24,010
it's formulated into components which 
have a certain amount of autonomy and so

2640
02:16:24,011 --> 02:16:25,690
far that's worked sufficiently well.

2641
02:16:26,140 --> 02:16:28,510
Whether it will and it will probably 
continue to work.

2642
02:16:28,511 --> 02:16:33,511
I mean the are a very,
very robust people and they've gone 

2643
02:16:33,511 --> 02:16:34,330
through things that are analogous to 
what they're going through now.

2644
02:16:34,331 --> 02:16:37,120
Many times God only knows,
right,

2645
02:16:37,150 --> 02:16:41,260
but,
but it's very dangerous thing to presume

2646
02:16:41,261 --> 02:16:46,261
that the Americans are down for the 
count because they have an uncanny 

2647
02:16:46,261 --> 02:16:47,350
ability to rise from the ashes even 
stronger than they were before.

2648
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:50,380
But you can certainly see the danger 
lurking in Europe.

2649
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:52,180
That's,
that's a different thing.

2650
02:16:52,210 --> 02:16:57,210
Like I think the European state is dude,
because I think it grew too fast and 

2651
02:16:58,290 --> 02:17:03,290
it's severed that connection between 
like there's not the proper hierarchy 

2652
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:04,270
of,
of identification.

2653
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:05,890
So,
and people are saying,

2654
02:17:05,891 --> 02:17:07,180
wait,
I Brussels,

2655
02:17:07,181 --> 02:17:08,410
like,
who the hell are you guys?

2656
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:13,680
Why are you making decisions for us?
And we don't agree with your decisions 

2657
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:16,150
and like are you sure that Greece and 
Germany can be in the same place because

2658
02:17:16,151 --> 02:17:19,000
that's by no means self evident,
right?

2659
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:24,060
The Germans aren't very happy about it 
and the Greeks aren't very happy about 

2660
02:17:24,060 --> 02:17:27,151
it and one of the rules for making an 
organization is that it's a lot easier 

2661
02:17:27,151 --> 02:17:31,681
to make a functional organization worse 
than it is to make a dysfunctional 

2662
02:17:31,681 --> 02:17:33,370
organization better.
And so you might say,

2663
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:36,070
well you've got Germany and France and 
England,

2664
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:38,590
well let's say Germany and France 
powerhouses,

2665
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:41,710
especially Germany,
they can afford to bring Greece in.

2666
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:42,400
Well

2667
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:45,810
maybe,
but

2668
02:17:46,290 --> 02:17:48,570
there's no evidence that they can afford
it.

2669
02:17:49,110 --> 02:17:51,180
So I mean Greece is unbelievably 
corrupt.

2670
02:17:51,210 --> 02:17:53,610
No one pays her income tax.
That's a big problem.

2671
02:17:53,670 --> 02:17:58,670
Right?
And bringing them in to a union at a 

2672
02:17:58,670 --> 02:18:01,440
high order has no effect whatsoever on 
the micro behaviors.

2673
02:18:01,770 --> 02:18:06,770
And the thing is the micro behaviors 
have to be rectified and no one really 

2674
02:18:06,770 --> 02:18:10,071
knows how to do that.
How do you stop a country where people 

2675
02:18:10,071 --> 02:18:12,411
don't pay their taxes from?
How do you stop the people from not 

2676
02:18:12,411 --> 02:18:14,040
paying their taxes?
Why do we pay our taxes?

2677
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:17,010
Who knows?
We could just all of a sudden decide not

2678
02:18:17,011 --> 02:18:17,580
to,
you know,

2679
02:18:17,581 --> 02:18:22,581
and the government wouldn't have the 
resources to run around gathering them 

2680
02:18:22,581 --> 02:18:25,221
all up for one reason or another.
It's become customary for people in 

2681
02:18:25,221 --> 02:18:27,420
functional Western democracies to pay 
their taxes.

2682
02:18:27,630 --> 02:18:31,470
But why,
who knows?

2683
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:36,500
It would have been way easier for us 
just to do what the Greeks did and 

2684
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:36,500
pretend to pay them,
you know,

2685
02:18:36,780 --> 02:18:41,780
so there are too big I think.
And so the people on the right is saying

2686
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:44,850
back to the nation and like I understand
why they're doing that,

2687
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:47,510
but,
but

2688
02:18:49,310 --> 02:18:51,800
the danger is the nation will 
subordinate the individual.

2689
02:18:52,490 --> 02:18:55,010
And I do see it as another example of 
safe spaces.

2690
02:18:55,470 --> 02:18:57,890
It's just scales different.
So.

2691
02:18:58,310 --> 02:19:02,450
And that's why I think that the proper 
antidote to that,

2692
02:19:02,451 --> 02:19:04,940
to both the chaos on the left and the 
order on the right,

2693
02:19:05,210 --> 02:19:10,210
roughly speaking,
is to walk the proper line in the 

2694
02:19:10,210 --> 02:19:10,520
middle.
And we better do that because things are

2695
02:19:10,521 --> 02:19:12,680
not.
Things are too chaotic at the moment.

2696
02:19:13,460 --> 02:19:17,390
So it's not good.
Maybe it's really good that's possible.

2697
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:22,840
But we're in a state where I really 
believe we're in a state where things 

2698
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:25,160
could go any number of ways and there's 
no,

2699
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:26,930
there's no predicting it.
So.

2700
02:19:26,931 --> 02:19:28,430
And never felt that,
you know,

2701
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:32,270
I mean I lived in the eighties and you 
know,

2702
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:37,300
political correctness rose up in the 
nineties as well and I can remember a 

2703
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:40,601
lot of what happened in the early 
seventies with the oil crisis and all 

2704
02:19:40,601 --> 02:19:43,361
that.
So there were times when things were 

2705
02:19:43,361 --> 02:19:43,580
shaky but they weren't shaky the way 
they are now.

2706
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:49,180
They're an internal shakiness rather 
than something that was a threat that 

2707
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:49,340
was,
seemed to be imposed from the outside.

2708
02:19:50,030 --> 02:19:51,590
And that's different.
And,

2709
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,810
and it's,
it's,

2710
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:54,580
it's,
it's,

2711
02:19:54,890 --> 02:19:59,890
it is associated with,
with this intellectual war that's going 

2712
02:19:59,890 --> 02:20:01,190
on with postmodernism in new Marxism.
And all of that as well.

2713
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:01,850
So

2714
02:20:08,070 --> 02:20:13,070
dealing with,
and you mentioned that the effects are 

2715
02:20:14,730 --> 02:20:19,730
much more pronounced than men,
especially given the agenda.

2716
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,170
It's a lot of questions.
They're good questions.

2717
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:42,200
Um,
I'll tell you a couple of strange things

2718
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:44,210
that it takes that I don't really 
understand.

2719
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:49,240
The first is when we've done the 
analysis of the effects of the future 

2720
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:52,451
authoring program,
it has had a different differential 

2721
02:20:52,451 --> 02:20:55,370
impact on men and it's had a 
particularly differential impact on what

2722
02:20:55,371 --> 02:21:00,371
I would call it excluded men.
And so that would be non western ethic 

2723
02:21:00,371 --> 02:21:04,121
minority men or,
or what majority men who aren't doing 

2724
02:21:04,731 --> 02:21:06,230
very well.
So for example,

2725
02:21:06,231 --> 02:21:11,231
at Mohawk College,
the future authoring program had a 

2726
02:21:11,231 --> 02:21:14,321
particularly robust effect on Mohawk 
college students who are men who hadn't 

2727
02:21:14,321 --> 02:21:18,431
done very well in high school and knew,
hadn't picked a major that had a 

2728
02:21:18,431 --> 02:21:20,540
destination,
a career destination at it's amp.

2729
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:24,590
So you can imagine those people are,
they have an ambiguous relationship with

2730
02:21:24,650 --> 02:21:29,510
the idea of education and they're not 
oriented specifically towards a goal.

2731
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:34,900
They're not very motivated.
Now why did it have a differential 

2732
02:21:34,900 --> 02:21:36,830
effect on man?
That's a good question.

2733
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:38,720
Well,
first of all,

2734
02:21:38,721 --> 02:21:42,350
the women are doing better,
so it might just be a matter of the fact

2735
02:21:42,351 --> 02:21:47,351
that it does better for people who 
aren't doing as well and at the moment 

2736
02:21:47,351 --> 02:21:47,960
most of them are men,
I don't believe.

2737
02:21:48,050 --> 02:21:51,290
I think that might be part of it,
but I don't believe that's all of it.

2738
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:57,040
I think that part of the reason that 
women are doing better is because 

2739
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:59,000
they're agreeable and so if a system 
sets out a structure and says,

2740
02:21:59,060 --> 02:22:02,260
here's a pathway to attainment,
the women won't rebel against that.

2741
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:07,270
They'll go along with it and that's 
working very well for them at the 

2742
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:07,270
moment.
The man,

2743
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:10,841
especially the men on the disagreeable 
end of the distribution and there's way 

2744
02:22:10,841 --> 02:22:12,080
more men on the district disagreeable 
end of the distribution.

2745
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:13,430
Then there are women,
right?

2746
02:22:13,431 --> 02:22:18,431
That's what you get from.
If you look at overlapping normal 

2747
02:22:18,431 --> 02:22:18,590
distributions.
So there's the male district,

2748
02:22:18,591 --> 02:22:22,730
female distribution for agreeableness,
mail distribution for agreeableness.

2749
02:22:22,970 --> 02:22:24,980
Tremendous overlap.
Okay.

2750
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:29,990
Women are higher.
All the really agreeable people are 

2751
02:22:29,990 --> 02:22:32,391
women.
All the really disagreeable people are 

2752
02:22:32,391 --> 02:22:33,060
meant and maybe the real differences 
occur at the extremes.

2753
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:33,990
Right?
So,

2754
02:22:34,290 --> 02:22:39,290
so,
and it's a very interesting side effect 

2755
02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:40,680
of overlapping distributions so people 
can be mostly the same,

2756
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:43,440
but that can still produce radical 
differences.

2757
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:46,800
Disagreeable men won't do anything they 
don't want to do.

2758
02:22:47,850 --> 02:22:52,850
They just say up yours,
I'll go home and play video games with 

2759
02:22:52,850 --> 02:22:54,000
you.
I'm not listening to your stupid classes

2760
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:57,780
and why should I work for you?
I'll just go have fun.

2761
02:22:58,650 --> 02:23:01,200
I'll do my own thing.
I don't think they're motivated.

2762
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:04,230
And so then if you take the men who are 
like that and you say,

2763
02:23:04,231 --> 02:23:05,340
okay,
what do you want?

2764
02:23:06,390 --> 02:23:08,850
You can have what you want,
but you have figured out what it is.

2765
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,620
So then they write down what they want.
They think,

2766
02:23:10,621 --> 02:23:12,420
Oh hey,
well that might be worth having.

2767
02:23:12,421 --> 02:23:15,660
So maybe I'll put some effort into it.
That's what it looks like to me.

2768
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:16,580
Now,
you know,

2769
02:23:16,650 --> 02:23:19,770
that's weak evidence and this is a weak 
argument,

2770
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:23,070
but I'm trying to stretch out my 
understanding to account for this.

2771
02:23:23,071 --> 02:23:24,720
But I'll tell you something else that's 
really weird.

2772
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:30,020
I don't understand this either.
So more than 90 percent of the people 

2773
02:23:30,020 --> 02:23:34,461
who watch my videos on youtube are men 
now that's weird because now about 80 

2774
02:23:34,461 --> 02:23:35,850
percent of psychology students are 
women.

2775
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:38,340
So that is not what you would expect,
right?

2776
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:41,850
You would expect that the majority of 
them would be women and you might say,

2777
02:23:41,851 --> 02:23:43,800
well it's because of the political 
stance I've taken.

2778
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:45,360
And I thought,
well that's possible.

2779
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:48,090
So I went and looked at the demographic 
data because I have that.

2780
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:50,640
Well before I did any of the political 
videos,

2781
02:23:50,730 --> 02:23:54,810
85 percent of my viewers were men.
So it's actually increased a bit.

2782
02:23:54,811 --> 02:23:58,440
It's increased by six percent and that's
not trivial,

2783
02:23:58,441 --> 02:24:02,580
but it was still overwhelmingly men.
So that was interesting.

2784
02:24:02,581 --> 02:24:03,450
I thought,
what the hell,

2785
02:24:03,451 --> 02:24:04,620
why is that?
Exactly.

2786
02:24:05,010 --> 02:24:10,010
And then now I've been watching crowds 
when I've been talking to them and the 

2787
02:24:10,010 --> 02:24:11,220
crowds that have come to see me in 
person.

2788
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:16,400
This happened at the University of 
Toronto Free Speech Debate and I 

2789
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:19,611
actually noticed it and commented on it 
before the debate took place because I 

2790
02:24:19,611 --> 02:24:20,520
was talking about intrinsic differences 
between men and women.

2791
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:21,990
And I looked around the room and I 
thought,

2792
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:23,100
hmm,
hey,

2793
02:24:23,130 --> 02:24:24,900
80 percent of the people in this room 
are men.

2794
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:30,110
So I had all the men stay windham and 
women stand up and then all the men 

2795
02:24:30,110 --> 02:24:30,110
stand up.

2796
02:24:30,110 --> 02:24:30,110
They said,
look,

2797
02:24:30,110 --> 02:24:32,520
here's a natural experiment.
For some reason,

2798
02:24:32,521 --> 02:24:34,470
80 percent of the people who showed up 
to this sermon,

2799
02:24:34,620 --> 02:24:37,320
now everybody thought I was kinda 
cracked to to do that.

2800
02:24:37,590 --> 02:24:39,140
And it was a risk,
you know?

2801
02:24:39,870 --> 02:24:40,770
But I thought,
no,

2802
02:24:40,771 --> 02:24:45,771
there's something going on here.
And then what's interesting now is that 

2803
02:24:45,771 --> 02:24:49,550
every public appearance that I've made 
that's related to the sort of topics 

2804
02:24:49,550 --> 02:24:50,490
that we're discussing is overwhelmingly 
men.

2805
02:24:51,060 --> 02:24:54,480
It's like it's like 85 to 90 percent.
And so I thought,

2806
02:24:54,481 --> 02:24:55,290
wow,
that's weird.

2807
02:24:55,291 --> 02:24:57,120
Like what the Hell's going on here?
Exactly.

2808
02:24:57,450 --> 02:25:02,450
And then the other thing I've noticed is
that I've been talking a lot to the 

2809
02:25:02,450 --> 02:25:06,561
crowds that I've been talking to,
not about rights but about 

2810
02:25:06,561 --> 02:25:06,561
responsibility,
right?

2811
02:25:06,561 --> 02:25:07,320
Because he can't have the bloody 
converse.

2812
02:25:07,350 --> 02:25:12,350
What are you doing?
You can't have the conversation about 

2813
02:25:12,350 --> 02:25:14,631
rights without the conversation about 
responsibility because your rights are 

2814
02:25:14,631 --> 02:25:17,790
my responsibility.
That's what they are technically,

2815
02:25:17,970 --> 02:25:22,970
so you just can't have only half of that
discussion and we're only having half 

2816
02:25:22,970 --> 02:25:23,980
that discussion.
The question is,

2817
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,720
well,
what the hell are you leaving out?

2818
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:29,620
If you only have that half of the 
discussion and the answer is,

2819
02:25:29,621 --> 02:25:34,621
well,
you're leaving out responsibility and 

2820
02:25:34,621 --> 02:25:34,621
then the question is,
well,

2821
02:25:34,621 --> 02:25:35,680
what are you leaving out?
If you're leaving out responsibility and

2822
02:25:35,681 --> 02:25:40,681
that answer might be,
well maybe you're leaving out the 

2823
02:25:40,681 --> 02:25:40,780
meaning of life.
That's what it looks like to me.

2824
02:25:41,010 --> 02:25:45,670
It's like here you are suffering away.
What makes it worthwhile,

2825
02:25:45,970 --> 02:25:48,720
right?
You know you're completely out.

2826
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:53,340
You're completely.
You have no idea what you're you.

2827
02:25:53,350 --> 02:25:58,150
It's almost impossible to describe how 
bad an idea that is.

2828
02:25:59,230 --> 02:26:02,860
Responsibility.
That's what gives life meaning.

2829
02:26:03,430 --> 02:26:07,090
It's like lift a load.
Then you can tolerate yourself,

2830
02:26:07,091 --> 02:26:08,830
right?
Because look at your useless,

2831
02:26:09,220 --> 02:26:11,350
easily hurt,
easily killed.

2832
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:15,160
Why should you have any self respect?
That's the story of the fall.

2833
02:26:15,730 --> 02:26:17,550
Pick something up and carry it.
Pick.

2834
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:19,330
Make it heavy enough so that you can 
think,

2835
02:26:19,510 --> 02:26:21,730
yeah,
well useless as I am.

2836
02:26:21,730 --> 02:26:24,100
At least I could move that from there to
there.

2837
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:29,550
Well,
what's really cool about that is that 

2838
02:26:29,550 --> 02:26:31,171
when I talk to these crowds about this,
the man's eyes light up and that's very 

2839
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:36,240
like I've seen that phenomena because 
I've been talking about this 

2840
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:36,240
mythological material for a long time 
and I can see what I'm watching.

2841
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:37,410
Crowds people,
you know,

2842
02:26:37,630 --> 02:26:42,630
their eyebrows lift,
their eyes light up because I put 

2843
02:26:42,630 --> 02:26:42,660
something together for them,
not sweat,

2844
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:47,700
mythological stories do.
So I'm not taking responsibility for 

2845
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:47,700
that.
That's what the stories due.

2846
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:48,760
So I say this story to people,
go click,

2847
02:26:48,761 --> 02:26:49,420
click,
click,

2848
02:26:49,710 --> 02:26:54,710
you know when their eyes light up,
but this responsibility thing that's a 

2849
02:26:54,710 --> 02:26:56,350
whole new order of this is that young 
men are so hungry for that.

2850
02:26:56,351 --> 02:27:01,351
It is unbelievable.
And one of the things I've been talking 

2851
02:27:01,351 --> 02:27:04,411
to some of the people who've been 
running for the conservative leadership 

2852
02:27:04,411 --> 02:27:06,160
in Canada and I've been talking to them 
about,

2853
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:11,360
well the difficulties they have 
communicating with young people because 

2854
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:11,360
conservatives,
what?

2855
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:11,650
What the hell are they going to sell to 
young people,

2856
02:27:11,651 --> 02:27:16,651
right?
Because being conservative is something 

2857
02:27:16,651 --> 02:27:16,651
that happens when you're older.
They can sell responsibility.

2858
02:27:17,470 --> 02:27:19,390
No one's selling it.
And the thing is,

2859
02:27:19,690 --> 02:27:21,610
for men,
there's nothing but responsibility.

2860
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:27,250
No,
I was watching the simpsons the other 

2861
02:27:27,250 --> 02:27:29,281
day.
I watched the simpsons episode and I 

2862
02:27:29,281 --> 02:27:29,830
deconstructed it.
And so it's really interesting.

2863
02:27:29,831 --> 02:27:34,150
So what happens in the first Simpson 
episode is that it's Christmas and homer

2864
02:27:34,151 --> 02:27:39,151
and marge,
you're going to buy some Christmas 

2865
02:27:39,151 --> 02:27:41,011
presents,
but homer doesn't get his Christmas 

2866
02:27:41,011 --> 02:27:41,110
bonus.
And so he's absolutely crushed by that.

2867
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:46,320
And that actually is a recurring theme 
in the simpsons where homer loses his 

2868
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:47,470
job or something like that or can't make
enough money.

2869
02:27:47,560 --> 02:27:50,170
He's completely crushed even though he's
kind of useless,

2870
02:27:50,171 --> 02:27:51,790
bumbling,
laughing,

2871
02:27:51,791 --> 02:27:53,770
fool of a guy,
you know?

2872
02:27:54,010 --> 02:27:59,010
The thing that gives that show its soul 
is that he still oriented towards his 

2873
02:27:59,010 --> 02:27:59,010
family.

2874
02:27:59,010 --> 02:28:01,450
That's what makes them honorable,
is that foolish as he is.

2875
02:28:01,630 --> 02:28:05,620
He's decided to adopt responsibility for
his family and to try to bear that.

2876
02:28:06,070 --> 02:28:07,750
And so he's not.
He's a holy fool.

2877
02:28:07,751 --> 02:28:12,751
He's not a complete fool.
And so interesting watching the story 

2878
02:28:12,751 --> 02:28:14,800
because he suffers dreadfully as a 
consequence of not being able to fulfill

2879
02:28:14,801 --> 02:28:16,150
his responsibility.
Well,

2880
02:28:16,151 --> 02:28:21,151
that's for men.
Women have their sets of 

2881
02:28:21,151 --> 02:28:21,220
responsibilities.
They're not the same,

2882
02:28:21,950 --> 02:28:26,950
right,
because they're complicated because 

2883
02:28:26,950 --> 02:28:26,950
women of course have to take primary 
responsibility for,

2884
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:30,290
for having infants at least,
but then also for caring for them,

2885
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:35,560
they're.
They're structured differently than men 

2886
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:38,740
for biological necessity,
even if it's not a psychological issue 

2887
02:28:38,740 --> 02:28:38,930
and it's also partly a psychological 
issue.

2888
02:28:39,230 --> 02:28:43,640
Women know what they have to do.
Men have to figure out what they have to

2889
02:28:43,641 --> 02:28:46,670
do and if they have nothing worth living
for them,

2890
02:28:46,671 --> 02:28:51,671
they stay Peter Pan and why the hell not
because the alternative to valued 

2891
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:58,960
responsibility is impulsive,
low class pleasure,

2892
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,600
and you saw that in the Pinocchio Story,
right?

2893
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:04,310
That's pleasure island.
It's like,

2894
02:29:04,311 --> 02:29:09,311
well,
why lift the load if there's nothing in 

2895
02:29:09,311 --> 02:29:09,311
it for you?
That's another thing that we're doing to

2896
02:29:09,311 --> 02:29:11,570
men.
That's a very bad idea and two boys,

2897
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:14,780
it's like your pathological and 
oppressive.

2898
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:15,560
It's like,
fine.

2899
02:29:15,561 --> 02:29:17,700
Then why the hell am I going to play if 
that's the.

2900
02:29:17,701 --> 02:29:22,701
If that's the situation.
If I get no credit for bearing 

2901
02:29:22,701 --> 02:29:25,481
responsibility,
you can bloody well be sure I'm not 

2902
02:29:25,481 --> 02:29:28,031
going to bear it,
but then you know your life is useless 

2903
02:29:28,031 --> 02:29:28,880
and meaningless and you have your full 
of self contempt,

2904
02:29:28,881 --> 02:29:31,370
denialism and,
and that's not good.

2905
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:35,780
And so that's why I think that's what I 
think is going on at a deeper level with

2906
02:29:35,781 --> 02:29:40,781
regards to men needing this direction.
A man has to decide that he's going to 

2907
02:29:40,781 --> 02:29:42,320
do something.
He has to decide that

2908
02:29:48,990 --> 02:29:49,830
image.

2909
02:29:52,820 --> 02:29:53,270
Yeah.
Well,

2910
02:29:53,271 --> 02:29:56,240
you know partly what you're trying to do
in the future authoring process to say,

2911
02:29:56,241 --> 02:29:57,590
okay,
well what's your highest value?

2912
02:29:58,430 --> 02:29:59,480
Right?
It's the star.

2913
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:00,440
It's like,
okay,

2914
02:30:00,470 --> 02:30:03,320
what are you aiming for?
You can decide man,

2915
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:05,120
but you know,
there's some criteria.

2916
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:10,300
It should be good for you.
It should be good for you in a way that 

2917
02:30:10,300 --> 02:30:12,140
facilitates your moving forward.
Maybe it should be good for you in a way

2918
02:30:12,141 --> 02:30:14,210
that's also good for the family and the 
community.

2919
02:30:14,420 --> 02:30:19,420
It should cover the,
the domain of life mean there's 

2920
02:30:19,420 --> 02:30:21,380
constraints on what you should regard as
a value,

2921
02:30:21,970 --> 02:30:23,810
but you.
But within those constraints,

2922
02:30:23,811 --> 02:30:27,710
you have the choice.
You have choice.

2923
02:30:28,460 --> 02:30:30,560
Well,
the thing is is that people will carry a

2924
02:30:30,561 --> 02:30:35,240
heavy load if they get to pick the god 
damn load so and they think,

2925
02:30:35,241 --> 02:30:36,410
well,
I won't carry any load.

2926
02:30:36,411 --> 02:30:37,040
It's like,
okay,

2927
02:30:37,041 --> 02:30:42,041
fine,
but then you're like the sled dog that 

2928
02:30:42,041 --> 02:30:42,041
doesn't have a sled pole,
you're just gonna.

2929
02:30:42,041 --> 02:30:44,450
You're going to tear a piece is out of 
your own legs because you're bored.

2930
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:47,300
You know you need.
People are pack animals.

2931
02:30:47,301 --> 02:30:52,301
They need,
they need to pull against a weight and 

2932
02:30:52,301 --> 02:30:52,880
and that's not true for everyone.
It's not true.

2933
02:30:52,881 --> 02:30:55,010
Particularly say for low conscientious 
people.

2934
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:58,070
I mean maybe they're open and creative 
are extroverted and some other things,

2935
02:30:58,071 --> 02:31:00,860
but for the,
for the typical person,

2936
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:02,560
they,
they,

2937
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:07,780
they'll eat themselves,
they'll eat themselves up unless they 

2938
02:31:07,780 --> 02:31:10,631
have a load.
This is why there's such an opiate 

2939
02:31:10,631 --> 02:31:12,401
epidemic among a dispossessed white,
middle aged guys who were unemployed in 

2940
02:31:12,401 --> 02:31:13,910
the US.
It's like they lose their job.

2941
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:15,860
They're done,
right?

2942
02:31:16,220 --> 02:31:21,220
They despise themselves.
They develop chronic pain syndromes and 

2943
02:31:21,220 --> 02:31:21,220
depression

2944
02:31:21,220 --> 02:31:22,590
and the chronic pain is treated with 
opiates.

2945
02:31:22,830 --> 02:31:26,370
So that's what we're doing.
So yeah,

2946
02:31:26,550 --> 02:31:29,250
that's what it looks like to me is you 
have to.

2947
02:31:29,310 --> 02:31:34,310
And it's so interesting to watch the 
young men when you talk to them about 

2948
02:31:34,310 --> 02:31:34,310
responsibility.
There is a God damn thrilled about it.

2949
02:31:34,350 --> 02:31:35,990
It just blows me away.
It's like,

2950
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,920
really?
That's what's.

2951
02:31:38,250 --> 02:31:43,250
That's the counterculture.
Grow the hell up and do something 

2952
02:31:43,250 --> 02:31:43,890
useful.
Really.

2953
02:31:43,891 --> 02:31:44,730
I could do that.
Oh,

2954
02:31:44,731 --> 02:31:48,420
I'm so excited by that idea.
No one ever mentioned that before.

2955
02:31:48,660 --> 02:31:49,620
It's like rights,
rights,

2956
02:31:49,621 --> 02:31:50,520
rights,
rights,

2957
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:51,820
Jesus.
It's,

2958
02:31:51,990 --> 02:31:53,580
it's,
it's appalling.

2959
02:31:53,900 --> 02:31:54,450
It's,
it's,

2960
02:31:54,640 --> 02:31:57,510
and I feel that that's deeply felt by 
the people who are,

2961
02:31:58,140 --> 02:32:01,260
who are coming out to to listen to these
sorts of things,

2962
02:32:01,261 --> 02:32:04,260
to there.
They've had enough of that so.

2963
02:32:04,350 --> 02:32:09,350
And they better have because it's,
it's a nonproductive motive being 

2964
02:32:09,350 --> 02:32:09,350
responsibility,
man.

2965
02:32:09,540 --> 02:32:11,910
That's where the meaning in life is.
So.

2966
02:32:14,590 --> 02:32:15,860
All right,
good.

2967
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:17,100
One more class.
Hey,

2968
02:32:17,850 --> 02:32:18,960
we'll see you next week.
