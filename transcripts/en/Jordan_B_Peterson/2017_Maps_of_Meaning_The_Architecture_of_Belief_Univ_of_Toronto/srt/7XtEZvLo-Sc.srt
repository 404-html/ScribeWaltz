1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,520
Okay,

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,800
I told you at the beginning of the class
that I started working on this material 

3
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,070
partly because I was interested in why 
people were so inclined to to go to any 

4
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:38,951
lengths to protect their belief systems.
I wanted to understand and I knew that 

5
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:40,160
those were systems of value,
right?

6
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:45,161
That that belief system is something 
that enables you to ascribe value to 

7
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:49,541
things so that so that you can act in 
the world towards things in a way from 

8
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:55,961
things roughly speaking,
and I've already made a case to you that

9
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,000
belief systems regulate people's 
emotions but not

10
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,360
not as a consequence of decreasing their
death,

11
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:12,361
anxiety or anything like that,
or even directly decreasing their their 

12
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:18,691
threat sensitivity or uncertainty,
but more specifically by helping them 

13
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:24,151
orient themselves in the world so that 
what they do matches what they want in 

14
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:29,701
the social environment,
and it's an important set of 

15
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:33,421
distinctions because the emotional 
control that belief systems allow is 

16
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,690
mediated by success in the social 
environment.

17
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:39,040
That's the crucial thing.
It's not.

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,520
It's not directly.
It's not as if you're holding a belief 

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,890
system and that's directly inhibiting 
somehow your emotional responsivity.

20
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,490
It's more that you share,
you have a motive,

21
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,980
orienting yourself in the world so that 
other people can understand what you're 

22
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,181
up to so that you can cooperate and 
compete with them without conflict and 

23
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:08,941
the fact that you can do that without 
conflict and maybe even with 

24
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:09,370
cooperation.
That's what regulates your emotion,

25
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,580
so it's not only the fact of the beliefs
belief system,

26
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:17,581
it's the fact that it's shared with 
everyone else and so people are willing 

27
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:24,991
to defend their belief systems because 
they're defending the territorial 

28
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:30,931
structure that enables them to make 
sense of the world and then to act out 

29
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,530
making sense of the world with everyone 
else around them.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,880
Now,
then the question arises,

31
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,210
what if two different groups of people 
have different belief systems?

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,240
What do you do in a situation like that?
And one answer is you capitulate.

33
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,410
Another answer is that you fight.
Another answer might be that you come to

34
00:02:56,411 --> 00:03:01,411
some consensus about how the difference,
those different belief systems might be 

35
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:05,941
mediated so that you can inhabit the 
same territory without subordination or 

36
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:10,711
without conflict.
But if you're going to come together in 

37
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:17,291
an agreement,
you can't do that simply by abandoning 

38
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,990
the belief system because the belief 
system is what orients you in the world.

39
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,930
And so the negotiation is very tricky 
and because of that,

40
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,900
it often ends up in subordination or 
conflict.

41
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,220
Another question that might arise out of
that rat's nest of questions is if you 

42
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,440
have belief system a and you have belief
system B and they're in conflict,

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,400
is there any principles that you can use
or any guidelines you can use to take 

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,991
the belief systems apart to under to try
to understand what might be of central 

45
00:03:55,091 --> 00:04:00,091
value in either of them or both so that 
if you do bring them together or even if

46
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,460
one supersedes the other,
that there is some evidence that they're

47
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:06,520
predicated on principles that are 
actually viable.

48
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,640
And of course that brings up the 
question of what constitutes viable 

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,161
principles.
And I got interested in that more 

50
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:19,570
particular question because when the 
Cold War was raging,

51
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,650
there were two ideological systems set 
up in the world.

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,330
Roughly speaking.
There were of course more,

53
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:30,331
but we can simplify it for the sake of 
argument down to two and one was 

54
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:35,020
predicated on the communitarian 
principles that were put forward by Marx

55
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:39,640
and the other was a consequence of the,
I would say,

56
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:44,641
western,
individualistic free market capitalist 

57
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:44,641
democracies,
roughly speaking,

58
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:45,850
and then you might ask yourself,
well,

59
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:48,700
were those only,
was that only a difference of opinion?

60
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,280
Right,
because that's the central question.

61
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,630
It was just a difference of opinion.
If what's underneath it is arbitrary 

62
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,791
then a,
it doesn't matter which system wins 

63
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,610
roughly speaking be.
There's no right and wrong in the 

64
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,580
discussion,
right?

65
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:08,581
It's that that would be something that 
would be more akin to a postmodern 

66
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:12,031
claim.
It's just group a puts forward their 

67
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:14,581
claims to power and Group B puts form 
their claims power and they're both 

68
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,641
equally valid and while have add are 
fundamentally because there's no way of 

69
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,520
solving the problem,
but it struck me that,

70
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:26,521
that I didn't think that we should leap 
to that conclusion so rapidly and so I 

71
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:32,041
started to investigate.
I think I started to investigate the 

72
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,721
substructure of Western thought.
Not so much communist thought because I 

73
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,580
thought of communism as an interloper on
the scene.

74
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,210
It was a system that wasn't devised and 
formalized until the late 1900,

75
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,470
late 18 hundreds and I didn't see it as 
part of what you might describe as 

76
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,740
organic development.

77
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,450
There's no mythologies,
so to speak,

78
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:55,030
at the basis of,
of the communist perspective.

79
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:58,760
And one of the things that's very 
interesting is that although those ideas

80
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,220
were roundly defeated by the end of the 
20th century,

81
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:05,030
they're making a comeback so rapidly 
that it's almost unbelievable.

82
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,780
Know I got an email from a medical 
student yesterday at the University of 

83
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,980
Toronto and now their courses that they 
have to take the mandatory.

84
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:17,981
These are social justice courses include
modules on equity and equity as equality

85
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,411
of outcome that they're pushing.
People are having the equality of 

86
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:26,711
outcome notion pushed on them in 
mandatory training and universities 

87
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:26,960
everywhere.
Again,

88
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,940
and equity isn't equality of 
opportunity,

89
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,150
equality of outcome.
You know,

90
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,180
that was the central dictum of the 
Communist states in the 20th century.

91
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:36,350
It's like,
what the hell?

92
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:40,670
How did we get back to that again 
already so.

93
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,750
And the idea being is if there isn't 
absolute equality of outcome within an 

94
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,021
organization that the thing is corrupt,
it needs to be restructured from the 

95
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:50,021
bottom up.

96
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:54,430
And then the question of course is who 
decides that outcomes are equal by what 

97
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,670
means and with what groups?
Because you can,

98
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,040
you can produce an infinite number of 
groups of people with equally validly in

99
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:06,371
some sense,
and you're never going to get equality 

100
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:08,621
of outcome across the infinite number of
ways that you can parse up society into 

101
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:13,901
groups.
It's not even technically possible 

102
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,720
unless everyone has nothing.
So anyways,

103
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,010
these are obviously very powerful ideas 
and the mere fact that they killed 100 

104
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,240
million people already are more in the 
20th century wasn't enough to put them 

105
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,020
to rest.
Anyways.

106
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:30,290
So back to the main theme.
Is there something.

107
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,660
This is the main question.
Is there something,

108
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,020
is there a set of ideas that Western 
civilization is predicated on that are 

109
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:43,010
more than just bloody opinion?
That's the question.

110
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,600
Because if there isn't,
well then what do you.

111
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,910
What do you do about that?
It's arbitrary.

112
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,520
He was just holding it for no reason 
whatsoever.

113
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,240
It could be a different system.
There's no reason to stick with it.

114
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,810
All of those things like it takes the.
It takes the core out of it.

115
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,250
When that was neat,
just claim right.

116
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:06,251
He said,
you take the core metaphysical 

117
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:09,521
presupposition out from underneath 
Western civilization or any civilization

118
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:13,040
for that matter and the whole thing 
loosens chickens,

119
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,030
shakes and crumbles.
Well for nature.

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,040
The metaphysical presupposition was God.
Well then the question of course,

121
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,600
well,
what even does that mean?

122
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:28,601
And it on one hand it means,
I suppose adherence to a dogmatic set of

123
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,880
beliefs,
but then you might ask yourself,

124
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,280
well,
is there something else that it means?

125
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:38,120
It means at least the hypothesis of some
transcendent value.

126
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:39,500
It means at least that.

127
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,780
So you know,
Nisha announced the death of God and so 

128
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,891
one of the consequences of that 
Dostoevsky was working on exactly the 

129
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,410
same set of ideas and in crime and 
punishment in particular,

130
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,500
which is a book I could.
It's a necessary book.

131
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,560
That's the thing is there's a number of 
books that were written in the last 

132
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:03,790
hundred and 20 years that you really 
have to read.

133
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,890
Crime and punishment is one of them and 
I think the Gulag archipelago is another

134
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,930
and probably beyond good and evil is 
another,

135
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,110
but Dostoevsky.
Nietzsche were writing in parallel.

136
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:18,111
It's remarkable how much their their 
lives intertwined and Nisha knew more 

137
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:21,810
about Dostoevsky than than is generally 
don't.

138
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,120
There's been some recent scholarship 
indicating that,

139
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,090
but Dostoyevsky's book,
crime and punishment,

140
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,700
he has his main character.
Riscal Nichol decides that he's going to

141
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:37,701
commit a murder and he has very good 
justification for the murder and 

142
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:37,770
Dostoevsky is very good at this.
He,

143
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,070
he puts his characters into very,
very difficult moral situations and 

144
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,870
gives them full justification for 
pursuing the,

145
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,190
the,
uh,

146
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,230
for pursuing the pathway that they're 
pursuing.

147
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,920
And so ruskell Nikolov,
he's broke and starving.

148
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:07,010
He wants to go to law school.
His sister's about to prostitute herself

149
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:12,011
rough,
roughly speaking by marrying a guy that 

150
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:12,011
hates her,
that she hates and that,

151
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,790
and he has contempt for her,
at least acts in that manner.

152
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,710
He's trying to rescue his mother as 
well,

153
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:18,240
who's also in dire financial straits.
He,

154
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,400
he,
he,

155
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,430
he goes to a pawnbroker to pawn his 
meager position so that he can continue 

156
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,811
to scrape by and she has this nice,
I believe it's her niece that's not very

157
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:34,811
bright,
who she basically treats as as a slave 

158
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:35,090
and his horrible too,
and so the care,

159
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,230
the pawnbroker has this money.
Ruskell Niqab is in dire need.

160
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,760
He thinks,
look,

161
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:43,940
I'll just killer because why the hell 
not?

162
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,390
I'll take her money.
She's not doing any good with it.

163
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,390
Anyways.
I'll free your niece who's just working 

164
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:52,610
as a slave.
She's got all these other people tangled

165
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:57,611
up in her pawnbroker schemes.
All that will happen is the world will 

166
00:10:57,611 --> 00:11:00,620
be a better place and the only thing 
that's holding me back is conventional.

167
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,860
Moral cowardice and Dostoevsky has his 
character in crime and punishment go 

168
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,780
through days,
hours,

169
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,810
hours and days and weeks of intense 
imagination about this rationalization,

170
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:17,750
about this,
trying to justify himself,

171
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:21,920
placing a metal outside,
placing him self outside the law so that

172
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:26,921
he can perpetrate this act and telling 
him self with all the best nihilistic 

173
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:30,410
arguments that the only possible thing 
that could be holding them back is an an

174
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:35,300
arbitrary sense of indoctrinated 
morality and so dusty Esky explores that

175
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:40,301
he does commit the murder and then of 
course all hell breaks loose because 

176
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:40,460
things don't necessarily turn out the 
way that you want.

177
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:41,270
He gets away with it.

178
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,270
However,
while he gets away with a technically 

179
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,641
because no one knows he did it,
but he doesn't get away with it in 

180
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,641
relationship to his own conscience and 
so that the rest of the book explores 

181
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:51,920
that.
Well,

182
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:56,921
Dostoevsky,
I believe it was in crime and 

183
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:56,921
punishment.
Although he makes the same point in many

184
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:59,350
of his books.
He makes a very fundamental point,

185
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:04,351
and this is the kind of point that that 
I think that people who haven't 

186
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:08,461
investigated these matters down,
this particularly particular literary 

187
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:11,860
and philosophical pathway,
never grappled with Dostoevsky,

188
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,890
said straightforwardly if there's no 
god,

189
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,260
so if there is no higher value,
let's say if there's no transcendent 

190
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,711
value,
then you can do whatever you want and 

191
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:24,010
that's the question that he's 
investigating and you see,

192
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,000
this is why I have such frustration say 
with people like Sam Harris,

193
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:33,001
this sort of radical atheists because 
they seem to think that once human 

194
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,650
beings abandoned their,
their grounding in the transcendent,

195
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,160
that the,
the plausible way forward is with a kind

196
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:44,161
of purist rationality that automatically
attributes to other people equivalent 

197
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:44,770
value.

198
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,770
It's like I just don't understand that.
They believe that that's the rational 

199
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,821
pathway.
What the hell is irrational about me 

200
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:56,431
getting exactly what I want from every 
one of you whenever I wanted at every 

201
00:12:56,431 --> 00:13:00,451
possible second.
Why is that are irrational and how 

202
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:03,880
possibly is that more irrational than us
cooperating?

203
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:07,480
So we can both have a good time of it.
I don't understand that.

204
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:13,130
I mean,
it's as if the psychopathic tendency is 

205
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,590
irrational.
There's nothing irrational about it.

206
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,040
It's pure naked self interest.
How is that irrational?

207
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,360
I don't understand that.
Where?

208
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,970
Where's the pathway from rationality to 
to an egalitarian virtue.

209
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,560
Why the hell not every man for himself 
and the devil take the hindmost?

210
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,330
It's a perfectly coherent philosophy and
it's actually one that you can institute

211
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:39,331
in the world with a fair bit of material
success if you want to do it so I don't 

212
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,700
see.

213
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,820
To me,
I think that that the universe that 

214
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,761
people like Dorkins and Harris inhabit 
is so intensely conditioned by 

215
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:53,770
mythological presuppositions that they 
take for granted.

216
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,600
The ethic that emerges out of that as if
it's just a given,

217
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,780
a rational given,
and this of course precisely niches,

218
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:04,780
observation as well as Dostoevsky's.
That's snitches observation.

219
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,070
You don't get it.
The ethic that you think is normative is

220
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:14,071
a consequence of its of its of its 
nesting inside this tremendously lengthy

221
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:19,381
history,
much of which was expressed in 

222
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:19,840
mythological formulation.
You wipe that out.

223
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,870
You don't get to keep all the 
presuppositions and just assume that 

224
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,711
they're rationally axiomatic there.
The rational to make a rational 

225
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:33,721
argument,
you have to start within an initial 

226
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:36,240
proposition while the proposition that 
underlies western culture is that 

227
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,221
there's a transcendent morality.
Now you could say that's a transcendent 

228
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:42,700
morality instantiated in the figure of 
God.

229
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,790
That's fine.
You could even call that a 

230
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:47,790
personification of the morality if you 
want to.

231
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,930
If you don't want to move into a 
metaphysical space.

232
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,310
I'm not arguing for the existence of 
God.

233
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,820
I'm arguing that the ethic that drives 
our culture is predicated on the idea of

234
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:05,240
God and that you can't just take that 
idea away and expect the thing to remain

235
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:08,000
intact midair without any foundational 
support.

236
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,540
Now you don't have to buy that,
but if you're interested in the idea,

237
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:16,541
then you can read Nicha because that's 
what he was trying to sort out and it 

238
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,840
wasn't only nature.
He came to that conclusion.

239
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,970
It was many people have come to that 
conclusion,

240
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:24,971
but I think the two who've outlined it 
most spectacularly were Nietzsche and 

241
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:29,270
Dostoevsky.
Nietzsche is an unbelievably influential

242
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,260
philosopher.
You know,

243
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:32,630
I don't think there was anyone that was 
more influential

244
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,540
during the entire course of the 20th 
century accepting a very,

245
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,990
very tiny handful of other people 
accepting the scientists.

246
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:44,970
We won't bother with their,
with their discussion.

247
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:49,971
You could put marks in that category.
You could put Freud in that category 

248
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:53,421
partly,
but after that the list starts to get a 

249
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:53,421
lot thinner,
you know,

250
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:57,780
so maybe there's 10 people up,
but now level and Dostoevsky of course.

251
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,120
I think if,
if you ever,

252
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,050
if anybody ever prepares a list of the 
top 10 greatest literary figures in the 

253
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,890
world,
he would be in the top 10 list and now I

254
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:12,891
think he's perhaps second to Shakespeare
and maybe above Shakespeare in my 

255
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:17,181
estimation.
So these aren't trivial people we're 

256
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:18,090
talking about and they weren't dealing 
with trivial issues.

257
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Well,
so then the question might be what's at 

258
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,420
the bottom of the idea of a transcendent
value?

259
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,330
And I want to want to approach that

260
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,620
staying out of the metaphysical domain 
as much as possible because you can 

261
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,301
claim anything you want from a 
metaphysical perspective and that's a 

262
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:42,310
big problem.
And so people will say,

263
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:44,680
well,
why come up with a hypothesis of God?

264
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,630
For example,
God can be anything.

265
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,900
There's a satire.
The Flying Spaghetti Monster,

266
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:54,901
right is classic satirical 
representation of a deity that the 

267
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:57,310
atheist types used to buttress their 
arguments and fair enough,

268
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:59,020
you know,
as a satirical idea,

269
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:04,021
it's pretty damn funny,
but there's things about this that 

270
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:07,261
aren't the least bit of music.
And the thing that's not amusing as 

271
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:07,540
well.
What if anything,

272
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,330
is our culture predicated on,
okay,

273
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:11,530
so what happened?
Well,

274
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:16,830
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky put this forth,
this set of propositions and out of 

275
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:21,901
Dostoyevsky's line of thinking to some 
degree grew Solzhenitsyn soldier units 

276
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:26,440
and documented the absolute horrors of 
equity predicated Soviet society.

277
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:27,970
You know,
and we don't teach,

278
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,720
we don't learn about that.
Write this I don't understand,

279
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,200
is that what happened in the 20th 
century on the radical left end of the 

280
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,130
spectrum is not well documented.
Students don't learn about it.

281
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,950
Why the hell is that?
We learned about World War Two.

282
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,660
We learned about what happened in the 
Holocaust.

283
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:45,430
And Fair enough,
we absolutely should,

284
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,850
but nobody knows.
It's a mystery to everyone.

285
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:51,420
When I talk about what happened in the 
Soviet Union,

286
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:56,421
and that's absolutely appalling,
that's to say nothing about what 

287
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:56,850
happened in China,
which was equally horrible.

288
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,150
The system didn't work.
It was predicated on the wrong values.

289
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,870
Unless you think that that sort of thing
means worked,

290
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,700
you know,
because you have to define that as well,

291
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,360
but it collapsed under its own weight 
after it killed tens of millions of 

292
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,360
people.
That doesn't really end.

293
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,660
Still Rich,
not like Russia has recovered.

294
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,140
It doesn't seem to me like that's a very
good definition of worked.

295
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Now whatever we're doing in the West 
seems to work for all of its flaws and 

296
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,250
the question is,
are we just deceiving ourselves?

297
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:30,920
Is it just arbitrary power,
politics and opinion,

298
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,660
or is there something at the bottom of 
it?

299
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,930
So when Solzhenitsyn wrote the Gulag 
archipelago,

300
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:45,931
he believed that the Russians would have
to return to Orthodox Christianity to 

301
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:49,051
find their pathway forward and that's of
course has made him into a reactionary 

302
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:51,520
in the eyes of many of his critics,
but that is perhaps what is happening in

303
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:56,521
Russia.
Although it's very difficult to tell 

304
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:58,261
because Putin also seems to be using his
affiliation with the Orthodox Christian 

305
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,430
Church as as it means to consolidate 
power,

306
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,670
so the situation in Russia is unclear,
but a religious revival if that's 

307
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,000
happening in Russia and perhaps it 
isn't,

308
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:12,001
but if it is happening,
is something that unfolds over decades 

309
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,671
and even centuries,
so it's not an easy thing to evaluate 

310
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:14,671
when it first starts to happen,

311
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,470
but Solzhenitsyn drew the same 
conclusions that dos Dsq did 

312
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,110
fundamentally,
not not in exactly the same way,

313
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,220
but very,
very close.

314
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,140
He,
he believed as far as I could tell,

315
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:30,141
that unless people were willing to 
adhere to some sort of transcendent 

316
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:34,211
value,
that they had no protection against 

317
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:36,800
pathological ideologies and no 
protection against the murderous 

318
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,951
impulses that came along with them and I
found his work at unbelievably.

319
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,090
I found his right.
Incredible,

320
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,500
powerful,
incredible.

321
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,310
I don't know how you can read that book 
and not draw that kind of conclusion.

322
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,340
I think people who criticized soldier 
nets and have never read the damn book 

323
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,001
because that book is like.
It's like going into the ring with 

324
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:56,580
Mohammed Ali and being pummeled to death
for half an hour,

325
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,830
you know,
you don't recover from it that easily.

326
00:19:59,250 --> 00:19:59,760
So

327
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,810
then young branched off of nature and so
niches.

328
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:11,200
Idea was that people would have to 
create their own values roughly speaking

329
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,620
and I think that's where niches is.
We is his weakest because it isn't 

330
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,971
obvious to me that people can create 
their own values and I think he fell 

331
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:25,411
into.
I don't want to be a casual critic of 

332
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,460
nature because that's always dangerous 
given that he probably had an Iq of 260.

333
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,420
You know,
I mean,

334
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:30,380
he was way the hell out there in the 
stratosphere.

335
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:32,020
It just,
when you think you've understood what he

336
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:37,021
was talking about,
you can be bloody well sure that you 

337
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:37,021
didn't,
but it does seem to me.

338
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:39,100
And he was running out of time.
He died young and he was trying to solve

339
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:44,101
this problem in a rush I would say.
And he hypothesized that people would 

340
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:48,601
have to become Superman overmanned 
roughly in order to deal with the death 

341
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:49,360
of God.

342
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,360
And that idea sort of branched off into 
Nazi propaganda because that's in some 

343
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,591
sense with the Nazis were trying to do 
with their promotion of the of the 

344
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,210
perfect area.
Now it's a mist,

345
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,350
it's a misappropriation of nature in my 
estimation.

346
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,190
And it was partly because his sister who
is a perverse creature,

347
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,880
I'm a,
what would you say,

348
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:14,881
doctored his work in such a way so that 
it was more easily appropriated by the 

349
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:17,440
Nazis,
but there is some danger in what he said

350
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:19,390
too,
because the question is,

351
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:24,391
well,
if you're going to transform yourself 

352
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:24,391
into the,
into the giver of values,

353
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:28,860
what stops you from inflating yourself 
into something like a demigod and just 

354
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,820
pronouncing what the values are going to
be.

355
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,510
So that's a problem.
You know what you're going to replace 

356
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,550
tradition with yourself.
Well,

357
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,460
there's dangers in that because there's 
nothing to keep you humble.

358
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,620
That's,
that's the most appropriate objection.

359
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:53,621
There's nothing to keep you humble.
And those things can spiral out of 

360
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:54,900
control very rapidly.
And they did say in the case of Hitler,

361
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:57,590
I mean it's easy to blame what happened 
in Germany on Hitler,

362
00:21:57,591 --> 00:22:02,591
but that's a.
that's a big mistake because it was a 

363
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:02,591
dialogue between Hitler and the German 
people,

364
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,340
right?
Hitler didn't create himself.

365
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,100
It was cocreation.
He said things.

366
00:22:07,101 --> 00:22:09,620
People listened and told him back what 
to say,

367
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:14,621
and then he said them and they listened 
and they told them back what to say and 

368
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:17,810
it looped until he was the mouthpiece of
their darkest desires.

369
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,540
Now that's a.
that's a game he was willing to play,

370
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,520
but you can't think about that as it 
isn't like Hitler created Nazi Germany,

371
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,130
Hitler and the Germans,
cocreated,

372
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:29,780
Nazi Germany.
Now,

373
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:34,781
when a leader gives our articulation to 
the imagination of the population,

374
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,900
that's what a leader does,
and you know you could say that,

375
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:39,650
well,
Hitler,

376
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,860
maybe Hitler filtered what the Germans 
were telling him through a particular 

377
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,060
lens because he had no shortage of 
resentment and desire for revenge in his

378
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,200
own heart.
You know,

379
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,560
it's not like his life was a spectacular
success be before he became a political 

380
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,540
activist and he was brutalized very 
badly in world war one and he didn't get

381
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:03,541
to pursue his primary dream,
which was to be an art student in 

382
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:07,561
Vienna,
and he had applied three times and got 

383
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:07,600
rejected all three times and so it was 
bitter about that.

384
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,660
He was basically living on the streets 
after World War One.

385
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,040
It wasn't the world's happiest person 
and I'm sure he carried a fair bit of 

386
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,501
resentment in his heart when he was in 
the trenches in world war war one at in 

387
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,540
one experience that he had.
All of his friends were killed by a 

388
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,510
mortar when he had wandered off to go do
something else.

389
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,870
So you know,
it's hard to even imagine what something

390
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:33,871
like that would do to you,
but I can tell you when you're the only 

391
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,691
survivor out of 20 people,
that's also going to give you an 

392
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:39,040
enhanced sense of your own specialness.
Because the alternative is just to think

393
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,640
about how God damn arbitrary.
The universe really is so,

394
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,160
so

395
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,580
young.
Studied nature in in great detail and he

396
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:54,581
was particularly interested because 
young had his finger on the central 

397
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:55,950
problems all the time,
right?

398
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,450
Because he was a great psychologist and 
he was listening to what people said and

399
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,660
he was an a staggering genius as well 
and so like Nietzsche or Dostoevsky or 

400
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,820
social nets and he was that kind of 
prophetic type I would say,

401
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,390
and he understood as well.
Perhaps what was wrong with niches 

402
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:18,731
formulation,
the idea that people could only create 

403
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:21,341
their new,
their own values and that's what would 

404
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:24,040
replace the lacking.
Found the foundation that was now 

405
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,830
lacking under Western civilization 
itself.

406
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,610
And he came to his conclusion,
I would say through Freud because Freud 

407
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,830
started analyzing parts of the human 
cognitive process and content that 

408
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:41,180
people hadn't attended to before in any,
in any great detail.

409
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,950
And that was primarily dreams.

410
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,340
You know,
the idea of dream analysis I suppose is 

411
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,831
one of Freud's perhaps Freud's major 
contribution to modern western thought.

412
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,590
The idea was there was something to 
dreams and I suppose what I did is said,

413
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:57,200
hey,
look,

414
00:24:57,201 --> 00:25:02,201
isn't it strange we have this whole 
other form of thought that we engage in 

415
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:07,000
at night and it speaks in the language 
that we don't really understand and so 

416
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,550
what the hell is that?
And you can say,

417
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:15,551
and many modern people do,
dreams are of no significance or even 

418
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:17,120
that they're random processes,
which is an absurd proposition obviously

419
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:19,310
because they're by Terrell,
whatever they are,

420
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,860
they're obviously not random,
so.

421
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,740
So Freud's idea was that there was some 
something in dreams that was 

422
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,060
informative,
so that's his.

423
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,090
Now he had a method for describe for 
extracting out from the dream what the 

424
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:39,570
dream purported to represent and he 
outlined that great deal of detail in 

425
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:43,580
the interpretation of dreams and if you 
want to read one book by Freud,

426
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:44,840
I would highly recommend that one.

427
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,790
It's a very long book and it's very 
detailed,

428
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:51,791
but Freud does it extraordinarily 
comprehensive analysis of the way that 

429
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:55,601
dreams work.
Now he made the because because he had 

430
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:59,321
brought a theoretical framework to bear 
even on his investigation into dream 

431
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:04,211
structure.
He concluded that dreams were 

432
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:06,821
essentially wish fulfillments,
and that's where young and Freud 

433
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:11,350
disagreed.
He also believed that the primary 

434
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,230
motivating factor of human beings with 
sexual,

435
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:16,970
and now that's a tougher one to toss 
aside because even if you're a Darwinian

436
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,660
rather than a Freud Ian,
you're going to obviously support the 

437
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,711
proposition that sexual motivation among
any living creature is going to be one 

438
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:31,511
of the highest order motivations because
otherwise creatures don't reproduce and 

439
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:33,620
prevail over the long run.
So the question is,

440
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:36,590
is that is that the ultimate source of 
motivation?

441
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:39,410
And in some sense the answer to that has
to be yes.

442
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,920
Well,
Freud wanted to make that in some ways 

443
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:44,920
the sole source motivation,
and I'm oversimplifying,

444
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,960
I hate to do that in relationship to 
Freud because he was not as simple 

445
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,540
minded.
Character young had a dream once,

446
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:56,541
if I remember correctly,
that Freud and jung were excavating a 

447
00:26:56,851 --> 00:27:01,851
basement and so freud had outlined in 
Freud had already discovered the 

448
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:01,851
basement,
let's say.

449
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:06,801
So that would be the unconscious 
structure of the psyche and young broke 

450
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:08,880
through into another basement that was a
multi chambered place.

451
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:09,900
So many,
many,

452
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:14,901
many rooms and I suppose what drove 
young and freud apart was the 

453
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,760
proposition that there was a hell of a 
lot more going down,

454
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:23,060
going on down there.
Then had already met the eye and they 

455
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,960
broke on the idea that the sexual 
impulse was primary.

456
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,110
Roughly speaking,
they broke when you wrote a book called 

457
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,110
symbols of transformation,
which is actually.

458
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,440
There's.
There's three books that I know of that 

459
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:35,820
are sort of like maps of meaning.
One is symbols of transformation.

460
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,540
One is a book by Eric Norman called the 
origins and history of consciousness

461
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,570
and the third and the third one,
while his maps of meaning,

462
00:27:44,571 --> 00:27:46,550
they're the same book.
They're just like,

463
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:49,550
they're trying to solve the same problem
from three different directions.

464
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,160
They're all attempts to address the same
problem.

465
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,760
And so symbols of transformation was a 
book that you wrote about the fantasies 

466
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,470
of a schizophrenia American woman,
and he was.

467
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:05,270
He was trying to relate her fantasies to
these old mythological ideas and young's

468
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:10,271
idea essentially.
And this is an idea that was shared by 

469
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,320
people like piaget.
So we were not going to say that you and

470
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:15,830
I just pulled this idea out of the air,
was that the,

471
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,190
the birthplace of mythic mythology and 
literature for that matter was the dream

472
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,600
that they share structural that they 
share,

473
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,690
they share,
they share what mode of information 

474
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,600
presentation,
and it's a relatively radical 

475
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,600
hypothesis,
but,

476
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,880
but given that they both,
they both represent

477
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:49,730
hm

478
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,710
dreams,
dreams and mythological representations 

479
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,561
share and essentially narrative 
structure and they use their literary 

480
00:28:58,561 --> 00:28:58,561
like,
you know,

481
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:02,140
I mean it's not so unreasonable to 
notice that a dream at night is like the

482
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:07,141
movie that you play in your head and 
it's not unreasonable to note as well 

483
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:11,461
that the dreams that you have at night 
bear a relationship to the daydreams 

484
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:12,790
that you have during the day.
It's a form of cognition.

485
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:15,130
It seems like an involuntary form of 
cognition.

486
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:16,510
No,
and that's a very strange thing.

487
00:29:16,511 --> 00:29:18,880
So young thought about the dream as 
nature,

488
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:21,760
speaking of its own accord,
roughly speaking.

489
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,440
And so his idea was,
well,

490
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,180
when you,
when you sleep,

491
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:27,160
you dream,
but the dream happens to you.

492
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,520
It's not something that you create the 
way that you don't even think about 

493
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:32,520
creating it because I might say,
well,

494
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,970
what are you thinking about?
And you'll say,

495
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:38,971
I'm thinking about whatever it is and 
you'll take credit in some sense for 

496
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:40,720
thinking that because it seems like a 
voluntary activity,

497
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,970
but what happens at night is that you 
think,

498
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:47,971
but you think in voluntarily and so what
would say is that means that something 

499
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:52,201
is thinking in you and that's a 
perfectly reasonable way of looking at 

500
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:56,350
it and this is one of the things that's 
uncanny about the cycle analysts as they

501
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,460
were willing to take their observations 
to their logical conclusion.

502
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,180
There are things that think in you.
What are those things and what are they 

503
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:10,720
thinking and why are they thinking it?
Now,

504
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,640
if you do dream analysis,
and this is a tricky thing because who's

505
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:18,010
to say if your damn analysis is correct?
Right?

506
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:20,340
It's very difficult to understand that.
If you.

507
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:25,370
If you do dream analysis with someone,
you generally have them lay out their 

508
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,910
dream and then you ask them when they're
going through their dream a second time,

509
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,030
they lay out their dream and you can 
kind of get a picture of it,

510
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,750
and then they lay out their dream a 
second time and as they go through it,

511
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,450
every time they mentioned a detail or a 
character,

512
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:42,451
you ask them what that reminds them of 
and the hypothesis is that the dream is 

513
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:48,241
presenting an image or an idea that's 
associated with a network of ideas and 

514
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:51,220
then if you can expand on the network of
ideas as you go through the dream,

515
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,990
you can elaborate on the dream.

516
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,400
You can expand it upwards and you can 
start to see what it might be attempting

517
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,500
to put forward.
Now,

518
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:02,350
Freud's idea was that the dream knew 
what it was doing,

519
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:07,590
but that its content was being 
suppressed and oppressed by an internal 

520
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,100
sensor.
So the dream had to be sneaky about what

521
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:13,060
it was saying because it was going to 
deliver a message that the person didn't

522
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:18,061
want to hear.
That that was tied up with his idea of 

523
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:19,360
repression,
but that's not young's idea.

524
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:20,920
See,
young's idea was different.

525
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:21,970
He said,
no,

526
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:26,971
no.
The dream is trying to tell you what 

527
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:26,971
it's trying to tell you as clear as it 
can.

528
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:31,120
That's just the best it can do,
and so you could think of the dream,

529
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,640
and this is I believe,
the right way to think about it.

530
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:38,641
The dream is the birthplace of thought.
The same way that artists are the 

531
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:38,641
birthplace of culture.

532
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,860
It's exactly the same process.
It's that your mind is groping outward 

533
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,030
to try to comprehend what it has not yet
comprehended and it does that first by 

534
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:52,920
trying to map it on to image and it's 
doing that in the dream and it's 

535
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,690
somewhat incoherent and and,
and well,

536
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:59,350
let's stick within coherent because it's
not yet a full fledge thought.

537
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,700
It's the birthplace of thought.
It's a fantasy about what might be,

538
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:09,130
and then if you can grip the fantasy and
share it with other people,

539
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:14,131
then maybe they can elaborate upon it 
and bring it into being with more 

540
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:15,790
clarity than it would be if it merely 
existed.

541
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:20,690
As the precursor of a thought in your 
imagination now cause you anxiety,

542
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:23,860
idea two was okay.
You think you think in words,

543
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,920
where the hell do those thoughts come 
from while they just spring into my 

544
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,020
head?
While that's not much of an answer,

545
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,180
they just what?
Pop out of the void.

546
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Is there some sort of precursor to the 
development of the ideas?

547
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,600
Is there a developmental pathway?
So here's an image.

548
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,770
This is the Buddha.

549
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,040
There's calm water,
there's a lotus.

550
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,560
The roots go all the way down to the 
bottom of the lake.

551
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:50,561
It's dark down there.
The roots are embedded in the dark 

552
00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:54,041
substrata at the bottom of the lake.
The plant moves upwards towards the 

553
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,610
light that the water gets lighter and 
lighter.

554
00:32:55,611 --> 00:33:00,611
As you move upward with the root,
the flower manifests itself on the 

555
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:03,200
surface and the Buddha sits in the 
middle.

556
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,030
That's an image about how ideas develop.
They come out from the bottom of reality

557
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:13,031
and they push themselves up towards the 
light and they blast forward and 

558
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:16,190
something emerges as a consequence.
That's what that image means and it's an

559
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:21,191
image.
The Golden Buddha that's sitting in the 

560
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:21,191
middle of the Lotus is an image of the 
perfect person.

561
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:25,871
You could think about the gold Buddha 
who sits in a triangle as exactly the 

562
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:26,870
same thing.
That's the eye on the top of the pyramid

563
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:32,110
is they're all the same ideas and what's
the idea that's trying to burst forward 

564
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,650
how to be in the world?

565
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,950
Well,
what other idea would burst forward 

566
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,950
because it's the only problem that you 
really have,

567
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,120
right?
How should you manifest yourself 

568
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,270
properly in the world?
It's everyone's question.

569
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,280
It's the ultimate question.
It's been the ultimate question since 

570
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,500
the beginning of time and we'd been 
working out that idea forever,

571
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:56,530
first of all,
merely by acting it out and then by 

572
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,561
representing the actions and then by 
representing the representations and 

573
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:04,000
spiraling all that together.
So I started looking developmentally.

574
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,150
I thought,
okay,

575
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:10,390
maybe these idea have roots,
and this was partly predicated on the 

576
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:14,651
observation from Dostoevsky and niches 
and so forth that there did seem to be a

577
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:18,620
necessary pattern in moral,
in morality.

578
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:21,800
Did it seem to be unnecessary pattern?
It wasn't arbitrary.

579
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:26,801
It was a.
It was a representation of the specific 

580
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:30,161
mode of human beings and it isn't 
something that's just imposed on you by 

581
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:31,250
your culture's not something that's just
learned,

582
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,550
it's intrinsic in you and it's manifest 
in the culture at the same time and 

583
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:40,250
there's a dial and and and there's a 
dialogue between those two things.

584
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,060
Culture and nature were both with the 
ideas embedded,

585
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:45,410
trying to make,
make,

586
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:50,750
make the proper articulation of that 
spring forward in each individual,

587
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,960
and that's only to say these aren't,
these aren't radical propositions.

588
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,430
Your nature strive so that you can 
manifest yourself properly in the world.

589
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,580
Culture strives to aid you in that 
endeavor.

590
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,920
Is that.
Is there something about that?

591
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:07,660
That's,
that's,

592
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,970
that's dubious validity.
What else would it be doing?

593
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,930
Working for your death,
hardly working for your destruction.

594
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,260
While you could see that maybe when 
culture becomes pathologized,

595
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,280
but to the degree that it's able to 
maintain itself across long periods of 

596
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,160
time,
it obviously has to be striving in some 

597
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,771
way for the man of,
for your individual manifestation so 

598
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:31,040
that you can survive and flourish.
So there's a,

599
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,100
there's a,
there's a co creation of the human being

600
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:39,101
going on through nature and through 
culture and while and then perhaps with 

601
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:43,881
your own,
with your own voluntary will 

602
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:45,730
participating,
whatever the hell that is,

603
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,790
something we don't understand at all and
are and are prone to dismiss because of 

604
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:50,860
that.

605
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:59,050
So then I learned about piaget.
Piaget had some very interesting ideas 

606
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,560
and I think I've told you already what 
piaget was up to.

607
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,100
He wasn't a developmental psychologist.
He didn't even regard himself as a 

608
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,071
psychologist.
He wanted to reconcile science and 

609
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:12,761
religion.
That's what he was doing through his 

610
00:36:12,761 --> 00:36:14,651
entire bloody life because it drove him 
crazy when he was an adolescent and he 

611
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:19,811
didn't think that he would be able to 
survive unless he could bring those two 

612
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:20,900
things together.
So he's working on the same problem.

613
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:26,000
And so one of the things that piaget,
who was very prone to observation,

614
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:30,320
he was an ecologist of human beings.
That's a good way of thinking about it.

615
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:35,321
And ecologist as a scientist who studies
animals by watching their behavior 

616
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:36,650
rather than studying them under 
laboratory conditions.

617
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,750
And he got very interested in the 
spontaneous emergence of morality in the

618
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:44,210
play of children that was so smart.

619
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,260
They're so smart.
That idea that you know when kids come 

620
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,690
together and unify themselves towards a 
particular goal,

621
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,340
so in play that are morality emerges out
of that and that that morality,

622
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:58,770
and I've mentioned this before,
there's a morality in game one there.

623
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,270
There's a morality in game two,
there's a morality in game three.

624
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,870
What's common across all those 
morality's as a matter of morality.

625
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,410
And so the matter morality emerges from 
the particular morality's that are 

626
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,010
embedded in particular cooperative 
situations.

627
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,530
We could say cooperative and competitive
situations.

628
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,830
You can expand that out to die.
You can expand that out biologically to 

629
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,740
some degree,
to the idea of the dominance hierarchy,

630
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,040
right?
Every social animal and even many 

631
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,760
animals who aren't social are embedded 
in a dominance hierarchy.

632
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,180
The dominant Turkey has a structure.
We couldn't call it a dominance 

633
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,180
hierarchy.
Dominance hierarchy,

634
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,850
a,
b,

635
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:35,810
c,
d,

636
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:40,811
e,
thousands of them across thousands of 

637
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:43,600
years.
You extract out from all of them what 

638
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,170
central to all of them.
That's the pyramid of value.

639
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,580
What's the.
What's the question?

640
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,640
What question do you need answered about
the Pyramid of value?

641
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,290
What's at the top

642
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,300
[inaudible]?
That's the ideal.

643
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,030
That's the eye.
At the top of the pyramid are the Golden

644
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,650
Buddha.
In the Lotus,

645
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:00,350
it's the same thing.
It's the same thing as the crucifix,

646
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,200
paradoxically enough,
and that has to do.

647
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:08,201
It has to do with something like the 
voluntary acceptance and therefore 

648
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:10,280
transcendence of suffering.
It's something like that.

649
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,630
These are not arbitrary ideas.
They're deeply.

650
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,940
That's my case anyways.
They're deeply,

651
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:20,750
deeply,
deeply rooted in biology and culture.

652
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:26,130
They're there as deeply rooted in 
biology as the dominance hierarchy is 

653
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,590
rooted in biology and we already know 
the answer to that.

654
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:31,610
The dominance hierarchy is been around 
for 350 million years.

655
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:36,550
It's a long time.
You don't get to just brush off and say,

656
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:37,240
well,
morality,

657
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:40,360
some sort of second order cognitive 
problem.

658
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,290
It's like,
no,

659
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,120
it's not.
I can.

660
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,270
I can tell you something about its 
instantiation in your nervous system.

661
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,810
You have a counter at the bottom of your
brain that keeps track of where you are 

662
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,280
in terms of your status and it bloody 
well regulates the sensitivity of your 

663
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,280
emotions.

664
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,030
So if you're at the bottom of the 
hierarchy,

665
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:03,031
barely clinging onto the world,
everything overwhelms you and that's 

666
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:05,710
because you're damn near dead and so 
everything should overwhelm you.

667
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:08,620
You've got no extra resources anymore.
Threat,

668
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,890
you're sunk,
so you become extremely sensitive to 

669
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,251
negative emotion and maybe also 
impulsive so that you grab well the 

670
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:20,990
grabbing is good and if you're near the 
top in the dominance hierarchy and your 

671
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,140
counter tells you that,
then your serotonin levels go up.

672
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,530
Your less sensitive to negative emotion,
you're less impulsive.

673
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,890
You live longer,
like everything works in your favor.

674
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:34,891
Your immune system functions better and 
you're oriented at least to some degree 

675
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:38,521
towards the medium and longterm future.
And you can afford that because all hell

676
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:41,350
is breaking loose around you all the 
time.

677
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,800
And so then the question is,
is there a way of being that increases 

678
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,760
the probability that you're going to 
move up dominance hierarchies?

679
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:54,450
Well,
that doesn't seem to be particularly 

680
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,341
provocative proposition unless you think
that it's completely arbitrary and 

681
00:39:56,341 --> 00:40:00,811
random and that you can think that if 
you want,

682
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:03,160
but I don't think there's any evidence 
for that whatsoever.

683
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:04,240
I mean,
we certainly have,

684
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,810
even for sexual selection,
we impose criteria.

685
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,230
They're not ram random and arbitrary,
so.

686
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,140
Okay,
so back to young.

687
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,050
So what was young trying to do?
Well,

688
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,550
he was trying to see,
see young believer that once we had 

689
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,080
stopped populating the cosmos with gods 
that they went inside.

690
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,300
That's a good way of thinking.
Well,

691
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,620
think,
think about it this way.

692
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,700
You know,
archaic person looks at the sky and uses

693
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,230
his imagination to populate the sky.
What's The sky?

694
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,820
Well,
it's the constellations.

695
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:44,890
It's the domain of the gods.
Well,

696
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:45,610
why?
Well,

697
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:49,510
because the gods are what are be,
are out there beyond your understanding.

698
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:51,520
Well that's what you see when you look 
up at the sky.

699
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,660
So you populate the night sky with 
figures of your imagination.

700
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:01,020
So the gods are the things that you 
broadcast out of your imagination and 

701
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,921
see spread over the world.
It's like the contents of your 

702
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:08,791
unconscious are manifesting themselves.
When you encounter the unknown exactly 

703
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,120
what it is,
that's exactly how.

704
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,850
How else could it be?
Right?

705
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:15,970
You're projecting your fantasy onto what
you don't understand.

706
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,670
That's how you start to cope with what 
you don't understand.

707
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,150
You populate the unknown with Daddy's.
Where did they come from?

708
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,220
They came from your imagination.
Well,

709
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:26,590
what happens when you take them out of 
the world?

710
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,570
Do they disappear?
No,

711
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,960
they just go back into your imagination.
So that's where you dug down to find 

712
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,651
them.
That's the same motif as rescuing your 

713
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:40,490
dead father from the from or rescuing 
your father from the belly of the whale.

714
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:45,610
It's the same idea is that the corpses 
of the gods inhabit your imagination.

715
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,980
So where do you go?
If you need to revivify them,

716
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,280
you go into your imagination and that's 
exactly what you did and this is no 

717
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,670
secret.
If you read Young,

718
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:58,880
he tells you that's what he did.
He tells you that's why he did it.

719
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:04,130
It's not an interpretation on my part.
So then then the question is,

720
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:09,131
what's down there?
Is it just massive catastrophe or is 

721
00:42:09,131 --> 00:42:13,391
there something in it that's patterned 
while young's proposition was that you 

722
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:19,211
read?
Did you really discover the great 

723
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:21,310
archetypes that guide human being by 
investigating the structure of your 

724
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:25,781
imagination?
When you thought about the imagination 

725
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:28,451
in some sense,
at least in part as a manifestation of 

726
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:28,451
your.
Of your biology?

727
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:29,030
Well,
yes.

728
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,220
What else would it be?
You know,

729
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,140
when I told you that story about my 
nephew,

730
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:38,141
I believe right about him running around
as a night and then going off to have a 

731
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,640
combat with the doors and the dragons.

732
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,440
It's like,
well where did that come from?

733
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,750
Well,
partly it came from his culture,

734
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:48,290
right?
Because he was at night and so obviously

735
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,560
that's a cultural construct,
but the thing is is that his imagination

736
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,150
is this structure that's looking for 
things to fill it self with.

737
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,360
Just like your predisposition to 
language,

738
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,200
you have a predisposition to language.
What is that we don't know.

739
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,800
What does it do?
It looks for things in the world to fill

740
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,600
itself with.
Right?

741
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:10,010
And if you're.
If you.

742
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:12,710
First of all,
when you start to learn how to speak,

743
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:14,490
you babble.
Every phoneme did.

744
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,920
Did you know that there's.
There's a lot,

745
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:21,010
there's a fire.
I was learning to speak an Asian 

746
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,741
language.
There would be full names I couldn't 

747
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:23,741
pronounce and vice versa,
an infant,

748
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:25,460
all of them.
They babble all the phonemes and then as

749
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:30,461
they start to learn the language,
they lose the ability to say a bunch of 

750
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:32,030
them and only retain the ones that are 
relevant to that language.

751
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,230
So a baby babbles all laying all 
possible languages.

752
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,170
That's a way of thinking about it and 
then loses the ability.

753
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,020
So that's a manifest that's you can see 
there.

754
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:42,890
So you could say,
well,

755
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,930
you manifest the potential to be 
possessed by all the set of all possible

756
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:50,270
archetypes.
It's built into your biology.

757
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:54,050
And then as you're enculturated in your 
own culture,

758
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,230
the set of archetypes that manifest its 
benefits themselves in that culture are 

759
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,860
the ones that you pull in for your own 
use.

760
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:04,130
So my,
my nephews running around like a night.

761
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:04,970
Well,
you know,

762
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:07,040
if he would have been born in the middle
of the Amazon,

763
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,880
he would have been running around with a
bow and know a poisoned Arrow in a bowl.

764
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,030
It's the same thing.
It's the same idea.

765
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:19,031
It's just trapped out in,
in different cultural dress and he,

766
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,840
he,
his little imagination was trying to 

767
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:24,840
solve the problem.

768
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:24,840
How do you deal with the unknown?
Well,

769
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,711
what's the unknown?
It's these little devils that keep 

770
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:32,440
biting,
jumping up on you and biting you and 

771
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,390
they come out without.
So just killing them.

772
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,190
It's like cutting the head off the 
hydro,

773
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,290
right?
Seven more grow.

774
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:42,470
Well,
what the hell good is it to solve one 

775
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,621
problem when there's just a bunch more 
problems that are come gonna come after 

776
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:46,890
you.
And that's everyone's question.

777
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:48,720
That's the ultimate question of 
nihilism,

778
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:54,020
right?
Why bother solving a problem if all 

779
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,930
that's going to happen is that 20 more 
problems are going to come your way.

780
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,080
Why not just give up and die while,
right?

781
00:44:58,081 --> 00:44:59,820
It's a good question.
It's a.

782
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,290
it's a good question,
right?

783
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:06,530
Is the suffering so intense that the 
whole game should just be brought to it 

784
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:10,191
and that's another fundamental question 
of existence and people who've become 

785
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:14,310
truly malevolent answer that question in
the affirmative,

786
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,710
they say,
it's too much.

787
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,990
We should destroy it.
Now,

788
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:23,220
I wouldn't say they're precisely doing 
it only for humanitarian reasons,

789
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,460
but you have to understand and 
appreciate the logic.

790
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,040
It's not irrational.
That's the other thing.

791
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:32,610
It's not irrational to work for the 
destruction of being.

792
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,180
It's not irrational.
In fact,

793
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,850
it might be the most rational thing you 
could come up with.

794
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It depends on your initial initial set 
of presuppositions so young down into 

795
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:47,340
the belly of the beast,
so to speak,

796
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:48,560
to to,
to,

797
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:53,810
to to see what lurks in the imagination.
He sees the birthplace of archetipal 

798
00:45:54,691 --> 00:45:55,460
ideas.
Well,

799
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:59,200
what are archetipal ideas?
There are patterns of a.

800
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:04,430
You could think about them as as 
representations of patterns of adaptive 

801
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,730
behavior,
and so then you might ask,

802
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:06,990
well,
where did they come from?

803
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,980
Well,
that's part of what I've been trying to 

804
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,320
to,
to teach you about.

805
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,160
They evolved as far as I can tell,
right?

806
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,160
They evolved collectively.
Is that our society,

807
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:22,050
and this is the dominance hierarchy 
idea,

808
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:27,080
dominance,
hierarchy set themselves up as a matter 

809
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,121
of course,
they're the standard way that animals 

810
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:30,270
organized themselves into territory.
Well,

811
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:35,271
okay,
human beings are watching those 

812
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:35,280
dominance hierarchies since we became 
self aware thinking,

813
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,250
what the hell are we up to?
What the hell are we up to?

814
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,130
What's and and there's a question that 
lurks in there.

815
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:46,310
What constitutes acceptable power?
What constitutes acceptable sovereignty?

816
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,590
Who should lead?
Who should rule?

817
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,260
What should be at the top?
While we talked about that,

818
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:55,470
the Mesopotamians figured that out.
Speech and vision,

819
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,510
that's Marduk speech,
vision,

820
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,930
and the willingness to confront the 
terrible unknown.

821
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:06,050
That's what should rule.
While what's that an arbitrary idea or 

822
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,680
is that a great idea?
How could it be any other way?

823
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:13,010
Well,
that's what human beings are like and I 

824
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,171
don't think that you can read the 
Mesopotamian story and understand the 

825
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:20,271
reference,
which isn't an easy thing to do and 

826
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:20,271
failed to draw that conclusion.

827
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,810
Marta has eyes all the way around his 
head.

828
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,480
He speaks magic words.
He goes off to fight,

829
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:27,120
tie amat the dragon of chaos.
Well,

830
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:29,860
what's that?
That's the Reptilian Predator that lurks

831
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:32,930
in the unknown.
While it is any of that it.

832
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:38,230
Is there anything about any of that that
stands in opposition to what you were pr

833
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,620
would presume if you were just analyzing
our situation from a purely biological 

834
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:46,510
perspective,
we're prey animals.

835
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,960
We're predators.
We'd be threatened by reptiles forever.

836
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,760
Why wouldn't we use the Predator that 
lurks in the dark forest or the water as

837
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:59,761
a representative of the unknown?
Why wouldn't we harness that circuitry?

838
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,280
We already have it at hand and even more
to the point,

839
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:07,300
how could we do anything else?
It's it makes perfect sense.

840
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,400
Well,
so then you might say,

841
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:11,170
well,
what would you want to be king?

842
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,560
You could say king of the world are king
of your own soul.

843
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,840
What do you want to subordinate yourself
to?

844
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,320
How bout your heroic willingness to 
encounter the unknown and articulate it 

845
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,670
and share that with people?
There is no nobler vision than that and 

846
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,430
I don't see that.
It's merely arbitrary and so,

847
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:35,490
and it's not merely arbitrary too 
because if you do that to the degree 

848
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:39,220
that you do that assuming your society 
isn't entirely corrupt,

849
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,540
you will be successful.
It will actually aid you practically.

850
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,320
You'll rise up above men,
you'll be selected by women,

851
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,500
you'll be admirable,
you'll be valued and and you know that 

852
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,490
because if you look at the people that 
you admire and value,

853
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,700
again,
unless you've taken a detour into dark 

854
00:48:59,700 --> 00:48:59,700
places and are,
are,

855
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,910
are,
are,

856
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:06,180
are possessed,
with admiration for people who are 

857
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:06,880
working for malevolent purposes and for 
destruction.

858
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:12,120
You just have to watch the people that 
you admire and try to figure out what's 

859
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,601
common across them and draw your own 
conclusions and you can ask yourself to 

860
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:19,090
when you're torturing yourself with your
conscience because you're not doing what

861
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:20,590
you should be and you know it.

862
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,070
What is it that you're torturing 
yourself in relationship to?

863
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:28,240
You have a vision of your own ideal and 
you torment yourself.

864
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:30,670
If you're not matching it,
what's the ideal?

865
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,110
Well,
you don't know,

866
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:37,111
right?
It's kind of incoherent and and poorly 

867
00:49:37,111 --> 00:49:37,420
articulated,
but that doesn't mean it isn't trying to

868
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:40,930
manifest itself and make itself known to
you.

869
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:46,350
It's really the purpose of religious 
education is to make that ideal 

870
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,070
articulated well.
We've lost that.

871
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,450
It's not a good thing.
Okay,

872
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:57,451
so I talked to you about the 
Mesopotamian story and I talked to you 

873
00:49:57,451 --> 00:50:00,661
about the Egyptian story and what I 
thought it meant and it's a bit of an 

874
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:00,700
elaboration on the same theme because it
says,

875
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:03,120
well,
the hero isn't only the.

876
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,650
The Daddy,
the transcendent pattern,

877
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,020
let's say that goes out into the 
unknown,

878
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:13,110
cuts it into pieces and makes the world 
that's not good enough because it only 

879
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:14,680
deals with the terrible mother.

880
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,860
That's one way of thinking about it,
but there's a terrible father to.

881
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:22,861
Once culture gets instantiated in large 
scale and the Egyptians had that 

882
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:24,610
problem.
Two problems,

883
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,830
chaos.
Second problem,

884
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,240
pathological order.
Well,

885
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,990
structures tend towards pathological 
order.

886
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,390
The Egyptians laid out why that set 
right?

887
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:40,391
Seth is the evil advisor of the king 
who's lurking in the background all the 

888
00:50:40,391 --> 00:50:44,381
time,
trying to tear the structure down for 

889
00:50:44,381 --> 00:50:46,721
his own malevolent purposes.
So now and then that overcomes the 

890
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:51,521
structure and destroys the and what 
rigidified and makes malevolent the 

891
00:50:51,521 --> 00:50:54,120
entire social structure,
so a degenerate into safe,

892
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:56,690
fascist totalitarianism,
something like that,

893
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,710
and especially being a threat since 
we've had highly organized societies.

894
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:06,970
Then the hero ends up in the underworld 
and has to come back and do direct 

895
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:10,910
combat without malevolent force at the 
price of his own consciousness.

896
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,940
Right?
Because the horse gets one of his eyes 

897
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:15,940
destroyed.

898
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,070
It's no bloody joke to face the forces 
that make a culture rigid and 

899
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:23,711
malevolent.
So there's an addition to the hero 

900
00:51:23,711 --> 00:51:23,711
archetype.
Two things happen.

901
00:51:23,711 --> 00:51:25,670
One,
you go out and you conquer chaos and you

902
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:30,671
make order out of it,
but the second is you take pathological 

903
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,420
order,
recasted into chaos and then allow it to

904
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:36,080
reemerge and you do that.
Not In some arbitrary sense,

905
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:39,960
but in tandem with your rescued father.
And that's I guess in part what niche to

906
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:43,190
MC missed as far as I can tell is he 
didn't.

907
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,440
He knew that he knew of the death of 
God.

908
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,930
Perhaps he didn't know that it had 
happened.

909
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:51,770
Many Times Murcia Eylea documented that 
across many cultures,

910
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:56,771
but what you didn't seem to lay out,
at least in his vision of the superman 

911
00:51:56,771 --> 00:52:01,630
or the Overman,
was that it was a responsibility of the 

912
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:04,160
person who wants to reverify the culture
to go down and rescue the damn culture,

913
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:09,430
which is what you're supposed to be 
doing in university because your father 

914
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:10,310
is lying dead in the libraries.
Right?

915
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:15,610
So you're supposed to be going in there 
and taking that spirit out of the books 

916
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:19,400
and manifesting it in your own being.
That's what the universities were four,

917
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,220
although I don't think that's what 
they're for anymore.

918
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:30,580
So we talked about the Mesopotamian 
story and we talked about the Egyptian 

919
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:34,421
story and other people have documented 
the emergence of hero mythology in 

920
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,850
culture is far more diverse than the 
ones that I'm exposing you to.

921
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,820
That was done most popularly by Joseph 
Campbell,

922
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,630
but Campbell's like,
I don't think Campbell had a single idea

923
00:52:44,631 --> 00:52:47,390
that he didn't derive from young.
And I'm not saying that in a.

924
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,380
In a critical manner,
because Campbell was good at standing as

925
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:55,070
a mediator between young and in a more 
general population.

926
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:58,790
He did and that's,
that's a nontrivial accomplishment.

927
00:52:58,791 --> 00:52:59,810
Seriously,
but,

928
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,160
but,
but young is still the source of those 

929
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,280
ideas and if you're serious about them,
that's the person that you have to go to

930
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:12,490
for that kind of knowledge.
So now I wanted to tell you some other 

931
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,110
stories that are,
that are in some sense closer to western

932
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:15,470
culture.

933
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,380
They're the stories upon which Western 
culture is actually predicated.

934
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:20,300
So I'm going to tell you,
well,

935
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:25,301
I'm not only Western story today,
I'm going to tell you a couple of 

936
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:27,800
stories from genesis and I'm going to 
tell you about the story of the Buddha.

937
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:32,810
I'm going to do that at the same time 
because the story of the Buddha is 

938
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,730
almost a perfect parallel structurally 
speaking to the story of Adam and eve.

939
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And so I want to show you that.
And you can decide for yourself if I'm 

940
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,510
imposing a pattern on it because God 
only knows,

941
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,100
right?
Or whether or not.

942
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,340
Once you have the key to understanding 
the stories,

943
00:53:47,341 --> 00:53:49,300
which I hope I provided you with,
with the,

944
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:54,730
you know,
the idea of the dragon of chaos and the 

945
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:54,730
great mother in the great father in the 
individual,

946
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:59,631
it gives you a Schema that you can use 
to understand the characterizations of 

947
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:05,241
great stories and as far as I can tell,
it works pretty much universally across 

948
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:05,800
stories,
so,

949
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:07,530
so I want to read.

950
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:11,520
I want to walk you through those 
foundational stories and I would say one

951
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:13,980
of the things to know about the way the 
Bible is structured,

952
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:16,920
there's a couple of things you want to 
know about it is that it was authored by

953
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:21,921
multiple people across extraordinarily 
vast spans of time and then aggregated 

954
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:27,981
by other people and sorted into 
something that seemed to make sense and 

955
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:32,010
so you can really think about it as a 
Bible is a library.

956
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:33,780
It's a library of books.
It's not a book.

957
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,950
The library is organized a certain way.
That makes a kind of sense,

958
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,790
but it's not exactly as if anyone 
decided what that sense would be.

959
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:47,040
It's the collaborative work of hundreds 
and thousands of people across thousands

960
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:53,570
of years attempting to organize our 
collective story into something that 

961
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,800
something out of which the sense 
emerges.

962
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:00,780
It's like human beings acted and then 
they dram,

963
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:05,840
dreamed about how they acted,
and then they wrote down what they 

964
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,180
dreamed about,
how they acted,

965
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,560
and then they organized what they wrote 
about how they dreamed they acted,

966
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:15,860
and that's how that book came into being
and the information that's within it 

967
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,130
emerged from the behavioral level 
upward,

968
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:17,550
right?

969
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,980
Rather than being imposed top down.
Now there's a.

970
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,780
there's a feedback,
right?

971
00:55:21,781 --> 00:55:26,781
Because if you understand how you act 
and that changes how you act and so you 

972
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,520
can't.
You can't avoid the top down feedback,

973
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:34,521
but a tremendous amount of the 
information in there and this is why 

974
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:37,851
it's revelatory information.
We don't know it's in there because how 

975
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:41,010
we act as informative and then if you 
represent how we act,

976
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:45,030
that's informative,
but the information came from how we act

977
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,780
from the representation of how we act 
and then you might think,

978
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:51,180
well,
how did we learn how to act?

979
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:56,181
And the answer is,
we've been trying to figure out how to 

980
00:55:56,181 --> 00:55:59,151
do that for three point 5 billion years.
There's lots of information encoded in 

981
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:04,821
our actions and in our social 
interactions way more than we 

982
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:06,150
understand.
So we're acting something out.

983
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:11,180
We don't understand what it is,
but we're doing our best to pull that 

984
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:11,400
information upward,
partly by dreaming about it.

985
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:16,790
That's what you're doing at night.
You're trying to figure out what the 

986
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:16,790
hell you're up to.
Well,

987
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,780
you don't know because you don't know 
yourself in totality.

988
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:23,710
How could you possibly know?
Best you can do is dream yourself up and

989
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:26,980
then speak yourself into some sort of 
articulated existence.

990
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:31,600
It's just an approximation because you,
whatever you is,

991
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,310
whatever you are rapidly supersedes.
Whatever you think you are.

992
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,370
That's why people constantly shocked 
themselves.

993
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,400
You know,
if you were only what you thought of 

994
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,171
yourself or wouldn't life be simple.
You'd know exactly what you were doing 

995
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:47,320
all the time and you could even control 
your own behavior.

996
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:48,790
Well,
good luck with that.

997
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,030
You can't do that for yourself much less
for other people.

998
00:56:55,250 --> 00:57:00,250
So let's go through these stories.
So they're sequenced,

999
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:04,300
people are trying to make sense out of 
them.

1000
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,220
They're aggregating these stories from 
all sorts of different places,

1001
00:57:07,221 --> 00:57:12,221
all sorts of different tribes,
all sorts of different times and then 

1002
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:15,941
trying to make them coherent without 
losing the content and without doing 

1003
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:18,410
arbitrary editing.
And so part of the reason that the Bible

1004
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:21,920
is full of internal contradictions,
it's for the same reason that a dream is

1005
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:25,940
full of internal contradictions is if 
you impose too much coherence on it,

1006
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:31,390
you start losing the look.
Imagine you have an imagined that you 

1007
00:57:33,501 --> 00:57:38,501
have a impressionist painting,
well it's messy and,

1008
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,340
and,
and the,

1009
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,140
the image emerges and you might say,
well,

1010
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:47,141
we could replace that with a nice clean 
line drawing or even a sequence of stick

1011
00:57:47,691 --> 00:57:50,750
figures and get the basic point across.
It's like,

1012
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:51,350
well,
you would,

1013
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:53,930
but you'd lose the richness.
The,

1014
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:59,010
an articulable richness would be lost in
the premature attempt to bring logical 

1015
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:03,560
closure to the phenomena.
And so in fact,

1016
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:08,561
we know already that that's maybe the 
difference between dreams and waking 

1017
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:09,430
thought.
So waking thoughts,

1018
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:12,920
sacrifices,
completeness for coherence,

1019
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,640
right?
So whereas dream thought sacrifices 

1020
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,090
coherence for completeness,
and that's,

1021
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:25,110
that's,
that's not something I'm saying 

1022
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,561
arbitrarily.
This is something that has been thought 

1023
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:28,511
through by people who've been thinking 
this sort of thing through for a long 

1024
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:29,000
time.
Precise thought

1025
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:36,660
excludes too much.
An imprecise thought is not sufficiently

1026
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:41,971
coherent.
So we do both precise thought left 

1027
00:58:41,971 --> 00:58:42,670
hemisphere linguistically mediated,
sequential,

1028
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:43,300
logical,

1029
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:50,540
incoherent,
but complete thought imagistic emotion 

1030
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:50,540
based,
right hemisphere.

1031
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,870
The right hemisphere even has a more 
diffuse structure.

1032
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:54,540
It's like the right hemisphere is trying
to get a picture of everything.

1033
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:00,530
Now it's not going to be a very detailed
picture because it's a picture of 

1034
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:04,011
everything full of contradictions,
but at least it's a picture of 

1035
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:04,440
everything.
And the left says that's not good enough

1036
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:08,160
for precise action and it's not.
So we'll narrow that to precision,

1037
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,980
but we lose the richness.
But you need both.

1038
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,290
So there's an interplay.
Well,

1039
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:18,830
the documents that the Bible is composed
of our half dream and half articulated 

1040
00:59:20,701 --> 00:59:25,701
thought and they have the advantages of 
articulated thought and the advantages 

1041
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:27,710
of the dream,
but also the disadvantages of both.

1042
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:33,260
So to the degree that it's articulated,
it's in a dogmatic box to the degree 

1043
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,000
that it's a dream,
it's still incoherent,

1044
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:40,510
but it's the problem is you have to.
You have to move through the entire 

1045
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,080
world even though you don't know it in 
detail.

1046
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,260
So you need detailed knowledge were 
detailed,

1047
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:50,261
knowledge is necessary and you need 
vague but complete knowledge where 

1048
00:59:50,261 --> 00:59:50,261
that's necessary.
It's an.

1049
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:55,300
It's a very uncomfortable balance,
but we have to face everything even 

1050
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,260
though we don't understand anything 
completely.

1051
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,200
Now,
genesis,

1052
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:06,290
the first stories in genesis are,
what would you say on identifiably?

1053
01:00:10,261 --> 01:00:10,860
Ancient.

1054
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,220
God only knows how old they are.
The story of Noah.

1055
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,670
Here's an interesting thing.
I know this guy who's a.

1056
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,240
he's a Kwakwaka'wakw tribal member and 
an artist who lives on the tip of 

1057
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:31,121
northern Vancouver Island and the 
culture he comes from is about 14,000

1058
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,900
years old,
something like that,

1059
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:35,000
and maybe it's odd,
been unbroken for 14,000

1060
01:00:35,001 --> 01:00:36,740
years,
a very long period of time.

1061
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,170
And He.
He's not literate.

1062
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:42,150
This guy,
although he's very intelligent,

1063
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,090
has a great memory and is also a great 
artist.

1064
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:49,300
And He's told me some of the stories 
that have come down through the 

1065
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,961
Kwakwaka'wakw tradition,
and he was educated by his grandparents 

1066
01:00:52,961 --> 01:00:55,130
who were original language speakers.
And he's an original language speakers.

1067
01:00:55,131 --> 01:01:00,131
There are many people like that left.
I think there's only 3000 in his 

1068
01:01:00,131 --> 01:01:02,300
particular tribal group.
They have a story that's the flood story

1069
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:06,110
that this except it's canoes and it 
isn't a dove.

1070
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:08,930
It's a cro.
But the damn story is exactly the same.

1071
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:09,770
It's like,
well,

1072
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:11,330
what the hell is up with that?
In fact,

1073
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:12,680
at the end,
it's not a canoe.

1074
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:17,681
It's a bunch of canoes that are tied 
together and at the end the canoes all 

1075
01:01:17,681 --> 01:01:18,770
break apart.
And that's why there are people all over

1076
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:23,771
the world.
It's like the story of the Tower of 

1077
01:01:23,771 --> 01:01:26,410
Babel,
which I'm going to talk to you about 

1078
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:26,410
today.
So

1079
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:34,370
the reason I'm telling you that is 
because the stories at the beginning of 

1080
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:37,911
genesis are extraordinarily old now.
So maybe he tells the same story that we

1081
01:01:38,191 --> 01:01:40,140
tell,
you know,

1082
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:44,100
making the presumption that we are the 
people who are,

1083
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:46,170
who are part of this Judeo Christian 
tradition.

1084
01:01:46,171 --> 01:01:48,030
And I know that that's not the case for 
everyone

1085
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:55,130
either.
He's telling the same damn story and it 

1086
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:57,660
emerged from a central point so long ago
that it's 20,000

1087
01:01:57,661 --> 01:02:00,090
years or 30,000
years or maybe 50,000

1088
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,340
years since we moved out of Africa.
Something like that.

1089
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:07,490
And the story has survived,
which is certainly possible because 

1090
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:07,490
oral,
you think,

1091
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,830
can an oral tradition survive that long?
That's the wrong question.

1092
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,710
Oral traditions always survived that 
long.

1093
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,660
What's radical is that they disappear.
Were the radicals.

1094
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:24,080
The oral tradition is something that 
stays the same generation after 

1095
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:28,251
generation.
So how much innovation do you think 

1096
01:02:28,251 --> 01:02:28,320
there is in a small tribal group?
None.

1097
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:31,080
That's why they don't have advanced 
technologies.

1098
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,930
They stay the same.
The stories stay the same.

1099
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,560
So the idea that they can be transmitted
unchanged over thousands and tens of 

1100
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,880
thousands of years is really not a 
debatable proposition.

1101
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:46,881
It's the norm.
So either the stories emerged from a 

1102
01:02:46,881 --> 01:02:50,931
central source and have never been lost 
so that you can pick them up everywhere 

1103
01:02:50,931 --> 01:02:54,620
or there's something about the stories 
that automatically regenerates 

1104
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:54,620
themselves.

1105
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:57,390
And I suppose it's a little bit of 
column a and a little bit of column B.

1106
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,250
It's like my,
my nephew,

1107
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:03,420
when he perceived himself as a dragon 
slaying night,

1108
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:04,170
it's like,
well,

1109
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:09,770
was that the continuation of an oral 
tradition or was it something that he 

1110
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,460
spontaneously come up with?
And the answer is both.

1111
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,710
Both.
The pattern was there.

1112
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:18,711
He just had to see it and he saw it and 
synthesize it and pr and encapsulated it

1113
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:21,240
in his own imagination.
Well,

1114
01:03:21,241 --> 01:03:24,240
that's not much different than the oral 
tradition being unbroken.

1115
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,020
It's just a variant of the same thing.
I mean,

1116
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,390
if you lose a story,
but everyone acts it out,

1117
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,340
you can reconstruct the story.
Right?

1118
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:37,910
And if everyone doesn't act it out,
then the culture dies because there's 

1119
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,810
some things about the story that you 
have to act out if your culture is going

1120
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:40,470
to survive.

1121
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,630
That's the hypothesis.
And then that would be.

1122
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:46,440
Well that would be where you would 
search for ultimate values,

1123
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:51,830
the stories that enable you as an 
individual to flourish in such a manner 

1124
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:55,350
that your culture flourishes in a way to
enhance your flourishing.

1125
01:03:55,351 --> 01:04:00,351
Right?
That's the right way that you want to 

1126
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:01,821
organize things.
You know that's what you do inside a 

1127
01:04:01,821 --> 01:04:01,821
family.
If it's functioning well,

1128
01:04:01,821 --> 01:04:06,380
right?
The family function so that every 

1129
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:08,400
individual benefits from being in the 
family and that strengthens the family.

1130
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,220
That's what piaget called and 
equilibrated solution.

1131
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:16,550
Technically speaking,
when he was looking for the origin of 

1132
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:19,581
moral ideas,
he came up with the idea of a 

1133
01:04:19,581 --> 01:04:20,670
celebrated,
celebrated state,

1134
01:04:20,671 --> 01:04:23,480
and then it calibrated state is one.
The three of you are in iniquity,

1135
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:28,490
abraded state if you all want to be in 
that state and while you're in that 

1136
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:32,931
state,
the things that you're doing together 

1137
01:04:32,931 --> 01:04:33,540
work better and they facilitate each of 
your development,

1138
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:34,500
right?

1139
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,400
So it's the stacking of,
of,

1140
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:41,520
of an ethical.
Have a set of ethical propositions so 

1141
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,040
that the individual benefits at the same
time as the group and you can.

1142
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:46,110
You can increase that stacking.
We could say,

1143
01:04:46,111 --> 01:04:51,111
well,
it's not only that you want to organize 

1144
01:04:51,111 --> 01:04:53,811
yourself so that all three of you get 
what you want better than you would if 

1145
01:04:53,811 --> 01:04:54,630
you were alone and so that you're 
healthy.

1146
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,250
And so the stacking also occurs all the 
way down the physiological chain.

1147
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:04,550
You want to be manifesting yourself in 
the world so that you remain is 

1148
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:05,130
physiologically healthy as you possibly 
can,

1149
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:08,190
so your stress responses are properly 
balanced and all of that.

1150
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:13,550
And then maybe your equilla braided 
state as well enough developed so it 

1151
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:16,371
doesn't just include the three of you,
it extends outward beyond you into the 

1152
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,640
greater community and things stacked 
like that.

1153
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,840
And that's if they get,
if they all get stacked up,

1154
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:24,640
every level is stacked on top of each 
other properly.

1155
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:29,910
You have an equilibrated state and I 
don't think that that's any different 

1156
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:31,810
than a vision of paradise.
I think those are the same thing.

1157
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,450
So now the question is,
well,

1158
01:05:34,451 --> 01:05:38,530
can that happen?
That's a whole different story.

1159
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,400
I mean,
it happens in your own life at those 

1160
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:44,400
times where everything comes together 
for you.

1161
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,060
You know,
it's chaotic and then everything snaps 

1162
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:49,060
together and you think that's exactly 
right.

1163
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,060
And it's unstable.
You can't maintain it.

1164
01:05:51,061 --> 01:05:52,960
It fragments again,
but that's what you're.

1165
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,900
That's what you're working towards.
If you have any sense,

1166
01:05:55,901 --> 01:06:00,901
you're working towards that constantly.
And I think that's what music 

1167
01:06:00,901 --> 01:06:03,901
represents.
It's the stacking of harmonious 

1168
01:06:03,901 --> 01:06:03,901
patterns,
right,

1169
01:06:03,901 --> 01:06:04,700
that are playing themselves out in 
being.

1170
01:06:04,701 --> 01:06:06,850
And you watch how people respond to 
music.

1171
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:13,260
The Orchestra is led by the leader.
Every different individual plays his or 

1172
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:18,181
her part.
They're organized into string sections 

1173
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:18,181
and horn sections and so on.

1174
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:20,410
So you get individual subgroup,
group,

1175
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,150
orchestra,
leader.

1176
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,640
Then maybe you have people dancing.
Well,

1177
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:29,641
so what does that mean?
So maybe it's men and women dancing in 

1178
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:29,641
front of that,
like a Viennese waltz.

1179
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:31,930
So it's the harmonious stacking of 
pattern.

1180
01:06:31,931 --> 01:06:36,931
Being in the background led by someone 
who is making sure that the time is in 

1181
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:39,640
order and men and women arranging 
themselves according to the patterns.

1182
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:44,641
Right?
And everyone has a wonderful time when 

1183
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:46,621
that's happening and it's acting out,
acting out the proposition that all of 

1184
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:51,631
these levels of being can be stacked up 
harmoniously at the same time and 

1185
01:06:51,631 --> 01:06:52,990
everybody has a tremendously fun time 
while they're doing it.

1186
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,860
Maybe that's how you find a mate at a 
dance and for exactly the same reason,

1187
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:02,010
it's an optimal place to do that.
You see if there's someone that you can 

1188
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,260
be with with whom you can mutually act 
out the patterns of being well,

1189
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:06,880
we're all acting that out at a dance.

1190
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,070
We don't know what we're doing.
We're having a good time.

1191
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:10,030
Well,
yeah,

1192
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:13,840
that's a little glimpse of paradise.
That's what that good time is.

1193
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:17,380
Now,
the Bible stories before what happened,

1194
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:22,381
what seems to happen is that you can see
there's two cataclysmic events at the 

1195
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:26,650
first part of that.
At the end of the first part of Genesis,

1196
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:31,210
there's the flood,
so the prehistoric world is wiped out by

1197
01:07:31,211 --> 01:07:36,211
the flood,
and so the idea there in some sense 

1198
01:07:36,211 --> 01:07:39,570
there's a bunch of ideas,
but one of them is there's a place in 

1199
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,220
history past which we cannot look and 
that's absolutely true.

1200
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:47,250
One of the things that's very strange 
about human beings is that are written 

1201
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:51,841
civilizations.
The ones we have records of all seem to 

1202
01:07:51,841 --> 01:07:51,940
have popped up somewhere in the 
neighborhood of five to 6,000

1203
01:07:51,941 --> 01:07:53,740
years ago.
It doesn't matter where you look.

1204
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,330
Right?
Central America,

1205
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,710
China,
India,

1206
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:58,930
Greece,
Egypt,

1207
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:00,460
well it's all the same.

1208
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,920
Six thousand years ago,
post.

1209
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,820
There we were.
Well,

1210
01:08:03,821 --> 01:08:05,410
what happened before that?
Well,

1211
01:08:05,411 --> 01:08:10,411
the answer is we don't know.
Everything is obscured by the chaos of 

1212
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:12,850
history before that point and all that 
emerged out of it,

1213
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:16,130
so to speak,
are these incredibly ancient stories and

1214
01:08:16,131 --> 01:08:18,800
so we're going to walk through the 
ancient stories and see what we can pull

1215
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:20,930
out of them.
We've already done that with several,

1216
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:24,200
so there are some representations of the
garden of Eden.

1217
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:29,230
So this is by Hieronymus Bosch.
I don't know if you know who hieronymus 

1218
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:33,821
Bosch is,
but he's definitely worth looking up 

1219
01:08:33,821 --> 01:08:33,821
because he was one strange character.
He was like,

1220
01:08:33,821 --> 01:08:36,770
I think he painted in the 15th century,
if I remember correctly.

1221
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:40,010
He was like this 15th century version of
Salvador Dali.

1222
01:08:40,011 --> 01:08:45,011
His paintings are so uncanny that that 
they're still shocking to the mortar 

1223
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:50,291
nih,
which is really something because it's 

1224
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:50,291
not easy to shock a modern person with a
visual image,

1225
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,680
but Hieronymus Bosch will definitely do 
that.

1226
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,980
And that's his representation of 
paradise.

1227
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:59,981
There's some central structure in the 
middle that's partly phallic and partly 

1228
01:08:59,981 --> 01:09:03,430
chambered so.
And there's Adam and Eve united,

1229
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,210
united by God.
So.

1230
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:10,211
And there's one by Peter Paul Rubens and
it sorted the primordial lush landscape 

1231
01:09:10,211 --> 01:09:13,430
that you might think about as the what?
The ancestral human home.

1232
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:15,020
It's something like that.

1233
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,910
A treat landscape.
Well,

1234
01:09:18,911 --> 01:09:20,590
why trees?
While we liked fruit,

1235
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,470
we lived in trees.
Why not trees?

1236
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:28,471
I mean even modern people have a very 
powerful tendency to think about trees 

1237
01:09:28,471 --> 01:09:30,250
is sacred.
You wouldn't get environmentalists tying

1238
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:32,470
themselves to great,
you know,

1239
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,490
Douglas firs and protecting them if 
there wasn't some deep felt sense within

1240
01:09:36,491 --> 01:09:38,860
us that they're sacred.
Whatever that means.

1241
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,680
Well,
trees are our home.

1242
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:46,800
Well,
that's as close to sacred as you're 

1243
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:46,800
going to get.
So

1244
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,320
okay,
so I'm going to read you something from 

1245
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,320
the book of Job and this is God 
harassing job.

1246
01:09:54,451 --> 01:09:56,070
So I don't know if you know the story of
Joe,

1247
01:09:56,071 --> 01:10:01,071
but it's very interesting story.
And basically what happens with job is 

1248
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:04,161
that God and the devil have a bat,
which seems a little unreasonable side

1249
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:09,440
for God,
but he gets to do whatever he wants.

1250
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:14,000
So he has a bet with Satan roughly 
speaking and says,

1251
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,670
says,
well job.

1252
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:21,790
He tells Satan that job is a good guy.
And that he's faithful to God and Satan 

1253
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:21,790
says,
yeah,

1254
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:25,490
let me let me out and for awhile I bet 
you we can do something about that.

1255
01:10:25,491 --> 01:10:27,050
And God says,
roughly speaking,

1256
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:29,540
no are you could torture her all you 
want.

1257
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:32,540
He's going to stay faithful.
And Satan says,

1258
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:34,100
well,
we'll have a baton out and soul,

1259
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,890
God hands them over and what happens to 
job?

1260
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,040
It's like everything terrible that you 
could imagine then happens to job,

1261
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,780
right?
His,

1262
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,430
his,
all,

1263
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:47,630
his family dies.
All his possessions are destroyed.

1264
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:53,290
He gets a horrible skin disease.
And so then he's sitting there by the 

1265
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,411
fire sort of scraping himself with bits 
of broken pots and all his friends come 

1266
01:10:56,411 --> 01:11:00,671
around and tell them that the reason all
this happened to him was because he 

1267
01:11:00,671 --> 01:11:01,220
deserved it.
So it's perfect,

1268
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:01,660
right?
It's,

1269
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:06,780
it's like an ultimate suffering story.
It's a precursor to the idea of the 

1270
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:07,670
crucifix.
That's one way of thinking about it.

1271
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:12,940
So.
And Joel has a chat with God and asks 

1272
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,340
him like Cain did roughly

1273
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,740
what's going on,
and God attempts to.

1274
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,920
He's irritated that job would even dare 
to question him.

1275
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:22,530
It's like he's God.
It's gets to do whatever he wants.

1276
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,420
It's a very strange book.
Anyways,

1277
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:28,020
this is one of the things that God says 
to job well,

1278
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:31,380
God is trying to justify himself.
I would say to job,

1279
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,440
and the reason I'm telling you this,
you see is because so imagine that 

1280
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:39,450
you're trying to analyze a literary 
work.

1281
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,170
You might say,
well,

1282
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,910
where's the meaning in the literary 
work?

1283
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:45,330
And the answer is in the words

1284
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,080
word by word.
It's in the phrases,

1285
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:54,650
it's in the sentences,
it's in the relationship of the 

1286
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:57,531
sentences to each other.
It's in the relationship of the 

1287
01:11:57,531 --> 01:12:00,501
sentences within paragraphs.
It's in the relationship of the 

1288
01:12:00,501 --> 01:12:03,111
paragraphs within the contexts of the 
chapters and it's in the relationship 

1289
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:07,050
between the chapters and the whole book 
and then the book in the whole culture.

1290
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,560
So you can't.
It's not easy to localize the meaning.

1291
01:12:10,561 --> 01:12:12,680
It exists at all those levels,
symbol [inaudible],

1292
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:15,600
and they all inform one another and what
that means,

1293
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:17,400
and it's even worse than a book like the
Bible.

1294
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,070
I want to show you a picture.
This is an amazing picture.

1295
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:27,500
So let me tell you what this is.
So the Bible is the world's first 

1296
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,250
hyperlinked document.
That's a good way of thinking about it.

1297
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:32,580
So what you have here.
So what you see at the bottom,

1298
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,040
there's a line along the bottom and then
there's small lines coming down from it.

1299
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:39,990
Okay?
Each of those,

1300
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,100
the line has dots on it.
Each job is a is a verse,

1301
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:50,230
okay?
And then there's a line associated with 

1302
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:51,350
the verse that's a varying length and 
the length corresponds to how many times

1303
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:54,950
that verse is cross referenced somewhere
else in the document.

1304
01:12:55,790 --> 01:13:00,140
And then these rainbow colored lines are
the cross references.

1305
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,680
So now that's really worth thinking 
about.

1306
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:05,720
So then you think,
well that book is deep.

1307
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,120
Well why is it deep?
Well,

1308
01:13:08,121 --> 01:13:13,121
let's.
Because every single thing in it refers 

1309
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:13,121
to every other thing.
It's connected.

1310
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:14,480
Like your brain is connected,
like it's not a linear document.

1311
01:13:14,481 --> 01:13:17,030
And the thing is a book is a very 
strange thing,

1312
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:19,370
right?
Because when you or or even a story,

1313
01:13:19,371 --> 01:13:22,280
because when you lay out the story in 
some sense,

1314
01:13:22,281 --> 01:13:23,210
you're like,
God,

1315
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,360
you're outside of the space and time of 
the story and so you can adjust the end 

1316
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:33,071
to make the beginning different.
You know how if you watch a movie and 

1317
01:13:33,071 --> 01:13:33,620
then it's got a surprise ending,
it changes the beginning.

1318
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,480
You thought the beginning was one thing,
but it isn't.

1319
01:13:35,481 --> 01:13:36,890
It's something else.
Well,

1320
01:13:36,891 --> 01:13:41,891
when you lay out a story,
you can fiddle with the story anywhere 

1321
01:13:41,891 --> 01:13:44,981
in the story and so and you can also 
make something that happens before 

1322
01:13:45,381 --> 01:13:47,630
dependent on something that happens 
after,

1323
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:52,780
which is very strange and that's what's 
happened with the Bible because people 

1324
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:52,780
have worked on it,
worked on it,

1325
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,480
worked on it,
worked on it,

1326
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:57,140
trying to synthesize it and make it 
coherent and make it make sense.

1327
01:13:57,290 --> 01:14:02,290
And so they're continually connecting 
everything that's inside of it to 

1328
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:05,561
everything else.
And so you end up with a document map 

1329
01:14:05,561 --> 01:14:06,080
that looks like that.
So now,

1330
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:08,900
so you think about that.
Everything is connected to everything in

1331
01:14:08,901 --> 01:14:11,740
that document.
Not chaotically meaningfully.

1332
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:14,170
Just like your brain is connected in a 
meaningful way,

1333
01:14:14,171 --> 01:14:19,171
it's not everything is connected,
everything is connected in a meaningful 

1334
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:19,171
way,
and then you think,

1335
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:20,630
well,
where?

1336
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,200
What do the stories mean?
And then the answer is,

1337
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:28,260
well,
that's a hard question because all of 

1338
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,391
them are connected with each other,
and then there's all these different 

1339
01:14:30,391 --> 01:14:33,331
levels of analysis and so you can pull 
out meanings at one level of analysis 

1340
01:14:33,331 --> 01:14:35,140
that aren't self evident at another 
level of analysis.

1341
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,860
Just like if you're listening to a 
complex piece of symphonic music,

1342
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:42,100
you can follow a baseline or you can 
follow the strings or you can follow the

1343
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:45,310
horns and they're all harmoniously 
interrelated,

1344
01:14:45,311 --> 01:14:46,990
but they're also separable.

1345
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:52,290
Okay,
so there is an image that lurks in the 

1346
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:53,140
Old Testament and the images,
the same image.

1347
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:58,240
It's roughly the same image as the image
of Marduk confronting tie a mat.

1348
01:14:58,241 --> 01:14:59,410
So for example,
at the,

1349
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,840
at the beginning,
God makes.

1350
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,360
Here's,
here's how the beginning goes.

1351
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:10,030
In the beginning,
God created the heaven and the earth and

1352
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:15,031
the earth was without form and void and 
darkness was upon the face of the deep 

1353
01:15:15,031 --> 01:15:17,050
and the spirit of God moved upon the 
face of the waters and God said,

1354
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:19,120
let there be light and there was light.
Okay,

1355
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:21,340
so we got to look at the first few lines
here.

1356
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,730
So this is God justifying himself to 
job.

1357
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:29,940
He says,
can you pull in Leviathan with a fish 

1358
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,931
hook or tie down its tongue with a rope?
Can you put a cord through its nose or 

1359
01:15:32,931 --> 01:15:35,980
Pearson jaw with a hook?
Will it keep you begging for mercy?

1360
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:41,010
Will it speak to you with gentle words?
Will it make an agreement with you for 

1361
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:45,031
you to take it as your slave for life?
Can you make a pet of it like a bird or 

1362
01:15:45,431 --> 01:15:48,610
put it on a leash?
For the young women in your house,

1363
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:53,850
will traders barter for it?
Will they divided up among the 

1364
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:57,001
merchants?
Can you fill it's hide with harpoons or 

1365
01:15:57,001 --> 01:15:57,001
its head with fishing spirits?

1366
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:01,550
If you lay a hand on it,
you will remember the struggle and never

1367
01:16:01,551 --> 01:16:06,150
do it again.
Any hope of subduing,

1368
01:16:06,151 --> 01:16:09,740
it is false.
The mere sight of it is over powering.

1369
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,430
No one is fierce enough to rouse it.
Who is then able to stand against me?

1370
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,400
Who has a claim against me that I must 
pay?

1371
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:21,590
Everything under heaven belongs to me.

1372
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:25,550
Oh,

1373
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,730
more computer trouble.
Now.

1374
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:28,240
There we go.

1375
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:34,690
I will not fail to speak of Leviathan's 
limbs.

1376
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:38,440
It strengthen it's graceful form who can
strip off its outer coat,

1377
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:43,650
who can penetrate it's double coat of 
armor who dares opened the doors of its 

1378
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:45,670
mouth,
ringing about with fearsome teeth.

1379
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:51,150
It's back.
Has rows of shields tightly sealed 

1380
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,630
together.
Each is so close to the next that no air

1381
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:55,720
can pass between.
They are joined fast to one another.

1382
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:57,940
They claimed together and cannot be 
parted.

1383
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,700
It.
Snorting throws out flashes of light.

1384
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,110
It's eyes are like the rays of dawn's 
flame stream from its mouth,

1385
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:10,290
sparks of fire shoot out.
Smoke pours from its nostrils from a 

1386
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:10,290
boiling

1387
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:13,910
pot overboard burning reads.
It's breadth sets,

1388
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:16,850
coles ablaze,
and flames dart from its mouth.

1389
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:21,110
Strength resides in its neck,
dismay goes before it.

1390
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,990
The folds of its flesh are tightly 
joined.

1391
01:17:23,991 --> 01:17:27,140
They are firm and immovable.
It's chest is as hard as rock.

1392
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,930
Hard is a lower millstone.
When it rises up,

1393
01:17:29,931 --> 01:17:33,320
the mighty are terrified.
They retreat before it's thrashing.

1394
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,400
The sword that reaches it has no effect,
nor does the spear or the dart or the 

1395
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:43,361
javelin earned.
It treats like Straw and bronze like a 

1396
01:17:43,361 --> 01:17:46,541
rotten wood arrows do not make it flee.
Sling stones are like chaff to it.

1397
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:50,390
A club seems to it,
but a piece of Straw.

1398
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:55,780
It laughs at the rattling of the Lance.
It's undersides or Jag had pot shirts 

1399
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,760
leaving a trail in the mud like a 
threshing sledge.

1400
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:03,650
It makes the depth churn like a boiling 
cauldron and stays up to see like a part

1401
01:18:03,651 --> 01:18:08,651
of ointment.
It leaves that glistening wake behind 

1402
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:09,260
it.
One would think the deep had white hair.

1403
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:12,680
Nothing on earth is it's equal,
a creature without fear.

1404
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:17,960
It looks down on all that or haughty and
is king overall that are proud.

1405
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,150
Well,
so what's God doing?

1406
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,650
He's describing what he defeated in 
order to create the world.

1407
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:28,490
That's Marta can tie matt.
Okay,

1408
01:18:28,491 --> 01:18:31,040
so that's one reference like that.
Alright,

1409
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:36,100
so now another reference like that.
This is from psalms 74.

1410
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:47,550
Yet God is my king of old working 
salvation in the midst of the earth.

1411
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:50,970
Thou did break the CND pieces by thy 
strength,

1412
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:56,180
Thou dits chatter.
The heads of the sea monsters in the 

1413
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,450
waters vow did crush the heads of 
Leviathan,

1414
01:18:57,570 --> 01:19:02,570
right?
That's the creature that we just heard 

1415
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:04,191
described.
Thou gave us to him to be food to the 

1416
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:07,170
folk inhabiting the Wilderness.
Now you remember,

1417
01:19:07,171 --> 01:19:12,171
so when Marta defeats Tye,
Maddie cuts her into pieces and makes 

1418
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:12,630
the world out of her pieces.
In here.

1419
01:19:12,631 --> 01:19:15,810
What's happening is that the force that 
that encounters,

1420
01:19:15,811 --> 01:19:19,140
the Leviathan is able to break it into 
pieces and feed everyone with it.

1421
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:24,740
Now,
the reason I'm telling you that in 

1422
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:25,050
relationship to this is because and the 
earth was what?

1423
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:28,410
Without form and void and darkness was 
upon the face of the deep.

1424
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:33,710
Let me tell you a little bit about that.
Those lines before God's God begins to 

1425
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:45,531
create the world is Tohu wa Bohu.
That's from the Hebrew.

1426
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:49,530
The word Tohu by itself means emptiness 
or futility,

1427
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:54,980
so there's a psychological element to 
that hay and that emptiness or futility 

1428
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:59,091
in some senses.
What you confront when you're trying to 

1429
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:01,311
extract your life from the world.
It is used to describe the desert 

1430
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:01,830
wilderness as well.

1431
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:05,270
Whoa,
Whoa,

1432
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:06,090
Whoa,
whoa.

1433
01:20:06,091 --> 01:20:08,220
Who?
Chaos is the condition

1434
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,770
that Barra ordering remedies.
Okay,

1435
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:15,690
so there's the idea in the first verses 
that this initial chaos is being ordered

1436
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:17,730
and the order is what makes the world so
the.

1437
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,300
It's,
it's,

1438
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:22,800
it's standard cosmology order emerges 
out of chaos,

1439
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:25,380
and the thing that makes it emerges.
The word of God.

1440
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,930
Now darkness and deep,
which is home in Hebrew,

1441
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:34,440
are two of the three elements of the 
chaos represented in Intoa,

1442
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:37,170
Tohu wa Bohu.
The third is the form of this earth.

1443
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:42,530
In the Enuma elish.
The deep is personified as the God 

1444
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:45,180
goddess time at the enemy of Martech.
Here it is the formless body of primeval

1445
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:47,640
water surrounding the habitable world.
Okay?

1446
01:20:47,641 --> 01:20:52,641
So,
but we know tailem and out are the same 

1447
01:20:52,641 --> 01:20:55,700
word,
or at least tatum was derived from 

1448
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,251
timeout.
So the idea that's presented at the 

1449
01:20:58,251 --> 01:21:00,861
beginning of genesis is the same.
It's an abstracted and psychologized 

1450
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:04,260
representation of the story that the 
Mesopotamians put forward.

1451
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,900
So Yahuah is Marduk,
roughly speaking,

1452
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:11,370
going out and conquering the dragon of 
chaos and making order out of it.

1453
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,690
And then there are these illusions later
say in job,

1454
01:21:13,691 --> 01:21:16,140
been in the psalms of him doing exactly 
that,

1455
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,800
conquering a primordial monster and 
making the world out of its pieces.

1456
01:21:19,801 --> 01:21:22,020
While so what does that mean exactly?
Well,

1457
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:28,070
it means that the highest ordering 
principle is the spirit that goes out 

1458
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:32,781
into the darkness or the deep that 
encounters the dragon of chaos because 

1459
01:21:32,781 --> 01:21:37,521
of obviously Leviathan is a dragon and 
defeats it and feeds the people as a 

1460
01:21:37,521 --> 01:21:42,051
consequence,
while we are hunting creatures after 

1461
01:21:42,051 --> 01:21:44,901
all,
and in order to establish our place in 

1462
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:47,031
the world,
we had to go out there and conquer the 

1463
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:47,031
dragons of the wilderness.
You might wonder,

1464
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:49,770
why does a dragon breathe fire?
Well,

1465
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:51,870
there's a bunch of reasons as far as I 
can tell,

1466
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:57,830
fire is all inspiring,
so fire and a terrible Predator or the 

1467
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,430
same thing because they both inspire.

1468
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:02,980
All fire is transforming,
but predit like,

1469
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:06,720
what's a good metaphor for being bitten 
by a poisonous snake?

1470
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:12,020
Well,
have you ever seen the wounds that a 

1471
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:12,020
poisonous stake produces?
If you're bitten by them,

1472
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,770
it's like someone took your arm and 
incinerated it,

1473
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:16,980
and so the idea that a snake has fiery 
breath is,

1474
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:22,220
well,
let's call it close enough from a 

1475
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:22,220
metaphorical perspective.
Right now,

1476
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:24,930
God is claiming to job that he's the 
spirit.

1477
01:22:24,931 --> 01:22:29,931
That clique that clears the wilderness 
and then builds order out of chaos and 

1478
01:22:29,931 --> 01:22:31,050
because.
Because,

1479
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,140
because he's the embodiment of that 
spirit,

1480
01:22:34,141 --> 01:22:39,141
in some sense,
job has no reason to ever question his 

1481
01:22:39,141 --> 01:22:40,800
moral decisions.
It's something like that in the story of

1482
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:45,801
job,
but the point that that point we'll 

1483
01:22:45,801 --> 01:22:45,960
leave aside because it's a more 
complicated issue.

1484
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:51,620
The point is that the writers of the 
Bible are trying to dream up a 

1485
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:55,560
representation of the spirit of 
civilization.

1486
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,680
That's the right way to think about it.
You can think of Yahuah as the spirit of

1487
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:00,990
civilization and what is that?
Well,

1488
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,050
it's the thing that encounters the 
wilderness and makes habitable order,

1489
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:09,051
but then it's also the spirit of the 
order itself and that's I think why in 

1490
01:23:09,051 --> 01:23:12,541
Christianity there's a representation of
God the father because he's a 

1491
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:16,111
representation of the culture that's 
generated after the chaos has ordered,

1492
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:21,360
right?
You have the spirit that goes out into 

1493
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,191
chaos and slash orders and then you have
the spirit of the order and then the 

1494
01:23:23,191 --> 01:23:27,001
spirit of the order and the spirit of 
the ordering principle have to figure 

1495
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:30,451
out how to coexist.
That's partly what the Egyptians were 

1496
01:23:30,451 --> 01:23:30,451
trying to figure out,
right?

1497
01:23:30,451 --> 01:23:34,090
There's a dynamic relationship between 
the culture and the spirit that 

1498
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:35,890
generates the culture and then you might
also ask,

1499
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:41,100
should the culture be superordinate or 
should despirit that generates the 

1500
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:45,481
culture be super superordinate,
and the answer seems to be the emergent 

1501
01:23:45,481 --> 01:23:49,441
answer seems to be that the spirit that 
generates the culture should be super 

1502
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,230
superordinate to the spirit of the 
culture.

1503
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:55,470
It's something like that and that's also
why I think that one of the brilliant 

1504
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:56,830
discoveries,
let's say,

1505
01:23:57,190 --> 01:24:02,190
of Western individualistic civilization 
is that the group is there to serve the 

1506
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:06,130
individual because the individual is the
thing that revivified the group,

1507
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:11,050
so each depend on the other integrally,
but if you subordinate the individual to

1508
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:13,960
the group,
then the group stagnates and dies and so

1509
01:24:13,961 --> 01:24:18,961
that's a very bad longterm strategy.
Even though the group and belonging to 

1510
01:24:18,961 --> 01:24:22,771
the group is clearly necessary.
You need to uphold the values of the 

1511
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:26,281
group,
but the values of the group should be 

1512
01:24:26,281 --> 01:24:26,530
subordinated to producing the individual
who gives the group vision.

1513
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,280
And the Mesopotamians figured that out.
The Egyptians figured that out.

1514
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:35,281
We've figured it out.
We just don't know that we figured it 

1515
01:24:35,281 --> 01:24:36,100
out and it's not a mere arbitrary 
supposition.

1516
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:42,340
Alright,
so I should show you because this is 

1517
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,330
actually interesting.
I think perhaps

1518
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:52,930
good.

1519
01:24:57,110 --> 01:25:00,740
I want to show you what the cosmology,
what people considered,

1520
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:03,890
because the structure of the initial 
order,

1521
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,780
because it's kind of interesting and God
said,

1522
01:25:05,781 --> 01:25:10,781
let there be a firmament in the midst of
the waters and let it divide the waters 

1523
01:25:10,781 --> 01:25:14,141
from the waters and God made the 
firmament and divided the waters which 

1524
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:15,800
were under the firmament from the waters
which were above the firmament,

1525
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:20,801
and it was so God called the firmament 
heavens and the evening and the morning 

1526
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:20,801
were the second day.
Well,

1527
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:22,310
so what are they thinking about?
Well,

1528
01:25:22,311 --> 01:25:24,650
that's the sort of classical view of the
world.

1529
01:25:24,651 --> 01:25:28,860
It's something like that is that there's
a desk,

1530
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:32,930
it's the disc we inhabit and there's 
land that's the desk,

1531
01:25:32,931 --> 01:25:34,850
and under the desk there's water,
fresh water,

1532
01:25:34,851 --> 01:25:39,851
and then under that there's the ocean.
And then on top of that there's a dome 

1533
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:39,851
and that's the sky.

1534
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:40,940
That's the firmament,
that's heaven.

1535
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,240
And there's water above that.
Well obviously because it rains,

1536
01:25:44,241 --> 01:25:49,241
so there has to be water up there.
So that's the way the cosmos was 

1537
01:25:49,241 --> 01:25:49,340
conceptualized.
Just so you know.

1538
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:53,480
Now it's a phenomenal logical 
conceptualization because that's what it

1539
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:54,680
looks like,
right?

1540
01:25:54,681 --> 01:25:56,120
And you might say,
well that's wrong.

1541
01:25:56,121 --> 01:25:57,140
It's like,
well,

1542
01:25:57,141 --> 01:25:57,890
yes,
it's,

1543
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:04,190
it's wrong in a functional sort of way.
It's right from a phenomenological 

1544
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:04,910
perspective,
but it's wrong from a,

1545
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,760
from a scientific perspective,
was never designed to be a scientific 

1546
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:10,760
perspective,
so all right,

1547
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:15,491
so we won't bother with this part will.
We'll start here so god makes animals 

1548
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:20,540
and plants and all of that,
and then at the end of it,

1549
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:22,400
this is on which day,

1550
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:32,510
Sixth Day God said,
let us make man in our image after our 

1551
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:36,561
likeness and let them have dominion over
the fish of the sea and the fowl of the 

1552
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:36,720
air over the cattle and all of the 
earth,

1553
01:26:36,721 --> 01:26:39,630
and over every creeping thing that 
creepeth upon the earth.

1554
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:40,290
Okay,
well,

1555
01:26:40,291 --> 01:26:42,540
the relevant.
There's two relevant issues there.

1556
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:45,900
One is let us make man in our image 
after our likeness.

1557
01:26:45,901 --> 01:26:47,490
Well,
what exactly does that mean?

1558
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:52,790
While we've already,
we've already encountered that to some 

1559
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:56,631
degree,
we've already encountered what the 

1560
01:26:56,631 --> 01:26:57,630
nature of the spirit of God is in this 
story.

1561
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:03,980
The nature of the spirit of God that 
creates order out of chaos is the thing 

1562
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:07,611
that creates order out of chaos,
and so the statement here is that 

1563
01:27:07,611 --> 01:27:08,940
there's something about human beings

1564
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,370
that partakes in that.
Now,

1565
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:15,710
when I started unpacking this,
I thought,

1566
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:16,450
okay,
look,

1567
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:19,040
there's an idea that's at the root of 
our legal system,

1568
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:24,500
and so our legal system is the 
articulation of the patterns by which we

1569
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:26,510
live,
and to a fair degree,

1570
01:27:26,511 --> 01:27:27,830
it's,
it's an evolved system.

1571
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:32,831
It's a culturally constructed system,
but it's an evolved system as well and 

1572
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:36,011
it's predicated on the idea that there's
something about the individual that the 

1573
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:36,560
law has to respect.
Well,

1574
01:27:36,561 --> 01:27:37,850
so the question is,
well,

1575
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:42,350
is that just an arbitrary supposition?
Because that's really the question.

1576
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:47,590
It's the same question as,
is Western civilization founded on 

1577
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:50,000
something that's a rock or is it just 
founded on something that's an opinion?

1578
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:55,300
Well,
it's the same question with regards to 

1579
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,921
the law.
The law assumes that there's something 

1580
01:27:56,921 --> 01:27:57,530
about you that sovereignty,
even if you're a murderer,

1581
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:03,190
you have unalienable rights now you 
think that is a bloody weird thing for 

1582
01:28:03,190 --> 01:28:07,391
any sort of system to have come up with 
because the idea that if you're the 

1583
01:28:07,391 --> 01:28:11,951
ultimate in malevolent transgressors 
that you still have some sort of 

1584
01:28:12,411 --> 01:28:13,520
sovereign value.

1585
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,520
It's like that is such an unlikely thing
for people to think up that you really 

1586
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,240
have to think a long time about how that
might've come to be.

1587
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:21,860
Well,
there's an idea here.

1588
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:25,280
That's the idea is that there's 
something about human beings,

1589
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:27,100
men and women,
you know,

1590
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:30,470
because people often complain about the 
patriarchal structure of the Bible.

1591
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:35,471
It's based on a misapprehension of 
anthropology that was popularized by 

1592
01:28:35,471 --> 01:28:37,530
someone named Gimbutas at Ucla,
which is for,

1593
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:42,600
for for her perspective.
There's not a shred of historical 

1594
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,031
evidence,
although there's some psychological 

1595
01:28:46,031 --> 01:28:46,031
truth in it,
in,

1596
01:28:46,031 --> 01:28:49,120
in Genesis,
both men and women are created in the 

1597
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:49,760
image of God and that's quite a 
remarkable thing.

1598
01:28:49,761 --> 01:28:54,761
I think it's a rich,
a remarkable part of the document 

1599
01:28:54,761 --> 01:28:54,860
because it's not what you'd expect from 
a patriarchal,

1600
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:55,880
you know,
from a,

1601
01:28:56,120 --> 01:29:01,120
from a document that was designed to do 
nothing but extend the domain of the 

1602
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:01,120
patriarchy.

1603
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,290
It's like you left with the damn cattle 
that would've made things a lot easier 

1604
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:08,990
and that isn't what happened,
so both men and women have this image 

1605
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:12,800
and what's the image?
That's the image of the thing that can 

1606
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,321
order chaos and so it's necessary to 
treat you as if you have intrinsic value

1607
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:22,310
because the fact that you can partake in
the process of mediating between order 

1608
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:25,260
and chaos means that you're basically 
the salvation of society.

1609
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:30,510
That's what it means and so society 
can't impose on you to to greater degree

1610
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:35,690
because you are too valuable for even 
the law to push arbitrarily past a 

1611
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:40,210
certain point.
Now then you have to think this,

1612
01:29:40,211 --> 01:29:41,760
and this is,
this is,

1613
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:44,430
this is where you really have to think 
about what you believe.

1614
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:49,970
Do you believe that or not?
Because there's not much difference 

1615
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:52,830
really technically speaking.
There's not much difference than that.

1616
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:55,830
Between that and believing these 
stories,

1617
01:29:55,831 --> 01:29:57,840
it depends bloody well what you mean by 
belief.

1618
01:29:57,841 --> 01:30:01,110
They're not scientific representations 
of an evolutionary process.

1619
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:02,950
Obviously the people who came up with 
them,

1620
01:30:02,951 --> 01:30:03,900
words,
scientists,

1621
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:05,820
so whatever they are,
they're not that,

1622
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:11,090
but they're making a proposition that's 
not an accidental proposition and we 

1623
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:13,410
know that partly because it's rooted so 
deeply in these ancient stories.

1624
01:30:13,411 --> 01:30:15,930
We have no idea how old the Mesopotamian
story is.

1625
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:18,390
You know,
it's the oldest story we have in written

1626
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:20,280
form,
so we know that,

1627
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:25,010
but God only knows how old it is.
It's part of an oral tradition and these

1628
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:26,220
oral traditions can be

1629
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:33,170
look the same.
Carver gave me a big thing called a CSO 

1630
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,840
Udl,
and it's a man in the middle of a double

1631
01:30:36,841 --> 01:30:38,730
headed sea serpent,
right?

1632
01:30:38,731 --> 01:30:40,380
So they're there.
That's 14,000

1633
01:30:40,381 --> 01:30:44,040
years old that came from Siberia.
It's the same bloody idea.

1634
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:47,700
It's the same idea.
So these ideas aren't arbitrary.

1635
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:49,470
So the question is,
well,

1636
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:52,470
are they true?
Well then the question is,

1637
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:57,210
what the hell do you mean by true?
Because the comes down to that.

1638
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:02,640
Is it true that habitable order is 
dependent on the spirit that moves into 

1639
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:07,171
the unknown and takes the Leviathan and 
chops it into pieces and distributes it 

1640
01:31:07,171 --> 01:31:08,770
and answer to that is yes,
that's true.

1641
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,670
As far as I can tell you mean is it 
literally true?

1642
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:16,120
While it's is true as things get.
That's how we got here.

1643
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:18,670
We got here because people went into the
unknown,

1644
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,200
they conquered what was out there.
They took what was of utility from that.

1645
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:25,810
They brought it back and they shared it 
with the community.

1646
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:30,900
That's why we're here.
That is the central story of humankind 

1647
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:30,900
and that's still what we do.
You know,

1648
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:36,150
we're not exactly necessarily going out 
to conquer an embodied monster,

1649
01:31:36,611 --> 01:31:38,590
although we do that.
If we hunt for example,

1650
01:31:38,591 --> 01:31:40,930
but you know,
most of us don't do that anymore,

1651
01:31:40,931 --> 01:31:43,210
but to the degree that you're an 
explorer in the,

1652
01:31:43,211 --> 01:31:48,211
in the intellectual realm,
you're still going out into the unknown 

1653
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,450
and conquering what's out there looming 
like maybe it's the cure for a disease 

1654
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:56,430
you're looking at right in the face.
You're trying to decompose it and break 

1655
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:59,851
it into its parts.
You're trying to understand it and then 

1656
01:31:59,851 --> 01:32:02,371
you're trying to tell everybody what you
found while and everybody pats you on 

1657
01:32:02,371 --> 01:32:02,371
the back.
It says,

1658
01:32:02,371 --> 01:32:02,371
well,
you're,

1659
01:32:02,371 --> 01:32:04,900
you're,
you're a brave explorer of the unknown.

1660
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:08,530
While that is exactly the sort of thing 
that we should be fostering,

1661
01:32:08,531 --> 01:32:12,220
and it's the thing that we all admire,
so okay,

1662
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:17,221
so that happens on the sixth day and so 
now we know human beings are made in 

1663
01:32:19,811 --> 01:32:20,800
God's image.
Well,

1664
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,030
what does that mean exactly?

1665
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:29,900
I think,
I think what it means a reasonable way 

1666
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:30,810
of thinking about it.
You can take about it like the genie.

1667
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:34,350
The genie has this tremendous amount of 
power that's constrained in a very small

1668
01:32:34,351 --> 01:32:38,220
space and genie and genius or the same 
word roughly speaking.

1669
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:43,520
So the genius is the.
Your genius is the genie that inhabits 

1670
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:43,520
you,
right?

1671
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:48,141
It's this logo spirit.
It's an gets put in a very small 

1672
01:32:48,141 --> 01:32:51,951
container.
You see that idea represented in the 

1673
01:32:51,951 --> 01:32:55,551
Christian conception of the relationship
between Christ and God because there's 

1674
01:32:55,551 --> 01:32:59,481
an idea that God had to empty himself 
out in order to fit into the body of 

1675
01:32:59,481 --> 01:33:00,180
Christ.
It's something like that.

1676
01:33:00,181 --> 01:33:05,181
They call that Kenosis,
that's a technical word and what it 

1677
01:33:05,181 --> 01:33:06,930
seems to be the idea that you're a 
lawyer.

1678
01:33:06,931 --> 01:33:11,931
It's like you're a low resolution 
representations of the ultimate spirit 

1679
01:33:11,931 --> 01:33:13,440
that encounters the unknown.
It's something like that.

1680
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:18,650
It's a very smart idea,
and you could say maybe that's what 

1681
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:21,411
human beings have in common is that that
that reached an embodiment of that 

1682
01:33:21,411 --> 01:33:22,140
spirit,
for lack of a better word.

1683
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:27,500
So okay,
so then God makes the god makes human 

1684
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:32,151
beings male and female,
makes them in his own image and is happy

1685
01:33:32,221 --> 01:33:33,210
about them and says,
well,

1686
01:33:33,211 --> 01:33:38,211
you're going to dominate the world,
which people like David Suzuki read that

1687
01:33:38,221 --> 01:33:42,210
to say you should go out and dominate 
the world because they read that kind of

1688
01:33:42,211 --> 01:33:47,211
patriarchal oppression into the text,
but this is more a description of how 

1689
01:33:47,211 --> 01:33:51,381
things are going to be.
Then whether or not they should be that 

1690
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:52,010
way.
So anyways,

1691
01:33:52,011 --> 01:33:53,780
that's the sixth day.
The seventh day

1692
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:56,980
God rests,
right?

1693
01:33:56,981 --> 01:33:59,530
So that's the origin of the week,
roughly speaking.

1694
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,380
So,
okay,

1695
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:07,680
that's one story.
There's two creation stories in genesis 

1696
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,060
and they actually don't match completely
in their structure.

1697
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,730
And what happened was someone they 
called the redactor,

1698
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:14,440
maybe it was a bunch of people we don't 
know,

1699
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:19,620
to a creation story,
one and creation story too from 

1700
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:22,471
different places and thought,
well these are sort of the same and 

1701
01:34:22,471 --> 01:34:25,531
they're sort of different and people are
going to be unhappy if we dispense with 

1702
01:34:25,531 --> 01:34:25,800
this one and they're going to be unhappy
if we dispense this,

1703
01:34:25,801 --> 01:34:27,910
this one,
but they don't make sense together.

1704
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:33,120
So let's see if we can put them in some 
kind of order that makes approximate 

1705
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:36,810
sense.
And they took the newer one and put it 

1706
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:36,810
second and took the.
Sorry,

1707
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:38,450
they took the older one and put it 
second and put,

1708
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:40,240
took the newer one and put it first.

1709
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,600
So Adam and eve is an older story than 
the story that I just told you.

1710
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,580
So.
But it's a different story.

1711
01:34:45,581 --> 01:34:50,581
It's written in a different style,
but it's been more or less brought into 

1712
01:34:50,581 --> 01:34:52,810
narrative coherence with the first 
story.

1713
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:58,170
So.
And you could say at the level of the 

1714
01:34:58,170 --> 01:34:58,170
sentence,
there is paradoxes,

1715
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:01,280
but at the level of the chapter,
let's say the stories make sense.

1716
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:06,600
So okay,
so what happens up there went from the 

1717
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:06,600
earth,
a mist,

1718
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:11,111
and it watered the whole face of the 
ground and the Lord God formed man of 

1719
01:35:11,111 --> 01:35:14,351
the dust of the ground and breathed into
his nostrils the breath of life and man 

1720
01:35:14,351 --> 01:35:16,560
became a living soul.
There's an identity in this archaic sort

1721
01:35:16,561 --> 01:35:19,820
of thought between breath and spirit,
right respiration,

1722
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,620
spirit,
inspiration,

1723
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:25,340
spirit,
pneuma like pneumatic tire spirit.

1724
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,770
The breath contains the spirit.
Well,

1725
01:35:27,771 --> 01:35:28,550
why is that?

1726
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:30,020
Well?
Because when people die,

1727
01:35:30,021 --> 01:35:35,021
the breath leaves their body,
and so it's an easy thing to identify 

1728
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:36,040
that with the animating spirit.
Right now,

1729
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:38,480
anima means spirit as well.
So,

1730
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:42,380
so that's the phenomenological reality 
of the story.

1731
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,790
And Lord God planted a garden eastward 
in Eden and there he put the man whom he

1732
01:35:46,791 --> 01:35:50,150
had formed.
Eden means well watered place.

1733
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:51,290
Well,
why?

1734
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,610
Well,
where do you want to live?

1735
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,990
These are desert people,
right?

1736
01:35:53,991 --> 01:35:54,830
Who are writing this?
Well,

1737
01:35:54,831 --> 01:35:56,550
what do they want?
They want an oasis.

1738
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,130
What's an.
What's an oasis?

1739
01:35:58,131 --> 01:36:03,131
It's a garden with water.
While you're gonna you're gonna live 

1740
01:36:03,131 --> 01:36:05,621
somewhere.
It's not going to be out in the middle 

1741
01:36:05,621 --> 01:36:06,791
of the damn desert.
You want to be in a garden that's 

1742
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:09,821
watered,
and then you could say you also be in a 

1743
01:36:09,821 --> 01:36:09,821
walled garden that's protected and 
that's what paradise means.

1744
01:36:09,821 --> 01:36:12,110
Paradise.
A means walled garden.

1745
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,930
So this initial paradise is a walled 
garden.

1746
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:18,320
Why?
Walled order culture,

1747
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:20,240
nature.
What does it mean?

1748
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:25,360
Well,
that's the natural environment of human 

1749
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:25,360
beings.
It's.

1750
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,230
It's the optimal balance between culture
and nature.

1751
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:32,260
That's what a walled garden is,
with enough water flowing in it to keep 

1752
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:35,591
it,
to keep it fertile and that water is 

1753
01:36:35,591 --> 01:36:35,591
also chaos,
right?

1754
01:36:35,591 --> 01:36:38,630
There has to be.
It can't be static and dry and solid and

1755
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:43,631
stale.
There has to be some living element to 

1756
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:43,631
it,
so.

1757
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:46,810
So it's a walled place that the water 
can still fruit,

1758
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,260
defy

1759
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:53,950
and out of the ground made the Lord God 
to grow every tree that is pleasant to 

1760
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:54,320
the sight.
So it's also full of trees.

1761
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:57,380
This is our natural habitat and good for
food.

1762
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:00,860
The tree of life also in the midst of 
the garden and the tree of the knowledge

1763
01:37:00,861 --> 01:37:02,900
of good and evil.
So these are two trees,

1764
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:05,330
they bring forth fruit that produced 
something.

1765
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:10,360
One produces the knowledge of good and 
evil and the other producers eternal 

1766
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:13,200
life.
So why?

1767
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:18,350
Well,
I'll get to that emit and a river went 

1768
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:20,331
out of Eden to water the garden and from
dance it was parted and became into 

1769
01:37:20,331 --> 01:37:22,070
foreheads.
We won't bother with that.

1770
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,460
So now God has having a little chat with
Adam and he says,

1771
01:37:25,461 --> 01:37:30,461
look,
you can eat every tree of the garden 

1772
01:37:30,461 --> 01:37:30,620
except one of the tree of the knowledge 
of good and evil.

1773
01:37:30,621 --> 01:37:33,650
You don't eat that because in the day 
you eat,

1774
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:36,860
you'll surely die.
So you might ask,

1775
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:39,590
well,
why is the tree put there to begin with?

1776
01:37:39,591 --> 01:37:42,530
And well the answer to that is who the 
hell knows?

1777
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,660
That's how the story portrays it and we 
don't know.

1778
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:53,200
And the Lord God said,
it is not good that the man should be 

1779
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,571
alone.
I will make a help meet for him and out 

1780
01:37:55,571 --> 01:37:55,571
of the ground,
the Lord God formed every beast,

1781
01:37:55,571 --> 01:37:56,070
the field and every fall

1782
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:01,070
of the year and brought them unto Adam 
to see what he would call them and 

1783
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:02,580
whatsoever Adam called every living 
creature that was the name thereof.

1784
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,730
So that's an echo of the idea of the 
power of the word.

1785
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:10,731
Right.
So even though these stories are from 

1786
01:38:10,731 --> 01:38:10,731
different traditions,
they're separate traditions.

1787
01:38:10,731 --> 01:38:14,310
You see at the beginning that God uses 
his word to bring order out of chaos.

1788
01:38:14,311 --> 01:38:19,311
And then he allows Adam in some sense to
do the same thing is that there's this 

1789
01:38:19,311 --> 01:38:23,960
unarticulated plethora of being and the 
man comes along and says that's that.

1790
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,560
That's that.
That's that.

1791
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:28,440
And that brings them into a higher order
form of being.

1792
01:38:28,441 --> 01:38:31,350
So it's a.
it's a replication of the creation in a,

1793
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:36,590
in a shrunken form.
And Adam gave names to all the cattle 

1794
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:39,870
cattle or just anything that has four 
legs roughly speaking and to the fowl of

1795
01:38:39,871 --> 01:38:41,550
the air and to every beast of the field.

1796
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:46,910
But for Adam,
there was not found to help meet for 

1797
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:49,041
him.
And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to 

1798
01:38:49,041 --> 01:38:52,161
fall upon Adam and he slept,
and he took one of his ribs and closed 

1799
01:38:52,161 --> 01:38:52,680
up the flesh instead thereof.
And the rib,

1800
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:54,900
which the Lord God had taken from 
manmade,

1801
01:38:54,901 --> 01:38:57,180
he a woman and brought her unto the man.
And Adam said,

1802
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:59,820
this is now bone of my bones and flesh 
of my flesh.

1803
01:38:59,821 --> 01:39:02,700
She shall be called woman because she 
was taken out of man.

1804
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:08,270
And then there's an injunction,
therefore a man shall leave his father 

1805
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:08,790
and his mother and shall cleave unto his
wife.

1806
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:11,080
And they shall be one flesh,
while there's also a,

1807
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:16,170
there's a moral injunction there.
And so the idea is that the two beings 

1808
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:19,230
that have been created are actually not 
whole until they're one thing.

1809
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:21,060
Right?
And once they're joined together,

1810
01:39:21,061 --> 01:39:26,061
that's supposed to be one thing.
And that one thing is actually a more 

1811
01:39:26,061 --> 01:39:28,230
perfect entity than the two things that 
are a part.

1812
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:34,040
So.
And that's actually part of the sacred 

1813
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,501
basis of the idea of,
of monogamous relationships in western 

1814
01:39:36,501 --> 01:39:38,070
culture.
And they were both naked,

1815
01:39:38,071 --> 01:39:39,870
the man and his wife and were not 
ashamed.

1816
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,460
A crucial piece of information.
So what exactly does that mean?

1817
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:52,750
Well,
the first question is what does it mean 

1818
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:52,750
to be naked?

1819
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:56,910
And so that's something that I thought 
about a lot in relationship and there's 

1820
01:39:56,910 --> 01:40:00,930
a relationship there with shame.
So the first question is what does it 

1821
01:40:02,051 --> 01:40:07,051
mean to be naked?
And the second question is what does it 

1822
01:40:07,051 --> 01:40:08,020
mean to be not ashamed of that?
While there's an.

1823
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:13,100
There is a,
I would say there an implication of a 

1824
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:15,700
kind of unconsciousness.
So Adam and Eve existed in this paradise

1825
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,270
state,
but they don't.

1826
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:23,340
They don't.
They don't have the capacity for self 

1827
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:23,340
reflection there no selfconsciousness 
here.

1828
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,910
Well,
why would I say that?

1829
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:28,180
Because there's very little difference 
between self consciousness and shame.

1830
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:33,360
In fact,
if you do psychometric analysis of the 

1831
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,660
state of self consciousness,
it loads with neuroticism,

1832
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:37,090
so loads with anxiety and emotional 
pain.

1833
01:40:37,091 --> 01:40:42,091
So to become self conscious,
what does it mean to become self 

1834
01:40:42,091 --> 01:40:42,640
conscious?
It becomes,

1835
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:47,790
it means you become aware.
One way of thinking about it as you 

1836
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:49,420
become aware of your vulnerability or 
another is that you become aware of your

1837
01:40:49,421 --> 01:40:51,010
insufficiency.
Okay,

1838
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:53,080
so let's say that you're standing up in 
front,

1839
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,220
a crowd talking

1840
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:57,460
and you become self conscious.
What happens?

1841
01:40:57,610 --> 01:40:59,230
Well first of all,
you can't talk anymore.

1842
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,980
The second is he kind of fall inside.
The third is you feel ashamed,

1843
01:41:02,981 --> 01:41:05,530
and the fourth is that you retreat and 
you look down,

1844
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:10,770
so it's a low status operation and it's 
associated with heightened anxiety and 

1845
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:12,280
so then you might say,
well,

1846
01:41:12,281 --> 01:41:15,070
why would you become self conscious 
before a crowd?

1847
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:17,830
Well,
the answer is they can see you,

1848
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:23,340
right,
and they can judge you and you can make 

1849
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,981
an error in front of them and you can 
make a fool of yourself so they put you 

1850
01:41:25,981 --> 01:41:25,981
down.
You can.

1851
01:41:25,981 --> 01:41:30,180
You can display yourself in a manner 
that ratchets you down the dominance 

1852
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:33,631
hierarchy.
That's to become self conscious and so 

1853
01:41:33,631 --> 01:41:35,740
well at least you have the advantage of 
being covered up in front of the crowd,

1854
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:38,650
but let's say all of a sudden you're 
stripped of your clothes.

1855
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,990
So what's the problem with that?
Well,

1856
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:46,320
all of your insufficiencies,
let's say are on painful display.

1857
01:41:46,631 --> 01:41:50,110
You can be evaluated by everyone,
but even more importantly than that,

1858
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:55,111
if possible,
is that close to actually protect the 

1859
01:41:55,111 --> 01:41:56,440
most vulnerable parts of you.
Human beings are upright animals,

1860
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:58,450
right?
We're very strange animals.

1861
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:01,690
You take a cat or a dog,
they're basically armored.

1862
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:05,050
The part of them that you see their back
is heavily armored,

1863
01:42:05,051 --> 01:42:07,780
heavily protected human being stretched 
upright,

1864
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:11,290
and so the softest part of parts of us 
are there for display,

1865
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,380
but also were displayed as sexual 
creatures too,

1866
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:20,010
and so to become,
to be naked and not ashamed of it is to 

1867
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:23,371
lack self consciousness.
So the idea is that the Adam and eve in 

1868
01:42:23,371 --> 01:42:24,880
the original state in the garden lacks 
self consciousness.

1869
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:33,030
Now the serpent was more subtle.
Subtle is an interesting word here 

1870
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:36,451
because it means kind of foglight and 
vague and difficult to detect.

1871
01:42:36,611 --> 01:42:39,010
So it's something that that lurks in is 
hidden.

1872
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:43,180
So that's what the serpent is.
It's in the domain of hidden things than

1873
01:42:43,181 --> 01:42:45,400
any beast of the field,
which the Lord God had made.

1874
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,790
And the serpent said unto the woman,
Hey,

1875
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:51,190
hasn't.
God said you shouldn't eat of every tree

1876
01:42:51,191 --> 01:42:52,750
of the garden.
And the woman said,

1877
01:42:52,751 --> 01:42:54,160
we may eat of the fruit,
of the trees,

1878
01:42:54,161 --> 01:42:55,990
of the garden,
but of the fruit of the tree,

1879
01:42:55,991 --> 01:42:58,480
which is in the middle of the garden,
the central fruit,

1880
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:00,940
God has said,
[inaudible] shall not eat of it.

1881
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,220
Neither shall you touch it,
lest you die.

1882
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:08,730
The serpent said unto the woman,
you shall not surely die for God knows 

1883
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:13,830
that in the day you eat thereof,
then your eyes will be opened and you 

1884
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:13,990
will be as gods knowing good and evil.

1885
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:17,710
All right?
So there's another implication there.

1886
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:22,950
We already saw that there's an impact.
There's the implication that Adam and 

1887
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:26,221
eve are not self conscious and now 
there's the implication that their eyes 

1888
01:43:26,221 --> 01:43:27,430
aren't open or at least that they're 
not.

1889
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,740
They're not open fully in some sense 
they're not open,

1890
01:43:29,741 --> 01:43:32,200
for example,
to the knowledge of good and evil.

1891
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:35,980
And that seems to be associated somehow 
with death in some strange way.

1892
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:37,030
Okay?
So,

1893
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,970
and it's the serpent talking to the 
woman.

1894
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:43,570
So the serpent is that is the 
temperature of the woman.

1895
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,570
So the question is,
why in the world would that be?

1896
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:51,900
I showed you those representations of 
Mary holding the infant up in air with 

1897
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:53,240
her foot on the snake,
and so you think,

1898
01:43:53,241 --> 01:43:55,130
well,
who's more self conscious,

1899
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:58,820
women or men,
and the answer to that is women are more

1900
01:43:58,821 --> 01:44:03,821
self conscious than meant and even 
further you might say that women taught 

1901
01:44:03,821 --> 01:44:05,300
men to be self conscious and I believe 
that to be the case.

1902
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:07,760
Maybe babies taught women to be self 
conscious,

1903
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,210
but women taught men to be self 
conscious and they still teach them that

1904
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:16,211
all the time because there's nothing 
that makes a man more self conscious 

1905
01:44:16,211 --> 01:44:17,600
that to be rejected by a woman that he 
desires.

1906
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:23,050
So the woman is always offering 
selfconsciousness demand and it isn't 

1907
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:26,540
necessarily a gift that they exactly 
appreciate and that Motif of course runs

1908
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:31,541
through the Adam and Eve story centrally
because eve is damned forever in some 

1909
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:33,620
sense for making them self conscious.
Well,

1910
01:44:33,621 --> 01:44:38,621
he didn't want to be self conscious.
Things were pretty good when his eyes 

1911
01:44:38,621 --> 01:44:41,471
were closed and new is wandering around.
Not worrying about whether he was naked 

1912
01:44:41,471 --> 01:44:41,471
or not.
Well,

1913
01:44:41,471 --> 01:44:43,190
the women became self conscious.
Why?

1914
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:45,620
Because of snakes.
Well,

1915
01:44:45,621 --> 01:44:48,770
maybe right.
Maybe that's exactly what happened,

1916
01:44:48,771 --> 01:44:52,190
you know,
she imagined we're being preyed upon for

1917
01:44:52,191 --> 01:44:54,440
millions of years by predatory reptiles.

1918
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:59,440
Right,
and we become more and more alert to 

1919
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,391
threat and more and more alert to threat
and then one day we get so alert to 

1920
01:45:01,391 --> 01:45:05,381
threat that we can see threat lurking in
the future and then all of a sudden we 

1921
01:45:05,381 --> 01:45:09,821
become aware of the future and then we 
become aware of death and then we're 

1922
01:45:09,821 --> 01:45:10,880
really self conscious,
but it's pretty good if you want to keep

1923
01:45:10,881 --> 01:45:15,881
the snakes down,
which we've been doing quite 

1924
01:45:15,881 --> 01:45:15,920
successfully ever since then,
but it's a big price to pay.

1925
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:21,250
We got so damn sensitive to threat that 
we were finally able to conceive the 

1926
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:23,120
ultimate threat,
not proximal threats,

1927
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:28,390
but the fact of threat itself.
The fact of mortality itself and the 

1928
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:32,231
fact of finitude itself and maybe women 
learned that because they become 

1929
01:45:32,231 --> 01:45:36,080
painfully aware of the mortal 
limitations of their infants first.

1930
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:39,430
Right?
This small thing could die,

1931
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:44,980
could end,
and it'll certainly as an object of 

1932
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:48,281
predation,
and you can imagine God only knows how 

1933
01:45:48,281 --> 01:45:48,920
many infants human beings last to 
predators.

1934
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:53,920
I mean,
I told you at one point I believe that 

1935
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,490
there was a cat that was found that that
had a,

1936
01:45:55,540 --> 01:46:00,540
that had a,
had a skull and jaws that were 

1937
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:03,230
specialized for biting the skulls of 
protocol.

1938
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:08,231
Humans one long tooth at the back that 
would drive right through the back of 

1939
01:46:08,231 --> 01:46:12,491
the skull so the cat could put its teeth
here and drive the tooth right into the 

1940
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:16,271
back of the skull so you know that's a 
good enough dragon for are for all 

1941
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:18,290
intents and purposes,
I would say.

1942
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:24,910
Anyways,
the snake comes along and opens the 

1943
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:26,861
woman's eyes.
When the woman saw that the tree was 

1944
01:46:26,861 --> 01:46:30,551
good for food and that it was pleasant 
to the eye and it treated to be desired 

1945
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:33,881
to make one wise,
she took of the fruit thereof and did 

1946
01:46:33,881 --> 01:46:36,761
eat and gave also unto her husband with 
her and he did eat and the eyes of both 

1947
01:46:36,761 --> 01:46:41,501
of them were opened and they knew that 
they were naked and they sewed fig 

1948
01:46:41,501 --> 01:46:41,501
leaves together and made themselves 
aprons.

1949
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,670
While there's a lot happening in those 
few lines,

1950
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,940
now there's a fruit thing going on 
there,

1951
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:48,620
snake and fruit.
Okay,

1952
01:46:48,621 --> 01:46:50,820
so we know from Lynn is bell 
hypothetically,

1953
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:55,821
that the reason that primates like us 
developed our intense vision is because 

1954
01:46:55,821 --> 01:46:57,630
we evolve with snakes.
The snakes opened her eyes.

1955
01:46:57,631 --> 01:47:01,760
What about fruit color vision,
right?

1956
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:06,800
Why to detect ripe fruit.
We know that and our women and ripe 

1957
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:07,630
fruit the same.
Well,

1958
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:11,790
they're the same in so far as it was 
women offering the ripe fruit and that's

1959
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:13,710
undoubtedly something that happened.
You know,

1960
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:18,180
the hypothetical idea is the males 
haunted bring home protein.

1961
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:20,670
The women gather.
What are they gathering?

1962
01:47:20,730 --> 01:47:25,730
Well,
they're gathering at at minimum ripe 

1963
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,060
fruit and then what are they doing?
They're sharing it.

1964
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:32,620
Well,
you also bring about a moral obligation 

1965
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:32,620
when you're sharing food,
right?

1966
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:34,530
There's an invitation to reciprocity 
there,

1967
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:40,040
and so the fact that women were sharing,
let's say ripe fruit with men also 

1968
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:40,830
brings them into there.

1969
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:46,610
What would you call builds up the basis 
for the potential of a reciprocal moral 

1970
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:47,190
obligation.
It's something like that,

1971
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:52,170
and the problem again for men with being
allied with women and infants is that it

1972
01:47:52,171 --> 01:47:57,171
also heightens their self consciousness 
because you're a lot tougher and more 

1973
01:47:57,171 --> 01:47:58,050
indomitable safe.
There's just you,

1974
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:03,260
but as soon as you have a wife say,
and then you also have an infant while 

1975
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:06,060
all the burden of their self 
consciousness and their vulnerability is

1976
01:48:06,061 --> 01:48:07,590
placed upon you,
well,

1977
01:48:07,591 --> 01:48:09,300
it's a hell of a bargain.
Well,

1978
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,850
why did men except the bargain?
Well,

1979
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:15,960
it's partly because women stood in front
of them offering them fruit,

1980
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:16,890
right?
Well,

1981
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:20,220
prior to the price that the men paid for
that was to wake the hell up.

1982
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:21,960
Well,
who the hell wants that?

1983
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:26,250
It's a lot more.
It's a lot more calming to remain asleep

1984
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:31,251
with no knowledge of the sort of burden 
of mortality that you would bear if you 

1985
01:48:31,251 --> 01:48:31,350
became self conscious.

1986
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:34,350
So fine.
So now they're done with it.

1987
01:48:34,351 --> 01:48:36,450
They,
the snake and the fruit woke them up and

1988
01:48:36,451 --> 01:48:41,010
they can see and the scales drop from 
the rise and so we can really see.

1989
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,510
Well,
so what does that mean?

1990
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:45,570
Half our brain is visual is devoted to 
visual processing,

1991
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:47,240
so as well,
as long as,

1992
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:52,310
as her eyes got better,
our brain got bigger and bigger and 

1993
01:48:52,310 --> 01:48:53,040
bigger and bigger.
What happens when it gets big enough?

1994
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:54,870
Well,
not only can you see,

1995
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:58,650
you can see it,
you can start to see into the future.

1996
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,660
Well,
that's exactly what happened to us.

1997
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:05,870
Not only could we see with her eyes,
we could see with our imagination and 

1998
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:08,610
our imagination is our are.
You can see with your eyes closed,

1999
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:11,190
right?
Close your eyes,

2000
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:14,010
bring up a vision.
You can imagine the future.

2001
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:15,000
Well,
what are you seeing?

2002
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:18,360
You're seeing a potential future with 
your eyes closed,

2003
01:49:18,450 --> 01:49:19,650
the circuitries there.

2004
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:22,620
Once it's developed,
you can use it to imagine.

2005
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:27,680
You can project your project,
your vision into places that don't even 

2006
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,850
exist and you can start to conceptualize
the future.

2007
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:32,520
What happens when you conceptualize the 
future?

2008
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:33,310
Well,
this is a.

2009
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:38,250
I'm spoiling the punchline.
You have to work because you can see the

2010
01:49:38,251 --> 01:49:39,270
future coming.
You Think,

2011
01:49:39,271 --> 01:49:40,500
oh,
the future's coming.

2012
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:44,610
It isn't just the present anymore.
I don't have to just worry about whether

2013
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:47,140
or not I'm hungry right now.
I'm going to have to worry about whether

2014
01:49:47,141 --> 01:49:49,930
I'm hungry tomorrow and next week and 
next month and next year,

2015
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:53,800
and for me and for my wife and for my 
child and for the community.

2016
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:58,000
It's like you can forget about your day 
to day existence in paradise.

2017
01:49:58,001 --> 01:50:03,001
At that point,
there's no evidence that people in 

2018
01:50:03,001 --> 01:50:05,611
industrialized societies are happier 
than people in non industrialized 

2019
01:50:05,611 --> 01:50:05,611
societies.
In fact,

2020
01:50:05,611 --> 01:50:05,950
quite the contrary.

2021
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:07,810
We're less happy.
Why?

2022
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:11,410
Well,
because we fully and constantly bear the

2023
01:50:11,411 --> 01:50:13,090
burden of the future.
Well,

2024
01:50:13,091 --> 01:50:18,091
that's good because we don't die and we 
lived maybe 30 years longer and we have 

2025
01:50:18,091 --> 01:50:20,170
fewer horrible diseases and all of that,
but that doesn't mean it's any picnic.

2026
01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:22,900
You have to carry that along with you 
wherever you go.

2027
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:25,450
That's the burden of self consciousness,
right?

2028
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:30,451
And that's exactly what happens when God
finds out that Adam and eve have become 

2029
01:50:30,451 --> 01:50:33,601
self conscious.
The one of the first things he says is 

2030
01:50:33,601 --> 01:50:33,601
jigs up now,
man,

2031
01:50:33,601 --> 01:50:36,820
you're going to be working forever 
toiling forever.

2032
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,160
It's your destiny.
There's no escaping from it.

2033
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:41,080
Well,
human beings work.

2034
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:46,260
What does that mean?
They sacrifice the present for the 

2035
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:49,621
future,
and that's partly as soon as this 

2036
01:50:49,621 --> 01:50:49,621
happens,
the next story,

2037
01:50:49,621 --> 01:50:52,150
which is cain and enable,
you see the Motif of sacrifice emerge,

2038
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:52,570
right?

2039
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:55,030
That story circulates around the Motif 
of sacrifice,

2040
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:58,110
sacrifice the present for the future.
Well,

2041
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:01,330
what's the price you pay?
You don't get the present.

2042
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:03,430
That's a big price,
right?

2043
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:08,610
Because what you do is what you're doing
essentially is you're taking all the 

2044
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:12,061
potential suffering of the future and 
putting it into the present all the 

2045
01:51:12,061 --> 01:51:13,060
time.
Well,

2046
01:51:13,061 --> 01:51:14,140
so what happens?
Well,

2047
01:51:14,141 --> 01:51:16,420
maybe you live longer and live 
healthier,

2048
01:51:16,421 --> 01:51:20,440
but you're not without the burden that 
that puts on you.

2049
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:25,960
So the eyes of them were both opened and
they knew they were naked.

2050
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:27,040
Well,
so what does that mean?

2051
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:28,870
Well,
what is naked mean?

2052
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:31,780
It means you know you're vulnerable.
That's exactly what it means.

2053
01:51:31,781 --> 01:51:36,781
They know they're vulnerable.
So they sewed fig leaves together and 

2054
01:51:36,781 --> 01:51:38,560
make themselves aprons.
So what happens is they wake up,

2055
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:40,510
their eyes open,
they know they're vulnerable,

2056
01:51:40,511 --> 01:51:41,710
so they discover the future.

2057
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:44,290
They discover their vulnerability 
extended into the future,

2058
01:51:44,291 --> 01:51:46,000
and the first thing they do is build 
culture,

2059
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:47,380
right?
That's the fig leaves.

2060
01:51:47,381 --> 01:51:48,400
It's like,
okay,

2061
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:53,760
here's the vulnerability.
We put a barrier between us and the 

2062
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:53,760
world.
It's like a wall,

2063
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,650
right?
Because this is externalized clothing.

2064
01:51:56,680 --> 01:52:00,720
That's one way of thinking about it,
and so to put that clothing on,

2065
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:03,160
this is clothing as a human universal,
by the way.

2066
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:06,100
Now sometimes it's only used for 
decorative purposes,

2067
01:52:06,101 --> 01:52:08,500
but far more often,
especially in cold climates,

2068
01:52:08,501 --> 01:52:13,501
it's used for protection,
so to clothe yourself is to recognize 

2069
01:52:13,931 --> 01:52:17,020
your vulnerability and to use culture to
hold it at bay.

2070
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:22,470
So fine.
They made themselves aprons and they 

2071
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:23,830
heard the voice of the Lord God walking 
in the garden in the cool of the day,

2072
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:30,060
and Adam and his wife hid themselves 
from the presence of the Lord God among 

2073
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:30,060
the trees of the garden.

2074
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:33,340
Okay?
So before Adam and eve wake up,

2075
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:36,070
before they realize they're vulnerable,
they don't hide from God.

2076
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,740
So what does that mean?
Well,

2077
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:43,200
he's the spirit that goes into the 
unknown to,

2078
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,610
to,
to,

2079
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:46,580
to conquer it,
and to make the world.

2080
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:48,440
Okay?
So let's say that's what you're supposed

2081
01:52:48,441 --> 01:52:51,380
to do.
You're supposed to mediate between chaos

2082
01:52:51,381 --> 01:52:52,760
and order.
Okay?

2083
01:52:52,761 --> 01:52:54,470
And you were supposed to do that 
forthrightly,

2084
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:57,290
so then the question is what the Hell's 
stopping you?

2085
01:52:57,830 --> 01:53:01,400
And that answer's easy.
Your knowledge of your vulnerability.

2086
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:03,770
Obviously that's what stopping you.
It's like,

2087
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:06,740
why aren't you courageous and 
forthright?

2088
01:53:07,130 --> 01:53:12,130
Well,
because you can be cut off at the knees 

2089
01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:13,910
and terribly hurt and so you're going to
shrink back from that responsibility and

2090
01:53:13,911 --> 01:53:15,200
it's no bloody wonder,
right?

2091
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:20,260
It's obviously what's going to happen.
So the Lord God calls them to Adam.

2092
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:25,150
So He's trying to.
What that means for the,

2093
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:28,310
for God to call on you is to say for God
to say,

2094
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:31,340
I'm I want to act through you or I want 
to act with you.

2095
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:32,930
Have that spirit.
Let's say.

2096
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,280
Well,
Adam says,

2097
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:38,270
I heard,
I heard God says to Adam,

2098
01:53:38,271 --> 01:53:39,980
where are you?
Adam says,

2099
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:42,710
I heard your voice in the garden,
right?

2100
01:53:42,711 --> 01:53:46,880
I heard the call,
but I was afraid because I was naked and

2101
01:53:46,881 --> 01:53:47,960
I hid myself.
It's like,

2102
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:52,961
yes,
that's exactly what human beings are 

2103
01:53:52,961 --> 01:53:54,581
like.
That's precisely exactly what we're 

2104
01:53:54,581 --> 01:53:54,590
like.
We hear the call,

2105
01:53:54,591 --> 01:53:56,840
but we hide and we have.
The thing is it's.

2106
01:53:57,090 --> 01:54:02,090
There's good reason for it.
It's not something trivial and God said,

2107
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:06,230
who told you you were naked?
Did you eat the tree that I told you you

2108
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:11,240
shouldn't eat?
And the man says the man doesn't come 

2109
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:11,420
off very well in this particular phrase 
as far as I'm concerned,

2110
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:16,540
and there's actually quite.
This is actually quite a comedic story 

2111
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:17,360
except that it's also a catastrophic 
tragedy.

2112
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:22,130
It's like God calls out him out like,
what's with you now?

2113
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:24,080
You know you're hiding from me.
Why?

2114
01:54:24,081 --> 01:54:26,540
And the first thing out of him does it 
says it's her fault.

2115
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:28,790
It's her fault.
She made me self conscious.

2116
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:30,470
Well,
I see that in resentful.

2117
01:54:30,471 --> 01:54:35,471
Men All the time.
They're very antipathetic towards women 

2118
01:54:35,471 --> 01:54:39,670
and they blame their misery and 
resentment on the fact that women won't 

2119
01:54:39,670 --> 01:54:41,660
have anything to do with them while the 
women are making them self conscious for

2120
01:54:41,661 --> 01:54:43,820
not being old.
They should be because the women think,

2121
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:48,970
why should I bother with you if you're 
not the embodiment of the spirit that 

2122
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:50,210
will move into the unknown and and face 
the Leviathan,

2123
01:54:50,211 --> 01:54:51,800
which is exactly what she should be 
saying.

2124
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:52,820
And you're thinking,
well,

2125
01:54:52,821 --> 01:54:54,500
I don't want to have anything to do with
that,

2126
01:54:54,501 --> 01:54:56,510
but I'd like women to like me anyways.
It's like,

2127
01:54:56,511 --> 01:54:57,890
well,
good luck with that.

2128
01:54:57,980 --> 01:55:02,980
So that doesn't work out.
And so instead of getting your act 

2129
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:02,980
together,
you say those God damn women,

2130
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:04,130
that's exactly what Adam says to God.

2131
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:04,610
He said,
well,

2132
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:06,560
don't,
don't be laying this on my feet.

2133
01:55:06,561 --> 01:55:11,561
It's the woman you made her.
She made me all self conscious and 

2134
01:55:11,561 --> 01:55:11,780
cowardly.
It's like brilliant,

2135
01:55:11,781 --> 01:55:13,040
great,
wonderful.

2136
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:15,950
And God says to the woman,
what did you do?

2137
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,240
And the woman said,
well,

2138
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:22,330
it was,
it was the serpent that confused me and 

2139
01:55:22,330 --> 01:55:22,760
I ate well.
It's like,

2140
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:25,240
actually I'm a little more sympathetic 
to her then dad,

2141
01:55:25,241 --> 01:55:28,520
I'm all things considered because after 
all she was trying to deal with the damn

2142
01:55:28,521 --> 01:55:29,510
snake.
Right?

2143
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:34,690
And we find out that the snake is not 
only the thing that preys upon her 

2144
01:55:34,690 --> 01:55:35,450
infants,
but as the tradition develop,

2145
01:55:35,451 --> 01:55:37,760
it's identified with Satan himself.
So,

2146
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:42,950
and that's the snake in every soul.
That's the right way of thinking about 

2147
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:43,410
that.
So she had her reasons,

2148
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:47,580
but doesn't matter.
You pay whether you have your reasons or

2149
01:55:47,581 --> 01:55:49,980
not,
and so God says to the serpent,

2150
01:55:50,430 --> 01:55:52,950
because you've done this,
you're cursed above all cattle,

2151
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:55,880
above every beast of the field,
upon the Belize,

2152
01:55:55,890 --> 01:55:57,660
shelled out,
go and dust shelled out,

2153
01:55:57,661 --> 01:55:59,400
eat all the days of thy life.

2154
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:02,400
So first of all,
the serpent seems to have legs,

2155
01:56:02,950 --> 01:56:07,950
right?
And then it's turned into a snake and 

2156
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:07,950
that's actually how it worked by the 
way,

2157
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:09,360
because snakes had legs and they lost 
them.

2158
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:13,260
Now I'm not trying to say that this 
story necessarily represents that,

2159
01:56:13,261 --> 01:56:16,890
but it's an interesting parallel and he 
tells the snake,

2160
01:56:16,891 --> 01:56:20,580
I'll put enmity between the and the 
woman and between thy seed and her seed,

2161
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:23,790
it shall bruise thy head and Thou shall 
bruise his heel.

2162
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:25,690
While yes,
well that's the snake striking.

2163
01:56:25,691 --> 01:56:30,691
Great.
And the fact that when human being see 

2164
01:56:30,691 --> 01:56:32,661
snakes,
they want to just like the simpsons 

2165
01:56:32,661 --> 01:56:32,661
whacking day,
right?

2166
01:56:32,661 --> 01:56:35,960
It's time to get rid of the snakes and 
that's why the many great saints are 

2167
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:39,291
those who drive the snakes from the land
like St Patrick or St George and the 

2168
01:56:39,291 --> 01:56:43,311
Dragon,
and it's the same representation of the 

2169
01:56:43,311 --> 01:56:44,520
hero moving out into the Wilderness and 
confronting the predatory,

2170
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:49,910
the predatory predatory potential is the
right way of thinking about it.

2171
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,840
All right unto the woman he said,
I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and 

2172
01:56:56,881 --> 01:57:00,630
thy conception in sorrow,
thou shalt bring forth children and that

2173
01:57:00,631 --> 01:57:04,350
desire to be shall be to thy husband and
he shall rule over thee.

2174
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:07,110
Well.
That's a statement of destiny,

2175
01:57:07,111 --> 01:57:09,870
not a statement of the way it should be.
So what does it mean?

2176
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:14,130
I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and 
die conception,

2177
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:19,260
while self consciousness will do that,
because of course women are fully aware 

2178
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:19,830
of exactly how fragile their infants 
are.

2179
01:57:19,831 --> 01:57:23,490
So that's a big problem in sorrow.
Thou shalt bring forth children.

2180
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:25,980
That's something particular to human 
women,

2181
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:27,180
right?
And here's why,

2182
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:32,010
the price we paid for the rapid 
expansion of our brain,

2183
01:57:32,011 --> 01:57:36,030
which is also something that gave us 
this self consciousness and vision meant

2184
01:57:36,031 --> 01:57:41,031
that there's an evolutionary arms race 
between the pelvic width of women and 

2185
01:57:41,031 --> 01:57:43,470
the hole in the center of the pelvis and
the infants had.

2186
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:49,010
So what happens is the infant is born 
far too young for a mammal of our size 

2187
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:51,660
because if it was benny older,
the head would be too big,

2188
01:57:51,661 --> 01:57:56,661
the pelvis would have to be too wide,
it's structural stability would be 

2189
01:57:56,661 --> 01:58:00,051
compromised and then women couldn't run.
So right now women are at the maximum 

2190
01:58:00,051 --> 01:58:01,740
for hip width in terms of their ability 
to run.

2191
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:07,160
So what's happened is that infants have 
had to be born younger with a 

2192
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:07,710
compressible head.
So you know,

2193
01:58:07,711 --> 01:58:12,711
the bones of an infant scholar joined 
together and sometimes after babies are 

2194
01:58:12,711 --> 01:58:16,641
born,
their head is actually almost cone 

2195
01:58:16,641 --> 01:58:18,711
shaped because of the tremendous 
pressure that was exerted on their head 

2196
01:58:18,711 --> 01:58:19,830
during the,
during the birthing process.

2197
01:58:19,831 --> 01:58:22,500
And of course that's killed innumerable 
women,

2198
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:28,070
right?
I mean women's life expectancy before 

2199
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:31,700
what?
The latter half of the 20th century was 

2200
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:33,840
way below men because they died in 
childbirth all the time and why?

2201
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:34,950
Well,
it's a.

2202
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:38,610
it's a very,
what do you call that?

2203
01:58:39,370 --> 01:58:40,690
It's a.
it's.

2204
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:48,240
It's a very narrow gateway and the price
that women pay for it is very high risk 

2205
01:58:48,341 --> 01:58:53,341
of death,
very high risk of sorrow because of 

2206
01:58:53,341 --> 01:58:56,260
death of children in childbirth and also
extraordinarily extraordinary pain in 

2207
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:58,990
giving birth,
so that's the price women pay for having

2208
01:58:58,991 --> 01:59:03,420
vision and being self conscious while 
that's and then worse,

2209
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:06,670
they desire their husband and he will 
rule over the well.

2210
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:09,340
Whether or not that's good or bad,
it doesn't matter.

2211
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,860
God's statement is that's how it's going
to be.

2212
01:59:11,861 --> 01:59:16,861
Well,
partly that's because as far as I can 

2213
01:59:16,861 --> 01:59:16,861
tell,
there isn't really women.

2214
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:21,870
Roughly speaking,
there's women with infants and a woman 

2215
01:59:21,870 --> 01:59:24,370
with an infant is compromised in terms 
of her what?

2216
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:30,750
Independent individuality to a 
remarkable degree because the infant is 

2217
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:31,390
dependent,
absolutely dependent,

2218
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:36,540
absolutely dependent for a year and then
unbelievably dependent for like eight 

2219
01:59:36,791 --> 01:59:40,660
years after that and then still pretty 
dependent for another five.

2220
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:45,930
So once you have an infant,
it's no longer you and I've talked to 

2221
01:59:45,930 --> 01:59:46,870
lots of women for whom that was a great 
relief by the way,

2222
01:59:46,871 --> 01:59:51,871
because it actually is somewhat of a 
relief to now not be the center of 

2223
01:59:51,871 --> 01:59:52,170
everything.
You know,

2224
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:54,430
if you go visit your in laws for 
example,

2225
01:59:54,431 --> 01:59:59,431
and you have a baby,
it's like they pay attention to the 

2226
01:59:59,431 --> 01:59:59,431
baby.
Your parents will do the same thing.

2227
01:59:59,431 --> 02:00:03,270
It's kind of Nice to have that happen,
but it's still an absolute catastrophe 

2228
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:06,790
for you as an independent being and 
you're not getting out in the forest and

2229
02:00:06,791 --> 02:00:08,680
hunt down dragons when you have an 
infant.

2230
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:11,590
So even if you could do it,
you're not going to do it.

2231
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:14,440
And so that's basically what that 
statement outlines.

2232
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:15,880
And then to Adam,
he says,

2233
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:18,820
because you listened to your wife and 
ate of that tree,

2234
02:00:18,821 --> 02:00:19,780
which I said,
you know,

2235
02:00:19,781 --> 02:00:21,250
maybe that's not such a good idea.

2236
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:24,880
Curse it is the ground for the sake in 
sorrow.

2237
02:00:24,881 --> 02:00:27,760
Show thou eat of it all the days of the 
light of thy life.

2238
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:31,660
Thorns also and thistles shall it bring 
forth to thee.

2239
02:00:31,661 --> 02:00:36,661
And now she'll eat.
The herb of the field in the sweat of 

2240
02:00:36,661 --> 02:00:37,720
thy face shall thou eat bread til thou 
return into the ground.

2241
02:00:37,990 --> 02:00:41,620
That's the death part for out of it.
Was Thou taken for dust,

2242
02:00:41,621 --> 02:00:46,621
thou art and unto dust thou shalt thou 
return and I missed one thing about 

2243
02:00:46,621 --> 02:00:48,670
that.
When the serpent,

2244
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,580
this took me a long time to figure out.
I think I've mentioned it already,

2245
02:00:51,581 --> 02:00:56,581
but it's worth reviewing.
The serpent tells eve that if she eats 

2246
02:00:58,481 --> 02:01:03,481
from the fruit of the tree,
then her eyes will be open and shall be 

2247
02:01:03,481 --> 02:01:03,790
as gods.
Knowing good and evil.

2248
02:01:04,230 --> 02:01:05,770
Well serpent doesn't say,
well,

2249
02:01:05,771 --> 02:01:09,280
you'll be as as gods in so far as new 
and good and evil,

2250
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:12,280
but you'll die so you only get half the 
gift.

2251
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:13,840
And so then I thought,
well,

2252
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:18,460
there's this weird minter mangling of of
occurrences in the story.

2253
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:24,330
There's the development of vision.
There's the development of self 

2254
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:24,790
consciousness.
There's the knowledge of nakedness,

2255
02:01:24,791 --> 02:01:29,791
there's the emergence of work,
there's the emergence of pain and 

2256
02:01:29,791 --> 02:01:32,611
suffering and childbirth,
and there's knowledge of good and evil 

2257
02:01:32,611 --> 02:01:32,611
thought for ages.
I thought,

2258
02:01:32,611 --> 02:01:33,700
what the hell?
What the hell?

2259
02:01:33,701 --> 02:01:38,701
What's going on there?
Why is there an emphasis on moral 

2260
02:01:38,701 --> 02:01:39,770
knowledge?
What does this have to do with moral and

2261
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,190
the implication is that in the initial 
state of unconsciousness,

2262
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:46,490
there was no moral knowledge and I think
of that as an animal like state,

2263
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:48,470
right?
There's no moral knowledge in animals.

2264
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:53,770
You don't think while that evil cat,
you don't ever think that even if it's 

2265
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:55,010
acting like a Predator,
even if it's playing with its prey,

2266
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:58,310
you don't attribute moral knowledge to 
the cat because you say,

2267
02:01:58,311 --> 02:01:59,990
well,
it doesn't know what it's doing.

2268
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:03,770
It doesn't understand what it's doing,
which is to say it acted out,

2269
02:02:03,771 --> 02:02:06,230
but it can't represent it or maybe even 
more.

2270
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:11,830
It acts it out,
but it can't represent it and it 

2271
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:11,900
certainly can't analyze its 
representation.

2272
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:17,110
It doesn't have that level of capacity,
but we do so there's that's associated 

2273
02:02:17,110 --> 02:02:19,490
with moral knowledge to some degree.
Why knowledge of good and evil.

2274
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,540
I thought,
all right,

2275
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:25,541
here's what it is.
Let's think about what you would 

2276
02:02:25,541 --> 02:02:25,610
consider reprehensible.
Universally.

2277
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:29,210
You could say,
how's this torturing and infant?

2278
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:33,290
I would consider that virtually 
universally reprehensible,

2279
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:34,610
wouldn't you say?
Okay,

2280
02:02:34,611 --> 02:02:37,100
so we will accept that as a reasonable 
definition,

2281
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:39,590
so then the question is,
one,

2282
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:45,490
why would you do it?
We'll leave that aside for a moment to 

2283
02:02:45,490 --> 02:02:49,360
how do you know how to do it?
That's the issue and that's easy.

2284
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:54,350
Once I know how I can be hurt because 
I'm aware of my own vulnerability,

2285
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:59,540
I know how you can be hurt and I can 
make it into a game and I can prolong it

2286
02:02:59,541 --> 02:03:03,170
forever and I can do it the worst 
possible way,

2287
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:08,180
and that's why when you open your eyes 
and you know your vulnerability and your

2288
02:03:08,181 --> 02:03:13,181
nakedness,
that you immediately have the knowledge 

2289
02:03:13,181 --> 02:03:13,490
of good and evil and so then evil 
becomes something like,

2290
02:03:14,210 --> 02:03:17,090
while there's tragedy in life,
fine earthquakes,

2291
02:03:17,091 --> 02:03:22,091
cancer disease,
all those terrible things that's 

2292
02:03:22,091 --> 02:03:22,910
different than me deciding that I'm 
going to make you miserable.

2293
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:26,600
The one is while you're a limited 
creature in an unlimited world,

2294
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:31,900
you're going to get hurt because of that
and maybe there's ways that you can be 

2295
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:35,231
that will enable you to transcend that 
at least to some degree and still have 

2296
02:03:35,231 --> 02:03:39,131
the benefits of being.
That's entirely different than me 

2297
02:03:39,131 --> 02:03:42,041
deciding that things are going to go a 
lot worse for you than they might and 

2298
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:44,300
human beings are capable.
I don't know if you've ever gone to some

2299
02:03:44,301 --> 02:03:46,550
of the dungeon porcher dungeons in 
Europe.

2300
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:48,260
Boy,
those are fun places to go.

2301
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:53,470
You think you take the most malevolent 
person you possibly could then have a 

2302
02:03:53,470 --> 02:03:58,061
little convention of those people and 
then get them to think up the worst 

2303
02:03:58,061 --> 02:04:00,920
possible things that they could possibly
devise and then you have the instruments

2304
02:04:00,921 --> 02:04:04,700
of torture that in euro,
in a medieval torture dungeon,

2305
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:07,220
right?
It's an art form and you think,

2306
02:04:07,221 --> 02:04:08,030
well,
why do people,

2307
02:04:08,031 --> 02:04:10,700
why are people willing to inflict that 
on one another?

2308
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:13,880
Well,
and we'll talk about that next time when

2309
02:04:13,881 --> 02:04:18,881
we talk about the story of Cain and Abel
because I think it holds the secret to 

2310
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:18,881
that,
and in the meantime,

2311
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:23,681
I'll stop with this story,
but I want to tell you the story of the 

2312
02:04:23,681 --> 02:04:23,681
Buddha because it maps onto it very 
nicely.

2313
02:04:23,681 --> 02:04:24,140
So what do you have?
You have.

2314
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:29,830
You have a protected space.
There's unconscious beings in a 

2315
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:34,031
protected space.
Something comes in in the form of the 

2316
02:04:34,031 --> 02:04:37,001
serpent to reveal death to reveal 
vulnerability,

2317
02:04:37,230 --> 02:04:37,830
death,
right?

2318
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:43,040
And then the paradise comes to an end.
The human beings are eliminated from it 

2319
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:47,721
and they don't get to come back.
So God puts angels with flaming swords 

2320
02:04:47,721 --> 02:04:47,721
at the,
at the,

2321
02:04:47,721 --> 02:04:52,680
at the gateway to Paradise so that 
people cannot come back in and it isn't 

2322
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:56,601
obvious what that means except that 
there's gotta be some sort of trial by 

2323
02:04:56,601 --> 02:04:57,690
fire before reentering paradise.

2324
02:04:57,690 --> 02:04:59,220
But we can leave that alone for a 
moment.

2325
02:04:59,430 --> 02:05:01,410
So that's the basic structure of the 
story.

2326
02:05:01,950 --> 02:05:04,950
Unconscious human beings,
emergence of knowledge,

2327
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:10,350
realization of death and suffering and 
the elimination of the paradise.

2328
02:05:10,351 --> 02:05:11,070
Right?
Okay.

2329
02:05:11,071 --> 02:05:12,840
So now I'll read you the story of the 
Buddha,

2330
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:17,490
the father of Prince Gautama,
the Buddha savior of the Orient,

2331
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:21,090
determined to protect his son from 
desperate knowledge and tragic awareness

2332
02:05:21,091 --> 02:05:25,350
built for him and enclosed pavilion,
a walled garden of earthly delights.

2333
02:05:25,650 --> 02:05:30,650
Okay?
So the story goes that at angel visited 

2334
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:34,400
Buddhist father and said that he's going
to have a son and the son is either 

2335
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:37,851
going to become the greatest ruler that 
the world has ever seen or a spiritual 

2336
02:05:37,851 --> 02:05:40,260
leader and the father being a practical 
man thought where there's no bloody way.

2337
02:05:40,261 --> 02:05:43,230
I want my son to be some like wandering 
spiritual leader.

2338
02:05:43,410 --> 02:05:46,140
I want him to be the greatest king that 
the world has ever seen.

2339
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:49,770
Okay?
And so the father decides,

2340
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:55,910
how am I going to get my son to be the 
greatest ruler of the world has ever 

2341
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:59,871
seen.
I better get them to fall in love with 

2342
02:05:59,871 --> 02:06:01,911
the world because then he's not going to
go traipsing after some sort of half 

2343
02:06:01,911 --> 02:06:04,200
witted spiritual knowledge.
He's going to stick to practical tasks,

2344
02:06:04,201 --> 02:06:06,150
right?
That's something that a father should do

2345
02:06:06,151 --> 02:06:08,220
to some degree is orient you in the 
world,

2346
02:06:08,221 --> 02:06:13,221
right?
And maybe shouldn't subvert your 

2347
02:06:13,221 --> 02:06:13,500
spiritual development to any great 
degree,

2348
02:06:13,501 --> 02:06:15,610
but there's a practical element to this 
and,

2349
02:06:15,870 --> 02:06:17,580
and so anyways,
that's how it works.

2350
02:06:17,581 --> 02:06:22,581
And so that's what happens.
The father bill is this city of 

2351
02:06:22,581 --> 02:06:27,261
perfection and he eliminates from it 
everything that's a reminder of the 

2352
02:06:27,601 --> 02:06:30,690
suffering that's associated with life,
so the only thing that's allowed,

2353
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,760
the only creatures that are allowed to 
be in there,

2354
02:06:32,761 --> 02:06:35,190
the only people that are allowed to be 
in there are healthy,

2355
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:36,720
young,
and happy people,

2356
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:41,810
so the Buddha grows up surrounded by 
nothing but the positive elements of 

2357
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:41,810
life.

2358
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:42,030
While you think,
well,

2359
02:06:42,031 --> 02:06:45,120
what does that mean?
While it's akin to the paradise idea,

2360
02:06:45,121 --> 02:06:48,990
obviously walled closure of paradise 
where there's no death,

2361
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:54,470
but there's more to it than that too.
It's also in some sense what a good 

2362
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:56,280
father would do.
What do you do with your young children?

2363
02:06:56,620 --> 02:06:58,920
Well,
you don't expose them to death and decay

2364
02:06:58,921 --> 02:07:00,900
at every step of the way.
Right to you.

2365
02:07:01,110 --> 02:07:05,010
You build a protected world for them 
like a wall enclosure,

2366
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:10,310
and you only keep what's healthy and 
life giving inside of it and you don't 

2367
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:12,240
expose them to things that they can't 
tolerate.

2368
02:07:12,241 --> 02:07:14,040
You know,
maybe you don't take a three year old to

2369
02:07:14,041 --> 02:07:15,240
a funeral now.
Maybe you do,

2370
02:07:15,241 --> 02:07:20,241
but maybe you don't.
There's things that you don't expect 

2371
02:07:20,241 --> 02:07:22,491
them to be able to cope with.
You regulate what they're allowed to 

2372
02:07:22,491 --> 02:07:25,761
watch.
You're not going to show them the tech 

2373
02:07:25,761 --> 02:07:25,761
Texas chainsaw massacre when they're 
four years old,

2374
02:07:25,761 --> 02:07:30,741
right,
so so you're staving off knowledge of 

2375
02:07:30,741 --> 02:07:33,711
mortality and death,
and so he's just being a good father in 

2376
02:07:33,711 --> 02:07:33,711
many ways here.

2377
02:07:33,711 --> 02:07:36,970
All signs of decay and degeneration 
where thus kept hidden from the prince,

2378
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:42,630
immersed in the immediate pleasures of 
the senses in physical love and dance 

2379
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:44,860
and music and beauty and pleasure.
Gautama grew to maturity,

2380
02:07:44,861 --> 02:07:47,920
protected absolutely from the 
limitations of mortal being.

2381
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:53,190
However,
he grew curious despite his father's 

2382
02:07:53,190 --> 02:07:55,630
most particular attention and will and 
resolve to leave his seductive present.

2383
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:57,520
Well,
it's that curiosity element.

2384
02:07:57,521 --> 02:08:00,820
It's the same thing that lurks in the 
Adam and Eve story.

2385
02:08:00,821 --> 02:08:04,510
It's like God tells Adam and Eve,
see that tree over there.

2386
02:08:04,660 --> 02:08:06,430
Don't be bothered with it.
Well,

2387
02:08:06,431 --> 02:08:08,080
you know what's going to happen with 
human beings,

2388
02:08:08,081 --> 02:08:10,150
especially if there's a snake associated
with it.

2389
02:08:10,151 --> 02:08:11,470
They're going to be over there right 
away.

2390
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:15,040
Check in that place out,
and that's exactly what happens with the

2391
02:08:15,041 --> 02:08:20,041
Buddha.
It's like he's raised to be healthy and 

2392
02:08:20,041 --> 02:08:24,001
what is,
what's the consequence of that is that 

2393
02:08:24,001 --> 02:08:27,030
the fact that he's healthy makes them 
look for what's beyond the protected 

2394
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:28,810
confines of the thing that made him 
healthy.

2395
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:34,140
It's like even in the Japan story,
you know where Japan Paints on 

2396
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:34,600
Pinocchio,
his mouth,

2397
02:08:34,601 --> 02:08:39,601
and he's ready to go.
He puts them outside the next day and 

2398
02:08:39,601 --> 02:08:39,601
Pinocchio is ready to run away with all 
the kids.

2399
02:08:39,601 --> 02:08:42,130
Right?
So the consequence of raising a child in

2400
02:08:42,131 --> 02:08:46,090
a healthy way is that the child is going
to be curious enough to go out there and

2401
02:08:46,091 --> 02:08:51,091
look for some trouble and we actually 
know that because there is followup 

2402
02:08:51,091 --> 02:08:55,320
studies of teenagers.
You imagine that there's teenagers who 

2403
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:56,350
never break any rules and then there's 
teenagers who break all the rules.

2404
02:08:56,351 --> 02:08:59,200
Okay?
These teenagers don't do very well.

2405
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:00,610
Introverted,
depressed,

2406
02:09:00,611 --> 02:09:02,050
anxious,
depressed.

2407
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:03,550
Sorry.
I said that twice.

2408
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:06,820
These ones are antisocial.
The ones in the middle.

2409
02:09:06,910 --> 02:09:11,910
That's what you want.
You want your damn teenager to get out 

2410
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:14,611
of the paradisical confines of your 
house and to go cause some trouble and 

2411
02:09:14,611 --> 02:09:14,611
to investigate.

2412
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:17,050
Maybe you don't want to know about it 
anymore than you have to.

2413
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:22,260
You don't want them to be breaking rules
all the time and you don't want them to 

2414
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:26,041
be so timid into a press that they can't
make a move on their own and never make 

2415
02:09:26,041 --> 02:09:28,240
a mistake.
So the paradoxical thing here,

2416
02:09:28,241 --> 02:09:31,390
and it's sort of echoed are this is why 
I like these two stories back to back is

2417
02:09:31,391 --> 02:09:35,890
like if you give people what they want,
then the first thing they're gonna do is

2418
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:40,950
try to get beyond it.
And Dostoevsky says the same thing and 

2419
02:09:40,950 --> 02:09:40,950
notes from underground.
He says,

2420
02:09:40,950 --> 02:09:42,580
if you gave people everything they 
wanted,

2421
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:44,410
pure utopia.
So he says,

2422
02:09:44,411 --> 02:09:49,411
so that they're sitting in a pool of 
bliss with nothing but bubbles of 

2423
02:09:49,411 --> 02:09:52,960
happiness coming up from the surface and
all they have to do is eat cake and busy

2424
02:09:52,961 --> 02:09:55,330
themselves with the continuation of the 
species.

2425
02:09:55,570 --> 02:10:00,570
Dusty said,
Dostoyevsky's observation is the first 

2426
02:10:00,570 --> 02:10:01,930
thing that people would do is find 
something to smash that with.

2427
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:04,780
Just so that something interesting and 
perverse could happen.

2428
02:10:05,130 --> 02:10:05,770
It's like,
well,

2429
02:10:05,771 --> 02:10:06,460
yes,
we're,

2430
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:10,720
we're creatures that are designed to 
encounter the unknown.

2431
02:10:10,721 --> 02:10:12,820
We want to keep moving beyond what we 
have,

2432
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:15,340
even if we have what we have is what we 
want,

2433
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:18,430
and maybe that's partly because we're 
oriented towards the future.

2434
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:20,020
We think,
well this is great,

2435
02:10:20,021 --> 02:10:21,910
but it's not good enough.
It's great,

2436
02:10:21,911 --> 02:10:26,911
but it's not good enough.
There's always something more that 

2437
02:10:26,911 --> 02:10:26,911
drives us forward.
While.

2438
02:10:26,911 --> 02:10:28,870
So that's what happens with the Buddha.
He gets curious.

2439
02:10:28,871 --> 02:10:31,840
He sees the walls,
he thinks there's walls,

2440
02:10:31,841 --> 02:10:33,650
there's probably something outside of 
those walls.

2441
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:37,400
So then he goes to his father and he 
says,

2442
02:10:39,860 --> 02:10:41,540
I'm,
I want to go outside,

2443
02:10:41,541 --> 02:10:43,010
what's outside?
And his father says,

2444
02:10:43,011 --> 02:10:44,330
Nah,
you don't want to go outside.

2445
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:45,170
And Buddha says,
yeah,

2446
02:10:45,171 --> 02:10:48,680
well I really do want to go outside and 
his father knows that unless he lets him

2447
02:10:48,681 --> 02:10:53,681
go outside,
he's going to climb over the walls and 

2448
02:10:53,681 --> 02:10:54,320
so the father decides he's going to let 
them go outside.

2449
02:10:54,321 --> 02:10:56,090
Bugs get fixed everything out there 
first.

2450
02:10:56,480 --> 02:11:01,480
So he goes outside.
It's like the Chinese preparing for the 

2451
02:11:01,480 --> 02:11:04,181
Olympics,
you know when they sprayed the grass 

2452
02:11:04,181 --> 02:11:04,181
with,
with,

2453
02:11:04,181 --> 02:11:04,181
with green paint,
got rid of all the homeless people.

2454
02:11:04,350 --> 02:11:07,310
It's the same thing.
So he goes outside the city and he tells

2455
02:11:07,311 --> 02:11:08,090
everyone,
all right,

2456
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:10,670
old people,
sick people dying,

2457
02:11:10,671 --> 02:11:14,000
people hit the road.
We don't want to see it for awhile,

2458
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:16,850
clean all this out.
We want the attractive people around the

2459
02:11:16,851 --> 02:11:21,851
sides of the roads,
like waving palm fronds and all of that 

2460
02:11:21,851 --> 02:11:24,641
and so when my son comes out,
he's going to see nothing but what's 

2461
02:11:24,641 --> 02:11:24,641
good and so we get that all arranged.

2462
02:11:24,641 --> 02:11:29,570
He lets his son go outside.
Now his son goes outside in this little 

2463
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:31,250
carrier thing and he has someone with 
him now,

2464
02:11:31,251 --> 02:11:36,251
unbeknownst to his father,
that person that's with them as an 

2465
02:11:36,251 --> 02:11:39,461
emissary of the gods and so in a 
perverse way he plays the same role as 

2466
02:11:39,461 --> 02:11:43,391
the serpent in the story of Adam and eve
and the gods have already arranged so 

2467
02:11:43,911 --> 02:11:48,911
that the father's a carer is going to be
insufficient and it's the snake in the 

2468
02:11:50,241 --> 02:11:55,241
garden idea.
It's like no matter how much care you 

2469
02:11:55,241 --> 02:11:55,490
take to make things perfect,
some of the,

2470
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:59,360
some of what you're excluding is going 
to come back in.

2471
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:04,600
So anyways,
Buddha goes outside and he's in his 

2472
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:08,741
chariot and preparations were made to 
guild is chosen route to cover the 

2473
02:12:08,741 --> 02:12:12,581
adventurous path with flowers and to 
display for his admiration and 

2474
02:12:12,581 --> 02:12:13,190
preoccupation,
the fairest women of the kingdom,

2475
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:16,090
the print set out with full red,
new in the shield,

2476
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:21,100
the comfort of a chaperone chariot and 
delighted in the Panorama previously 

2477
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:21,100
prepared for him.

2478
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:22,610
The gods,
however,

2479
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:27,880
decided to disrupt these most carefully 
laid plans and sent an aged man to 

2480
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:32,861
hobble in full view alongside the road.
The prince's fascinated gaze fell upon 

2481
02:12:33,111 --> 02:12:35,970
the ancient interloper,
compelled by curiosity.

2482
02:12:35,971 --> 02:12:39,140
He asked his attendant,
what is that creature stumbling,

2483
02:12:39,141 --> 02:12:44,141
shabby bent and broken beside my retinue
and the attendant answered that is a man

2484
02:12:44,151 --> 02:12:47,270
like other men who was born in infant 
became a child,

2485
02:12:47,271 --> 02:12:48,260
a youth,
a husband,

2486
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:53,261
a father,
a father of fathers has become old 

2487
02:12:53,261 --> 02:12:54,470
subject to destruction of his beauty,
his will,

2488
02:12:54,471 --> 02:12:57,620
and the possibilities of life like other
men,

2489
02:12:57,621 --> 02:12:59,840
you say,
hesitantly inquired the prints.

2490
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:05,080
That means this will happen to me,
and the attendant answered inevitably 

2491
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:06,950
with the passage of time.
Well,

2492
02:13:06,951 --> 02:13:11,951
that's the end of that party.
The world collapses in on Buddha and 

2493
02:13:11,951 --> 02:13:12,470
paying he hightails at home.
Well,

2494
02:13:12,471 --> 02:13:13,580
what does that mean?
Well,

2495
02:13:13,581 --> 02:13:14,690
that's what children do.

2496
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:17,610
Roughly speaking is there around their 
mother there.

2497
02:13:17,670 --> 02:13:20,000
They've got security there.
They go out into the unknown.

2498
02:13:20,001 --> 02:13:22,670
They encounter something that's just a 
little bit too much for them.

2499
02:13:22,740 --> 02:13:23,690
Bang,
they come home,

2500
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,520
they get old,
padded back into shape,

2501
02:13:25,521 --> 02:13:30,521
and how been taken care of hugging 
children and patting them is actually 

2502
02:13:30,521 --> 02:13:31,740
analgesic.
It actually reduces paid.

2503
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,980
Unsurprisingly,
that's what you do with someone who's 

2504
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:36,980
grieving,
right?

2505
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:38,110
So you hug them because grief is paid 
so,

2506
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:39,660
so they,
you know,

2507
02:13:39,661 --> 02:13:41,320
you pat them and they get rid of their 
pain.

2508
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:44,730
They get rid of their anxiety.
You calm them down and what happens?

2509
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:46,440
Well,
the next day they want to go out again.

2510
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:51,860
Well,
that's exactly what happens to the 

2511
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:51,860
Buddha,
so he's all shorted out by his encounter

2512
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:55,731
with death,
which has very little different than 

2513
02:13:55,731 --> 02:13:57,570
what happens to Adam and eve runs back,
recovers for six months.

2514
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:02,600
He has posttraumatic stress disorder.
He runs home and he recovers for six 

2515
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:04,440
months,
right in time,

2516
02:14:04,441 --> 02:14:06,120
his anxiety lessened.
His curiosity,

2517
02:14:06,121 --> 02:14:11,121
grinned.
He ventured outside again this time the 

2518
02:14:11,121 --> 02:14:12,650
God sent a sick man interview this creek
cheerios does attendance,

2519
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:14,850
shaking and palsy,
horribly afflicted,

2520
02:14:14,851 --> 02:14:17,880
unbearable to behold,
a source of pity and contempt.

2521
02:14:17,881 --> 02:14:21,840
What is he and the attendant answered 
that's a man like other men

2522
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:26,370
who was born whole but who became ill 
and sick,

2523
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:29,550
unable to cope,
a burden to himself and others suffering

2524
02:14:29,551 --> 02:14:33,300
and incurable like other men you say,
inquired the prince.

2525
02:14:33,330 --> 02:14:36,270
This could happen to me and the 
attendant answers,

2526
02:14:36,330 --> 02:14:39,000
no man is exempt from the ravages of 
disease.

2527
02:14:40,030 --> 02:14:42,350
Once again,
the world collapsed and Gautama returned

2528
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:47,400
to his home,
but the delights of his previous life 

2529
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,930
where ash is in his mouth and he 
ventured forth a third time,

2530
02:14:50,890 --> 02:14:54,460
the gods in their mercy sent him a dead 
man in funeral procession.

2531
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:00,000
This creature,
he asked his attendant laying so still 

2532
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,911
appearing,
so fearsome surrounded by grief and by 

2533
02:15:02,911 --> 02:15:03,190
Soro last and for Lauren.
What is he?

2534
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:08,140
And the attendant answered that is a man
like other men born of woman,

2535
02:15:08,141 --> 02:15:10,330
beloved and hated.
Who is once you.

2536
02:15:10,450 --> 02:15:14,380
Who once was you and now as the earth 
like other men you say,

2537
02:15:14,381 --> 02:15:17,110
acquired the prince.
Then this could happen to me.

2538
02:15:17,620 --> 02:15:20,860
This is your and said the attendant and 
the end of all men.

2539
02:15:21,490 --> 02:15:22,840
Well,
that's the end of childhood,

2540
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:25,090
right?
There's no going back after that.

2541
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:28,480
It's like Pinocchio goes back.
There's no one home anymore.

2542
02:15:28,530 --> 02:15:33,530
It's there's nothing that your father 
can do to protect you from knowledge of 

2543
02:15:33,530 --> 02:15:38,071
death.
There is no returning to the childhood 

2544
02:15:38,071 --> 02:15:40,210
unconsciousness because you now know and
there's no going backwards.

2545
02:15:40,660 --> 02:15:45,660
Suicide that's going backwards.
That's how you replace your emergent 

2546
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:48,040
self consciousness with the old blissful
unconsciousness,

2547
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:53,160
and that's exactly what suicidal people 
wish they are going to destroy their 

2548
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:56,410
painful selfconsciousness and make it 
all go away.

2549
02:15:58,570 --> 02:16:01,900
The world collapsed to final time and 
Gautama asked to be returned home,

2550
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:05,890
but the attendant had orders from the 
prince's father and took them instead to

2551
02:16:05,891 --> 02:16:07,310
a festival of women.
Oh,

2552
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:12,320
curing.
Near occurring nearby in a grove in the 

2553
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:14,491
woods.
The prince was met by a beautiful 

2554
02:16:14,491 --> 02:16:15,730
assemblage who offered themselves freely
to him without restraint in song,

2555
02:16:15,731 --> 02:16:18,190
dance and play in the spirit of sensual 
love.

2556
02:16:18,730 --> 02:16:23,730
But gautama could think only of death 
and the inevitable decomposition of 

2557
02:16:23,730 --> 02:16:25,300
beauty and took no pleasure in the 
display.

2558
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:30,340
Well,
so you see the parallels

2559
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:33,220
between one story and the other.
They're the same.

2560
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:36,370
They have the same underlying structure,
initial paradise,

2561
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:38,800
partly childhood,
partly unconsciousness,

2562
02:16:39,190 --> 02:16:44,190
the emergence of knowledge of mortality 
into that and the demolition of the of 

2563
02:16:44,190 --> 02:16:48,811
the paradise is the same metal story 
that we've been talking about all along 

2564
02:16:48,811 --> 02:16:52,620
ordered state collapse into chaos while 
the rest of the story is the return,

2565
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:55,390
like in the Bible,
Bible is actually set up that way.

2566
02:16:55,391 --> 02:17:00,391
It's collapse into history and then a 
movement upward.

2567
02:17:01,091 --> 02:17:03,040
The question is,
what's the movement upward?

2568
02:17:03,041 --> 02:17:07,510
That's the question here.
When the collapse is caused by knowledge

2569
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:12,511
of mortality and self and the emergence 
of self consciousness and knowledge of 

2570
02:17:12,511 --> 02:17:16,591
death,
is there any manner in which redemption 

2571
02:17:16,591 --> 02:17:17,350
can be attained or is that the final 
like,

2572
02:17:17,351 --> 02:17:19,120
is that finally,
is that.

2573
02:17:19,121 --> 02:17:21,580
Does that finally demolish you?
Well,

2574
02:17:21,581 --> 02:17:23,750
that's the question and that's,
that's,

2575
02:17:23,810 --> 02:17:28,810
that's it's the answer to that question 
that entire civilizations constantly 

2576
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:32,500
pursue and the question is,
well,

2577
02:17:32,501 --> 02:17:33,670
what is the answer?

2578
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:38,790
And part of the answer is identification
with the spirit that generates order out

2579
02:17:39,281 --> 02:17:41,830
of chaos.
That's the answer.

2580
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:44,470
It's something like that.
And so then the question is,

2581
02:17:44,471 --> 02:17:45,940
what does that mean?
Well,

2582
02:17:46,070 --> 02:17:49,390
that will be what the last two lectures 
in the course or about,

2583
02:17:49,391 --> 02:17:53,920
because we're down to two last lectures,
so any questions,

2584
02:17:54,590 --> 02:17:57,380
does that make sense?
More,

2585
02:17:57,520 --> 02:17:59,260
more importantly,
really is there,

2586
02:17:59,261 --> 02:18:04,261
is there any way in which it doesn't 
make sense because these stories are not

2587
02:18:04,271 --> 02:18:06,580
supposed to make sense,
right?

2588
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:11,640
That's the theory is that they're 
archaic superstitions or something like 

2589
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:12,310
that.
Well,

2590
02:18:12,311 --> 02:18:14,170
it doesn't seem to me that that's the 
case.

2591
02:18:14,171 --> 02:18:17,590
It seems to me that they make insanely 
perfect sense.

2592
02:18:17,591 --> 02:18:22,591
They're exactly right.
They tell you exactly what human beings 

2593
02:18:22,591 --> 02:18:26,311
are like and exactly what the situation 
that we face is so.

2594
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:28,480
And so.
Then the question is,

2595
02:18:28,481 --> 02:18:30,790
well,
the diagnosis is made properly.

2596
02:18:30,791 --> 02:18:33,580
What has the cure been properly 
identified?

2597
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:39,180
Well,
that's what we'll discuss for the next 

2598
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:39,180
two sessions.
