1
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,190
So today we're going to delve a little 
bit more deeply into the realm of 

2
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,461
symbolic representation and I'll,
I'll tell you what I think I'm doing and

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,920
then we'll show you a bunch of examples 
of it.

4
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:27,860
Then I want to tell you a couple more 
stories and so I'll tell you the stories

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,630
in the second half of the class.
So you know,

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,460
it was Carl Jung who popularized and 
differentiated the idea of archetypes.

7
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:41,340
They weren't his idea platonic forms or 
an I are,

8
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,990
are archetypes essentially.
Ideals are an archetype.

9
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:46,410
And so,
but young,

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,770
the thing that I think he did that,
that hadn't been done before was to 

11
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,750
suggest that he as well as suggesting as
Freud did,

12
00:00:56,871 --> 00:00:59,830
that human beings are composed of sub 
personalities.

13
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,230
You pointed out as I did to some degree,
that some of those personalities have a 

14
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:11,411
universal character and so that they can
be thought about as transcendent 

15
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:15,760
entities.
And you could think about those while 

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,151
they have been thought about it,
even put forward as gods of one form or 

17
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:19,151
another.
Um,

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,480
now when you talked about archetypes was
never clear what he meant and 

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,050
everything.
The reason for that was because the 

20
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,680
archetype is a very complicated idea and
a very complicated phenomena and you can

21
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:35,681
think about it biologically and you can 
think about it socially and you can 

22
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:36,860
think about it as something that the 
individual participates in creating,

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,160
so it's not that easy to localize it and

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,360
and as well it's not that easy to 
localize it and as well

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,190
[inaudible] was never clear about what 
the universe of archetypes look like at 

26
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,751
some time.
He spoke as if they were a relatively 

27
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:06,721
small number and then at other times he 
spoke as if they were innumerable and I 

28
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,850
think the reason for that is in part it 
depends on the level of analysis,

29
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,790
right?
The more transcendent the archetype,

30
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,140
the fewer there are.
They are,

31
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,790
but they differentiate because you might
say,

32
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,920
well,
how many hero archetypes are there?

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,160
And one answer could be one,
but they differentiate all the way out 

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,270
into the diverse range of works of 
fiction that we have.

35
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:30,271
So you could say there's as many 
variants of the hero archetype roughly 

36
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:33,901
speaking as there are works of fiction.
So you think about it as a hierarchy 

37
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:36,460
with the ultimate archetype at the top.
So then another question might be,

38
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,000
what does the landscape of ultimate 
archetypes look like?

39
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,920
And I think that that's.
Well,

40
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:46,921
that's what I tried to lay out and 
that's what I'm trying to lay out in 

41
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,471
this diagram.
So now why do you want to know that 

42
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:52,930
there's a practical reason or way?
There's a number of practical reasons as

43
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:57,931
well as intellectual reasons.
One of the most relevant practical 

44
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:01,891
reasons as far as I'm concerned,
is that integrating narratives and so 

45
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,150
those would include political 
narratives.

46
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:09,151
Integrating narratives have their forest
because they draw on universal 

47
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:11,230
archetypes,
otherwise they wouldn't have any power,

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,210
right?
Because they're basically stories,

49
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,380
an integrating archetypes like the story
that people that Hitler sold the Germans

50
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,950
or that the Germans and Hitler 
cocreated,

51
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:25,951
which is a much more accurate way of 
thinking about it that had motive force 

52
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:29,701
because it had an archetypal essence.
And so political stories derive their 

53
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:34,741
power from the underlying archetypal 
representations that obviously because 

54
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:37,180
they have to be concerned with the 
things that people find important.

55
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,490
Right?
Well,

56
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,960
how can you sell a political message to 
someone if it isn't about something they

57
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:43,540
find important and if it's important to 
them,

58
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,540
it's going to be grounded at least to 
some degree in their biological,

59
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,530
uh,
in,

60
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,540
in their biological substructure,
mean if you're talking to hungry people 

61
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,530
about food,
it's a story that you can tell,

62
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,530
right?
Because it,

63
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,900
it,
it hooks them deeply,

64
00:03:55,901 --> 00:04:00,901
it hooks them in,
hooks deep into their motivational 

65
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:01,810
systems to talk,
to use a narrative of Utopia,

66
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:04,390
which is the land of milk and honey,
roughly speaking a very,

67
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:09,391
very old idea.
You're also tapping deeply into 

68
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:13,530
intrinsic human longings.
And so the idea that political 

69
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,900
narratives incorporated archetypal 
themes is,

70
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,920
is not really,
it's not an idea that I would consider a

71
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,921
particularly controversial.
Putting it that way might be okay.

72
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:30,880
So the problem with political narratives
in my estimation,

73
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,910
is that they can rapidly transformed 
themselves into a theologies and 

74
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,210
ideologies are dangerous for variety of 
reasons,

75
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:41,740
but the primary reason for their danger,
I think this is a hypothesis,

76
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,170
is because of their one sided nature.

77
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,670
What happens is that they capitalize.
Paris.

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,780
Otitis,
I think is even a better way of thinking

79
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,980
about it,
a,

80
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,240
a profound underlying narrative,
but they don't tell the entire story and

81
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:58,870
so then if you're looking for 
orientation in the world because you are

82
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:03,520
fragmented and chaotic and somebody 
provides you with a partial story that's

83
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,500
going to serve an integrating function 
and it's very.

84
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,610
One of the things you see in 
psychotherapy is that if you're chaotic 

85
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,851
and confused and you go see a therapist 
who has a particular kind of practice 

86
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,960
Friday and behavioral,
cognitive rigidity and whatever,

87
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,440
there's a high probability that 
undergoing that course of therapy is 

88
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,760
going to be good for you and that you 
might even come to view your life in,

89
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,950
in the,
uh,

90
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,710
in the terms of that therapeutic 
practice.

91
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,490
You might say,
well,

92
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,710
why?
Why is that therapeutic practice right 

93
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,710
for you?
Maybe,

94
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,420
maybe it could have been Rogerian 
instead of Freud and say,

95
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,650
and the answer to that is,
yeah,

96
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:40,060
well,
it probably could be,

97
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,330
could have been because roughly 
speaking,

98
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,510
any coherent ordering principle is 
better than none.

99
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,370
And so that's also a good way to think 
about human development from a 

100
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,310
intellectual perspective is that partly 
what has to be provided to individuals

101
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,330
as they mature into an adult adults.
It's some kind of ordering structure,

102
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,690
and this is one of the fact that people 
who criticize the dogmatic element of 

103
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,170
religious belief don't really 
understand.

104
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,550
They don't understand that you can't.
You have to provide people with a 

105
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,330
determined that structure of support of 
some type,

106
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,570
even if it's constricting and 
restricting and crushing for that 

107
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,651
matter.
You have to pass through a disciplinary 

108
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:32,591
structure before and even in principle,
you could be free before you're 

109
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:32,960
disciplined.
You're not free,

110
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:37,961
you're just chaotic,
and so you have to practice some set of 

111
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,440
routines and rituals.
Now you could say,

112
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:44,441
well,
they don't necessarily have to be 

113
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:44,441
religious and they could be secular.
You could become a lawyer,

114
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:45,950
you could become a plumber.
You can become a carpenter.

115
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:50,951
And I would say yes,
that's far better than not becoming 

116
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:56,291
anything,
but the problem with an identity that 

117
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,501
isn't rooted into the archetypes is that
leaves you incomplete because the 

118
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:03,221
archetypical routing of the identity is 
what helps you grapple with the 

119
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:07,661
fundamental existential problems of life
and whether you're a carpenter or a 

120
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,390
plumber or a lawyer,
they're still going to.

121
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,390
Your soul is still going to hunger for 
some deeper form of identity and you're 

122
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,241
not going to get that without being,
without having your practical identity 

123
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:22,940
encapsulated in something that's that's 
greater from a philosophical perspective

124
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:27,941
and perhaps even deeper than philosophy,
which is I think the archetypal stories 

125
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:27,941
are there.
The.

126
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,300
There are the structure within which 
philosophy itself is embedded and 

127
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,560
outside of that as a behavioral 
structure,

128
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:38,561
we've talked about how those evolve.
You know there's there's behavioral 

129
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,831
evolution of something approximating a 
consensual morality and then stories 

130
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:46,241
about that consensual morality emerge 
and that inside that the structures of 

131
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,340
philosophy,
nest and all of those things have to be 

132
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,710
addressed by your identity to some 
degree or you're weak.

133
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,230
That's the problem.
You'll be sent by doubts.

134
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:59,231
You're be by anxiety,
your easy to stop and you don't have 

135
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,540
much motivation and none of that's good.

136
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,540
It's not good at all because life 
presents you with enough real obstacles 

137
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,250
in the fort,
in the face of genuine suffering so that

138
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:11,900
unless you're strongly grounded and have
a real mood reason for moving forward,

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,240
you're going to get stopped and as soon 
as you stopped,

140
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:16,190
you are one miserable thing because 
it's.

141
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,520
It's almost like the definition of human
misery is to be paralyzed by anxiety and

142
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:25,880
emotional pain and also have no motive 
force forward.

143
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,930
It's a terrible state and so you don't 
want to be in that state and you have to

144
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:33,410
have an identity that's powerful enough 
and deeply rooted enough,

145
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:38,411
so the most profound doubts that might 
emerge about your life are met by 

146
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:40,220
something of equivalent force.
Okay,

147
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:43,520
so we're going to review the symbolic 
domain and briefly and then I'm going to

148
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:46,280
show you a bunch of different examples 
of how it plays itself out.

149
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,870
Partly architecturally and symbolically,
but also partly politically because I 

150
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
want to show you how both of those 
things,

151
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,190
how those things parallel one another 
and partly what I'm hoping

152
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,190
is that understanding the full domain of
archetipal symbolic representation will 

153
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:09,321
also inoculate you against ideological 
possession because you'll know when 

154
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:13,770
you're told a half sided one sided 
ideological story,

155
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,890
you'll know that there's something 
missing in the story.

156
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,580
There's,
there's,

157
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,760
there's paces that aren't being told or 
there's part of the story that isn't 

158
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,821
being revealed.
So if it's a story about his tout 

159
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:26,640
tyrannical modern culture is and how 
oppressive you think.

160
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:31,641
Well yes obviously,
but what about the beneficial aspect of 

161
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:34,680
it and how is that being represented and
dealt with and and so.

162
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:39,681
And it's the same story about the 
negative element of the human being 

163
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:42,681
which you hear stories like that all the
time because I think perhaps more 

164
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,740
intensely since the 19 sixties,
but,

165
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,160
but,
but because I wasn't around before then,

166
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:49,020
I don't know what it was like previous 
to that.

167
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,770
There is this idea that people hold and 
it's promoted that there's something 

168
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,230
fundamentally no cancerous about human 
beings.

169
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,340
The it was the club of Rome.
I think when they pronounced it,

170
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:02,850
everyone on the planet was going to die 
of starvation by the year 2000.

171
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,790
That human beings were no better than a 
cancer on the planet.

172
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,140
It's like,
well,

173
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,430
yeah,
you know,

174
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,400
there's lots of things about us that 
could be improved,

175
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:16,401
but when you,
when you portray the human only as 

176
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:17,070
negative,
the question should arise.

177
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,060
It's like,
fair enough,

178
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:22,680
but what about the positive part?
Why aren't you telling that story and it

179
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:24,420
doesn't take you,
you know,

180
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,140
all you have to do is be sick once and 
go to a hospital where you get competent

181
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:31,920
care to understand that you know,
and you can get in competent care to,

182
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,050
but sometimes you get really competent 
care.

183
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:34,740
You think?
Yes,

184
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:39,741
it's really good that there's some 
people out there who have their act 

185
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:39,741
together and are trying to put things 
together.

186
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,700
You know,
when you can't forget that in your story

187
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:46,701
and you,
you don't want to forget that in your 

188
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:46,701
story about yourself either.
So,

189
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:50,180
so what is the fundamental landscape?
While the basic idea is that it's,

190
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,190
it's,
it's predicated.

191
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,560
You can look at it multiple different 
ways.

192
00:10:55,561 --> 00:11:00,561
It's predicated on the contrast between 
explored an unexplored territory or the 

193
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,310
contrast between the interpretive 
structure,

194
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,580
but philosophers like Kant talked about 
and the real world manifestation that 

195
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,740
underlies under whose existence 
underlies the validity of empirical 

196
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,380
thinking,
right?

197
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,540
There's you and your structure.
You interpret the world,

198
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:20,541
but there's also the world informing you
and so that's the explored territory 

199
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,230
versus unexplored territory,
something like that,

200
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:27,231
or it's order versus chaos or it's or 
it's another variant of that would be 

201
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:30,480
it's the hero going out into the unknown
to Qa,

202
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,760
to encounter the dragon of chaos and to 
gather the information that is out there

203
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,280
in the unknown and,
and,

204
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,520
and I tried to make the case to you 
because I'm often accused most recently 

205
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,980
on Sam Harris's podcast of making up 
post hoc stories.

206
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,780
You know,
you have a set of stories.

207
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:53,781
You can interpret them any way you want.
Of course that is a danger because you 

208
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,240
bring an interpretive structure to bear 
on every set of facts.

209
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,450
How do I know that this isn't just an 
arbitrary post hoc analysis and my 

210
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:05,071
answer to that,
it's a technical answer is it manifests 

211
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:08,461
itself at multiple layers of analysis 
simultaneously and the probability that 

212
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,740
it's merely an imposition of an a priori
interpretive structure is decreased by 

213
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,941
the number of different levels of 
manifestation that you can detect the 

214
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:17,941
phenomena.
It's,

215
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:18,400
it's an.
It's,

216
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,770
it's axiomatic.
That's why you have five senses.

217
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,950
That's why,
because they need to report a different 

218
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,021
level.
That's why in science use multiple 

219
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:30,481
methods to detect the same thing.
So one of the things I tried to point 

220
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:34,081
out is that you can map this archetipal 
structure onto brain structure quite 

221
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:38,820
nicely even onto hemispheric structure 
and the function of the subcortical 

222
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,720
systems,
but even more particularly,

223
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:45,721
you can map it onto the function of 
specific neuro psychological systems 

224
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:45,760
within the.

225
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,880
Within the,
within the biological neurology,

226
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,340
we do have an interpretive structure,
right?

227
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,800
That's your map,
so to speak,

228
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:56,560
of of expectation and desire in the 
world.

229
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,680
That's your model.
There's a brain area of roughly the 

230
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,050
hippocampus.
Although this is an oversimplification,

231
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,900
it compares that with incoming sense 
data,

232
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,620
which is also a model,
but we won't get into that for the sake 

233
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:10,620
of argument,
so that's explored territory,

234
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,410
unexplored territory and the thing in 
the center doing the comparison,

235
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:19,650
that's the knower and so,
so it's strikes me as a highly unlikely,

236
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:24,811
although you're welcome to criticize a 
way that you will see that kind of 

237
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:28,771
stacking of evidence across multiple 
domains of inquiry without there 

238
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:32,380
actually being a pattern there,
so it's not merely post hoc analysis and

239
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:35,470
even the people who derive these 
patterns like young to begin with.

240
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:38,500
Let's say look cross culturally at least
to say,

241
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:39,120
well,
here's,

242
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,310
here's a manifestation of a pattern and 
here's a separate culture and you can 

243
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,310
see the same pattern.

244
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,810
So there's some attempt there to be 
methodologically rigorous.

245
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:50,290
He did the same thing with people's 
fantasies and dreams and then again,

246
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:55,530
by mapping those onto people's behavior 
and therapy also had them test out the 

247
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,581
ideas in the world.
So these aren't just trivial 

248
00:13:59,581 --> 00:13:59,590
methodologically as people make them out
to be.

249
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:04,591
And especially that's the case when you 
can put a biological underpinning 

250
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:07,831
underneath them,
so the proposition is explored 

251
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,831
territory,
unexplored territory and the explorer 

252
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:14,400
roughly speaking,
and then a differentiation of those two 

253
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,160
things into positive and negative.
Why?

254
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Because everything complex has a 
positive and negative element and so 

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,930
explored.
Territory explored territory can become 

256
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,300
stultifying and crushing.
That's tyranny,

257
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,570
but it's also provides the structure 
that informs and protects you and 

258
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,610
unexplored territory.
Well that that can kill you obviously,

259
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,970
but it's also the place that you need to
go when you're static and dead and you 

260
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,820
need new water and you need new life and
you need new information,

261
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:47,821
so it's constant movement out into the 
unknown and back out into the unknown 

262
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,720
and back,
and that's what human beings are like,

263
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:54,721
right?
We're information foragers and then the 

264
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,900
individual is both positive and negative
and you know that

265
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,060
because you know yourself and you know 
other people and you know yourself,

266
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:07,061
you can be.
There's parts of you that are that are 

267
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:09,311
good classically speaking or good even 
by your own definition and other parts 

268
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,320
that really could use to say the 
minimum,

269
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,500
a tremendous amount of work and you also
know that about other people and if you 

270
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,710
get truly unlucky with yourself or other
people,

271
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,740
it won't merely be that you're not 
trying hard enough.

272
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,070
You'll encounter something in you or 
someone who's absolutely malevolent and 

273
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,560
bent on destruction,
and that's also not a hypothesis.

274
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:35,561
You know,
the the literature on post traumatic 

275
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,651
stress disorder reveals quite quite 
clearly that people typically develop 

276
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:44,081
posttraumatic stress disorder because 
they encounter some form of malevolence 

277
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:44,750
and if it.
If it's ever happened to you,

278
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:49,751
you know that it's no joke.
It's not some figment of your 

279
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:49,820
imagination.
Quite the contrary.

280
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,480
So and then that entire world that's 
sort of the world that can be 

281
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,060
comprehended is nested inside a broader 
symbolic network and that seems to be 

282
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,610
the symbolic network that's made up of 
the dragon of chaos,

283
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:08,360
which is something like our 
representation of the set of unknown,

284
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,780
the set of all currently unknowable 
things.

285
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,030
It's a very strange category,
right?

286
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:17,810
It's like the category of zero or the 
category of infinity and the reason that

287
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:22,811
we formulated that category is because 
we don't only want to know how to solve 

288
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:25,130
a problem,
just like we don't only want to know how

289
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:30,131
to win a game.
We want to know how to win this set of 

290
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:32,480
all possible games and we want to solve 
the set of all possible problems.

291
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,750
And so what human beings have been 
trying to do for the last forever is 

292
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:41,470
trying to figure out how to solve the 
problem of the set of all problems.

293
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,471
And we actually have some ideas.
One is playing to win the metagame and 

294
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,100
not the game.
That's one solution.

295
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:53,101
Another solution is go out into the 
unknown voluntarily and gather the 

296
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:55,420
information that lies there because that
continually updates you.

297
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,410
Um,

298
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,380
the other one is to make sacrifices.
And that was discovered in an articulate

299
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:15,381
form not very long ago.
And the idea of sacrifice is something 

300
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:15,381
like,
well,

301
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:18,300
you don't just have to solve the problem
of how do you survive in the present,

302
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,690
which is roughly the problem that 
animals are always trying to solve.

303
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,260
You have to solve the problem of how you
survive in the present,

304
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,780
given that you also have to survive next
week,

305
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:28,920
next month,
next year,

306
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,420
and among other people and answer that 
in part is the answer of sacrifice,

307
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:38,421
which is to give up something that you 
desperately want now that would even be 

308
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:42,141
useful right now so that you accrue more
benefit across a broader span of time.

309
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,810
A very,
very difficult lesson for animals to 

310
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,421
learn.
Animals have a terrible time learning 

311
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,341
that,
but even human have a terrible time 

312
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:55,251
doing it because there were some real 
intelligence in getting while the 

313
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,910
getting is good,
but it's a sub optimal strategy.

314
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,200
If you can stabilize the environment and
spread out your adaptive capability over

315
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:09,201
wider spans of time,
while so much the better you get what 

316
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:12,531
you need now and you get what you need 
later and you get what you want and so 

317
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,640
does your family and other people at 
much better solution.

318
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:18,270
But that requires.
It requires precisely sacrificed because

319
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:21,030
it requires sacrificing the present for 
the future.

320
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,110
And that idea of sacrifice emerged like 
all of our ideas,

321
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:28,440
first in in action,
in acting these things out,

322
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,680
and then conceptualizing them with our 
bodies like Indorama,

323
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,940
just the way that piaget described 
children first,

324
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,450
assimilating the structure of their 
parents' actions by imitating them 

325
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,100
rather than by breaking them down into 
systems of rules,

326
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,530
understanding the rules and 
incorporating the rules.

327
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,150
That isn't how we work,
react and figure things out in action.

328
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:52,770
Then we imitate our own actions.

329
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,770
And to imitate your own actions is to 
act yourself out or to act other people 

330
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,510
out.
You can do that without having explicit,

331
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:05,511
articulated knowledge and that's it's so
crucial to understand that because it 

332
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,040
it,
it explains great mystery,

333
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:13,041
which is how can we tell the stories 
that have meanings that are deeper than 

334
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,221
we know?
And the answer to that is we have 

335
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,710
information encoded in our behavior that
transcends our understanding well how 

336
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,960
well we're constantly modifying each 
other constantly and the world's 

337
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,090
constantly modifying us and there's no 
reason that wellbeing modified.

338
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:30,330
We should also be able to track how it 
is that we're being modified.

339
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,600
We have to figure that out afterwards 
and it's extraordinarily difficult to 

340
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,860
look at a whole culture or even a single
individual and to say,

341
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:39,900
well,
what is that person?

342
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:42,360
Or what is that societal structure?
It it.

343
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,480
It supersedes our conscious capacity for
representations were always playing 

344
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,480
catch up.

345
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,800
That doesn't mean that we don't act out 
things.

346
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:51,630
We think sometimes you know,
the,

347
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,990
the causal pathway can't go the other 
way because it can,

348
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,760
but more,
more frequently.

349
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:01,761
It's bottom up rather than top down,
which is how everything works in the 

350
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:04,080
biological world.
Animals do and have wisdom,

351
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:07,740
but they don't know what they do and 
they can articulate their wisdom,

352
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,800
so it's self evident that a process like
this must've occurred.

353
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,430
I mean,
I was talking about wolf dominance 

354
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,840
behaviors online the other day and 
somebody tweeted and said that it's the 

355
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,170
only captive wolves that dominate each 
other through aggression.

356
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,970
It isn't necessarily the most aggressive
males that are dominant in the wild.

357
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,990
And I thought,
well,

358
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,380
yes,
I know that that's what the wall has 

359
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,761
already documented among chimpanzees.
The thing that emerges as as appropriate

360
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,570
to lead and then to be imitated as 
leader isn't untrammeled aggression.

361
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,280
It's some process that is a kin to my 
interests and your interests matching 

362
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:58,660
over some period of time with all of us 
considered simultaneously,

363
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,050
right?
That's some equilibrated state of social

364
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:04,570
behavior embodied even in the behavior 
of wolves,

365
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:05,680
the behavior of rats,
who,

366
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,890
who knew how to play fairly.
The behavior of chimpanzees and 

367
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,981
certainly in our own behavior,
much more complex be in no small part 

368
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,810
because our social structures are much 
bigger than those of animals,

369
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,050
so therefore much more complex.
Robin Dunbar has indicated,

370
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,990
for example,
that one of the best predictors of brain

371
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:27,991
size predictors or correlates more 
likely what are the highest correlates 

372
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:30,280
at brain size,
especially at.

373
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,390
I think he only looked within primates,
is group size and that makes sense,

374
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:39,391
right?
Because the complexity of the social 

375
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:41,221
organization increases dramatically as 
the number of individuals involved 

376
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:42,730
increases,
and I wouldn't say it's group size,

377
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,470
brain size,
that determines groups.

378
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,380
How is it's brain size determines group 
size,

379
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:50,020
determines brain size,
determines group size in a loop,

380
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,040
and and many other factors are involved 
in expanding cortical representation as 

381
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,430
well.
So as far as I can tell,

382
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:01,420
there isn't anything contentious in 
those claims and it gives us,

383
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:06,690
gives us a basis out of which the 
archetypal stories can emerge and it 

384
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,840
explains why we can see revealed truth 
in them so to speak.

385
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:13,720
Because the truth was instantiated in 
the behavioral realm,

386
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:16,360
not in the conceptual realm and through 
the you know,

387
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:17,890
you,
you see this in your own life.

388
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:20,680
You Watch yourself and one day you go,
Aha,

389
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,110
that's what I've been up to this whole 
time.

390
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:25,030
That happens to people in therapy all 
the time.

391
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,790
Or you're dealing with some other person
and they tell you something.

392
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:32,791
It's like,
it's like the last piece fell into 

393
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:32,791
place.

394
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:32,791
He said,
Oh,

395
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:33,550
I had you completely wrong.
Now I get what you're up to.

396
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:38,080
And what's happened is my representation
has become more complete,

397
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:40,120
but it also matches your behavior 
better.

398
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,240
There's a concordance between what I've 
observed and what actually manifests 

399
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,111
itself and so while so for the 
derivation of of wisdom,

400
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:53,050
from the observation of behavior,
you do the same thing when you analyze a

401
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:58,051
shakespeare play,
you know Shakespeare play never 

402
00:22:58,051 --> 00:23:02,101
happened,
but Shakespeare extracted out patterns 

403
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:03,890
that happen all the time and if he 
hadn't extracted the out,

404
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:08,891
no one would watch the plays.
The plays are interesting precisely to 

405
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:11,560
the degree that the play is about 
something that's about you and something

406
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,050
that's about you and something that's 
about you.

407
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,200
It has to be something that's common to 
everyone and you watch the play and you 

408
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,890
partake in it through invitation.
Even though you're sitting down,

409
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,160
you partake in it through invitation and
then maybe later you go for coffee with 

410
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,160
your friends and say,
well,

411
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,800
what was that all about?

412
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,800
And that's your attempt to take the 
behavior wisdom that's coded in the 

413
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,810
story and make it articulate and we're 
doing that all the time.

414
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:39,811
Whenever you discuss a movie,
you do that and that's how educated 

415
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:39,910
people actually interact with 
literature,

416
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,470
right?
Because if you're uneducated,

417
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,560
roughly speaking,
you go see a movie and you just go it,

418
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,710
you never think about it as as something
that was produced.

419
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,980
You never think about it as a cultural 
entity and you never do that higher 

420
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,820
order analysis and when you're full,
your first encounter,

421
00:23:55,821 --> 00:24:00,821
the idea of even doing that,
you might be resistant to it because it 

422
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:01,940
seems in some sense to destroy some of 
the magic of that,

423
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,230
of that pure immersion in the form.
So,

424
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,240
but that doesn't mean that people who go
to movies and don't talk about them 

425
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,970
afterwards aren't learning anything.
Quite the contrary.

426
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,080
They're just learning.
They're learning using a very abstracted

427
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,090
form of imitation and then you might 
imagine you don't go to a movie,

428
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,380
go to 100 movies and you imitate 
something that's clean,

429
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,180
common across all the movies.
Well,

430
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:27,260
what's that?
Well,

431
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:32,261
that's an archetype.
The archetype is what's common across 

432
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:35,531
stories and so we're trying to get to 
the bottom of what's common across 

433
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:36,680
stores and this is the best I've been 
able to do.

434
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,850
It also maps quite nicely onto 
heidegger's representation of the world,

435
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:42,560
which is something I only found out 
later.

436
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,740
He has three domains of reality that 
correspond to this very,

437
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:50,060
very precisely,
and then Freud's conception is also very

438
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,460
similar.
Id Ego,

439
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:52,730
Superego,
right?

440
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:55,940
The end is the natural force within you,
positive and negative,

441
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:58,850
because Freud was smart.
He knew there was always that dichotomy.

442
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,530
Then the ego,
that's you,

443
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,900
the individual positive element,
negative element,

444
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,930
and the superego which controls you,
represses you inhibits you in civilized 

445
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:13,091
as you,
but is also can also be a complete 

446
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:13,091
tyrant.

447
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:16,420
And so part of the reason Freud's theory
obtained such purchase so rapidly was 

448
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
because it filled a it filled in a whole
and architect will hole that needed to 

449
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,531
be filled for psychotherapeutic 
practitioners who in some sense had 

450
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:30,311
taken the place of priests and ministers
and that Sorta then rabbis and that sort

451
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,720
of person.
So okay,

452
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,020
so that's the representation.
And then while we've talked about the 

453
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,380
representation of chaos,
and I would think about that,

454
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:46,250
and this is a radical thing to think.
It's sort of predicated on the idea that

455
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:51,251
what you confront in your in your 
experience is not so much the material 

456
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:54,860
world,
but potential as such.

457
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:59,861
It's the potential that you're 
constantly contending with that can 

458
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:03,011
destroy you and bring you down,
but also has has as part of its nature 

459
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,770
that which you can extract and use to 
build and grow and and we don't think of

460
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:12,860
ourselves as interacting with potential.

461
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,760
We think of ourselves as determined by a
material substrate,

462
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,560
but I don't think the idea that were 
determined by a material substrate is as

463
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,420
powerful an idea as the idea that we 
interact with potential and I also don't

464
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:31,421
think that the idea that were determined
by a material substrate is a more 

465
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:34,391
scientific idea.
Then the idea that we're interacting 

466
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:34,391
with potential.
Because I think that,

467
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,490
and I do this with hesitancy because 
anytime you delve into the quantum 

468
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,470
realm,
the hypothetical quantum realm to ground

469
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:44,490
your arguments,
doing something very dangerous,

470
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:49,491
but the quantum view of the world seems 
to be something like being as a field of

471
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:55,050
potential from which forms emerge.
It's something like that and some of the

472
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:57,570
physicists like wheeler,
for example,

473
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,720
believe that consciousness plays a key 
determining role in that whatever that 

474
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,430
role might be,
so it's not reasonable to think of these

475
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:10,110
ideas that somehow outside of the realm 
of scientific conjecture,

476
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,370
not,
not in the least,

477
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,700
especially because they can also be 
given a deep evolutionary grounding,

478
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:20,790
and that is why do we represent 
potential with assemble like this?

479
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Well,
it's because that's a great symbol for 

480
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,120
what lies outside our field of 
competence.

481
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:28,770
What is that?
Predators,

482
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,320
dangerous predators,
snakes,

483
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,230
raptors,
carnivores all amalgamated together in a

484
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:42,231
monster and the monster that well,
it's also the monster that even offers 

485
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:42,990
fruit.
That's the story in in the.

486
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,670
In the story of good and evil.
Well,

487
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,450
or in the story of Adam and Eve,
well obviously because you always hunt 

488
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,020
for nourishment in the face of 
predation,

489
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,300
obviously always,

490
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,190
and that's a paradox,
but it's a paradox that's embedded in 

491
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,560
everything that you do.
The strange thing about these categories

492
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:09,561
is they're not exactly logical 
categories there paradoxical categories 

493
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:13,440
and those sorts of things aren't 
supposed to exist because generally the 

494
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,231
rule for a category is it can't contain 
itself and its opposite at the same 

495
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:20,071
time,
but if you've ever dealt with a person 

496
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:22,740
on an intimate basis,
you know perfectly well that the 

497
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,131
category indicated by their name 
contains many paradoxical elements and 

498
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:30,430
they might be paradoxical enough so you 
can't even live with the person,

499
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,820
right?
They're not homogenous enough so that 

500
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,041
you can plot a path forward with that 
entity to many things pulling both you 

501
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:43,501
and them apart,
so some things are a and only a and not 

502
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:48,721
b,
but some things are a and b at the same 

503
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:49,300
time and complex categories have that 
nature.

504
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,770
I showed you some of the representations
of Osiris and isis emerging from the 

505
00:28:58,341 --> 00:29:03,341
conjoined serpent and that's what this 
diagram represents.

506
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:04,700
To some degree.
It's,

507
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,900
well,
what does the Kale,

508
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:10,901
what does the pimp chaos of potential 
first differentiate itself into get to 

509
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,510
say,
well,

510
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:13,670
it differentiates itself into Yin and 
Yang.

511
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:19,030
That's the right way of thinking about 
differentiates itself into chaos and 

512
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,241
order and those and those are the father
and the mother of everything that comes 

513
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:26,621
after them.
That's one way of thinking about it and 

514
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:29,171
they each have their symbolic realms and
so I've listed some of the common 

515
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:30,320
symbols that are associated with these 
two realms.

516
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:35,321
Now it's a difficult thing to pin down 
because what one of the symbols mean has

517
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:39,830
to be defined in relationship to the 
other.

518
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:42,880
So for example,
if you think about the sky,

519
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,460
the earth in relationship to the sky,
it's easy to make the earth feminine and

520
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:49,480
the Sky Masculine.

521
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,510
That's a common symbolic representation,
but if you contrast the earth with the 

522
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,591
water,
then the water tends to be represented 

523
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:01,471
as feminine and the Earth is masculine 
and so the symbolic representations can 

524
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:06,580
shift depending on the literary context.
Let's say the broader literary context,

525
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,410
and that means you can't just do a one 
to one mapping of the symbolic entity on

526
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,860
onto the underlying,
onto the underlying archetypal 

527
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,341
structure.
You have to be attentive to context and 

528
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:20,341
nuance.
Of course,

529
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:21,790
because we're talking about literature,
you know,

530
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:26,791
it's not like you can use a dictionary 
of symbols to get your way through 

531
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,290
something as complex as Shakespeare,
but you can see,

532
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,380
you can see the underlying patterns and 
use them.

533
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:34,720
Especially I think if you know the 
fundamental map.

534
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:39,721
But anyway,
so here are the more common symbolic 

535
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:41,800
representations.
A chaos transforms itself into the great

536
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:43,420
mother.
That's the queen,

537
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,000
can be the evil queen or the queen.

538
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It can be the fairy godmother or the 
queen that provides the poisoned apple 

539
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,310
to snow white or those or the queen that
locks the prince.

540
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,150
What's his name?
I don't remember the prince in sleeping 

541
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:00,190
beauty and the dungeon and tries to 
destroy him.

542
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,700
The queen them out.
We've talked about time out.

543
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,220
Um,
the material world,

544
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,920
material matter,
mother,

545
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,490
right?
So the material world is the mother of 

546
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:14,490
all things and matter.
His mother,

547
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,350
the land of the dead,
dark water,

548
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,180
unexplored territory,
nature,

549
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,460
mother nature.
Obviously the night sky,

550
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,310
contrast it against the day sky,
Isis,

551
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:25,780
queen of the underworld,
the womb,

552
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:27,970
the forest,
barbarian lands,

553
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:31,510
anomalous occurrences in the grave.
And the great father,

554
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,600
the king,
the emperor APP,

555
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,620
sue and tie a matte look together as we 
discussed in the Mesopotamian creation 

556
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,170
myth,
the ancestral spirits,

557
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:43,990
the family,
the city explored territory culture,

558
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,480
the day sky,
oh Cyrus God,

559
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:48,610
the father,
the village,

560
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:50,170
the nation,
the predictable,

561
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:55,260
the monument stone,
anything that's built in stone to last 

562
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,860
is this representation of the great 
father.

563
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,040
That's why there were monolithic 
religion spread across the northern 

564
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,510
hemisphere for thousands and thousands 
of years.

565
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,750
Those people were building things and 
carving things in stone to make 

566
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,060
memories.
That's what their monuments were for,

567
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:15,061
to bring the past into the present and 
future on a permanent basis and try to 

568
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:19,420
instantiate something solid that 
everyone could stand apart.

569
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,700
Well,
sometimes solid isn't what you need.

570
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:23,950
Sometimes what you need is fluid and 
liquid,

571
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,540
but the solidity is there to give you 
something to stand on even though it can

572
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:33,541
become something arid and dry.
You see in the story of exodus is Moses 

573
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,470
is a master of water.
And the Pharaoh is,

574
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,660
uh,
is the king of desert stone.

575
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:42,661
Roughly speaking in the and the Egypt,
Egypt is portrayed as a tyranny because 

576
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:48,050
it's nothing but dry stone and Moses 
brings water to that.

577
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:53,051
That's chaos.
That's partly the Red Sea story and 

578
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:55,781
partly Moses ability to to get water out
of rocks and not and when that's 

579
00:32:55,881 --> 00:33:00,881
necessary and part of the reason that 
he's found to begin with floating on 

580
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:04,031
water when he's an infant,
which is also something that almost 

581
00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:04,031
killed him,
right?

582
00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:07,570
Because while you don't want to put your
infant in a basket of rushes and put 

583
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,971
them to float on the water,
so that's a brief overview of the manner

584
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:17,171
in which images and stories can be used 
to represent the first division of this 

585
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:20,390
underlying reality.
You know nothing.

586
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,270
What do you do?
You establish a center,

587
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,080
you explore from the center.
It's a domain of safety and that's 

588
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,640
surrounded by the unknown.
So and that's what children do.

589
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:34,130
We already know this.
If you watch how children explore,

590
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:39,310
it's more evident if you look at 
children who are somewhat inhibited 

591
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,420
because really extroverted and 
emotionally stable children,

592
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:43,550
they'll just explore.
They will recede,

593
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:48,130
but children that are sort of balanced 
in their emotional response badge,

594
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,140
do you bring a 18 month old to a new 
playground?

595
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,770
All mothers standing there,
she's the pillar at the center of the 

596
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,691
world around her is explored territory 
and the reason this explored is because 

597
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:05,330
the child knows how to interact with the
mother and so one thing you want to know

598
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:08,360
about kids is you can have multiple 
caregivers for your kids.

599
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,940
You can have a nanny,
you can put them in daycare,

600
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,570
but they do not like having their 
primary caregiver switched.

601
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:20,050
It's like it's like everything 
transforms when that happens and it 

602
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,651
destabilizes been badly.
So if you're going to have other people 

603
00:34:23,651 --> 00:34:26,501
take care of your kids,
it's better that it's the same other 

604
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:27,290
person.
Well obviously,

605
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:32,291
I mean they're going to form an intimate
and loving relationship with them with 

606
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:34,400
any luck and if that disappears,
it's like a death,

607
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,700
but it's worse than that in some sense 
or or the reason that the death is bad 

608
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,610
because the child's conceptual world,
they're familiar world familiar family,

609
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,360
they're familiar world collapses,
so children hate that.

610
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,940
Now they can bond to multiple people.
That's not a problem,

611
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,210
but they do not like having their 
caregivers shifted because that defines 

612
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,931
their territory,
so the child is adapted to the mother's 

613
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,160
presence and has been ever since birth,
if everything's gone well,

614
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,170
so it's a place of security and 
stability,

615
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,810
partly because the child knows how to 
act around the mother,

616
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:11,050
but also partly because if the child 
encounters anything that he or she 

617
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,980
doesn't understand well in the presence 
of mother,

618
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,160
the mother will instantly intervene to 
provide the knowledge necessary to 

619
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,860
encapsulate the unexpected occurrence.

620
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Okay,
so the child is by the mother and the 

621
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,820
baby he's holding on and that gives him 
ventral contact.

622
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:26,630
It's sad.
It's.

623
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:28,430
It's comforting.
It's comforting.

624
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,310
It's produced is opiates.
It decreases pain.

625
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,640
It's directly comforting,
and so then the child is maybe they're 

626
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,030
shy and they're going to take a few 
looks at what's first and start to their

627
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:44,031
frozen clinging to something secure,
and then if nothing negative happens,

628
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:50,030
they start to relax.
Just like a rat that's been put into a 

629
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,490
new cage.
They start to relax and they'll start to

630
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:55,491
look and that's the first manifestations
of voluntary exploratory behavior and 

631
00:35:55,621 --> 00:36:00,621
maybe if there's other people around,
they'll look and smile and then they'll 

632
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:00,621
hide,
right,

633
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:02,040
and the smile is an invitation to play 
or interact,

634
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,290
but so it's.
It's a foray out into the world,

635
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:06,270
smile,
eye contact and hide.

636
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,360
Maybe they'll do that multiple times and
get a game going,

637
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,200
not establishes something stable going 
on between them and the stranger.

638
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,400
Does the stranger know how to play and 
then maybe they'll loosen up and they'll

639
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:22,401
start to explore and then they go out 
away from the mother and start 

640
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:24,690
interacting with the world until 
something happens that overwhelms the.

641
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,660
Then they'll run back,
get a hug,

642
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,690
maybe half asleep because maybe they 
processed enough and then you can 

643
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,201
encourage them to go back and so what 
they're doing is they have the flag 

644
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:39,150
planted on unknown territory.
That's mom the flag,

645
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,870
right?
They,

646
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:43,890
they circulate around there because it's
secure.

647
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Make forays outwards where the dragons 
are gathered what's of interest and if 

648
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,330
it's too much,
they run back and then they end.

649
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,980
The mom says it's okay.
No problem,

650
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:54,540
well you know,
or gives them a little,

651
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,580
you know,
rock or maybe feeds them something or 

652
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,230
and lets them have a little rest and 
then off you go play again.

653
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:06,230
Now they go again,
and so what the child is doing is 

654
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,841
continually moving out,
extending it's explored territory into 

655
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:12,891
the unknown,
just like the Star Trek voyagers and 

656
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:16,191
then moving back to security and then 
moving up farther and then moving back 

657
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:19,941
to security and hopefully at some point 
they carry with them their own security 

658
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:23,010
once they become competent,
like once you've incorporated all of the

659
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:27,120
competence of your parents,
you don't need to go back well,

660
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,790
and even if you do,
it isn't going to help you.

661
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,880
You've that.
You've transcended the security and 

662
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,370
that's what makes you an adult.
Hopefully that happens.

663
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,470
So.
So that's why the,

664
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,150
the hero archetype is the central human 
story.

665
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:43,840
It's because that's how we learn.
It's,

666
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,060
it's an images stick representation of 
the process by which we make sense out 

667
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,761
of the world.
So of course it's redemptive because by 

668
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:55,890
definition that's the pattern we use to 
expand our competence in the world.

669
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:00,890
How could it be anything other than 
redemptive and it's tied in with the 

670
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:01,860
here's how it's tied in with the idea of
sacrifice.

671
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,370
Every time you learn something 
especially painfully,

672
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:10,371
which really means you learned it,
there's a bunch of things that you 

673
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,360
already knew that you had to let go of 
because they're wrong and so there is no

674
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:17,361
learning without sacrifice,
and now that means is that there is no 

675
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:20,331
learning without the retooling of 
structures that you've already been 

676
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,971
using and that's because you actually 
have a complete map of the world always,

677
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,990
but it's low resolution.
It's low resolution,

678
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:33,620
and then if you go out there and into a 
particular area that you've only mapped 

679
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,971
in a low resolution way,
you'll learn that force you to update 

680
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:41,140
the low resolution representations and 
sometimes that can mean abandoning whole

681
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:44,980
pieces of it because they're just wrong.
You think this is like this.

682
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,110
You think your girlfriend is like your 
mother.

683
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Well,
you may find out that that's absolutely 

684
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,400
wrong,
and the degree to which you use this low

685
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,781
resolution map to map her,
you're going to experience nothing but 

686
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:58,150
trouble.
So in fact,

687
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:03,151
in all likelihood,
that's what you'll experience because 

688
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:03,151
your girlfriend is not your mother,

689
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,820
or at least she shouldn't be.

690
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,920
So when you go out and you encounter 
something new,

691
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:15,921
it always means the demolition of parts 
of you that are still uninformed and an 

692
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:20,630
incomplete.
And so there's a sacrificial element to 

693
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,361
exploration.
That's partly why people don't like to 

694
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,881
talk to.
People have ideas that are different 

695
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:25,890
than theirs because you might think,
well sure we differ.

696
00:39:25,891 --> 00:39:28,230
Why can't we just talk?
If you know things,

697
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,420
I don't all the better,
but no,

698
00:39:30,421 --> 00:39:35,421
if you know something,
I really don't know what's going to 

699
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:36,540
challenge something I already presumed 
and if it really challenges,

700
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:41,541
it will disintegrate and all do a little
trip into the underworld before I can 

701
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:44,400
read structure myself.
And if you really challenged me,

702
00:39:44,401 --> 00:39:49,350
it might be almost complete dissolution.
So you who wants that?

703
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,020
Well,
here's how you want that.

704
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:57,950
The only circumstance under which you 
will want that is if you know that the 

705
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,410
alternative is worse.
Continual small updates.

706
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,240
Hm.

707
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,260
Differentiate you and make you strong.
You shy away from that.

708
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:10,370
Your map stays low resolution and you 
make yourself weak because you're not.

709
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:16,090
You're not practicing that process of 
letting go and transforming and letting 

710
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,350
go and transforming because you want to 
become a master at that.

711
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,740
You don't want to be a master at 
guarding your territory even though 

712
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,791
that's extraordinarily useful.
You want to become a master of taking 

713
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:32,591
the walls apart and extending them and 
building them up and taking the walls 

714
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:35,621
apart and extending them and building 
them up and that because you'll never 

715
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:39,371
run out of utility for that and that can
mean that unknown becomes something 

716
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:43,511
that's your friend instead of your enemy
and that would be a wonderful thing 

717
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:45,830
because of course people respond to the 
unknown as if it's their terrible enemy.

718
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,480
It's like,
don't be so sure about that.

719
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,700
What you know might be your enemy.

720
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:55,180
What you don't yet know might be the 
best friend you have and it's highly 

721
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,740
probable because what do you know?
And there's an infinite number of things

722
00:40:57,741 --> 00:41:02,741
you don't know,
so you might as well make friends with 

723
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:04,871
them.
And then you also start to understand 

724
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:07,310
that you are precisely the thing that 
can move into the unknown,

725
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:12,460
as if it's welcoming and grow and 
develop as a consequence,

726
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:17,681
and that makes you a much different 
thing than the thing that has to be 

727
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:20,711
terrified of everything.
It doesn't understand you're just in a 

728
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,831
permanent state of existential horror 
under those conditions and you're 

729
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:27,701
dangerous to other people too,
especially if they don't agree with you 

730
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:31,030
as another way of representing it.
The dragon of chaos stands for the 

731
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,200
potential that surrounds us.
Inside of that,

732
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,950
there's the unknown.
They are knowing that you actually come 

733
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:38,950
into contact with,
right?

734
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,270
That's the unknown as it actually 
manifest itself in your world as 

735
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,720
something you don't understand,
instead of just the potential for that,

736
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:45,710
because we say,
look,

737
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,260
you know perfectly well that as you're 
sitting here,

738
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,110
there's all sorts of things you don't 
know everywhere,

739
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,720
but where are they?
Well,

740
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,720
they're not manifesting themselves at 
the moment.

741
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:58,940
They're only in potential,
but you could.

742
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,060
We could have a discussion that that 
became argumentative and then all of a 

743
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,931
sudden it would be as if emissaries of 
that unknown had entered the space and 

744
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:10,790
that's the unknown that's defined in 
relationship to what you know.

745
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,910
That's what you actually experienced.
Instead of it only being potential.

746
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,400
It's a tough thing to get because 
they're both unknown,

747
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,390
right?
You think,

748
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:22,391
well,
how can there be two different 

749
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:22,391
categories of unknown?
Well latent and manifest.

750
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:23,690
That's a good way of thinking about you 
know,

751
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:25,900
you in a relationship,
it's going stable,

752
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,660
but you know that sooner or later 
something will come up.

753
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,540
Okay,
op from where?

754
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,760
Why?
Up from?

755
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,080
From beneath?
Well,

756
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,850
what do you mean beneath?
While it's from.

757
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,510
It's from your complex,
the person you're in a relationship with

758
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:47,050
in,
in width is complicated and complex 

759
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:47,050
that's implicit in you.
It's,

760
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,940
it's inside your conceptual structure.
That's,

761
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,570
that's the way of looking at it now and 
then when there's a disagreement,

762
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,380
it will manifest itself and you know 
that you know that they're still trouble

763
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,050
brewing ahead.
Interrelationship always,

764
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,700
and that's part of what keeps them alive

765
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,220
was an interesting piece of empirical 
work done on this a while back,

766
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,090
so you might think,
well,

767
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,840
what is the optimal relationship look 
like in terms of positive and negative 

768
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:13,840
emotion?
You might say,

769
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,900
well,
Utopia,

770
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,380
nothing but positive interactions.
It's like no.

771
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:24,090
Now again,
you get people to code the interactions 

772
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,170
they have with your partner during the 
day,

773
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,250
you know,
you sample it,

774
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:30,730
you say,
was that interaction positive or 

775
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,411
negative?
And then what you're trying to do is 

776
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:32,411
predict the longevity of the 
relationship.

777
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:33,410
Okay,
so here's the data.

778
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,160
If it falls under five positive 
interactions to one negative 

779
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,520
interaction,
the relationship doesn't continue.

780
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,260
Fair enough.
Too much negative.

781
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:47,530
That's easy to understand.
If it exceeds 11 positive to one 

782
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:47,930
negative,
the relationship doesn't last.

783
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,800
Why?

784
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,930
New Challenge,
right?

785
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:54,730
What do you want from your partner?
Bless.

786
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:55,900
No,
no,

787
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:56,680
no.
You don't.

788
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:01,780
You want periods of peace punctuated by 
a good fight and that because that means

789
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:06,781
you respect them,
means you have something to offer each 

790
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:09,241
other and it means that you're both 
growing and so you don't want the fight 

791
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:10,690
to be too dramatic because,
well then you retreat.

792
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:15,691
You can't settle it,
but the person that you can completely 

793
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:15,850
map and who only does positive things 
for you,

794
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:17,800
it's like a.
You don't know that person,

795
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,680
but they're not communicating with you 
nor you with them.

796
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:25,860
Maybe they're just subordinating 
themselves to you or you to them and 

797
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,100
you're not growing.
You want someone who can.

798
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:30,280
It's a real relationship is a wrestling 
match.

799
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:35,281
It's a grappling,
grappling phenomena that you both 

800
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:35,340
emerged,
transformed from,

801
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,950
and that's what people want.
They don't want to push over.

802
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,050
Not Not unless there's something wrong 
with them,

803
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:45,730
and when narcissistic person who never 
wants to be challenged will want a 

804
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,990
partner who does nothing but deliver 
exactly what they're told to deliver,

805
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:52,950
but they will mistreat them beyond 
belief and perhaps deservedly so.

806
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:58,010
All right,
so here's some symbolic representations.

807
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:04,470
The two on the left are Jonah,
Jonah,

808
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:09,470
and the whale.
So the story of Jonah is an interesting 

809
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,350
one.
I'll just go over it very briefly.

810
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,020
There's a city and the city is full of 
people who are sinful.

811
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,490
What does that mean?
Well,

812
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:20,010
to sin is an archery term.
It means to miss the mark.

813
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:24,060
So these are people who aren't oriented 
properly and so the city is in a chaotic

814
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:26,440
state and God tells Jonah that he's 
gonna.

815
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,460
Go to that city and tell them just 
exactly what's up with them.

816
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:30,180
And Julie,
thanks.

817
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,320
No,
I'm not going to do that.

818
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:37,321
And why?
Well that doesn't require much 

819
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:40,701
explanation.
It's like how popular you are going to 

820
00:45:40,701 --> 00:45:42,771
be if you go to a city full of chaotic 
people and tell them why they're stupid 

821
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:44,490
and wrong.
It's Joanna,

822
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,060
thanks.
No,

823
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:50,061
I'm not going to do that.
I don't care if God's telling me to do 

824
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:50,061
it.

825
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:52,880
So his conscience is telling him to do 
it or his destiny is telling them to do 

826
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,211
it or,
or his orientation with higher morality 

827
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,030
is telling them to do it.
You can read it any way you want.

828
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,190
And so he thinks,
no,

829
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,440
I'm hopping on this boat and I'm getting
as far away from that city as I possibly

830
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:03,840
can.
And so he does that.

831
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:06,270
And then the storm comes up because God 
thinks,

832
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:08,430
no,
you're not getting away if I told you to

833
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:09,960
do something,
you're not getting away from it.

834
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,970
A storm comes up.
Well,

835
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:13,350
what does that mean?
Well,

836
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:18,351
it's easy.
Betray your destiny and see how long it 

837
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:24,530
takes you to be drowning in a storm.

838
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,200
It will happen immediately.
And of course it will,

839
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:33,201
because what?
What's calling you to be your best is 

840
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:33,900
exactly the thing that's pushing you 
forward,

841
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:36,360
to manifest yourself most fully in the 
world.

842
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,640
It's what you need.
You run away from that.

843
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,060
The boat's going to start to rock very,
very quickly.

844
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,350
Well,
you all know that.

845
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,160
You know that perfectly well.
It,

846
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:46,850
it,
it's hell.

847
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,860
All you have to do is not study for an 
exam that you know that's coming up to 

848
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,580
see everything start to the storm.
Water start to rise and everything start

849
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,820
to rock.
It's pretty bloody obvious.

850
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,520
So anyways,
he's on this boat and there's a storm.

851
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:04,970
And all of the people on the boat who 
who can't quite discriminate chaos from 

852
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:09,090
whether because they haven't 
differentiated the world to that degree,

853
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:09,690
thank.
Oh,

854
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,520
the boat wouldn't be about to be swamped
if we hadn't.

855
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:16,350
Some of us had done something stupid and
wrong,

856
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,720
and there's logic in that.
You know,

857
00:47:18,721 --> 00:47:23,721
you might think,
well God has nothing personal against 

858
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:24,600
you because of the storm,
so you're confusing levels of analysis,

859
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:26,640
but you've got to give these people some
credit.

860
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,980
It's like maybe they did do something 
stupid.

861
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,300
Maybe they didn't cop the damn boat 
properly.

862
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:34,150
Maybe the ropes aren't in as good as 
shape as they might be.

863
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:39,151
Maybe they weren't paying attention to 
the weather when they went out on the 

864
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:39,151
ocean,
you know?

865
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:43,800
Or maybe they haven't made peace with 
their brother and so their hearts are 

866
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,011
bent,
twisted out of shape so they don't make 

867
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:49,201
particularly good sailors.
It's like the idea that you encounter 

868
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:50,560
restoring because you're stupid and 
wrong is a really good idea.

869
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,250
Even though it's not an infinite 
applicability anyways.

870
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:57,370
They draw lots.
It's a primitive thing to do.

871
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,090
It's like,
wow,

872
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:59,650
it's one,
it's someone's fault.

873
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,610
We don't know who we're going to throw 
someone overboard,

874
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,830
the worst sinner,
obviously that's what God wants.

875
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:10,831
Some kind of sacrifice,
so they all draw lots and someone loses 

876
00:48:10,831 --> 00:48:10,930
and then Jonas stands up and says,
well,

877
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,600
sorry guys,
like I know that I've got a problem with

878
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:18,601
God at the moment so it's probably me.
You better throw me over and they don't 

879
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:22,351
really want to,
but he finally convinces them over Egos 

880
00:48:22,351 --> 00:48:23,230
and the storm settles.
Well,

881
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:28,231
you know,
sometimes if you're in a group of people

882
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:34,390
in an organization,
there is someone in the organization 

883
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,670
who's head is screwed on exactly 
straight and they know exactly why it is

884
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:41,671
and what they've done wrong and what 
puts them in that position and they are 

885
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:43,900
poisoning the entire enterprise and if 
you throw them overboard or better,

886
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:49,110
if they agreed voluntarily to leave,
then this storm will abate and 

887
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:49,210
everything will be okay.

888
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:54,780
So anyways,
they throw joe job over or Jonah 

889
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,510
overboard and a whale comes up and 
swallows them and takes them down to the

890
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:56,500
bottom of the ocean.
Well,

891
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,850
we already know what that means because 
we watched Pinocchio.

892
00:48:58,851 --> 00:49:03,851
It's like when God abandons you because 
you've abandoned your destiny and the 

893
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:09,691
storms come up,
the probability that you're going to be 

894
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:11,440
taken down to the,
to the depths is extraordinarily high,

895
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:13,390
and that happens in people's lives all 
the time.

896
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,850
Also down there,
Jonah repents.

897
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:21,300
Well,
what do you do when you were in not 

898
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,300
underworld,
where you've been there before,

899
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,901
when things fall apart on your friends 
have abandoned you and you're not as 

900
00:49:24,901 --> 00:49:27,661
popular as you could be.
You can't stand to look at yourself in 

901
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:27,661
the mirror into the underworld.
You go and you think,

902
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,620
Geez,
I've done a lot of things wrong.

903
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,080
You know,
maybe I should reconcile myself with the

904
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:33,490
world that I could get out of this.

905
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,960
We'll also.
That's what Jonah does.

906
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:35,710
He thinks,
all right,

907
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:38,830
I've got this destiny.
I better go do it.

908
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:43,831
God says,
so the whale spits them out onto the 

909
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:44,650
beach and off he goes to the city to 
tell them what's wrong.

910
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,010
Well,
that's what that represents,

911
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:49,540
that these symbols,
you know,

912
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,910
it's so cool.
The second one I really,

913
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:54,760
I really like.
It's so interesting because you see joan

914
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:57,610
and reemerging from the whale and he's 
got a halo around his head.

915
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,360
You say,
well,

916
00:49:58,361 --> 00:50:01,300
what's a halo?
Have you ever looked at a quarter?

917
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,550
Well,
think about a quarter.

918
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,930
A quarter is the moon and who's on the 
quarter?

919
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:13,170
The Queen,
the queen is surrounded by the halo of 

920
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,171
the Moon,
the Queens Queen of the Queen of the 

921
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:17,740
night gold coin.
That's the king's head on the sun.

922
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,370
That's the halo.
Well,

923
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,970
what comes out of the belly of the,
of the fish?

924
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,440
It's the illuminated human being.
It's the spirit of the illuminated human

925
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,280
being.
That's what that means.

926
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,320
Well,
what does that mean?

927
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:32,030
Well,
what else would come out of chaos,

928
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:32,600
you know,
if you,

929
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:35,360
if you fall apart and then you put 
yourself back together,

930
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:39,620
what is it that comes back out?
But at least you're in better shape than

931
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:40,820
you were before.
You know,

932
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:45,821
and then maybe you do that 20 times in 
your life or 50 times and you do it 

933
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:47,120
voluntarily.
Every time you do it,

934
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:51,140
you're more like the thing with the halo
and less like the thing that's,

935
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,810
you know,
being thrown overboard by your friends.

936
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,660
And then you see this representation on 
the right.

937
00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:58,820
This is a very complicated 
representation.

938
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:04,240
So in this one you see Christ who's 
carrying his cross with the sun behind 

939
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,211
them.
That's the halo that I was talking 

940
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:09,851
about.
He's the person who's voluntarily 

941
00:51:09,851 --> 00:51:10,670
accepted the necessity of death and 
renewal.

942
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,290
That's what the cross represents.

943
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,580
And so it's an,
it's an,

944
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,650
it's a,
what would you call it,

945
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,080
an abstracted representation of this,
uh,

946
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:21,920
further developed idea of this.
And then you see in the back,

947
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,470
this is a feminine symbol,
right?

948
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:26,480
It's a,
it's a symbol of birth.

949
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,820
And you'll see,
you'll understand more when I,

950
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:33,200
when I show you the symbols later,
this is the eternal opening in the world

951
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:37,010
from which new forms emerge.
It's the place from which babies emerge.

952
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:42,011
And you can tell that if you look 
carefully because you see all these 

953
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:44,411
little heads there with wings on them,
those are all spirits waiting to be 

954
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:46,550
born.
And so the hero emerges from the,

955
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:51,590
from the eternal feminine,
willing to die and suffer.

956
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:55,270
And in doing so,
this defeating the snake,

957
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,130
the snake's down there,
and the adversary at the same time.

958
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,250
While it's no wonder we don't understand
those images,

959
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:06,251
I mean there are so unbelievably rich 
that how could you possibly articulate 

960
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,460
them?
That's why they emerged in images,

961
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:12,461
stick form to begin with.
The artists get there before the 

962
00:52:12,461 --> 00:52:13,640
philosophers,
long before the philosophers,

963
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,990
the dramatists get there way before the 
artists even.

964
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,360
And so we figured it out,
we represented it in art and literature 

965
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,530
and music and drama.
And then we're on the cusp,

966
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:29,590
so to speak,
of understanding it in a fully 

967
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:30,080
articulated manner and not a moment too 
soon.

968
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,950
So what does it mean for this symbol to 
emerge from the feminine symbol,

969
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:39,050
let's say,
to emerge from chaos?

970
00:52:39,051 --> 00:52:40,850
Well,
this picture,

971
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,490
this is a picture of Venus,
the goddess of love,

972
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:48,670
right?
And so I cut this picture out of a 

973
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,951
larger picture and it's Venus 
manifesting yourself in a transcendent 

974
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:54,611
space in the sky in the same way that 
Christ did in the previous 

975
00:52:54,611 --> 00:52:57,701
representation.
And she has raised coming off her and 

976
00:52:57,701 --> 00:53:00,500
there's all these men who are nights 
kneeling in front of the image.

977
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,910
Well,
what does that mean?

978
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,200
Well,
it means that men use the image of 

979
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:08,200
female perfection to motivate 
themselves.

980
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,460
And that's exactly right.
That's precisely what they do.

981
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:15,461
You see that in the Tom Sawyer story.
So Tom Sawyer is about 12 years old and 

982
00:53:15,461 --> 00:53:18,500
he's still hanging around with his 
friends like huck Finn and this one girl

983
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:23,501
moves across the street,
becky and she comes out and he's struck 

984
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:24,020
by her for the first time in his life.
Something's changed.

985
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,010
And the first thing does is hot pop

986
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,490
on a picket fence and show off and 
balance in front of her.

987
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:29,970
And he's saying,
well,

988
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:31,110
look at me,
look at me.

989
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,530
I'm like the male bowerbird building 
something beautiful.

990
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:36,480
So the female will approve of it.
And it's,

991
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,910
it's motivation,
you know?

992
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:43,080
And that's something that I think modern
women don't really understand about men.

993
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:48,290
They don't understand that at least to 
the degree that males are uncorrupted 

994
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:50,610
and not better because of being 
rejected,

995
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:55,611
they're doing everything they can to 
kneel before the eternal image of the 

996
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:55,611
feminine

997
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,000
and try to make themselves worthy as the
chivalry story.

998
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,800
Right?
That's what you should encourage in your

999
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:07,300
partner so and so out of chaos emerges 
this first form.

1000
00:54:07,301 --> 00:54:12,301
It's the feminine form.
It's partly the form that represents 

1001
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:15,700
novelty as such,
so on one hand it's promise.

1002
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:20,701
On the other hand,
it's threat that you wouldn't believe 

1003
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:23,340
and I don't know because I don't know.
I don't understand the situation with 

1004
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,160
women as well as I understand the 
situation with men.

1005
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Obviously being a man,
but I don't know if women had any idea 

1006
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:33,520
how paralyzing they are to especially 
young men.

1007
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:39,940
A large,
very large number of my clinical 

1008
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,111
clients,
but also young men I've talked to in 

1009
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:44,911
general,
are absolutely terrified of women 

1010
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:48,360
because they're terrified of being 
rejected and the terror exists in 

1011
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,870
precise proportion to the attraction to 
the woman,

1012
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,630
which is a horrible paradoxical 
situation.

1013
00:54:52,631 --> 00:54:57,631
To be an insult and why men make such 
fools of themselves in front of women 

1014
00:54:57,641 --> 00:54:59,500
that they're attracted to,
it's because first of all,

1015
00:54:59,501 --> 00:55:04,501
they don't see the woman that they're 
attracted to because what the hell do 

1016
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,020
they know about her?
They don't see her as an individual.

1017
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,440
They see her as the manifestation of a 
judgmental ideal and then it's only in 

1018
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:15,601
establishing the relationship with the 
actual woman that they can start 

1019
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:18,640
differentiating between the judgmental 
ideal and the actual individual woman,

1020
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:22,390
and that also requires the sacrifice and
the sacrifice is

1021
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:28,740
you never can have an ideal woman,
so to have a relationship with any 

1022
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:33,951
woman,
you have to sacrifice the relationship 

1023
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:36,411
with the ideal woman and you have to see
the individual woman and separate her 

1024
00:55:37,241 --> 00:55:42,241
from the ideal and that's the same thing
that happens to the hero in sleeping 

1025
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:42,241
beauty,
right?

1026
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:46,771
He sees the evil queen who actually 
turns into the dragon of chaos and it's 

1027
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:49,300
not until he can,
he can defeat her,

1028
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:53,050
that he can establish a relationship 
with the actual princess.

1029
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:58,230
And that's exactly the case.
I had a wonderful my clients who ran 

1030
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,920
this men's group,
which was quite interesting.

1031
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:04,921
One of the things they had initiates do,
which was very intelligent,

1032
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,060
was to go out and ask 50 women in one 
day for their phone numbers.

1033
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,990
Why politely,
properly you don't want.

1034
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:13,930
It wasn't.
It wasn't a.

1035
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,920
It was a game,
but it wasn't a stupid game and the idea

1036
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:21,921
was get over your fear of rejection and 
how do you do that by encountering it 

1037
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,670
continually and continually

1038
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:28,840
and continually so that you're no longer
paralyzed by this.

1039
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,980
Here's,
I love this cartoon.

1040
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:40,190
This is from a underground comic for,
for people who smoke way too much 

1041
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:44,811
marijuana and it's called a.
These people are the fabulous furry 

1042
00:56:44,811 --> 00:56:47,700
freak brothers and they were created by 
Gilbert Shelton who was one of the first

1043
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:53,030
underground cartoonists and one of the 
least pathological ones with the best 

1044
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:57,201
sense of humor.
And he writes these stories about these 

1045
00:56:57,201 --> 00:56:57,201
stupid hippies.
Three of them,

1046
00:56:57,201 --> 00:57:01,071
the fabulous furry freak brothers.
You see two of them there and all they 

1047
00:57:01,071 --> 00:57:05,181
do is smoke pot and avoid responsibility
and and run away from the police and it.

1048
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:10,790
But,
but it's a nice satire and so and they 

1049
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:13,131
have this cat and the fat one fat Freddy
has the cat and they're too lazy to even

1050
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:19,221
give her the cat in name.
So it's fat Freddy's cat and it has its 

1051
00:57:19,221 --> 00:57:22,320
own adventure is mostly with an army of 
cockroaches that that lives inside.

1052
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,500
They're like horrible slummy hell hole 
of living place.

1053
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:29,700
And so anyways,
it's quite comical and so the.

1054
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,780
The hippies have stumbled across a small
fortune and stoned out of their minds on

1055
00:57:33,781 --> 00:57:38,781
cocaine.
They go out to set up utopia in the 

1056
00:57:38,781 --> 00:57:38,781
countryside.
They buy this terrible piece of property

1057
00:57:38,781 --> 00:57:42,210
but they're so diluted that they think 
it's like a mansion and they bring their

1058
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:44,400
cat and I don't know if you've ever had 
a cat,

1059
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:49,401
but cats don't like to move.
It really bugs them and so they're not 

1060
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:50,700
comfortable.
When you bring them to a new place,

1061
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:53,820
they're like the rat that's been taken 
out of its comfortable cage and put into

1062
00:57:53,821 --> 00:57:58,821
a new cage and the cat.
You put a cat in a new room and it 

1063
00:57:58,821 --> 00:58:02,000
depending on the cat obviously,
but generally they'll retreat into a 

1064
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,941
corner and be and now pityingly and be 
very unhappy for quite a substantial 

1065
00:58:04,941 --> 00:58:05,430
amount of time.

1066
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:09,120
And so the cartoonist actually map this 
out quite nicely.

1067
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:13,020
So the hippie takes the cat out of the 
box and says our new home,

1068
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,020
it's there out in the forest.
This is an urban cat.

1069
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:21,021
It's never been in the forest.
It doesn't know what the hell is up in 

1070
00:58:21,021 --> 00:58:21,450
the forest and the cat's looking rather 
dubiously and things.

1071
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:26,451
So this is the country.
And then it's put on the ground and it 

1072
00:58:26,451 --> 00:58:26,960
starts to slink as he says,
slink,

1073
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:30,420
slink out into the forest.
And that's actually what animals do.

1074
00:58:30,421 --> 00:58:31,730
It's,
it's a predator,

1075
00:58:31,731 --> 00:58:33,000
evasion,
crouch.

1076
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,010
And so if they're put in a new 
territory,

1077
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:40,011
they'll hunker down and freeze first and
then they'll slowly unfreeze and start 

1078
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:46,101
to explore.
They sniff first and then they'll start 

1079
00:58:46,101 --> 00:58:46,830
to move it.
But they do it like with trepidation and

1080
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:51,831
slowly and tried to hide it.
So that's what the cat is doing and the 

1081
00:58:51,831 --> 00:58:54,801
cat goes out into the unknown,
far enough sniffing and all of a sudden 

1082
00:58:54,801 --> 00:58:56,070
pow.
It goes underneath the house.

1083
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,990
It's like the toddler running back to 
the mother and the other,

1084
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,550
another hippie there.
Uh,

1085
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,620
I think that's fineas says,
where'd the cat disappeared?

1086
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,090
You now and the fats ready character 
says under the house.

1087
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:14,091
And then the cats onto there in the dark
with big eyes looking terrified saying 

1088
00:59:14,091 --> 00:59:15,510
you'd hide too if you'd smelled what I 
did.

1089
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:21,080
And so what it smelled was this thing 
that has like the head of a wolf and a 

1090
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,990
and antlers,

1091
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,820
like a deer in the tail of a skunk and 
the feet of a,

1092
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,410
like a chicken and horrible clause.
It's like,

1093
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,880
well,
what is that?

1094
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:34,180
Well,
it's a monstrous amalgam of that which 

1095
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,000
lurks and not known.
And so the cartoonists,

1096
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:37,070
the comedian got it perfect.
Said,

1097
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:37,880
well,
what is there?

1098
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:41,930
What is out in the unknown while you 
need one representation,

1099
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:47,530
not a thousand.
And so you take pieces of what's out 

1100
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,951
there that are relevant and you create a
single image out of that and you say,

1101
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:52,670
well,
this is what's out there.

1102
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,840
And you might say,
well,

1103
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:58,841
no such animal as that exists,
and that's actually incorrect.

1104
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,330
An animal,
very much animals,

1105
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,300
very much like that exists.
It's just a super ordinate,

1106
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,320
low resolution category.
It includes all those weird animals that

1107
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:11,420
might hurt you,
that are out in the forest.

1108
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,140
That's a useful category,
weird animals that might hurt you.

1109
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,320
And that's a real category.
You might say,

1110
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:23,321
well,
there's differentiated things within 

1111
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:23,321
that category.
It's like,

1112
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:25,820
yeah,
every category has that nature can still

1113
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:29,000
be further differentiated,
maybe not protons,

1114
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:34,150
you know,
they could even be differentiated with 

1115
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:36,311
regards to location at least.
So every category can be further 

1116
01:00:36,311 --> 01:00:37,520
differentiated.
The question is whether the category has

1117
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:40,880
some functional utility,
or at least that's one of its questions.

1118
01:00:40,881 --> 01:00:43,280
It's like that's the thing to be afraid 
of.

1119
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:44,270
Okay,
good.

1120
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,000
Now you got it.
This is the category of all things to be

1121
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:52,001
afraid of.
What do you do in response to that 

1122
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:52,001
category?
All right,

1123
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:53,480
so then we'd go to the next 
representation.

1124
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:59,650
This is Kelly gay ally,
Hindu goddess of destruction.

1125
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:06,170
She's the thing that you encounter.
She's the thing that makes things go 

1126
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,430
bump in the night.
What is that thing?

1127
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,980
Well,
let's take it apart a little bit because

1128
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:14,600
you can't see this image until you,
until you understand it,

1129
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:20,110
you wouldn't be able to if you're Hindu,
because you'd be in the culture and 

1130
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,740
you'd know what the image represented,
but some people in here might be Hindu,

1131
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:23,480
but not very many people.

1132
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:24,950
So.
Okay,

1133
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:27,830
so let's talk about this image.
It's horrifying image and so you.

1134
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:32,831
Here's how this image emerged.
It emerged in the imagination of people 

1135
01:01:32,831 --> 01:01:36,581
who were tormented for Millennia about 
just what the hell lurked out there in 

1136
01:01:36,581 --> 01:01:39,980
the unknown and some heart.
Some artists was seized by a revelation,

1137
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:42,530
a horrifying revelation of just what 
that was.

1138
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:43,670
Okay,
so what is it?

1139
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:44,990
Well,
first of all,

1140
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,860
she's in a,
a container of fire.

1141
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,350
Why fire?
Well,

1142
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:54,200
fire is useful and destructive,
right?

1143
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:58,940
And you also cannot look away from fire 
and so it's a really good symbol of that

1144
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:02,420
which you cannot look away from.
It's eternally meaningful.

1145
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:06,050
Fire is eternally meaningful.
Why we can't keep our hands off fire,

1146
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:11,080
right?
We're descendants of the first insane 

1147
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,100
ape who was so obsessed by fire that he 
couldn't stay away from,

1148
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,910
from a burning landscape and learned how
to master it.

1149
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,490
And he's our forefather not.
We're obsessed

1150
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,350
by fire.
It's magical to us.

1151
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,710
And it transforms.
It Burns and transformed.

1152
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,950
So from a symbolic perspective,
it's very useful.

1153
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,940
Useful source of,
of images.

1154
01:02:29,941 --> 01:02:31,740
Stick representation.
Okay.

1155
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,530
The fire's there.
And then inside the fire,

1156
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:37,410
these are skulls.
You see them all lined up there.

1157
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:41,970
So it's not just fire,
it's the fire of death that consumes.

1158
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,600
So that's where Kelly lives.
So that's fun to start with.

1159
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:50,050
And then there she is with her,
with her hair,

1160
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:55,250
hair on fire because her hair's on fire 
in case she isn't frightening enough 

1161
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:55,860
just because of where she lives,
their hair's on fire.

1162
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,880
And her head dresses made out of skulls.
So that's nice.

1163
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:02,370
And then she's like an insect like a 
spider.

1164
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:04,410
See,
she has all these legs and why is that?

1165
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,690
Because we don't really like insects and
you know,

1166
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:10,770
they set off our bug detectors and they 
can bite us and they're quite horrifying

1167
01:03:10,771 --> 01:03:15,771
and many people have spider phobias 
particularly and a and no wonder and 

1168
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:20,220
then she's got a weapon and one hand 
here and,

1169
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:25,580
but and then her,
you see she's eating something and you 

1170
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,550
see here her belly is concave.

1171
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,510
Well,
why?

1172
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,610
Well,
she's in a birth position.

1173
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:34,611
She's just given birth to this 
unfortunate character who happens to be 

1174
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:38,001
low.
She who she happens to be standing upon 

1175
01:03:38,001 --> 01:03:40,320
and he's disemboweled and she's eating 
him intestines first and that's Kelly.

1176
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:45,770
It's like that's horror.
It's a representation of horror and 

1177
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,780
death and destruction and 
transformation.

1178
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:52,620
It's feminine as well.
What do you do in the face of his mother

1179
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:57,621
nature?
That's another negative element of 

1180
01:03:57,621 --> 01:03:57,621
Mother Nature.
What do you do with something like this?

1181
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:02,780
Well,
that's the eternal question and the 

1182
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,631
answer is quite straightforward.
You make sacrifices to her and if you 

1183
01:04:04,631 --> 01:04:09,201
make the proper sacrifices,
then she turns into her beneficial 

1184
01:04:09,201 --> 01:04:10,610
counterpart and that's exactly what you 
do do in life.

1185
01:04:10,611 --> 01:04:15,611
If in the face of horror and death,
you make sacrifices so you transform the

1186
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:21,381
terrible destructive element of nature 
into that thing that continually offers 

1187
01:04:21,381 --> 01:04:23,520
you what you need and it's,
it's,

1188
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,960
it's of that discovery is one of 
unparalleled brilliance and you know we 

1189
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:30,030
don't get it.

1190
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,550
We think it's primitive.
It's and no wonder you know you,

1191
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:36,090
you can understand human sacrifice.
That sounds pretty primitive,

1192
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:37,470
man.
It's terrifying,

1193
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:40,610
but the idea of sacrifice,
it's inactive.

1194
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:45,630
The,
the idea itself is a conceptualization 

1195
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:48,111
of otter genius and why do you expect it
to come forward first in its perfect 

1196
01:04:48,111 --> 01:04:49,680
form,
it's not going to do that.

1197
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:54,681
It's going to come forward in perfectly 
and roughly and brutally and then 

1198
01:04:54,681 --> 01:04:57,540
hopefully be refined across time,
which is exactly what has happened.

1199
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:02,541
You see,
even in the biblical stories that 

1200
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:02,541
transition from human sacrifice,
sacrificed animal sacrifice,

1201
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:07,371
and then with us now it's the transition
from animal sacrifice to psychological 

1202
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:09,360
sacrifice because we're sophisticated 
enough to do that,

1203
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:14,780
we can let go of concepts and 
abstractions and things that were 

1204
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:17,890
holding onto that we should no longer 
hold onto and progress that manner.

1205
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,920
It's increasing,
articulated psychological 

1206
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,210
sophistication,
but we still make sacrifices and we hope

1207
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:30,211
that they'll be accepted and we hope 
that they're of high enough quality so 

1208
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:33,451
that they work well.
That's a representation of Diana.

1209
01:05:34,251 --> 01:05:36,650
You can think of Diana,
there's an opposite,

1210
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,800
a durga in Hinduism and she comes forth 
if you make the proper sacrifices to 

1211
01:05:42,891 --> 01:05:47,891
Kelly,
but I wanted to show you alternative 

1212
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:49,140
representations from different cultures 
of these archetypes forms.

1213
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:52,220
This is Diana Positive Feminine,
what?

1214
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,020
Multi breasted,
right?

1215
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:59,260
She's the thing that nourishes the world
and so that would be on one hand your 

1216
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,771
mother who obviously protects you from 
the terrible aspects of fire and danger,

1217
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:08,060
but also my nature conceptualized as the
positive feminine in general,

1218
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:15,260
the source of all fertility and all food
and all beings and all good things.

1219
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:17,420
Something that you want to have on your 
side,

1220
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:22,630
that's for sure,
and you might say if you acted 

1221
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:26,081
heroically properly and you played the 
metagame and not the game and you made 

1222
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:27,680
the proper sacrifices,
then you'd never encountered Kelly.

1223
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:31,160
You would only encounter her benevolent 
counterpart and so then you might say,

1224
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:32,390
well,
does she even exist?

1225
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:37,420
Then that's something that's very 
interesting is because the degree to 

1226
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:41,291
which the terrible part of the world 
manifests itself in your life is 

1227
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:45,140
proportionate to how insufficient you 
are and we don't know the full extent of

1228
01:06:45,141 --> 01:06:47,570
that.
If you got your act together completely,

1229
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,740
maybe all the suffering would disappear 
from your life or at least maybe all the

1230
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:56,741
unbearable suffering and maybe all the 
suffering or the unbearable suffering 

1231
01:06:56,741 --> 01:07:01,270
from the lives of people around you to 
and you already know that because there 

1232
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:05,471
are people that you'll go to in a crisis
that you can rely on and you know 

1233
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:09,221
they'll help you and you wonder what the
world would be like if you were like 

1234
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:09,680
that and everyone else was like that 
too.

1235
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:14,480
We'd have a lot fewer crises and the 
ones that we do have would be a lot more

1236
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:17,000
manageable and so when people say,
well,

1237
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:22,001
why is the world so rife with suffering?
One answer to that is because we're not 

1238
01:07:22,001 --> 01:07:26,981
yet what we could be,
and at least that's an answer that we 

1239
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:26,981
have some control over.
Right?

1240
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:29,630
You're not going to talk God out of 
making the world suffer.

1241
01:07:29,631 --> 01:07:34,631
That's for sure,
and you're not going to negotiate 

1242
01:07:34,631 --> 01:07:36,371
directly with Mother Nature,
but you might be able to put yourself 

1243
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:36,371
together a little bit and see if that 
works.

1244
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:41,171
At least it's under your control and God
only knows what the upper limit of that 

1245
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:43,980
might be.
Well,

1246
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:47,100
here's the decomposition of the of the 
fundamental archetype.

1247
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:51,210
The dragon of chaos differentiates on 
the one hand into the feminine.

1248
01:07:51,211 --> 01:07:54,780
That's the unknown in the feminine,
differentiates further into the negative

1249
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:59,781
feminine than the Positive Feminine.
The negative feminine is the reason for 

1250
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:01,960
which haunts.
It's the reason for.

1251
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:08,110
You know,
there's a whole group online called men 

1252
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:11,250
going their own way.
G T o w,

1253
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:14,370
that's a very interesting group to go 
study.

1254
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,010
There's lots them.
I don't know how many

1255
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,290
of them there are and most of them are 
older.

1256
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:23,291
Many of them are men who have been 
through a particularly horrifying 

1257
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:25,691
divorce for one reason or another and 
there they've had enough of women so 

1258
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:30,551
they stay.
Tell that young men that they're 

1259
01:08:30,551 --> 01:08:30,551
teaching never have a permanent 
relationship.

1260
01:08:30,551 --> 01:08:33,890
Never share your territory with a woman,
never share your possessions.

1261
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:38,720
Make sure you never lived together and 
don't stay with one long enough to enter

1262
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:43,721
a common law relationship because you 
will be stripped of everything that you 

1263
01:08:43,721 --> 01:08:43,721
have.
Well,

1264
01:08:43,721 --> 01:08:44,690
that's a hell of a thing to be telling 
people,

1265
01:08:44,691 --> 01:08:49,691
but what's happened is that the female 
has been manifested in their life only 

1266
01:08:49,691 --> 01:08:54,191
as the negative archetype and they've 
got that confused with all women and 

1267
01:08:54,191 --> 01:08:54,740
that's partly,
you know,

1268
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:57,420
you gotta ask yourself if you know the 
mythological stories.

1269
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,440
Maybe if you made the right sacrifices,
you wouldn't have so much trouble with 

1270
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:02,440
women.

1271
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,170
It's a,
it's a good question to ask yourself 

1272
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:06,170
first and,
and I would also say,

1273
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:10,920
you know,
if you're a woman who has trouble with 

1274
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:10,940
man or you're a man who has trouble with
women,

1275
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:16,030
it's not the women and it's not the man,
it's you because the women are telling 

1276
01:09:16,131 --> 01:09:19,490
you what's wrong with you and the men 
are telling you what's wrong with you.

1277
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:23,780
And if you don't listen then it's you.
It's either you are all men.

1278
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,520
Well that's easy.
It's all men.

1279
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:28,010
While that's certainly how it's played 
out in the world right now,

1280
01:09:28,011 --> 01:09:29,060
it's like,
no,

1281
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,210
it's not all men.
You can be by definition,

1282
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:35,600
by definition,
and it's not all women,

1283
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,090
that's for sure.
I don't want to have anything to do with

1284
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,400
women.
It's like you're a pathetic weasel.

1285
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,110
That's the same statement.

1286
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:49,450
Here's some lovely representations.
This is Mary from represented in,

1287
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,160
in,
in very different areas.

1288
01:09:51,161 --> 01:09:53,240
This is a very old witnesses about 
twelfth century.

1289
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:55,580
I absolutely love this image.
It's so profound.

1290
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,660
So what you see here is Mary as in as 
eternal mother of the infant.

1291
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:02,000
Okay,
she's sitting on the crescent moon here.

1292
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:05,210
She tweeted the night and underneath you
can't see this very well,

1293
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:10,211
but underneath the moon there is a.
there's a reptile and she's got a nice 

1294
01:10:10,211 --> 01:10:11,420
nicely underneath their feet and that 
Satan in part,

1295
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,230
which means protect your children from 
malevolent,

1296
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,820
from malevolence,
and it's the Predator.

1297
01:10:16,821 --> 01:10:21,821
And so what's the.
What's the proper orientation for 

1298
01:10:21,821 --> 01:10:25,330
mother?
Protect your infant from malevolent 

1299
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:25,330
predators,
obviously,

1300
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,140
right?
That's the holy image of the mother.

1301
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,540
So she's holding the infant safely in 
her arms.

1302
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:33,230
She's queen of the universe and she's 
coming out of this strange tunnel.

1303
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,330
It's the same.
These are called Amanda by the way.

1304
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,640
This tunnel,
and it's.

1305
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:40,130
It's actually,
this is going to be very strange,

1306
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:41,660
but I'm going to tell you what it is 
anyways.

1307
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:46,900
It's like a hole into the fabric of time
and space and it's revealing in the 

1308
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,950
image that's eternal.
That's outside of time and space and 

1309
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:52,520
it's outside of time and space because 
it recurs all the time.

1310
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,790
It never ages that it's,
it's,

1311
01:10:55,820 --> 01:11:00,820
it's,
it's an image that transcends 

1312
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:00,820
temporality.
Now you might say,

1313
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:00,820
well,
is it real?

1314
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:01,970
And the answer to that is,
well,

1315
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:05,780
it depends on what you mean by real.
Something that transcends temporality is

1316
01:11:05,781 --> 01:11:07,730
pretty damn real.
And so that's,

1317
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,080
that's what that,
that,

1318
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:14,150
that hole in the sky represents.
It also represents the place from which 

1319
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:14,150
all forms

1320
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:18,980
emerge.
So there's a biological component to it 

1321
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:18,980
too,
right?

1322
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:22,341
So it's as if the,
as if these divine figures are standing 

1323
01:11:22,341 --> 01:11:26,451
in front while,
I'll show you in a minute of what 

1324
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:28,071
they're standing in front of and you see
here the same thing with these little 

1325
01:11:28,071 --> 01:11:28,071
poteat.
That's what they're called,

1326
01:11:28,071 --> 01:11:31,380
sort of embedded in the fleshlight folds
law around here,

1327
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,450
and you see mary here holding the infant
again away from the terrible predator.

1328
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:39,330
That's the serpent of chaos down there 
in the,

1329
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:42,120
in the ocean and that's again,
what does that mean?

1330
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:44,040
Why would the servant of chaos be in the
ocean?

1331
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,830
Well,
how many of our ancestral infants do you

1332
01:11:46,831 --> 01:11:50,880
suppose were eaten by crocodiles at the 
waterhole and plenty,

1333
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:56,330
plenty of them,
and so that's something to be terrified 

1334
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,320
of and to take precautions against.
And so and then this image here,

1335
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:03,321
the older one,
see all these weird little figures in 

1336
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:03,321
the background here.

1337
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:05,440
You can't see them,
but they're musical instruments there.

1338
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:09,270
There are all sorts of archaic musical 
instruments and so here's,

1339
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:14,300
here's what the image means.
It means the potential from which this 

1340
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:17,190
figure is emerging is like a musical 
construction.

1341
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:21,150
So it's like a symphony.
It's this pattern layer.

1342
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:26,480
It's patterns layer upon layers of 
harmonious patterns that make up being 

1343
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,040
and out of that emerges this image and 
that's what that image represents and 

1344
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,541
that's what music represents.
It represents this pattern potential 

1345
01:12:35,541 --> 01:12:35,940
that we're constantly interacting with.
It's deeply,

1346
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:38,760
deeply meaningful.
That's why we love music so much.

1347
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,870
I've got a that's an absolute work of 
genius to put those two things together.

1348
01:12:42,871 --> 01:12:43,820
It's,
it's,

1349
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:46,330
it's remarkable,
remarkable image.

1350
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:47,590
So

1351
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,250
well,
let's stop there and we'll meet again in

1352
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:01,730
15 minutes and then this.
So that's the positive feminine on the 

1353
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:05,841
left and then on the right,
that's the Gorgon and that's the thing 

1354
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:07,020
that fills you with terror.
When you look at it,

1355
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:10,320
there's another representation of the 
positive feminine.

1356
01:13:10,321 --> 01:13:13,260
It's another representation of Mary.
There are representations very much like

1357
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:18,261
this.
If I assist with horace on your lap and 

1358
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:18,440
people often consider those precursors 
there Egypt,

1359
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:24,050
Egyptian statues,
precursors to the Christian iconography 

1360
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:27,530
and well,
I suppose in some sense they are in so 

1361
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,270
far as they predated them in time,
but the fundamental issue is that,

1362
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:36,380
well,
that this image has to be held up as 

1363
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:36,890
transcendent,
and by that I mean it's,

1364
01:13:36,891 --> 01:13:41,891
it's got to be.
It's an image that's got to be at the 

1365
01:13:41,891 --> 01:13:43,851
basis of a value structure that actually
works in so far as there's going to be 

1366
01:13:43,851 --> 01:13:47,841
human beings because there aren't any 
human beings without the infinite and 

1367
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:51,351
the mother,
and so if that's not held up as a as an 

1368
01:13:51,351 --> 01:13:54,231
image of ultimate value,
then everything falls apart and it's 

1369
01:13:54,231 --> 01:13:55,230
something our culture does 
extraordinarily badly.

1370
01:13:55,740 --> 01:14:00,740
I had a client recently admit to me and 
ashamed tones that she wanted to have 

1371
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:01,560
children.
I thought.

1372
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,370
I said,
well,

1373
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:04,860
you don't have to be ashamed of that.
Especially not if you're talking to me.

1374
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:05,370
And she said,
oh,

1375
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:08,460
that's such a relief because I can't 
talk to anyone about it at work.

1376
01:14:08,461 --> 01:14:10,230
They seem to think that it's,
you know,

1377
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:12,070
degrading thought that

1378
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:17,070
you can hardly diagnosed.
The culture is more pathological than 

1379
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:20,970
then that that's so appalling and it's 
so hard is one of the things I really 

1380
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:23,320
feel badly for young women because 
they're not guided through this with any

1381
01:14:23,321 --> 01:14:26,140
sense whatsoever.
And I'll tell you what my experience has

1382
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:29,110
been working with women and you can take
this for what it's worth.

1383
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:34,770
And,
and I've worked with women who have 

1384
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:34,770
achieved the highest levels of their 
profession.

1385
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,820
I don't mean just in academia,
but in a number of different fields.

1386
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:40,270
This is what happens will we'll take the
typical woman,

1387
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,210
conservative woman because they're more 
typical conscientious,

1388
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:46,480
not particularly open.
So they're there due to fool people,

1389
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:51,510
you know,
their existing within the structures of 

1390
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:51,760
their society.
So I'll take female lawyers is a classic

1391
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:53,620
example.
So they're very good at high school,

1392
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:58,770
very hardworking,
very intelligent but very but very 

1393
01:14:58,770 --> 01:14:59,080
beautiful and often rather agreeable.

1394
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,860
And that's important because it means to
some degree that they want to please and

1395
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:07,861
they'll do what they're told.
And so part of the reason I think that 

1396
01:15:07,861 --> 01:15:07,900
women are outperforming men in,
in elementary,

1397
01:15:07,901 --> 01:15:12,901
junior high school,
high school and university is because 

1398
01:15:12,901 --> 01:15:15,061
they're more likely to be obedient.
And I know that to some degree because 

1399
01:15:15,061 --> 01:15:18,541
we did analysis of students in Quebec 
and found out that one thing that 

1400
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:22,441
predicted grades over and above 
intelligence and conscientiousness was 

1401
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:26,401
agreeable nus.
And agreeable people got better grades 

1402
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:26,710
than their Iq and conscientiousness 
would predict,

1403
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,840
and that's particularly negative for 
men.

1404
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:33,841
So imagine this is what's happening.
So you're a borderline student and 

1405
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:37,600
you're also a bit rebellious and anti 
social.

1406
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,680
I'm going to fail you like you're right 
on the cusp.

1407
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,400
Don't like you much.
You fail.

1408
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:46,720
You have exactly the same grade profile,
but I like you tick,

1409
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:48,190
you move ahead,
you don't.

1410
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:53,850
And so one of the things that's dividing
men from women as they progress through 

1411
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,330
school is the degree to which they 
agreeable.

1412
01:15:55,540 --> 01:16:00,540
Now that works out to some degree for 
women in so far as the agreeableness 

1413
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:04,861
moves them forward,
but they encountered the negative 

1414
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:04,861
elements of being agreeable later in 
their careers.

1415
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:09,330
Anyways,
there are women are very good in high 

1416
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:09,340
school.
Then they go to college.

1417
01:16:09,341 --> 01:16:11,800
They're very good in college.
They nailed their damn grades.

1418
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:16,801
They do their studying,
they get their a's and they had the ace 

1419
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:17,410
their set,
so they're smart too.

1420
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,810
Then they go off to do their articling 
and they're really,

1421
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:24,811
really good at it and then they get 
offered an associate position and 

1422
01:16:24,811 --> 01:16:24,811
they're really,
really good.

1423
01:16:24,811 --> 01:16:29,011
At it and then by the time they're 30 
they make partner and let's say they're 

1424
01:16:29,011 --> 01:16:29,710
in high pressure,
high paying jobs,

1425
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,540
$250,000
a year.

1426
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:32,770
$300,000
a year.

1427
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:34,630
$500 an hour.
Okay.

1428
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,950
What's your life like?
You work all the time,

1429
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,590
period.
Seventy hours a week,

1430
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:46,591
75 hours a week,
flat out and you don't get to make any 

1431
01:16:46,591 --> 01:16:49,540
mistakes and if your client calls you at
three in the morning on Monday,

1432
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,600
on Sunday you say,
I'm really glad to hear you hear from 

1433
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,021
you because if you don't,
there's some hot law firm in New York 

1434
01:16:58,021 --> 01:16:59,740
that'll take your client from you at a 
moment's notice and the client is paying

1435
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:04,741
you whatever the firm.
Seven hundred and $50 an hour of which 

1436
01:17:04,741 --> 01:17:08,641
maybe you get 3:50
and what they want is an answer about 

1437
01:17:08,641 --> 01:17:08,950
something really complicated right?
Bloody now.

1438
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:14,530
And you can say all you want about the 
fact that women have a difficult time 

1439
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,500
with that because it's a male dominant.
Patriarchy new.

1440
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:21,580
Any female lawyer who's hit 30 and his 
partner that has any sense at all knows 

1441
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:21,800
that's complete bloody rubbish.

1442
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,870
It's market determined right to the 
core.

1443
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,720
What happens to the women when they're 
in their thirties?

1444
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:30,830
They all leave the high end law firms.
Why?

1445
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:34,880
Because who in their right mind would 
want to live like that?

1446
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,470
That's the issue,
right?

1447
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:40,190
Once you make about $60,000
a year for your family,

1448
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:45,191
but let's say for you personally,
additional income makes zero has zero 

1449
01:17:45,191 --> 01:17:47,600
impact on your quality of life.
Zero.

1450
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:51,080
So why work 80 hours a week while men 
will do it?

1451
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,880
Some men,
very few,

1452
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:58,300
a handful of hyper competitive men who 
are obsessed with hitting the pinnacle 

1453
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:01,940
of the given dominance hierarchy there 
in will happily work 80 hours a week and

1454
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:04,610
they'll forgo everything else.
Relationships,

1455
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:08,420
family,
children way in the second category,

1456
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:13,630
and so those men are often very 
difficult to live with too because 

1457
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:16,331
they're so obsessed with their career.
It's hard to have a relationship with 

1458
01:18:16,331 --> 01:18:17,150
them and maybe they don't have much of a
relationship with their kids,

1459
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:18,860
but they're damn good at what they do.

1460
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:23,860
And part of that is is they're smart and
disciplined and they'll work nonstop all

1461
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:29,171
the time.
It's like an obsession and that's the 

1462
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,841
sort of people who run things.
Those are the people who run things 

1463
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:33,410
while they're often also disagreeable to
because you want to.

1464
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:36,410
You wrote a manage people really,
they're not going to like you,

1465
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:39,140
you know when it's not an easy thing to 
not be liked.

1466
01:18:39,141 --> 01:18:42,350
And actually if you're an agreeable 
person and women are more agreeable than

1467
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:44,660
men,
it's quite painful to be disliked.

1468
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:47,180
But if you're in a managerial and 
executive position,

1469
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:50,420
the probability that people are going to
like you is quite low.

1470
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,220
Now,
if you're a real son of a bitch,

1471
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:54,230
then they're going to dislike you more.
But it's.

1472
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:59,231
It's those sit in those positions are 
very stressful partly because of the 

1473
01:18:59,231 --> 01:19:00,800
interpersonal dynamics and they're also 
incredibly,

1474
01:19:00,801 --> 01:19:02,390
incredibly competitive.

1475
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,410
So the women hit that at 30 and they're 
completely qualified in the law.

1476
01:19:06,411 --> 01:19:11,411
Firms are bloodied,
desperate to keep them because it's 

1477
01:19:11,411 --> 01:19:11,411
really hard to find highly qualified 
people,

1478
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,550
especially once you've put all that time
into training them,

1479
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,040
especially if they're also good at 
bringing in business.

1480
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:19,330
The law firm's trip over themselves to 
try to keep them account.

1481
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,400
The women think,
why in the world am I doing this?

1482
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:25,790
Why when the world would anyone in their
right mind do this?

1483
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,670
Especially because they're often married
by that point too,

1484
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:33,850
and generally they've married a husband 
who makes as much money or more than 

1485
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:35,630
them so they don't need the damn money,
and so they think,

1486
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,370
well,
there's more to life than this,

1487
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:39,380
which is exactly the right thing to 
think,

1488
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:44,500
and so they go and find a job that's 
nine to five and controllable so that 

1489
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,570
they can hire a nanny and have some kids
and have a life and it's like,

1490
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:50,000
yes,
that's the intelligent thing to do.

1491
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:53,090
So we've got things backwards in our 
culture.

1492
01:19:53,091 --> 01:19:56,300
We're thinking at least in part,
why aren't there more women in positions

1493
01:19:56,301 --> 01:19:58,370
of power?
Wrong question.

1494
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:04,090
The right question is why are there any 
minute all who want those positions of 

1495
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,230
power because it's not just positions of
power.

1496
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:08,610
You have to be such a knothead to think 
that,

1497
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:10,140
oh,
it's a position of power.

1498
01:20:10,141 --> 01:20:11,250
It's like,
sure,

1499
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:15,930
but it's a position of overwhelming 
responsibility and if you make mistakes,

1500
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,790
you're done.
Right?

1501
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:22,791
It's not like you occupy that position 
of power and everyone does what they're 

1502
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:23,790
told all the time in your life is easy.
It's like forget about that.

1503
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:27,930
People are on your case to do exactly 
the right thing all the time,

1504
01:20:27,931 --> 01:20:31,020
100 percent of the time and maybe you 
want that.

1505
01:20:31,021 --> 01:20:36,021
Maybe you don't.
So the what I don't know what people 

1506
01:20:36,021 --> 01:20:38,691
think is these people are all sitting in
their offices with their feet up on the 

1507
01:20:38,691 --> 01:20:38,691
desk,
smoking cigars,

1508
01:20:38,691 --> 01:20:39,630
no pressing the world.

1509
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:41,820
It's like that isn't how it works.
Those people,

1510
01:20:41,821 --> 01:20:46,200
they work flat out all the time.
So.

1511
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:48,960
And that's fine if that's what you want.
And some people are like that.

1512
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:50,490
They're hyper industrious people,
right?

1513
01:20:50,491 --> 01:20:53,160
From a trade perspective,
no matter where you put them,

1514
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,100
if you put them in a forest with an axe,
they just wander around,

1515
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,170
chopping down trees nonstop,
right?

1516
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:03,360
Because there it's built into them,
but if you want to have a balanced life 

1517
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,560
and you should want that,
you know,

1518
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:08,790
because the other thing you'll find,
and this is God's Gospel Truth,

1519
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:11,520
is that the older you get,
if you have any sense at all,

1520
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:13,800
the more important your family is to you
like that,

1521
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:18,850
that the utility of your career,
maybe that peaks around 35 or 40 and it 

1522
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:21,570
starts to decline pretty rapidly after 
that.

1523
01:21:21,571 --> 01:21:26,571
And what happens if you're fortunate,
you have someone in your life that you 

1524
01:21:26,571 --> 01:21:27,540
love,
that you've woven yourself together with

1525
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:32,541
and you have some kids so that you have 
something to do from the time you're 50 

1526
01:21:32,541 --> 01:21:32,670
till the time you're 80.

1527
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:36,510
And so it's a real mistake.
It's a barren future without children.

1528
01:21:36,511 --> 01:21:38,640
Man,
I can tell you that it's a real mistake.

1529
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:43,320
And so we do a terrible job of say,
putting that image forward and saying,

1530
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:43,920
well,
yeah,

1531
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:48,950
now you know,
because women have access to the birth 

1532
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:50,670
control pill now and can compete in the 
same domains as men.

1533
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:53,670
Roughly speaking,
there is a real practical problem here.

1534
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,900
It's partly an economic problem now 
because when I was roughly your age,

1535
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:03,080
it was still possible for a one income 
family to exist.

1536
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:09,740
Well,
you know that wages have been flat 

1537
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,230
except in the upper one percent since 
1973.

1538
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:11,730
Why?
Well,

1539
01:22:11,731 --> 01:22:16,731
it's easy.
What happens when you double the labor 

1540
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:16,731
force?
What happens?

1541
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:21,470
You have the value of labor.
So now we're in a situation where it 

1542
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:22,260
takes two people to make as much as one 
did before.

1543
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:27,500
So we went from a situation where 
women's career opportunities were 

1544
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:31,221
relatively limited to where they were 
relatively unlimited and there were two 

1545
01:22:31,221 --> 01:22:35,511
incomes to wear and so women could work 
to a situation where women have to work 

1546
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:39,000
and they only make half as much as they 
would have otherwise.

1547
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:40,920
And now we're going to go into a 
situation.

1548
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:46,040
This is the next step.
Whereas women will work because men 

1549
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,880
won't and that's what's coming now,
so we.

1550
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:52,881
There was an economics economist 
articles showing that 50 percent now of 

1551
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:57,150
of boys in school or having trouble with
their basic subjects and you look around

1552
01:22:57,151 --> 01:22:59,350
you and universities,
you can see this happening now.

1553
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:04,360
I've watched it over decades.
I would say 90 percent of the people in 

1554
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:07,180
my personality class are now women there
will a damn man left in university in 10

1555
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:12,181
years except in the stem fields and it's
a complete bloody catastrophe and it's a

1556
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:15,460
catastrophe for women because I don't 
know where the hell you're going to find

1557
01:23:15,461 --> 01:23:18,910
someone to,
to have to marry and have a family with.

1558
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,980
If this keeps happening.
So.

1559
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:24,250
And you think when you're 19 because 
you're so clueless when you're 19,

1560
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:25,390
you don't know a bloody thing.

1561
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,080
You think,
well,

1562
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:27,910
I'm not really sure I want children 
anyways.

1563
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:28,600
It's like,
oh yeah.

1564
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:31,510
You tell how well you've been educated.
Jesus,

1565
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,790
dismal,
dismal.

1566
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,790
Without fail.
I got to tell you,

1567
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:41,791
without fail,
I've watched women go through their 

1568
01:23:41,791 --> 01:23:41,791
professional careers,
many,

1569
01:23:41,791 --> 01:23:43,810
many of them.
It's a very rare woman who at the age of

1570
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:48,811
30,
doesn't consider having a child her 

1571
01:23:48,811 --> 01:23:49,960
primary desire and the ones that don't 
consider that.

1572
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:53,230
Generally in my observation,
there's something that isn't quite right

1573
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:55,870
in the way that they're constituted are 
looking at the world.

1574
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:58,390
Sometimes you get women who are truly 
non maternal,

1575
01:23:58,391 --> 01:24:03,391
you know by temperament there.
They have a masculine temporary 

1576
01:24:03,391 --> 01:24:03,391
disagreeable.
They're not.

1577
01:24:03,391 --> 01:24:05,050
They're not particularly compassionate.
They're not maternal.

1578
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,180
They don't really.
They're not that interested in kids.

1579
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,020
Fair enough,
man,

1580
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:13,200
but there aren't that many of them and 
there's plenty who will not admit to 

1581
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,340
themselves that that's what they most 
desperately want.

1582
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,860
Do you think women would be better off 
if they had earlier?

1583
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:27,710
Who knows?
Like it's like it really is a problem 

1584
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,190
now.
It's a really tough one.

1585
01:24:29,191 --> 01:24:31,410
I don't think anybody knows the answer 
to that because

1586
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:34,360
10,
11,

1587
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:37,090
then you can go and get a bachelor's and
master's.

1588
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:41,020
Well,
easy that way.

1589
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:44,860
Having the career first and then trying 
to raise young kids.

1590
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,140
Yeah,
I,

1591
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:51,170
I,
I can't answer that because I've seen 

1592
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,100
women do a good job of it both both ways
and you do get the odd woman who manages

1593
01:24:53,101 --> 01:24:55,040
a high powered career and kids,
but Jesus,

1594
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,040
those women,
man,

1595
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,930
like they,
they,

1596
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:02,960
they buy more powerful Mike Royce 
because it'll take 45 seconds to cook 

1597
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,620
the food instead of a minute,
and I'm not kidding.

1598
01:25:04,621 --> 01:25:06,150
It's like they're,
they're up at five.

1599
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,730
They exercise for half an hour.
They make breakfast,

1600
01:25:08,731 --> 01:25:10,470
they get their kids ready to work,
they go to work.

1601
01:25:10,471 --> 01:25:13,740
They worked 14 hours at 14 hour days,
flat bloody out.

1602
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:16,650
They come home and work for another two 
hours to get their kids organized.

1603
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:20,640
They have a nanny to help them out and 
then they work for two more hours before

1604
01:25:20,641 --> 01:25:25,641
they go to bed at like one and then 
they're up at five and they do that 

1605
01:25:25,641 --> 01:25:28,221
again and I'll tell you,
you better be tough if you're going to 

1606
01:25:28,221 --> 01:25:30,711
do that physically too,
because you'll just burn yourself to a 

1607
01:25:30,711 --> 01:25:30,711
crisp.

1608
01:25:30,711 --> 01:25:31,430
I've seen some women manage it,
you know,

1609
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:36,590
but they're like,
they're tough and they're rare because 

1610
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:39,510
that's a hell of a hell of a regimen and
then if anything goes wrong,

1611
01:25:39,511 --> 01:25:44,511
you know,
you have a sick kid or something like 

1612
01:25:44,511 --> 01:25:46,041
that,
or there's any sort of crisis in your 

1613
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:46,041
family,
it's just,

1614
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:49,940
you know,
it then it becomes too much and I don't 

1615
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:50,070
know the answer to that,
you know,

1616
01:25:50,071 --> 01:25:55,071
I mean,
the advantage women have is they live 

1617
01:25:55,071 --> 01:25:56,841
about eight years longer than men 
because testosterone kills men so well 

1618
01:25:58,921 --> 01:26:00,030
that,
that that's right.

1619
01:26:00,031 --> 01:26:02,970
They pay up front and gain on the,
on the,

1620
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:04,220
on,
in the long run.

1621
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:08,090
But how it isn't clear how our society 
should sort this out,

1622
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,550
we don't know.
And it's partly we don't know what to do

1623
01:26:10,551 --> 01:26:12,860
now that women have control over their 
reproductive function.

1624
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,510
It's a big mystery.
Yup.

1625
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:22,080
But I think from a practical,
the workforce later on,

1626
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:27,710
competition with people and that's 
always.

1627
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:33,960
People are always hiring joggers because
they'll have lots of.

1628
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:37,160
Yup.
Yes.

1629
01:26:37,161 --> 01:26:38,840
Well,
and the thing is young,

1630
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:41,120
stupid people have the advantage of 
being young,

1631
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:47,050
middle aged,
stupid people have the disadvantage of 

1632
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:49,391
being middle aged and so if you're going
to hire a young stupid person or a 

1633
01:26:49,391 --> 01:26:49,910
middle aged stupid person,
you'll go for the young,

1634
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:51,830
stupid person.
And I'm stupid.

1635
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:52,430
I mean,
you know.

1636
01:26:52,431 --> 01:26:55,040
No,
not I'm being sarcastic obviously,

1637
01:26:55,041 --> 01:27:00,041
but I mean without,
without experience and just getting 

1638
01:27:00,041 --> 01:27:01,010
started in the world,
you're much more likely to favor someone

1639
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:06,011
young because there's an instant 
explanation for their relative 

1640
01:27:06,011 --> 01:27:06,980
cluelessness and it's a problem,
you know,

1641
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,310
so.
So I don't know what the answer is,

1642
01:27:10,311 --> 01:27:15,311
but one,
one answer certainly is at least in 

1643
01:27:15,311 --> 01:27:18,281
part,
is to start letting young women know 

1644
01:27:18,281 --> 01:27:19,400
what being 30 and being female is like 
because.

1645
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:24,490
And also to disabuse them of the notion 
that there's something magical about a 

1646
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:24,490
career.

1647
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,370
First of all,
most people don't have careers,

1648
01:27:25,371 --> 01:27:30,371
man.
They have jobs and the reason you get 

1649
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:32,951
paid for a job is because you're being 
asked to do things you wouldn't do 

1650
01:27:32,951 --> 01:27:33,680
unless you were being paid.
And so it's not.

1651
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:37,520
It's not some,
not some utopia of cigar smoking.

1652
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:39,410
With your boots up on your desk,
that's for sure.

1653
01:27:39,411 --> 01:27:42,140
Not Hot that that would be such a utopia
to begin with.

1654
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,900
But alright,
so.

1655
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:50,350
So anyways,
so this is more differentiation of the 

1656
01:27:50,781 --> 01:27:53,930
archetype fundamentally.
So you see the dragon of chaos here,

1657
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:57,680
the potential manifesting itself into 
this ambivalent feminine figure.

1658
01:27:57,681 --> 01:28:00,750
Both both promise and threat.
And then I've,

1659
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:04,250
I've mapped this one out.
So the ambivalent feminine figure,

1660
01:28:04,251 --> 01:28:09,251
so sort of multi valence gives rise to 
the positive mother and then the 

1661
01:28:09,251 --> 01:28:10,970
positive mother gives birth to the hero 
and that's Hercules there.

1662
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:12,860
And this.
I like this image a lot.

1663
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:17,780
So Hercules is in this container so that
you can interpret that both as something

1664
01:28:17,781 --> 01:28:18,830
feminine,
the container,

1665
01:28:18,831 --> 01:28:21,560
but also as a representative of culture 
because it's a boat.

1666
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:24,530
It's floating on the chaotic ocean here.
So that's Hercules.

1667
01:28:24,531 --> 01:28:29,210
He asked to be in a container that 
sustains him in the murky water of chaos

1668
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:33,890
and you see he's going out into the 
unknown and he's got a lion skin on.

1669
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:39,170
And that's partly because one of the 
initiation rituals for,

1670
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:44,260
for young men,
when the reliance say in the Middle 

1671
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:44,260
East,
and that wasn't very long ago,

1672
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:47,951
was that you had to go out and kill a 
lion with a spear and with a bow and 

1673
01:28:47,951 --> 01:28:50,330
Arrow or something like that.
It's like that's impressive.

1674
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:53,060
All things considered.
I mean you really think about that for a

1675
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:58,061
minute.
You really want to go out and try to 

1676
01:28:58,061 --> 01:28:58,061
kill a lion with a stick.
It's like,

1677
01:28:58,061 --> 01:29:02,420
it probably.
You probably wouldn't be quite the same 

1678
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:02,420
after you did that.
That would be my guess.

1679
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:02,420
And

1680
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,000
so anyways,
so there's.

1681
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:08,001
Hercules has got his lion skin on and 
that shows that he's assimilated to the 

1682
01:29:08,001 --> 01:29:11,541
lion,
the dominant sort of animal and that 

1683
01:29:11,541 --> 01:29:11,541
he's also mastered it and he's got his 
bow and Arrow to.

1684
01:29:11,541 --> 01:29:13,680
So He's,
he's going to hit the target properly.

1685
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:18,681
He's not.
He's someone who doesn't sin because he 

1686
01:29:18,681 --> 01:29:20,751
can hit the center of the target and 
he's got this club which I really liked 

1687
01:29:20,751 --> 01:29:22,020
because it's covered with eyes,
just like Martech.

1688
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:23,520
Mr Damian Hero.
Well,

1689
01:29:23,521 --> 01:29:25,320
what do you want to do when you go out 
into the unknown,

1690
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,660
it's like arm yourself and pay 
attention,

1691
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:30,210
and so that's what you're trying to 
produce.

1692
01:29:30,211 --> 01:29:33,990
If you're a good mother is this figure 
that can go out into the unknown,

1693
01:29:33,991 --> 01:29:35,910
armed,
accurate,

1694
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:40,500
and able to pay attention and that's a 
hell of a thing to participate in.

1695
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:45,540
It's really fun.
I found having children incredibly 

1696
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:45,540
entertaining.

1697
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:48,150
It's ridiculously entertaining thing to 
do because for a bunch of reasons.

1698
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:52,710
One is that it's the only relationship 
you'll ever have in your life where you,

1699
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,800
where you actually have a chance of 
establishing something that's close to 

1700
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,740
perfect is with your kids because when 
they're delivered to you,

1701
01:29:58,741 --> 01:30:03,741
so to speak,
they're there in some sense they're 

1702
01:30:03,741 --> 01:30:05,580
perfect and your job is to maintain that
perfection.

1703
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:07,830
If you can,
and you do that by being a good parent,

1704
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,050
by being encouraging,
by being on their side,

1705
01:30:10,051 --> 01:30:15,051
by taking care of them,
and you can have an absolutely pristine 

1706
01:30:15,051 --> 01:30:19,251
relationship with the child.
That doesn't mean it's not full of 

1707
01:30:19,251 --> 01:30:19,251
trouble because it is,
but it's.

1708
01:30:19,251 --> 01:30:22,290
It can easily be the best relationship 
you'll ever have in your life,

1709
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:27,380
and in fact,
I think that's it can be the worst to 

1710
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,201
and you know,
sometimes you get unlucky in your child 

1711
01:30:30,201 --> 01:30:32,601
is sick mentally or physically and 
things fall apart and it's not your 

1712
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:33,810
fault,
but sometimes it is your fault,

1713
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,840
but it's a real gift and you have to 
play this game of protection and 

1714
01:30:39,451 --> 01:30:40,530
encouragement,
right?

1715
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,830
Protection and encouragement and get 
that dynamic right?

1716
01:30:43,831 --> 01:30:48,831
And then you build,
you help someone develop into something 

1717
01:30:48,831 --> 01:30:52,011
that's well exactly this,
that can take on the trouble of the 

1718
01:30:52,011 --> 01:30:53,520
world forthrightly and man,
that's what you want.

1719
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:56,790
That will make it worthwhile.
That's for sure.

1720
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:57,870
Now,
let's see.

1721
01:30:57,871 --> 01:30:59,640
I got to figure out where I want to go 
next.

1722
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:01,980
Well,
I've talked about the dragon fight,

1723
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:03,270
so I won't do that.
Oh yes.

1724
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:04,830
We might as well look at some of the,
the,

1725
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:08,750
we'll look at the same thing on the 
patriarchal side of the equation so that

1726
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:12,990
it's the great father and the great 
mother that emerge out of chaos.

1727
01:31:12,991 --> 01:31:14,350
Let's say that,
um,

1728
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:19,670
you can think about that over the 
evolutionary time span to because it's 

1729
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:22,860
the fundamental differentiation of life 
into one into two sexes,

1730
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:27,900
in the fundamental differentiation of 
being into two sexes that interact 

1731
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,150
creatively to produce,
to produce new being.

1732
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:35,590
It's very,
very deep motif and so the dragon of 

1733
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:38,370
chaos differentiates itself into the 
great farther and that's God the father.

1734
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:43,430
That's an image there and you see he's 
sitting in front of the sun and the sun 

1735
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:46,110
is behind him and the son is the thing 
that comes up out of the darkness in the

1736
01:31:46,111 --> 01:31:51,111
morning and then shines the light on 
everything with which we can see and 

1737
01:31:51,331 --> 01:31:53,760
then collapses again into the darkness 
at night.

1738
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,710
Right?
And so and at night it fights.

1739
01:31:55,711 --> 01:32:00,010
It's battle with the forces of darkness 
and chaos and emerges triumphant

1740
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,440
in the morning.
And that's why we have solar gods.

1741
01:32:02,441 --> 01:32:06,580
Because the highest day it is 
assimilated to the dominant,

1742
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:12,150
the dominant phenomena in the sky.
And well no wonder because the sun is 

1743
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:14,350
also what gives life and that provides 
light.

1744
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:19,380
And that does send the darkness away and
to notice that there's something 

1745
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:24,211
symbolically useful in now that you can 
also apply to the ideal person is 

1746
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:28,930
another active of conceptual metaphor,
genius and so behind God.

1747
01:32:28,931 --> 01:32:31,690
The father is the son,
son,

1748
01:32:31,691 --> 01:32:36,691
son,
and you see he's ruling over a walled 

1749
01:32:36,691 --> 01:32:40,351
city here.
And you can think about God the father 

1750
01:32:40,351 --> 01:32:41,800
here as the spirit of the walled city.
That's a good way of thinking about it.

1751
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,180
And so,
and why?

1752
01:32:43,181 --> 01:32:44,710
What is that spirit mean?
Well,

1753
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:49,090
forget about the supernatural element of
this or the transcendent element of it.

1754
01:32:49,091 --> 01:32:49,400
Even.

1755
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:55,650
How do you represent society?
Okay,

1756
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,010
you've got your walled city.
Okay,

1757
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:03,020
why is it wall?
That's the fundamental structure of a 

1758
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:03,110
city.
Why is it walled?

1759
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:08,120
Well,
because you have to have a border 

1760
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,651
between what's yours and what isn't.
So a border between your territory and 

1761
01:33:09,651 --> 01:33:09,651
outside world,
right?

1762
01:33:09,651 --> 01:33:11,850
Otherwise it's not delineated and 
defined.

1763
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:14,430
So the first thing is it's something 
that's walled off.

1764
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:17,760
It's a,
it's a defined space inside that there's

1765
01:33:17,761 --> 01:33:22,761
a dominance hierarchy.
It's a masculine dominance hierarchy 

1766
01:33:22,761 --> 01:33:23,550
because like chimps are fundamental 
dominance.

1767
01:33:23,551 --> 01:33:25,350
Hierarchy is masculine.
Okay?

1768
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:30,500
So the dominance hierarchy is what's the
same across all the men and then it's 

1769
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:31,620
more than that,
it's,

1770
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:37,540
it's what?
It's what's the same across all men in 

1771
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:41,361
so far as they found their position in 
the dominance hierarchy in so far as 

1772
01:33:41,361 --> 01:33:45,201
they're supporting it in so far as 
they're expanding it and in so far as 

1773
01:33:45,201 --> 01:33:48,000
they're trying to strive up it,
so it's averaged across that,

1774
01:33:48,001 --> 01:33:50,520
but then it's more than that because 
it's not just the man that lived.

1775
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:55,520
Now,
it's also the men that used to live and 

1776
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,350
the man that will live and you think,
what are you relating to when you relate

1777
01:33:58,351 --> 01:34:03,351
to other people,
while in part you're relating to the 

1778
01:34:03,351 --> 01:34:05,100
spirit of the man that will soon live 
and that's what a contract is,

1779
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:10,430
right?
You make a contract with the potential 

1780
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:12,360
society of the future.
It's embodied as a spirit and so you act

1781
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:17,310
appropriately in relationship to the 
patriarchal spirit because if you act in

1782
01:34:17,311 --> 01:34:22,311
accordance with that structure,
then you can extend your contractual 

1783
01:34:22,471 --> 01:34:24,720
relationship with other people across 
time.

1784
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:30,050
It's brilliant.
It's a brilliant conceptualization and 

1785
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:31,590
that's independent of any supernatural 
or transcendent reality.

1786
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:36,690
I'm not saying it exists in in necessary
opposition to such things.

1787
01:34:36,691 --> 01:34:41,691
I'm just saying that you don't have to 
introduce the idea of such things into 

1788
01:34:41,691 --> 01:34:43,980
the conceptualization in order to 
understand the symbolism.

1789
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:51,440
Now,
I think it's more complicated than that 

1790
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:51,540
because if you think about this thing as
a spirit,

1791
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,040
a spirit is an essential pattern of 
personality.

1792
01:34:56,041 --> 01:35:01,041
Let's call it that.
To the degree that you're a well 

1793
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:02,330
civilized representative of the social 
world,

1794
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:07,570
you are actually inhabited by that 
spirit and so what should happen as you 

1795
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:11,300
mature is that as you become older,
you shouldn't become God the father.

1796
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,960
That's what you're aiming at.
You want to embody that central spirit 

1797
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,371
that characterizes the civilization and 
that spirit is very complex and that's 

1798
01:35:21,371 --> 01:35:24,290
why you see often see it in relationship
with the representation of God,

1799
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:29,291
the son,
because the masculine spirit isn't the 

1800
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:32,231
spirit in general.
The spirit of civilization isn't 

1801
01:35:32,231 --> 01:35:32,390
exhausted by it's patriarchal 
representation.

1802
01:35:32,391 --> 01:35:35,030
That's the dogmatic form like Cyrus,
right?

1803
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:40,270
It's only the structure that has to be 
aligned with the thing that keeps the 

1804
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:40,270
structure alive.

1805
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,010
So you want to be both of those things 
at the same time,

1806
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:48,610
the embodiment of the civilization and 
the forest that transforms it and moves 

1807
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:50,730
it forward.
And that's what you're supposed to be be

1808
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:53,640
being taught.
That's what university is for.

1809
01:35:53,641 --> 01:35:55,250
Well,
that's what he used to be for now.

1810
01:35:55,251 --> 01:35:58,130
It's mostly there to produce politically
obsessed idiots.

1811
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:00,230
Oh,
anyways,

1812
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:03,050
sorry about that.
But it gets very frustrating.

1813
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:04,570
So.
Alright,

1814
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:06,200
so that you'll get the picture.
That's what.

1815
01:36:06,201 --> 01:36:08,140
That's what that represents.
That's what he's trying.

1816
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:13,210
That's,
that's an idea that's been trying to 

1817
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:15,311
emerge in the human imagination since 
the beginning of time and it's not a 

1818
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:17,420
trivial idea.
It's an unbelievably profound idea.

1819
01:36:17,421 --> 01:36:19,370
And it,
it differentiates too.

1820
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:24,580
And this is what makes it complicated.
What kind of relationship do you have 

1821
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:25,820
with your father,
your real father?

1822
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:27,470
So often ambivalent,
right?

1823
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:32,740
Because the earth,
there's an element of him that 

1824
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:32,740
encouraged you,
hopefully,

1825
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:33,410
because without the encouragement of 
your father,

1826
01:36:33,411 --> 01:36:35,480
man,
the world is a dismal place.

1827
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:40,430
It's very difficult to be a courageous 
person unless you have your father in,

1828
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,130
in body and spirit behind you.
It's very dear,

1829
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:48,160
demoralizing.
Like it really kills people not to have 

1830
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:48,800
their mother,
they just don't recover from that.

1831
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:50,020
But,
and,

1832
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:54,740
and I think people can recover from a 
fragmented father relationship,

1833
01:36:54,741 --> 01:36:59,741
but it's the next worst thing you know,
because if your father rejects you or 

1834
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:05,010
doesn't form a relationship with you,
it says if the spirit of civilization 

1835
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:07,940
has left you outside the walls as of 
little worth,

1836
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:10,400
it's very difficult for people to 
recover from that.

1837
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:15,730
So the father should be an encouraging 
forest but can be a tyrannical and 

1838
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:16,370
crushing force.
And so that's very,

1839
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:18,800
that's a very difficult thing to get 
right.

1840
01:37:18,801 --> 01:37:23,801
Partly because if you're my son,
then I should impose the highest 

1841
01:37:25,251 --> 01:37:30,251
standards of behavior on you and I 
should always be judging what you're 

1842
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:32,060
doing.
Why should be judging it with,

1843
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:35,600
with the aim of making the best in you 
come forward.

1844
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,960
But,
but getting that balance exactly right.

1845
01:37:38,961 --> 01:37:41,360
It's very difficult.
And so it's easy to,

1846
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,360
for a father to swing too much into 
judgment,

1847
01:37:44,361 --> 01:37:46,580
let's say.
And then of course mothers can play this

1848
01:37:46,581 --> 01:37:51,581
role to,
to swing too far into the domain of 

1849
01:37:51,581 --> 01:37:53,951
judgment and to be too harsh.
And to the degree that the father has 

1850
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:55,560
his own pathologies,
he's going to do that in perfectly,

1851
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:55,980
you know,

1852
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,980
he might be someone who's,
who's the father who devours his son 

1853
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:03,450
because he's jealous of the new 
possibility,

1854
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:06,600
the new potential that the struggle for,
for,

1855
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:11,710
uh,
attention and love from the mother or 

1856
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:14,091
from the other children in the family.
There's all sorts of things that can go 

1857
01:38:14,091 --> 01:38:16,560
terribly wrong.
So that's the farther as wise king.

1858
01:38:16,561 --> 01:38:19,320
And that's another symbol that's been 
lost,

1859
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:24,321
I would say to a massive degree in 
modern universities because all we're 

1860
01:38:24,321 --> 01:38:28,251
taught is to tear that down and to not 
even notice that it manifests itself 

1861
01:38:28,471 --> 01:38:30,690
everywhere,
especially in the universities which are

1862
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:35,990
like,
there is close to an ideal environment 

1863
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:38,121
as you could,
as human beings have ever been able to 

1864
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:38,121
create.
It's as simple as that.

1865
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:41,040
And if you can't be grateful for,
for the structure of the university,

1866
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:46,041
with all its imperfections,
then then you're completely blind to 

1867
01:38:46,041 --> 01:38:46,041
this element of the architect.

1868
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,900
And that's the opposite of it.
That's the sun that devours the king,

1869
01:38:50,901 --> 01:38:53,650
that devours his own son.
That's a tyrant.

1870
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:59,150
You know,
that's like the mother who's too over 

1871
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:01,051
protective.
It's the male version of that and the 

1872
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:02,090
mother that's too over protective says 
I'll never let anything happen to you.

1873
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:07,420
It's like,
well maybe you actually want to have 

1874
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:07,420
something happen to you.
You know,

1875
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:08,660
it's a bit of an all inclusive 
statement.

1876
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:09,740
It's like,
no,

1877
01:39:09,741 --> 01:39:14,741
I'm going to make you strong so any 
number of things can happen to you and 

1878
01:39:14,741 --> 01:39:15,790
when you're,
when you need some care,

1879
01:39:15,791 --> 01:39:17,120
I'll be there.
But otherwise,

1880
01:39:17,121 --> 01:39:19,810
like out into the world with you,
that's the right attitude.

1881
01:39:19,811 --> 01:39:22,940
And for the father it's like get your 
bloody act together,

1882
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:28,090
but I'm on your side.
It's because not because I want to 

1883
01:39:28,090 --> 01:39:30,371
destroy you or demean you or push you 
down in the dominance hierarchy bit 

1884
01:39:30,371 --> 01:39:30,800
because I want the best.
Didn't you?

1885
01:39:30,801 --> 01:39:33,560
To emerge.
And so you need standards.

1886
01:39:33,561 --> 01:39:35,750
It's like what are you doing wasting 
your life?

1887
01:39:35,751 --> 01:39:40,040
There's way more than that to you get 
your act together and bring it out.

1888
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:45,280
And that's a message that people really 
want to hear if they have any sense at 

1889
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,280
all.
And generally they do want to hear it.

1890
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:47,720
So,
you know,

1891
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:54,180
I was talking,
I've been talking to a lot of people 

1892
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:54,180
recently as,
as perhaps you know,

1893
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:58,291
and what I was talking to one of the 
leaders of the Conservatives this 

1894
01:39:58,291 --> 01:40:01,350
morning and they're asking me about,
the person was asking me about bill see 

1895
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:05,091
16,
but more specifically about talking to 

1896
01:40:05,091 --> 01:40:06,650
young people in because the conservative
leadership

1897
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,530
struggle is going on right now.
I've been talking to a bunch of them and

1898
01:40:10,531 --> 01:40:11,190
I said,
well look,

1899
01:40:11,191 --> 01:40:14,670
one of the things you could do for young
people that no one's doing is to talk to

1900
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:19,671
them about responsibility because 
everyone talks to young people about 

1901
01:40:19,671 --> 01:40:21,570
rights.
So like we need our rights.

1902
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:22,680
It's like,
Oh God,

1903
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:25,020
how many rights do you need?
You know,

1904
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:30,021
really,
like you have more privileges than any 

1905
01:40:30,021 --> 01:40:30,060
people who've ever lived anywhere.
Well,

1906
01:40:30,061 --> 01:40:33,420
it's so dull to hear that so dull.
It's so pathetic.

1907
01:40:33,421 --> 01:40:34,640
And,
and uh,

1908
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:39,950
what would you call it?
It's so demeaning that you have to be 

1909
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:40,620
protected and have your rights.
It's like I said,

1910
01:40:40,621 --> 01:40:43,380
there's a huge marketplace for 
responsibility.

1911
01:40:43,381 --> 01:40:45,210
That's what you want to talk to young 
people about.

1912
01:40:45,211 --> 01:40:48,990
It's like get your act together and do 
something worthwhile with your life.

1913
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,660
For the first time,
my entire adult life,

1914
01:40:51,661 --> 01:40:54,490
the conservatives actually have 
something to sell young people,

1915
01:40:54,491 --> 01:40:54,730
right?

1916
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:57,790
They could sell them responsibility.
It's like,

1917
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:58,450
well,
why?

1918
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:01,540
Because that's where my life has meaning
with responsibility.

1919
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:07,320
The more responsibility you take on,
the more meaning your life has and the 

1920
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:11,890
the higher degree of responsibility that
you agreed voluntarily to try to bear,

1921
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:17,350
the richer your life will be and no 
one's ever told that in the case.

1922
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:18,820
You know,
it's like you have.

1923
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,890
You have four kids say,
well,

1924
01:41:20,891 --> 01:41:23,830
that's plenty of responsibility.
You're going to have meaning.

1925
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,570
It's going to be rough,
you know,

1926
01:41:25,571 --> 01:41:30,571
because it's complicated.
You have a complicated job and you try 

1927
01:41:30,571 --> 01:41:31,600
to help the careers of the people around
you.

1928
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:35,560
Do you try to solve tough problems and 
aid suffering and do all of that.

1929
01:41:35,561 --> 01:41:38,470
It's like its weight,
its responsibility,

1930
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:40,270
but it's,
there's glory in it.

1931
01:41:40,271 --> 01:41:42,930
There's real glory and there's deep 
meaning in it and,

1932
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:48,380
and,
and young people are starving for that 

1933
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:51,421
because no one ever tells them that.
It's like you're way more than you 

1934
01:41:51,421 --> 01:41:51,421
think,
man,

1935
01:41:51,421 --> 01:41:52,870
stand up.
Do something difficult.

1936
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,690
Do something difficult and heroic,
right?

1937
01:41:55,990 --> 01:42:00,550
Burst out of your barns.
It's like that's a good message.

1938
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:06,920
That's a necessary message because we 
have to be more than we are because if 

1939
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:07,060
we,
if we aren't,

1940
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,260
we're not going to survive.

1941
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:13,180
Well,
that's the sun devouring father,

1942
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,710
that's a painting by Medina of Satan.
It's pretty horrifying one,

1943
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:24,680
and that's Captain Hook.
I really liked the figure of Captain 

1944
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,730
Hook some of these popular mythological 
stories.

1945
01:42:26,731 --> 01:42:31,731
Myths based fairytales.
Modern fairy tales have got things 

1946
01:42:31,731 --> 01:42:31,731
really right.
Captain Hook.

1947
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:33,510
Well,
he's a pirate.

1948
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:39,290
So I think I told you that in the Google
engineers investigations of female 

1949
01:42:39,871 --> 01:42:44,871
sexual fantasies,
the pirate played a large role werewolf 

1950
01:42:44,871 --> 01:42:48,690
vampire pirate surgeon,
billionaire credibly comic comical.

1951
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,160
Well pirate,
you know,

1952
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:53,030
captain of the high seas and someone 
willing to break rules.

1953
01:42:53,031 --> 01:42:55,140
There's a romance in that figure.
Well,

1954
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:58,560
so the idea of the great father as the 
pirate is a good one.

1955
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:01,860
Well,
Kirk is kind of a pathetic pirate and of

1956
01:43:01,861 --> 01:43:04,410
course pirates are precisely that 
because they're all also crooked.

1957
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:07,650
And so what makes empathetic.
Well,

1958
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:12,740
it isn't because he's got a hook 
precisely because maybe that's just a 

1959
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:16,191
sign of adventure.
It's because he's being chased by a 

1960
01:43:16,191 --> 01:43:16,191
crocodile with a clock in its stomach.

1961
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,290
Well,
that's the dragon of chaos right now.

1962
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:19,800
It's time,
tick,

1963
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:20,700
tick,
tick.

1964
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:24,390
Your life is going to end.
It's already got a piece of you and it's

1965
01:43:24,391 --> 01:43:27,480
coming for the rest,
and so hook is terrified of that.

1966
01:43:27,481 --> 01:43:31,850
He's terrified into resentment and and,
and the evil roughly speaking,

1967
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:36,950
why he can prey on other people.
And so that's the father in the Peter 

1968
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:41,360
Pan Story out in Neverland,
which is the archetypal domain captain 

1969
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:41,360
Hook's the farther,
well,

1970
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,620
why would peter pan want to grow up to 
be Captain Hook?

1971
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:45,030
Well,
he doesn't,

1972
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:47,190
and so he stays.
Pan.

1973
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:49,020
Pan Means everything,
right?

1974
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:51,860
Like pantheism,
he stays everything.

1975
01:43:51,861 --> 01:43:54,440
He's the divine child.
He never wants to grow up.

1976
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:56,840
Well,
why would you sacrifice the potential of

1977
01:43:56,841 --> 01:44:01,160
youth to become nothing but a death 
obsessed tyrant?

1978
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:02,870
Well,
that's the story in,

1979
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:06,620
in Peter Pan,
and of course Wendy's in the story.

1980
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,830
And so as Tinkerbell,
tinkerbell is the imagined feminine.

1981
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:12,320
She's just,
she doesn't even exist.

1982
01:44:12,321 --> 01:44:17,321
She's just this perfect little thing 
that's always around whatever peter pan 

1983
01:44:17,321 --> 01:44:20,981
needs her,
but the problem with Tinkerbell is that 

1984
01:44:20,981 --> 01:44:22,370
she's a fairy and fairies don't exist.
He has wendy there.

1985
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,550
She's a real girl.
She grows up and actually marry someone.

1986
01:44:25,551 --> 01:44:28,880
Peter Pan stays king of the lost boys 
forever and you know,

1987
01:44:28,881 --> 01:44:30,830
maybe it's better to be king of the lost
boys,

1988
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:33,980
but not to be king at all,
but maybe not to.

1989
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:38,780
King of the dam is not exactly something
to snort a dominance hierarchy to strive

1990
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:42,980
for dominating.
So that's the Peter Pan Story and it's a

1991
01:44:42,981 --> 01:44:45,080
right.
It's the right story for the modern age,

1992
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:50,081
that's for sure.
So that's a negative element of the 

1993
01:44:50,081 --> 01:44:50,150
great father.

1994
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,330
Here's the positive element of the great
father.

1995
01:44:54,331 --> 01:44:59,331
These are both read.
This is a representation of Moses 

1996
01:44:59,331 --> 01:45:00,750
receiving the,
the rules for living from God on high.

1997
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:05,780
What we talked about that already know,
and I see that that's a story of the 

1998
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:08,670
revelation of structure.
That's the story of mankind.

1999
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:11,340
We're acting out a moral structure.
Well,

2000
01:45:11,341 --> 01:45:16,341
what is it now?
And then we get a glimpse of what the 

2001
01:45:16,341 --> 01:45:18,981
moral structure isn't.
It hits people with the force of a 

2002
01:45:18,981 --> 01:45:18,981
revelation,
then it can be articulated,

2003
01:45:18,981 --> 01:45:20,760
and that's partly what the story of 
Moses lays out.

2004
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,700
Then you see here,
this picture,

2005
01:45:23,701 --> 01:45:26,490
I really liked this one too.
This is a supplicant.

2006
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:30,030
Basically someone who's who's hit hard 
by a divine vision.

2007
01:45:30,031 --> 01:45:31,740
It's God in heaven.
Again,

2008
01:45:31,741 --> 01:45:36,741
very,
very similar to this with with a cross 

2009
01:45:36,741 --> 01:45:39,501
in the background and it's something 
like that to transcend your littleness 

2010
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:40,830
because look,
he's looking up.

2011
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:43,090
That's what's at the top of the 
dominance hurricane.

2012
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:48,290
So what?
At the top of all possible dominance 

2013
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:51,021
hierarchies look up.
That's the father who supports the 

2014
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:52,970
sudden that's transcending his own 
vulnerability,

2015
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:57,971
right?
Willing to bear it voluntarily and not 

2016
01:45:57,971 --> 01:45:57,971
too,
and not to shirk from that.

2017
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:02,080
It's exactly right and it is what you 
admire in people you know,

2018
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:05,220
you admire people who are courageous and
they were strong,

2019
01:46:05,221 --> 01:46:10,221
and when you decompose that,
it means that they're able to act 

2020
01:46:10,221 --> 01:46:13,140
appropriately and in a helpful,
compassionate,

2021
01:46:13,141 --> 01:46:18,141
wise and tough manner,
despite the fact that there be set with 

2022
01:46:18,141 --> 01:46:20,190
all of the problems of mortality that 
beset everyone else.

2023
01:46:22,570 --> 01:46:24,010
Well,
how does it go wrong?

2024
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:26,440
Well,
that's all propaganda for Hitler.

2025
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:28,450
Look at the imagery.
You know,

2026
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:30,620
he's a night that's on the right.
He's the.

2027
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,710
He's the night of nationalism.
Well,

2028
01:46:32,711 --> 01:46:34,330
that's God the father to,
you know,

2029
01:46:34,630 --> 01:46:36,580
it's a little bit one sided,
right?

2030
01:46:36,581 --> 01:46:40,420
Because there's more to the farther than
the state.

2031
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:46,320
That's the thing and that's the problem 
with nationalism and it's totalitarian 

2032
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,770
variance and we're moving in that 
direction fast,

2033
01:46:47,771 --> 01:46:52,771
right?
You see Europe right now fragmenting 

2034
01:46:52,771 --> 01:46:54,801
again because the European Union is too 
amorphous and maybe not well enough 

2035
01:46:55,261 --> 01:46:59,160
bordered and everyone is getting nervous
and they're saying back to the state,

2036
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:00,960
back to the state,
it's fair enough.

2037
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:06,140
Fair enough.
You need to be around people who are 

2038
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:06,140
like you,
so to speak,

2039
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:10,440
what you have built a consensus with,
but to subordinate yourself to the state

2040
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:13,410
and to make its head that the bearer of 
the,

2041
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:14,190
the,
the,

2042
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:18,960
the archetype of the night without 
having that element of individuality and

2043
01:47:18,961 --> 01:47:20,460
it is absolutely pathological.

2044
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,350
We've already been down that road,
right?

2045
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:24,750
Because the national socialists were 
hyper national,

2046
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:27,810
just like,
well it both in Germany and in Italy and

2047
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:29,100
it's attractive.
Again,

2048
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:32,850
it's interesting here.
You see hit the rest of the night and up

2049
01:47:32,851 --> 01:47:37,851
here there's a bird and that bird should
be the dove because that should be the 

2050
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:38,070
holy ghost if the iconography was 
proper,

2051
01:47:38,071 --> 01:47:40,820
but it's not.
It's an eagle and an eagle is a burden.

2052
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:43,500
Carry a neater,
right?

2053
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:46,020
It feeds on corpses.
Well,

2054
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:51,021
it's worth thinking about.
So that's the woman worshiping the 

2055
01:47:51,021 --> 01:47:54,931
strong father.
Another representation of Hitler as a 

2056
01:47:54,931 --> 01:47:57,411
night,
and then there's Hitler as wise father 

2057
01:47:57,411 --> 01:47:59,421
you see is surrounded by people there 
who focused in on him as if he's an 

2058
01:47:59,421 --> 01:48:01,340
architect.
Archetype will import and then this is a

2059
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:07,190
poster from,
from the Lis and anti Nazi poster from 

2060
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:10,971
the Allies and you see right there that 
Hitler and the Nazis are assimilated to 

2061
01:48:10,971 --> 01:48:11,520
a mess of predatory snakes.

2062
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:12,000
It's like,
well,

2063
01:48:12,001 --> 01:48:12,630
why?
Well,

2064
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:17,340
if you want to appeal to someone's 
determination to destroy you say,

2065
01:48:17,550 --> 01:48:19,440
well,
here you are and you're all ready to go.

2066
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:24,920
Let's go kill some snakes.
And everyone can say yes and then you 

2067
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:24,920
say,
well,

2068
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:25,980
there's the snakes right there.
And the thing is,

2069
01:48:25,981 --> 01:48:29,070
it's true to some degree because you 
have plenty of snakes.

2070
01:48:29,071 --> 01:48:31,350
Just like everyone else,
and so it's easy.

2071
01:48:31,351 --> 01:48:34,860
That's the first step towards 
demonization and you can do it just like

2072
01:48:34,861 --> 01:48:36,450
that.
It's no problem.

2073
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:41,480
The archetype will map perfectly,
especially if there's already tension 

2074
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:44,961
between the groups or if the other group
is identifiable in some manner or you 

2075
01:48:44,961 --> 01:48:47,790
can make it identifiable.
Discussed is the best way to do that,

2076
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:49,770
not fear,
disgust,

2077
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:53,340
fear to fear someone.
You have to respect them.

2078
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,410
You don't want to burn everything that 
the person that you fear owns.

2079
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:02,520
You want to burn everything that the 
person who disgusts you owns,

2080
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:07,670
and so you'll see people who are pushing
the nationalist agenda hard and Hitler 

2081
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:08,400
did this beautifully.

2082
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:13,560
Everything that was outside of the area 
in domain of purity wasn't to be feared.

2083
01:49:13,561 --> 01:49:18,561
It was disgusting.
It was contemptuous and it should be 

2084
01:49:18,561 --> 01:49:22,131
destroyed and purified by fire,
and that was his message and Nazis were 

2085
01:49:22,131 --> 01:49:26,340
unbelievably great at using fire of 
purification as a symbolic message.

2086
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:27,910
Well,
it,

2087
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:31,920
it has an archetype will power.
Then you see here,

2088
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:36,090
this is an English,
a poster from the World War II.

2089
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:41,600
I'm asking people to buy bonds to fund 
the American or the British war effort,

2090
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:45,270
and you see these,
these talon like plause,

2091
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:50,420
Japan and Nazi reaching out to the 
virgin mother and her infant child,

2092
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:52,700
right?
Deep,

2093
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:57,130
deep use of deep subordination,
of archetypal imagery for the purposes.

2094
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:02,340
While I hesitate to say propaganda 
because world war in some sense was 

2095
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:06,901
pretty clear cut,
but you get the point and there's the 

2096
01:50:06,901 --> 01:50:08,440
uniform reoccur.
That uniformity of the state,

2097
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:09,910
right?
So the goose step,

2098
01:50:09,911 --> 01:50:11,680
everybody moves exactly the same way.

2099
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:14,800
Everybody's put.
Everybody's turned into exactly the same

2100
01:50:14,801 --> 01:50:19,801
carbon copy of everyone else.
All the diversity is pushed out of the 

2101
01:50:19,801 --> 01:50:23,581
state.
It's subordinated to the supreme leader 

2102
01:50:23,581 --> 01:50:23,581
in the hierarchy becomes incredibly 
rigid and,

2103
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:24,720
and,
and,

2104
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:25,870
and,
and,

2105
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,370
and,
and homogenous.

2106
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:28,000
So like,
well,

2107
01:50:28,001 --> 01:50:33,001
that's great for fast action,
but it's terrible if you don't know 

2108
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:33,001
where you're going.
You need some diversity,

2109
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:37,831
needs some flaws in the cliffs 
crystalline structure in case you're on 

2110
01:50:37,831 --> 01:50:41,551
the wrong path.
And that's why you can't have everyone 

2111
01:50:41,551 --> 01:50:45,031
being the supreme leader's acolytes.
The whole bloody thing wanders off in 

2112
01:50:45,031 --> 01:50:49,081
one direction and because we don't know 
the right direction to go wandering off 

2113
01:50:49,081 --> 01:50:51,550
in a single direction is extraordinarily
dangerous.

2114
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:56,610
You will eventually fall over a cliff,
so there's the Nazis use of of light at 

2115
01:50:59,171 --> 01:51:04,171
night.
They were unbelievably good at there at 

2116
01:51:04,171 --> 01:51:06,781
their.
This is one of the things that made 

2117
01:51:06,781 --> 01:51:06,781
fascism so difficult to fight because 
with communism,

2118
01:51:06,781 --> 01:51:08,470
because it was a fully articulated 
philosophy,

2119
01:51:08,471 --> 01:51:12,160
you could attack it rationally,
but fascism never really did that.

2120
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:14,830
What they did instead was used ritual,
right?

2121
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:20,370
Huge mass rallies and highly emotionally
supercharged meetings and then the use 

2122
01:51:20,801 --> 01:51:25,801
of light and fire and so Hitler built 
the biggest parade grounds in human 

2123
01:51:26,081 --> 01:51:31,081
history to host the Nuremberg rallies 
and he would get in front of them on 

2124
01:51:31,081 --> 01:51:32,750
this huge stage with,
you know,

2125
01:51:32,790 --> 01:51:37,790
with Greek columns.
Very impressive looking and have blocks 

2126
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:39,130
of thousands of people organized 
perfectly orderly.

2127
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:42,340
The Germans are good at order in order 
is associated with disgust,

2128
01:51:42,341 --> 01:51:44,560
sensitivity,
incredibly organized,

2129
01:51:44,561 --> 01:51:49,561
orderly displays complete and then at 
night with fire and behind him he would 

2130
01:51:49,561 --> 01:51:53,560
have all of the search lights from the 
Luther author lined up,

2131
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:57,100
dozens of them shooting their light 
straight up miles into the sky,

2132
01:51:57,101 --> 01:52:01,900
so we stand in front of these incredibly
impressive displays of light long before

2133
01:52:01,901 --> 01:52:04,270
there were rock shows and so forth doing
that,

2134
01:52:04,271 --> 01:52:09,271
you know,
it was unparalleled in history and and 

2135
01:52:09,271 --> 01:52:10,240
addressed the crowd and it was very good
at addressing the crowd.

2136
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:15,450
He'd say something and if people were 
listening he'd say more of it and if 

2137
01:52:15,450 --> 01:52:18,040
they were listening you'd say more of it
and because he was addressing the mob,

2138
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:23,610
the mob God exactly from Hitler what 
they wanted and we saw what that was 

2139
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:27,001
like $120 million people dead in no time
flat and the worst horrors that were 

2140
01:52:27,001 --> 01:52:31,501
ever perpetrated on people.
Maybe because there's no shortage of 

2141
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:36,250
perpetrated horrors stolen.
Same thing.

2142
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:38,080
Stalin the great father,
right?

2143
01:52:38,081 --> 01:52:40,840
Wise man at the helm of the ship of the 
state.

2144
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:46,360
This is after the wall came down,
some old man kissing a a gilded statue,

2145
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:49,630
stellan before it's going to be before 
it's going to be torn down.

2146
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:54,640
There he is with happy children and not 
the children that has policies starve to

2147
01:52:55,491 --> 01:52:57,290
death as you,
as you might well imagine.

2148
01:52:57,630 --> 01:53:00,410
Areas in his military uniform sitting on
what's all,

2149
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:02,420
for all intents and purposes,
a throne.

2150
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:04,820
And this is,
this is really an uncanny one.

2151
01:53:04,821 --> 01:53:06,590
It's very positive,
right?

2152
01:53:06,710 --> 01:53:09,110
That's Hitler is or still in his head of
state.

2153
01:53:09,111 --> 01:53:14,111
He's in this hellish Mandela of fire.
Perfect with God the father at his head.

2154
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:15,950
That's Lennon.
You know,

2155
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:16,910
who people still,

2156
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:21,290
who people still revere.
You may know and perhaps you don't,

2157
01:53:21,291 --> 01:53:24,500
that I was nominated to be rector of the
University of Glasgow.

2158
01:53:24,501 --> 01:53:26,780
And so,
which is an honorary position.

2159
01:53:26,781 --> 01:53:31,781
And um,
today yesterday the different candidates

2160
01:53:32,511 --> 01:53:35,660
put up their manifestos and,
and the student newspaper paper put them

2161
01:53:35,661 --> 01:53:40,661
up and then wrote an analysis of the 
manifestos which were biased and there 

2162
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:46,481
were appallingly biased in one sided.
And I wrote and told them that they 

2163
01:53:46,481 --> 01:53:46,481
said,
well,

2164
01:53:46,481 --> 01:53:48,290
we have a perfect right to our political
opinion.

2165
01:53:48,291 --> 01:53:49,040
And I thought,
yeah,

2166
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:50,290
well for sure,
but you know,

2167
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:55,510
you are journalists after all and maybe 
you could be just trying to tell what's 

2168
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:55,970
happening.
It's like,

2169
01:53:55,971 --> 01:53:56,480
no,
no,

2170
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:57,650
no,
there's none of that.

2171
01:53:58,070 --> 01:54:00,260
And they said that one of the candidates
that they,

2172
01:54:00,261 --> 01:54:05,261
uh,
that they clearly recommended who seems 

2173
01:54:05,261 --> 01:54:07,070
to be a person who's perfectly heroic in
his own right.

2174
01:54:07,071 --> 01:54:12,071
I mean,
he's taken on very many difficult legal 

2175
01:54:12,071 --> 01:54:14,051
cases and,
and work for the oppressed and 

2176
01:54:14,051 --> 01:54:14,190
downtrodden who clearly exist.

2177
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:19,550
Um,
it was either him or another candidate 

2178
01:54:19,550 --> 01:54:22,211
doesn't really matter that they 
described as bolshy and an outspoken 

2179
01:54:22,211 --> 01:54:23,630
Bolshie meaning Bolshevik,
like,

2180
01:54:23,631 --> 01:54:24,200
it's like,
well,

2181
01:54:24,201 --> 01:54:25,720
you know,
he's appropriately bullshit.

2182
01:54:25,721 --> 01:54:27,650
It's like,
it's no different than saying,

2183
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:29,420
well,
he's appropriately not see.

2184
01:54:29,421 --> 01:54:31,520
Like,
like what the hell is that?

2185
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:36,610
I mean there were 50 million people that
were killed in the Soviet Union by the 

2186
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:39,110
Bolsheviks and maybe twice that many in,
in China.

2187
01:54:39,111 --> 01:54:44,111
And that does,
it says nothing about Cambodia and all 

2188
01:54:44,111 --> 01:54:44,510
the other places there were radical left
blood bass.

2189
01:54:44,511 --> 01:54:47,730
You think it's cute to call someone 
Bolshie Jesus.

2190
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:47,810
Okay.

2191
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:50,250
It's appalling.
It's appalling.

2192
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:52,710
It's not some fashionable thing that you
do.

2193
01:54:53,070 --> 01:54:58,070
It's participation in some of the 
deepest intellectual morasses of evil 

2194
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:59,910
that human beings have ever managed to 
create,

2195
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:02,610
and yet it's fashionable and shows you 
what,

2196
01:55:02,611 --> 01:55:02,650
what

2197
01:55:02,650 --> 01:55:05,380
the universities are worth.
Well,

2198
01:55:05,381 --> 01:55:07,600
there's the downside of Stella.
Yeah.

2199
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:13,380
Stella and his hangman.
That sort of cartoon would have gotten 

2200
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:16,151
you killed in the Soviet Union.
Stalin as st himself in a stain glass 

2201
01:55:16,151 --> 01:55:20,671
representation.
There's a statue of Stella and covered 

2202
01:55:20,671 --> 01:55:24,120
with red paint for the blood after the 
wall came down there Astella as what?

2203
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:26,530
It's very much like Medina's Satan,
right?

2204
01:55:26,531 --> 01:55:29,020
You look at that and it's exactly the 
same.

2205
01:55:29,021 --> 01:55:31,180
Marketable idea.
There's the Americans going.

2206
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:33,740
It had a cap in hand to get a little 
large.

2207
01:55:33,741 --> 01:55:35,050
Yes.
From Papa stalad.

2208
01:55:35,290 --> 01:55:40,120
That's a painting of the Communists,
forcibly collectivizing,

2209
01:55:40,121 --> 01:55:43,000
the productive farmers in the Soviet 
Union,

2210
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:45,150
the early 19 twenties.
The kulaks right.

2211
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:50,750
Everything from whom they stalled and 
rape them and murdered them and ship 

2212
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:54,531
them off to Siberia and killed them and 
wiped out the productive farmers of the 

2213
01:55:54,531 --> 01:55:57,270
Soviet Union.
And then starved 6 million Ukrainians to

2214
01:55:57,271 --> 01:56:01,230
death and there is some poor kid in the 
19 thirties who's ribs are showing,

2215
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:04,170
you know,
taking a bath in this part with his eyes

2216
01:56:04,171 --> 01:56:04,590
wide.

2217
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:09,590
And you know,
he's one of the fortunate ones because 

2218
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:09,590
he's still alive.
It's like bull sheet.

2219
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:10,560
Yeah,
cute.

2220
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:13,950
Pretty Fun.
Fashionable,

2221
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:19,250
lovely.
Well that's the decomposition of chaos 

2222
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:19,590
into God.
The father,

2223
01:56:19,591 --> 01:56:23,280
half providing security in order and 
half providing tyranny.

2224
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:25,350
That's the archetype you have to put up 
with it.

2225
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:30,380
That's what your society is like.
You try to interact with it in a way 

2226
01:56:30,380 --> 01:56:31,740
that enables the positive part of it to 
come forth.

2227
01:56:31,741 --> 01:56:36,741
And then it does the same thing.
Chaos gives rise to the father who's 

2228
01:56:37,330 --> 01:56:38,410
nurturing and,
and,

2229
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:40,350
and,
and encouraging.

2230
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:45,770
And that gives rise.
That produces the son was very hard to 

2231
01:56:45,770 --> 01:56:48,210
find that image I can tell you.
So.

2232
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:53,300
And then that gives rise to the proper 
balance of the proper attitude from the 

2233
01:56:53,551 --> 01:56:55,530
father produces the same thing that 
sutton,

2234
01:56:55,531 --> 01:56:57,480
who's the hero of the individual,
who's the hero?

2235
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:02,720
The consciousness that conflict 
consciousness of the child that's 

2236
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:06,351
willing to go forth,
eyes opened and voluntarily confront 

2237
01:57:06,351 --> 01:57:10,290
chaos and turn it into order and that's 
the proper pathway for human beings.

2238
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:16,040
So here's a way of thinking about it or 
showed you that diagram you know of how 

2239
01:57:17,311 --> 01:57:21,420
you decompose the value structure and 
you can do it right down to the level of

2240
01:57:21,421 --> 01:57:22,170
detail.
You know,

2241
01:57:22,171 --> 01:57:27,120
so you want to make dinner,
you go below that higher resolution,

2242
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:30,060
you cut up vegetables,
you move your arm,

2243
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:35,140
you it decomposes all the way,
differentiates down all the way to 

2244
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:36,330
skill.
You put these skills together,

2245
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:41,090
represent them with abstract concepts.
I can make dinner,

2246
01:57:41,570 --> 01:57:45,170
I can take care of my family,
can undertake this job at work.

2247
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:49,080
That makes me a decent father.
That's part of being a good pr.

2248
01:57:49,190 --> 01:57:54,190
That's part of being a good person.
The question is what's at the pinnacle 

2249
01:57:54,190 --> 01:57:58,391
of that?
At the upper end of the abstraction 

2250
01:57:58,391 --> 01:57:58,391
hierarchy,
because these things should be organized

2251
01:57:58,391 --> 01:57:59,930
all the way up into a complete 
hierarchy.

2252
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:03,680
What is it mean to be a good person?
Well,

2253
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:08,980
it means we've walked through it.
It means you win the set of games,

2254
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:14,210
you go out into the world and exploring,
you bring back what you've found and you

2255
01:58:14,211 --> 01:58:16,730
build yourself out of it and you share 
it with other people.

2256
01:58:17,450 --> 01:58:22,450
That's an old,
old story that's no different than the 

2257
01:58:22,450 --> 01:58:22,820
story of the collective hunt.
It's exactly the same thing,

2258
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:24,090
right?
You,

2259
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:26,550
you build yourself into someone that has
a low,

2260
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:29,540
have a longterm relationship with 
someone of the opposite sex,

2261
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:34,690
generally speaking,
so that you can bring children into the 

2262
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:35,960
world and turn them into exploratory 
heroes in stabilize the state.

2263
01:58:36,530 --> 01:58:38,960
That's what should be at the top and 
that thing that's at the top,

2264
01:58:38,961 --> 01:58:42,220
it's the same thing.
It's integration of all

2265
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:45,580
of those things into the same thing and 
that's the same as the sun.

2266
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:50,760
That's the same as the halo.
It's the same as the thing that emerges 

2267
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:53,671
from the belly of the whale.
It's all of those things and you also 

2268
01:58:53,671 --> 01:58:57,040
know that because you know that you have
the capacity for admiration,

2269
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:58,600
it's in you,
it's in you.

2270
01:58:58,601 --> 01:59:02,440
It's locked into your biology and it's 
locked into your sociology.

2271
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:07,800
You see what you admire.
Not to partial representation of the 

2272
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:08,380
ultimate ideal.
It's as simple as that.

2273
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:10,630
So I,
I kind of nested this.

2274
01:59:10,631 --> 01:59:15,631
Hey,
so I should just explain this diagram 

2275
01:59:15,631 --> 01:59:18,061
briefly.
So it was a map I tried to make in some 

2276
01:59:18,061 --> 01:59:21,691
sense of my own identity.
I mean just using myself as an example 

2277
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:24,820
of someone typically situated in 
society.

2278
01:59:24,821 --> 01:59:29,620
So now I have this role which is kind of
a high resolution role.

2279
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:34,770
I'm a father and a husband and I also 
run a business and so the father and 

2280
01:59:34,770 --> 01:59:38,671
husband thing is sort of nested inside 
of that because it's dependent on my 

2281
01:59:38,671 --> 01:59:39,250
economic success to some degree.

2282
01:59:39,730 --> 01:59:44,730
And then that's nested inside a 
capitalist structure and then that's 

2283
01:59:44,730 --> 01:59:46,060
nested inside.
Well I said American personality,

2284
01:59:46,061 --> 01:59:51,061
but it's sort of that's good enough.
And then that's nested inside the 

2285
01:59:51,061 --> 01:59:54,931
humanistic western personality and 
inside the Judeo Christian personality 

2286
01:59:54,931 --> 01:59:58,801
and that's all nested inside this thing 
that's best conceptualized as something 

2287
01:59:58,801 --> 02:00:01,430
approximating the exploratory hero.
And so that's a,

2288
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,240
that's a value structure that's and you 
know you can different.

2289
02:00:04,330 --> 02:00:08,290
You could differentiate that to a much 
higher level than father and husband.

2290
02:00:08,291 --> 02:00:10,840
And we did that when we decompose things
right down to,

2291
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:16,160
you know,
their motor actions and you want what 

2292
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:18,481
you want this and this is,
I think there's something that's 

2293
02:00:18,481 --> 02:00:23,040
transcendent about this.
You want all those things stacked up so 

2294
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,790
they're all operating properly at the 
same time,

2295
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:30,120
all the way up and all the way down.
And I don't even know how far down 

2296
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:30,120
means.

2297
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:31,510
Like if you get all those things 
together,

2298
02:00:31,810 --> 02:00:35,440
your physiology be organized and 
oriented properly to oh well,

2299
02:00:35,441 --> 02:00:37,510
you know,
and that means your organs work properly

2300
02:00:37,511 --> 02:00:40,510
in the micro elements of the board 
properly and all the way down.

2301
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:44,350
And then if everything is organized like
that to the society starts to work,

2302
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:49,620
everything starts to organize itself 
along the horizontal axis where each 

2303
02:00:49,901 --> 02:00:53,110
level of the structure supports every 
other lecture level.

2304
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:58,260
And you can feel that.
I believe that's what you feel when 

2305
02:00:58,260 --> 02:00:58,330
you're engaged in doing something 
meaningful.

2306
02:00:58,331 --> 02:01:03,331
You can feel those things coming 
together and you can also feel that as 

2307
02:01:03,331 --> 02:01:03,490
a,
as a kind of strength.

2308
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:06,190
It pushes you forward instead of pulling
you backwards.

2309
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:07,510
So,
and it,

2310
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:08,890
I,
I think that you're,

2311
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:13,480
our nervous systems are very 
sophisticated and they orient us in time

2312
02:01:13,481 --> 02:01:18,481
and space and they can tell us when 
they're in the right place at the right 

2313
02:01:18,481 --> 02:01:18,550
time and people love that.

2314
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:21,610
And I think you experienced that when 
you're deeply engaged in music as well.

2315
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:23,140
It puts you there momentarily,
right?

2316
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:26,560
Say you're in a cathedral and you're 
listening to some remarkable music.

2317
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:31,710
If the light pouring in,
you're in trees because that's what it 

2318
02:01:31,710 --> 02:01:31,710
cathedral is.
That's what this,

2319
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:35,230
that's what the arches is,
its light coming through the trees.

2320
02:01:35,231 --> 02:01:38,170
That's what's represented in the stones.
You're in there,

2321
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:41,390
you're looking at the,
it's pouring down at you,

2322
02:01:41,391 --> 02:01:46,391
you're in this,
you're at the center of the world and 

2323
02:01:46,391 --> 02:01:48,221
there's a great piece of music playing 
and it's an indication that everything 

2324
02:01:48,221 --> 02:01:52,301
is stacking up along this one poll.
That's what it's supposed to produce 

2325
02:01:52,301 --> 02:01:56,740
that produces a religious experience.
If it works properly and you know that 

2326
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:58,220
you go to rock concerts,
you go listen to music.

2327
02:01:58,320 --> 02:01:59,960
So what the hell do you think you're 
doing there?

2328
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:02,420
You're not having a quasi religious 
experience.

2329
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:07,570
You think you'd go otherwise and just 
because you don't know that that's what 

2330
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:07,570
happened,
that's what's happening,

2331
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:12,521
doesn't mean it isn't what's happening.
People have been gathering together in 

2332
02:02:12,521 --> 02:02:15,860
groups and transcending the limits of 
their pathological individuality through

2333
02:02:15,861 --> 02:02:18,170
music and ritual since the beginning of 
time.

2334
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:21,260
Why would it be any different for us and
the lights there?

2335
02:02:21,261 --> 02:02:24,500
That's what the light show is for.
It's the same thing.

2336
02:02:24,530 --> 02:02:28,280
It's just that the religious element of 
it is stripped away partly because we've

2337
02:02:28,281 --> 02:02:33,281
criticized that to death so carelessly 
that we can't integrate it anymore into 

2338
02:02:33,281 --> 02:02:34,400
ceremonies like that and I mean fair 
enough,

2339
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:40,000
but.
But it's not like that comes without a 

2340
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,401
loss.
People hunger for that more deeply than 

2341
02:02:42,401 --> 02:02:42,401
anything else.

2342
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:47,350
Questions?
Yes.

2343
02:02:58,570 --> 02:03:03,570
Sacrifice human sacrifice and a 
psychological gratification and this 

2344
02:03:10,340 --> 02:03:11,330
correlation between.

2345
02:03:13,110 --> 02:03:14,260
Exactly.
The question is,

2346
02:03:14,261 --> 02:03:18,850
is there a relationship between the idea
of sacrificed and delay of gratification

2347
02:03:18,851 --> 02:03:20,800
and is that related to 
conscientiousness?

2348
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:22,750
Yes.
Well,

2349
02:03:22,870 --> 02:03:25,240
the conscientiousness relationship is a 
tough one.

2350
02:03:25,241 --> 02:03:27,760
You know,
we tested to see if conscientious people

2351
02:03:27,761 --> 02:03:32,761
were more likely to delay gratification 
in classic delay of gratification tasks 

2352
02:03:32,771 --> 02:03:37,771
and we found no effect.
We found Iq effect and we found a 

2353
02:03:37,771 --> 02:03:39,640
reverse effect for extroversion and 
positive mood,

2354
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:44,080
and so what happens is that happier 
people are more impulsive,

2355
02:03:44,081 --> 02:03:46,810
they're more likely to grasp what's 
right in front of them in the present,

2356
02:03:46,811 --> 02:03:50,800
but conscientiousness is an 
extraordinarily tough nut to crack and I

2357
02:03:50,801 --> 02:03:55,210
do think it's associated to some degree 
with the proclivity for sacrifice of the

2358
02:03:55,211 --> 02:04:00,211
present to the future,
but finding ways of testing that has 

2359
02:04:00,211 --> 02:04:00,211
proved very,
very difficult.

2360
02:04:00,211 --> 02:04:02,050
So but the,
the,

2361
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:05,020
the relationship between sacrifice and 
delay of gratification,

2362
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:07,360
those are the same words,
right?

2363
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:12,070
Delayed gratification is a sacrifice.
It's and you know,

2364
02:04:12,071 --> 02:04:13,720
there's famous experiments,
you know,

2365
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:18,780
you may know the marshmallow experiment 
and that is basically you take kids four

2366
02:04:20,121 --> 02:04:24,490
or so and you say you sit them in a room
and at a little table and you say,

2367
02:04:24,491 --> 02:04:27,100
here's a marshmallow.
If you don't eat that for 10 minutes,

2368
02:04:27,101 --> 02:04:28,630
we'll come in and give you another 
marshmallow.

2369
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:34,140
Right?
And so the kids and they videotape the 

2370
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:36,571
kids and the tapes are actually pretty 
funny because the poor kids do 

2371
02:04:36,571 --> 02:04:36,571
everything.
They can know what to look at that candy

2372
02:04:36,571 --> 02:04:38,430
or marshmallow like they sit on their 
hands,

2373
02:04:38,431 --> 02:04:40,020
they hum.
They look at the ceiling.

2374
02:04:40,021 --> 02:04:43,820
It's like they try to distract 
themselves and some of them just know.

2375
02:04:43,821 --> 02:04:44,280
It's like,
Oh,

2376
02:04:44,281 --> 02:04:49,281
to hell with it.
They eat it and then others can manage 

2377
02:04:49,281 --> 02:04:49,281
it,
and those were the.

2378
02:04:49,281 --> 02:04:50,700
The.
The data showed.

2379
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:55,700
You know,
I wouldn't say this study has been 

2380
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:57,621
replicated many times,
but the data showed quite clearly that 

2381
02:04:57,621 --> 02:04:58,470
the kids who could delay gratification 
out in early stage,

2382
02:04:58,471 --> 02:05:00,690
we're doing quite a bit better later in 
life now.

2383
02:05:00,691 --> 02:05:05,691
I don't know to what degree that was 
controlled for Icu because such things 

2384
02:05:05,691 --> 02:05:07,590
matter,
but the point is is that,

2385
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:08,910
well,
the point is,

2386
02:05:08,911 --> 02:05:11,490
the point that you're making is that you
can delay.

2387
02:05:11,491 --> 02:05:16,491
You can only delay gratification 
intelligently though if the social 

2388
02:05:16,491 --> 02:05:16,560
structure is stable,
right?

2389
02:05:16,561 --> 02:05:19,080
Because basically what if you delay 
gratification,

2390
02:05:19,081 --> 02:05:22,770
you're making a bargain with the 
potential future and the bargaining has.

2391
02:05:22,771 --> 02:05:27,771
Everybody's going to keep acting the 
same way so that the future is the same 

2392
02:05:27,771 --> 02:05:30,981
as the present because otherwise you'll 
delay gratification and then everything 

2393
02:05:30,981 --> 02:05:32,460
will fall apart and you won't get your 
cake and you won't get to eat it,

2394
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:38,060
and so society has to be quite stable.
It has to be stabilized by the 

2395
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:40,770
contractual relationship between people 
before delaying.

2396
02:05:40,771 --> 02:05:45,771
Gratification is a useful strategy.
This is also why you see in chaotic 

2397
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:49,320
circumstances where the future becomes 
uncertain.

2398
02:05:49,321 --> 02:05:52,080
People forgo delay of gratification 
very,

2399
02:05:52,081 --> 02:05:55,590
very rapidly and and,
and perhaps appropriately so,

2400
02:05:55,591 --> 02:05:57,900
although you can get a spiral going in 
the other direction.

2401
02:05:58,340 --> 02:05:58,560
So

2402
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:19,690
yeah,

2403
02:06:26,530 --> 02:06:31,530
I would say it's a chicken and egg 
problem because what happens as you 

2404
02:06:31,530 --> 02:06:32,890
stabilize societies,
being conscientious,

2405
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:38,190
conscientious becomes more useful,
and so then you're going to be selected 

2406
02:06:39,401 --> 02:06:44,401
for as a consequence of being 
conscientious and that's going to 

2407
02:06:44,401 --> 02:06:45,250
stabilize the society even more.
These are,

2408
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:47,620
these are roughly known as Baldwin 
Effects.

2409
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:51,610
So that's where,
let's call it a genetic transformation,

2410
02:06:51,611 --> 02:06:54,970
produces a behavioral transformation 
that transforms the environment.

2411
02:06:54,971 --> 02:06:57,910
So the genetic transformation is more 
likely to propagate.

2412
02:06:58,180 --> 02:07:03,180
You can get unbelievably rapid 
evolutionary movements when when you get

2413
02:07:03,401 --> 02:07:05,800
a loop like that developing and and 
they,

2414
02:07:05,801 --> 02:07:09,910
they happen frequently and that's,
that's also how in some sense of meaning

2415
02:07:09,911 --> 02:07:14,770
can be turned into a genetic can 
manifest itself genetically,

2416
02:07:14,771 --> 02:07:19,771
so if you have an idea that spreads 
through the culture and it tilts the 

2417
02:07:19,771 --> 02:07:21,850
culture in a certain way such that those
who hold that idea are likely to be more

2418
02:07:21,851 --> 02:07:26,851
successful,
then the meme in the biology will align 

2419
02:07:26,851 --> 02:07:29,761
themselves across time and and while I 
think you see that happening,

2420
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:35,480
that's that to some degree,
that's what's happened as religious 

2421
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:35,480
stories have propagated themselves as 
well,

2422
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:39,100
because as,
as the idea of the hero becomes clear,

2423
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:44,190
so to speak,
and then it manifests itself more 

2424
02:07:44,190 --> 02:07:44,470
clearly in the society,
then there's more rewards for doing it.

2425
02:07:44,650 --> 02:07:49,650
Then the selection pressures get more 
positively related to that kind of 

2426
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:50,800
behavior in the whole thing loops 
upwards.

2427
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:53,230
So it's something like that.

2428
02:07:55,090 --> 02:07:57,380
In terms of treating mental health 
disorders,

2429
02:07:57,381 --> 02:08:02,381
where do you think we should or have be 
pharmaceutical interventions secretary?

2430
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:13,230
At what point is depression and anxiety 
should be treated with medicine?

2431
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:16,540
That's what the.

2432
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:19,230
Okay,
that's a good question.

2433
02:08:19,231 --> 02:08:24,231
So the question is,
how do you differentiate the utility of 

2434
02:08:24,231 --> 02:08:27,800
behavioral slash psychotherapeutic 
treatments for conditions like 

2435
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:28,830
depression versus medical treatments?
Okay,

2436
02:08:28,831 --> 02:08:30,600
so the first thing I would say is,
um,

2437
02:08:31,230 --> 02:08:33,990
don't underestimate the utility of 
medical interventions.

2438
02:08:34,890 --> 02:08:36,720
Depression is a cat,
a catastrophe.

2439
02:08:36,721 --> 02:08:41,721
It carries with it a very high suicide 
rate and it also levels people out and 

2440
02:08:41,721 --> 02:08:44,650
it's really hard on their families and 
so and it,

2441
02:08:44,651 --> 02:08:47,370
and it's physiologically extraordinarily
damaging.

2442
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:52,110
And so if you're in a depressive state 
and it's severe,

2443
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:56,040
you can try an antidepressant.
You'll know in a month if it works,

2444
02:08:56,430 --> 02:09:01,430
if it works well,
maybe it'll help you get your life 

2445
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,430
together.
Like we could say,

2446
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:02,160
well maybe you're depressed because your
life isn't very well together.

2447
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:05,010
Could be.
Sometimes people are depressed,

2448
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:10,160
their life is just,
it isn't fine because no one's life is 

2449
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:10,160
fine.

2450
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:13,550
Everyone's life is a tragedy,
but sometimes people have their lives in

2451
02:09:13,561 --> 02:09:18,561
order,
as much as you could expect anyone to 

2452
02:09:18,561 --> 02:09:18,561
have.
They have friends,

2453
02:09:18,561 --> 02:09:19,830
they have an intimate relationship,
they have a career that they like,

2454
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:20,530
you know,
they're,

2455
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:25,710
they're qualified,
industrious people working hard on what 

2456
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:25,710
they're doing and,
and,

2457
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:30,640
and really playing a minimum number of 
games with themselves and they're 

2458
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:33,210
terribly depressed.
Antidepressant man that's sometimes that

2459
02:09:33,211 --> 02:09:35,610
will just fix it.
And so hooray,

2460
02:09:35,611 --> 02:09:40,611
like you were biological entity if,
if there's something out there that can 

2461
02:09:40,611 --> 02:09:43,110
help you strengthen yourself so that you
can prevail.

2462
02:09:43,410 --> 02:09:44,850
Great.
And you know,

2463
02:09:44,851 --> 02:09:46,140
people,
you hear,

2464
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:48,120
everyone takes antidepressants,
you know,

2465
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:53,180
everyone's taking them.
It's like no one takes those bloody 

2466
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:55,401
things without serious consideration.
Half the time I spend with my clients 

2467
02:09:55,401 --> 02:09:59,721
who are depressed is often the two years
long attempt to get them to tentatively 

2468
02:09:59,721 --> 02:10:04,371
try an antidepressant because there are 
so guilty that they're relying on an 

2469
02:10:04,371 --> 02:10:06,480
external crutch to sort out their lives 
that they can't even tolerate it.

2470
02:10:07,230 --> 02:10:08,010
But you know,
I say,

2471
02:10:08,011 --> 02:10:10,800
well look man,
what if you had diabetes,

2472
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:15,000
you know are going to take your insulin.
It's like you got stressed.

2473
02:10:15,001 --> 02:10:20,001
He blew out at your weakest point.
That's what happens when you get 

2474
02:10:20,001 --> 02:10:22,521
stressed.
If there's something out there that 

2475
02:10:22,521 --> 02:10:22,521
might help you,
it's like try it for God's sake,

2476
02:10:22,521 --> 02:10:26,040
you'll know in a month and you'd just 
stop if it doesn't work.

2477
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:31,400
Now having said that,
you want to do a multidimensional 

2478
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:31,400
analysis.
It's like,

2479
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:32,340
well,
do you have any friends?

2480
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:35,360
Do you have an intimate relationship or 
are you pursuing one?

2481
02:10:35,361 --> 02:10:38,000
Do you have a reasonable career?
Are you as educated as you are?

2482
02:10:38,001 --> 02:10:43,001
Intelligent.
You have something useful to do with 

2483
02:10:43,001 --> 02:10:43,430
your time outside of work?
Do you have a drug or alcohol problem?

2484
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:48,550
Are there other behavioral issues like 
sleep dysregulation and lack of eating 

2485
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:48,950
that are contributing to the pathology?

2486
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:54,160
You want to differentiate all of that 
and wherever you can make a behavioral 

2487
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:57,671
intervention so much the better,
but sometimes too you're dealing with 

2488
02:10:57,671 --> 02:10:59,120
people whose lives are so rare that they
don't even know where to start.

2489
02:10:59,330 --> 02:11:04,330
There are different than the ones who 
have everything in order to say and you 

2490
02:11:04,330 --> 02:11:04,330
say,
well,

2491
02:11:04,330 --> 02:11:08,110
try this man.
Maybe you won't cut your throat in the 

2492
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:09,680
next month because if your dad it's 
going to be hard to work with you and so

2493
02:11:10,130 --> 02:11:13,880
so medical interventions,
anything.

2494
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:19,420
If you're sick,
you do what is necessary to get better 

2495
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:20,810
and you leave your pride behind if you,
if you have to,

2496
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:24,410
and uh,
that that says nothing about the utility

2497
02:11:24,411 --> 02:11:29,411
of the behavioral interventions,
you want to hit the problem with 

2498
02:11:29,411 --> 02:11:32,231
everything you have at your disposal.
But some antidepressants especially,

2499
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:36,650
especially for people whose lives are 
together and who are depressed,

2500
02:11:36,651 --> 02:11:38,900
antidepressants can be absolutely 
miraculous.

2501
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:44,620
So you know,
when you hear about the clinical 

2502
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:47,920
evidence in their favor being iffy,
and that's partly because the diagnosis 

2503
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:48,170
of depression isn't very well 
formulated.

2504
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,010
It's very different to have a terrible 
life than to be depressed.

2505
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:55,850
And antidepressants can only help you so
much if you have a terrible life.

2506
02:11:56,810 --> 02:11:57,290
So

2507
02:11:58,830 --> 02:11:59,040
yeah,

2508
02:12:01,140 --> 02:12:01,650
yes,

2509
02:12:05,790 --> 02:12:10,790
these activities that are meaningful and
consciousness would be very good at 

2510
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:15,091
identifying and I feel like some things 
that are not as useful.

2511
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:29,070
Sure.
That's what does some personalities,

2512
02:12:30,590 --> 02:12:33,000
for example,
video games are.

2513
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:38,060
Okay.
So the question is can that sense of 

2514
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:38,060
meaning behind jacked?
And the answer to that is absolutely,

2515
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:43,340
absolutely.
Because you could say that the ultimate 

2516
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:46,110
sense of meaning is composed of the 
Union of fragmentary senses,

2517
02:12:46,111 --> 02:12:49,410
of meaning and the fragmentary senses of
meaning can be overwhelmingly powerful,

2518
02:12:49,530 --> 02:12:52,440
anger,
sexual lust and and,

2519
02:12:52,441 --> 02:12:55,140
and those sorts of things that you 
experienced when say when you're playing

2520
02:12:55,141 --> 02:12:58,650
a video game which are very carefully 
calibrated to keep you on the,

2521
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:03,680
on the edge of exploration,
let's say now I'm not a full of video 

2522
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:08,361
games because games are complicated and 
it isn't clear what people are doing 

2523
02:13:08,361 --> 02:13:08,780
when they're playing them,
you know,

2524
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,190
they may be expanding their cognitive 
skills,

2525
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:16,280
they may be learning to cooperate,
they may be learning to engage in 

2526
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:19,071
complex problem solving and so,
but part of it's also a matter of 

2527
02:13:19,071 --> 02:13:19,920
balance,
you know,

2528
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:23,220
50 hours a week,
probably not,

2529
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:26,100
unless you're going to go pro,
right?

2530
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:29,010
Because there's other things you need to
be attending to.

2531
02:13:29,011 --> 02:13:32,730
It's not a stable solution for your 
family,

2532
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:35,640
your society.
It's too one sided.

2533
02:13:35,850 --> 02:13:38,610
Yeah.
And you can get pulled down rabbit holes

2534
02:13:38,611 --> 02:13:42,090
of all sorts that are one sided pursuits
of meaning.

2535
02:13:42,450 --> 02:13:47,450
So it's something we're actually going 
to talk about as the later classes 

2536
02:13:47,450 --> 02:13:49,440
unfold.
The question is how do you stop yourself

2537
02:13:49,441 --> 02:13:52,500
from falling prey to a path or a sense 
of meaning?

2538
02:13:52,890 --> 02:13:57,890
And I think one of the answers to that 
is don't lie because what you're hoping 

2539
02:13:58,051 --> 02:14:02,430
is that your nervous system is 
sufficiently healthy and well program so

2540
02:14:02,431 --> 02:14:07,431
that what it reads out to you is 
reliable and if you pathologize your 

2541
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:13,080
psyche by either through sins of 
omission,

2542
02:14:13,081 --> 02:14:18,081
let's say or or outright deception,
you're gonna work that internal 

2543
02:14:18,081 --> 02:14:21,441
structure and it's not going to read out
properly to you and then your sense of 

2544
02:14:21,441 --> 02:14:21,441
meaning will lead you astray.

2545
02:14:21,441 --> 02:14:25,380
So like one of the reasons for speaking 
the truth,

2546
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:27,780
I shouldn't say that because you don't 
know how to speak the truth,

2547
02:14:27,781 --> 02:14:31,770
but you do know how not to lie and it's 
a game.

2548
02:14:31,771 --> 02:14:34,080
You're playing with yourself.
You can define the damn lies.

2549
02:14:34,081 --> 02:14:36,370
No one else has to do that for you.
You,

2550
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:41,600
you try not to otter falsehoods because 
you wore your neurological structure by 

2551
02:14:41,941 --> 02:14:44,580
doing so,
and then it will read out pathologically

2552
02:14:44,581 --> 02:14:48,090
and then if you rely on it to guide you,
it will run you right off a cliff.

2553
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:53,780
So that's why there's a moral element to
this is if you're going to rely on your 

2554
02:14:53,780 --> 02:14:57,501
sense of meaning,
make sure that you don't pollute the 

2555
02:14:57,501 --> 02:14:58,390
mechanism.
See,

2556
02:14:58,410 --> 02:15:03,410
this is.
This is partly why people go to 

2557
02:15:03,410 --> 02:15:03,410
confession,
right?

2558
02:15:03,410 --> 02:15:07,851
Which is,
which is like a serious 

2559
02:15:07,851 --> 02:15:07,851
psychotherapeutic technique.
It's like,

2560
02:15:07,851 --> 02:15:11,210
okay,
what stupid miserable wretched things 

2561
02:15:11,210 --> 02:15:11,210
did I do this week?

2562
02:15:11,210 --> 02:15:12,840
That's a good thing too to make 
conscious,

2563
02:15:12,841 --> 02:15:17,841
right?
Because maybe you cannot do them the 

2564
02:15:17,841 --> 02:15:17,841
next week and you think,
well,

2565
02:15:17,841 --> 02:15:17,841
why would you bother?
It's like,

2566
02:15:17,841 --> 02:15:22,671
well,
you're in a ship sailing across the the 

2567
02:15:22,671 --> 02:15:24,150
stormy seas.
If,

2568
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:29,180
if you're,
if you're hacking holes in it with a 

2569
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:31,671
pick ax,
you should probably pay attention to 

2570
02:15:31,671 --> 02:15:32,550
that before you sink,
so it's a good idea to keep,

2571
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:37,910
to keep what you're doing.
That's stupid in mind so that you can 

2572
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:40,611
stop doing it,
and so then you can more and more rely 

2573
02:15:40,611 --> 02:15:41,010
on yourself and your and your own.
You know,

2574
02:15:41,011 --> 02:15:44,280
your own conscience,
let's say,

2575
02:15:44,281 --> 02:15:45,780
as a guide to proper action.
You know,

2576
02:15:45,781 --> 02:15:50,781
in the Pinocchio story is that the 
conscious was not an unerring guide for 

2577
02:15:50,781 --> 02:15:54,780
Pinocchio.
It had to learn and so and so.

2578
02:15:55,170 --> 02:16:00,170
It's also partly pushing yourself into 
new situations and differentiating 

2579
02:16:00,170 --> 02:16:04,011
yourself so that you get wiser and so 
it's courage as well as truth,

2580
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:08,370
that those might be the two.
There's more beauty,

2581
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:09,240
courage,
truth,

2582
02:16:09,241 --> 02:16:11,970
you know,
the fundamental virtues.

2583
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:14,730
Yeah.
Why be virtuous?

2584
02:16:14,731 --> 02:16:19,731
That's the question.
And so that you can bear the suffering 

2585
02:16:19,731 --> 02:16:22,050
of life without becoming corrupt.
Right?

2586
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:25,560
It's practical.
It's practical.

2587
02:16:25,561 --> 02:16:27,480
If there's nothing more practical than 
that,

2588
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:30,010
so unless you want misery and

2589
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:32,320
people do,
you know it's exciting.

2590
02:16:33,010 --> 02:16:36,190
Misery.
So other questions?

2591
02:16:39,170 --> 02:16:39,880
All right,
then.

2592
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:44,590
See you next Wednesday.
