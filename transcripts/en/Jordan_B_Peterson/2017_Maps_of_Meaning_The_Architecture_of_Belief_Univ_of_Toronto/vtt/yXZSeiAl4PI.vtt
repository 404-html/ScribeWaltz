1
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 1>So today we're going to delve a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit more deeply into the realm of </v>

2
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.461
<v Speaker 1>symbolic representation and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what I think I'm doing and</v>

3
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>then we'll show you a bunch of examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

4
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Then I want to tell you a couple more </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and so I'll tell you the stories</v>

5
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>in the second half of the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

6
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>it was Carl Jung who popularized and </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated the idea of archetypes.</v>

7
00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>They weren't his idea platonic forms or </v>
<v Speaker 1>an I are,</v>

8
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>are archetypes essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ideals are an archetype.</v>

9
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but young,</v>

10
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I think he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hadn't been done before was to </v>

11
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 1>suggest that he as well as suggesting as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud did,</v>

12
00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>that human beings are composed of sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>

13
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.230
<v Speaker 1>You pointed out as I did to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that some of those personalities have a </v>

14
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:11.411
<v Speaker 1>universal character and so that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be thought about as transcendent </v>

15
00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>entities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could think about those while </v>

16
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.151
<v Speaker 1>they have been thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even put forward as gods of one form or </v>

17
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:19.151
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>now when you talked about archetypes was</v>
<v Speaker 1>never clear what he meant and </v>

19
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.050
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that was because the </v>

20
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>archetype is a very complicated idea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very complicated phenomena and you can</v>

21
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:35.681
<v Speaker 1>think about it biologically and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it socially and you can </v>

22
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>think about it as something that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual participates in creating,</v>

23
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>so it's not that easy to localize it and</v>

24
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.360
<v Speaker 1>and as well it's not that easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>localize it and as well</v>

25
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was never clear about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe of archetypes look like at </v>

26
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.751
<v Speaker 1>some time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spoke as if they were a relatively </v>

27
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:06.721
<v Speaker 1>small number and then at other times he </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke as if they were innumerable and I </v>

28
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:09.850
<v Speaker 1>think the reason for that is in part it </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on the level of analysis,</v>

29
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more transcendent the archetype,</v>

30
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the fewer there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

31
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 1>but they differentiate because you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

32
00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:17.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many hero archetypes are there?</v>

33
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And one answer could be one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they differentiate all the way out </v>

34
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.270
<v Speaker 1>into the diverse range of works of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction that we have.</v>

35
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:30.271
<v Speaker 1>So you could say there's as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>variants of the hero archetype roughly </v>

36
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.901
<v Speaker 1>speaking as there are works of fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think about it as a hierarchy </v>

37
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 1>with the ultimate archetype at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then another question might be,</v>

38
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.000
<v Speaker 1>what does the landscape of ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypes look like?</v>

39
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:46.921
<v Speaker 1>that's what I tried to lay out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm trying to lay out in </v>

41
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:49.471
<v Speaker 1>this diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now why do you want to know that </v>

42
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a practical reason or way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a number of practical reasons as</v>

43
00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:57.931
<v Speaker 1>well as intellectual reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most relevant practical </v>

44
00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:01.891
<v Speaker 1>reasons as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that integrating narratives and so </v>

45
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>those would include political </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives.</v>

46
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:09.151
<v Speaker 1>Integrating narratives have their forest</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they draw on universal </v>

47
00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they wouldn't have any power,</v>

48
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're basically stories,</v>

49
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.380
<v Speaker 1>an integrating archetypes like the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people that Hitler sold the Germans</v>

50
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>or that the Germans and Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocreated,</v>

51
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:25.951
<v Speaker 1>which is a much more accurate way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it that had motive force </v>

52
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:29.701
<v Speaker 1>because it had an archetypal essence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so political stories derive their </v>

53
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:34.741
<v Speaker 1>power from the underlying archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations that obviously because </v>

54
00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>they have to be concerned with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people find important.</v>

55
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>how can you sell a political message to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone if it isn't about something they</v>

57
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>find important and if it's important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

58
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be grounded at least to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree in their biological,</v>

59
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

60
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>in their biological substructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean if you're talking to hungry people </v>

61
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>about food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a story that you can tell,</v>

62
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it,</v>

63
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hooks them deeply,</v>

64
00:03:55.901 --> 00:04:00.901
<v Speaker 1>it hooks them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooks deep into their motivational </v>

65
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>systems to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use a narrative of Utopia,</v>

66
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>which is the land of milk and honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking a very,</v>

67
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:09.391
<v Speaker 1>very old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also tapping deeply into </v>

68
00:04:09.391 --> 00:04:13.530
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic human longings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that political </v>

69
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 1>narratives incorporated archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes is,</v>

70
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>is not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an idea that I would consider a</v>

71
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:25.921
<v Speaker 1>particularly controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting it that way might be okay.</v>

72
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with political narratives</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation,</v>

73
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>is that they can rapidly transformed </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into a theologies and </v>

74
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>ideologies are dangerous for variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>

75
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>but the primary reason for their danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a hypothesis,</v>

76
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 1>is because of their one sided nature.</v>

77
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.670
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that they capitalize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris.</v>

78
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Otitis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is even a better way of thinking</v>

79
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

80
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>a profound underlying narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't tell the entire story and</v>

81
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>so then if you're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation in the world because you are</v>

82
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>fragmented and chaotic and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>provides you with a partial story that's</v>

83
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:06.500
<v Speaker 1>going to serve an integrating function </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very.</v>

84
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is that if you're chaotic </v>

85
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.851
<v Speaker 1>and confused and you go see a therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has a particular kind of practice </v>

86
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Friday and behavioral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive rigidity and whatever,</v>

87
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergoing that course of therapy is </v>

88
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>going to be good for you and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might even come to view your life in,</v>

89
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>in the terms of that therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

91
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.710
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that therapeutic practice right </v>

93
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.710
<v Speaker 1>for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

94
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>maybe it could have been Rogerian </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of Freud and say,</v>

95
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>and the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

96
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably could be,</v>

97
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>could have been because roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

98
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>any coherent ordering principle is </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than none.</v>

99
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also a good way to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about human development from a </v>

100
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.310
<v Speaker 1>intellectual perspective is that partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what has to be provided to individuals</v>

101
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>as they mature into an adult adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some kind of ordering structure,</v>

102
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.690
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the fact that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who criticize the dogmatic element of </v>

103
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 2>religious belief don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

104
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.550
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand that you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to provide people with a </v>

105
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 2>determined that structure of support of </v>
<v Speaker 2>some type,</v>

106
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.570
<v Speaker 2>even if it's constricting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricting and crushing for that </v>

107
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.651
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to pass through a disciplinary </v>

108
00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:32.591
<v Speaker 2>structure before and even in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be free before you're </v>

109
00:06:32.591 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 2>disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not free,</v>

110
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:37.961
<v Speaker 2>you're just chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have to practice some set of </v>

111
00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 2>routines and rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say,</v>

112
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:44.441
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't necessarily have to be </v>

113
00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:44.441
<v Speaker 2>religious and they could be secular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could become a lawyer,</v>

114
00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:45.950
<v Speaker 2>you could become a plumber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can become a carpenter.</v>

115
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:50.951
<v Speaker 2>And I would say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's far better than not becoming </v>

116
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:56.291
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with an identity that </v>

117
00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.501
<v Speaker 2>isn't rooted into the archetypes is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves you incomplete because the </v>

118
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:03.221
<v Speaker 2>archetypical routing of the identity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what helps you grapple with the </v>

119
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:07.661
<v Speaker 2>fundamental existential problems of life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whether you're a carpenter or a </v>

120
00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:09.390
<v Speaker 2>plumber or a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still going to.</v>

121
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Your soul is still going to hunger for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some deeper form of identity and you're </v>

122
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.241
<v Speaker 2>not going to get that without being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without having your practical identity </v>

123
00:07:19.241 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 2>encapsulated in something that's that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater from a philosophical perspective</v>

124
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:27.941
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps even deeper than philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I think the archetypal stories </v>

125
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:27.941
<v Speaker 2>are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>

126
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.300
<v Speaker 2>There are the structure within which </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy itself is embedded and </v>

127
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 2>outside of that as a behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

128
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:38.561
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about how those evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there's there's behavioral </v>

129
00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:41.831
<v Speaker 2>evolution of something approximating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consensual morality and then stories </v>

130
00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:46.241
<v Speaker 2>about that consensual morality emerge </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that inside that the structures of </v>

131
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.340
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nest and all of those things have to be </v>

132
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 2>addressed by your identity to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree or you're weak.</v>

133
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be sent by doubts.</v>

134
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:59.231
<v Speaker 2>You're be by anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your easy to stop and you don't have </v>

135
00:07:59.231 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 2>much motivation and none of that's good.</v>

136
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not good at all because life </v>
<v Speaker 2>presents you with enough real obstacles </v>

137
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.250
<v Speaker 2>in the fort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face of genuine suffering so that</v>

138
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 2>unless you're strongly grounded and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real mood reason for moving forward,</v>

139
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get stopped and as soon </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you stopped,</v>

140
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 2>you are one miserable thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

141
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.520
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the definition of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>misery is to be paralyzed by anxiety and</v>

142
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 2>emotional pain and also have no motive </v>
<v Speaker 2>force forward.</v>

143
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible state and so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be in that state and you have to</v>

144
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 2>have an identity that's powerful enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>and deeply rooted enough,</v>

145
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:38.411
<v Speaker 2>so the most profound doubts that might </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge about your life are met by </v>

146
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 2>something of equivalent force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

147
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:43.520
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to review the symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain and briefly and then I'm going to</v>

148
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:46.280
<v Speaker 2>show you a bunch of different examples </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how it plays itself out.</v>

149
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Partly architecturally and symbolically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also partly politically because I </v>

150
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 2>want to show you how both of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

151
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>how those things parallel one another </v>
<v Speaker 2>and partly what I'm hoping</v>

152
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.190
<v Speaker 1>is that understanding the full domain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal symbolic representation will </v>

153
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:09.321
<v Speaker 1>also inoculate you against ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession because you'll know when </v>

154
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you're told a half sided one sided </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological story,</v>

155
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 1>you'll know that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing in the story.</v>

156
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

157
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.760
<v Speaker 1>there's paces that aren't being told or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's part of the story that isn't </v>

158
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.821
<v Speaker 1>being revealed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it's a story about his tout </v>

159
00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical modern culture is and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive you think.</v>

160
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:31.641
<v Speaker 1>Well yes obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about the beneficial aspect of </v>

161
00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 1>it and how is that being represented and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with and and so.</v>

162
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:39.681
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same story about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative element of the human being </v>

163
00:09:39.681 --> 00:09:42.681
<v Speaker 1>which you hear stories like that all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time because I think perhaps more </v>

164
00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:44.740
<v Speaker 1>intensely since the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

165
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because I wasn't around before then,</v>

166
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was like previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

167
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.770
<v Speaker 1>There is this idea that people hold and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's promoted that there's something </v>

168
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.230
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally no cancerous about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

169
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 1>The it was the club of Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when they pronounced it,</v>

170
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:02.850
<v Speaker 1>everyone on the planet was going to die </v>
<v Speaker 1>of starvation by the year 2000.</v>

171
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>That human beings were no better than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer on the planet.</v>

172
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

173
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things about us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be improved,</v>

175
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:16.401
<v Speaker 1>but when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you portray the human only as </v>

176
00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question should arise.</v>

177
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>

178
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 1>but what about the positive part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you telling that story and it</v>

179
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>doesn't take you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is be sick once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a hospital where you get competent</v>

181
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 1>care to understand that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can get in competent care to,</v>

182
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you get really competent </v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

183
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

184
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:39.741
<v Speaker 1>it's really good that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there who have their act </v>

185
00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:39.741
<v Speaker 1>together and are trying to put things </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

186
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can't forget that in your story</v>

187
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:46.701
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to forget that in your </v>

188
00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:46.701
<v Speaker 1>story about yourself either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

189
00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:50.180
<v Speaker 1>so what is the fundamental landscape?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the basic idea is that it's,</v>

190
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated.</v>

191
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.560
<v Speaker 1>You can look at it multiple different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

192
00:10:55.561 --> 00:11:00.561
<v Speaker 1>It's predicated on the contrast between </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored an unexplored territory or the </v>

193
00:11:00.561 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 1>contrast between the interpretive </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

194
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.580
<v Speaker 1>but philosophers like Kant talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the real world manifestation that </v>

195
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.740
<v Speaker 1>underlies under whose existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlies the validity of empirical </v>

196
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

197
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.540
<v Speaker 1>There's you and your structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You interpret the world,</v>

198
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:20.541
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the world informing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the explored territory </v>

199
00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:22.230
<v Speaker 1>versus unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

200
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:27.231
<v Speaker 1>or it's order versus chaos or it's or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another variant of that would be </v>

201
00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>it's the hero going out into the unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Qa,</v>

202
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.760
<v Speaker 1>to encounter the dragon of chaos and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gather the information that is out there</v>

203
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.280
<v Speaker 1>in the unknown and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

204
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.520
<v Speaker 1>and I tried to make the case to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm often accused most recently </v>

205
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 1>on Sam Harris's podcast of making up </v>
<v Speaker 1>post hoc stories.</v>

206
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a set of stories.</v>

207
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:53.781
<v Speaker 1>You can interpret them any way you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course that is a danger because you </v>

208
00:11:53.781 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>bring an interpretive structure to bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>on every set of facts.</v>

209
00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:00.450
<v Speaker 1>How do I know that this isn't just an </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary post hoc analysis and my </v>

210
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.071
<v Speaker 1>answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a technical answer is it manifests </v>

211
00:12:05.071 --> 00:12:08.461
<v Speaker 1>itself at multiple layers of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and the probability that </v>

212
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.740
<v Speaker 1>it's merely an imposition of an a priori</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretive structure is decreased by </v>

213
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.941
<v Speaker 1>the number of different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation that you can detect the </v>

214
00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:17.941
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

215
00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 1>it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

216
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>it's axiomatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have five senses.</v>

217
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.950
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they need to report a different </v>

218
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.021
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why in science use multiple </v>

219
00:12:28.021 --> 00:12:30.481
<v Speaker 1>methods to detect the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I tried to point </v>

220
00:12:30.481 --> 00:12:34.081
<v Speaker 1>out is that you can map this archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure onto brain structure quite </v>

221
00:12:34.081 --> 00:12:38.820
<v Speaker 1>nicely even onto hemispheric structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the function of the subcortical </v>

222
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.720
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even more particularly,</v>

223
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:45.721
<v Speaker 1>you can map it onto the function of </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific neuro psychological systems </v>

224
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>within the.</v>

225
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Within the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the biological neurology,</v>

226
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>we do have an interpretive structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

227
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.800
<v Speaker 1>That's your map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

228
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>of of expectation and desire in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

229
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.680
<v Speaker 1>That's your model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a brain area of roughly the </v>

230
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although this is an oversimplification,</v>

231
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 1>it compares that with incoming sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

232
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.620
<v Speaker 1>which is also a model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we won't get into that for the sake </v>

233
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:10.620
<v Speaker 1>of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's explored territory,</v>

234
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory and the thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the center doing the comparison,</v>

235
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:19.650
<v Speaker 1>that's the knower and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's strikes me as a highly unlikely,</v>

236
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:24.811
<v Speaker 1>although you're welcome to criticize a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you will see that kind of </v>

237
00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:28.771
<v Speaker 1>stacking of evidence across multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>domains of inquiry without there </v>

238
00:13:28.771 --> 00:13:32.380
<v Speaker 1>actually being a pattern there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not merely post hoc analysis and</v>

239
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 1>even the people who derive these </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns like young to begin with.</v>

240
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's say look cross culturally at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

241
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:39.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

242
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:44.310
<v Speaker 1>here's a manifestation of a pattern and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a separate culture and you can </v>

243
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.310
<v Speaker 1>see the same pattern.</v>

244
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 1>So there's some attempt there to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>methodologically rigorous.</v>

245
00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 1>He did the same thing with people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies and dreams and then again,</v>

246
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:55.530
<v Speaker 1>by mapping those onto people's behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>and therapy also had them test out the </v>

247
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.581
<v Speaker 1>ideas in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these aren't just trivial </v>

248
00:13:59.581 --> 00:13:59.590
<v Speaker 1>methodologically as people make them out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

249
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:04.591
<v Speaker 1>And especially that's the case when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can put a biological underpinning </v>

250
00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:07.831
<v Speaker 1>underneath them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the proposition is explored </v>

251
00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:10.831
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory and the explorer </v>

252
00:14:10.831 --> 00:14:14.400
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a differentiation of those two </v>

253
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.160
<v Speaker 1>things into positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

254
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Because everything complex has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative element and so </v>

255
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.930
<v Speaker 1>explored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Territory explored territory can become </v>

256
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:25.300
<v Speaker 1>stultifying and crushing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tyranny,</v>

257
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:30.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's also provides the structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that informs and protects you and </v>

258
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.610
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that that can kill you obviously,</v>

259
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the place that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go when you're static and dead and you </v>

260
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 1>need new water and you need new life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need new information,</v>

261
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:47.821
<v Speaker 1>so it's constant movement out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and back out into the unknown </v>

262
00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 1>and back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what human beings are like,</v>

263
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:54.721
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're information foragers and then the </v>

264
00:14:54.721 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 1>individual is both positive and negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know that</v>

265
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 1>because you know yourself and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and you know yourself,</v>

266
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:07.061
<v Speaker 1>you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of you that are that are </v>

267
00:15:07.061 --> 00:15:09.311
<v Speaker 1>good classically speaking or good even </v>
<v Speaker 1>by your own definition and other parts </v>

268
00:15:09.311 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 1>that really could use to say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum,</v>

269
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.500
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous amount of work and you also</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that about other people and if you </v>

270
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.710
<v Speaker 1>get truly unlucky with yourself or other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

271
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it won't merely be that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying hard enough.</v>

272
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:27.070
<v Speaker 1>You'll encounter something in you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's absolutely malevolent and </v>

273
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>bent on destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's also not a hypothesis.</v>

274
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:35.561
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the literature on post traumatic </v>

275
00:15:35.561 --> 00:15:38.651
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder reveals quite quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly that people typically develop </v>

276
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:44.081
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they encounter some form of malevolence </v>

277
00:15:44.081 --> 00:15:44.750
<v Speaker 1>and if it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's ever happened to you,</v>

278
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:49.751
<v Speaker 1>you know that it's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not some figment of your </v>

279
00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>

280
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.480
<v Speaker 1>So and then that entire world that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the world that can be </v>

281
00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:01.060
<v Speaker 1>comprehended is nested inside a broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic network and that seems to be </v>

282
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:04.610
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic network that's made up of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos,</v>

283
00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 1>which is something like our </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the set of unknown,</v>

284
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.780
<v Speaker 1>the set of all currently unknowable </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

285
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

286
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:17.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like the category of zero or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>category of infinity and the reason that</v>

287
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:22.811
<v Speaker 1>we formulated that category is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't only want to know how to solve </v>

288
00:16:22.811 --> 00:16:25.130
<v Speaker 1>a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like we don't only want to know how</v>

289
00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:30.131
<v Speaker 1>to win a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to know how to win this set of </v>

290
00:16:30.131 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 1>all possible games and we want to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the set of all possible problems.</v>

291
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:37.750
<v Speaker 1>And so what human beings have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do for the last forever is </v>

292
00:16:37.901 --> 00:16:41.470
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of the set of all problems.</v>

293
00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:46.471
<v Speaker 1>And we actually have some ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is playing to win the metagame and </v>

294
00:16:46.471 --> 00:16:48.100
<v Speaker 1>not the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one solution.</v>

295
00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:53.101
<v Speaker 1>Another solution is go out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown voluntarily and gather the </v>

296
00:16:53.101 --> 00:16:55.420
<v Speaker 1>information that lies there because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually updates you.</v>

297
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

298
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.380
<v Speaker 1>the other one is to make sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was discovered in an articulate</v>

299
00:17:10.381 --> 00:17:15.381
<v Speaker 1>form not very long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of sacrifice is something </v>

300
00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:15.381
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

301
00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:18.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't just have to solve the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how do you survive in the present,</v>

302
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.690
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly the problem that </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals are always trying to solve.</v>

303
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.260
<v Speaker 1>You have to solve the problem of how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive in the present,</v>

304
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:27.780
<v Speaker 1>given that you also have to survive next</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

305
00:17:27.781 --> 00:17:28.920
<v Speaker 1>next month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next year,</v>

306
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.420
<v Speaker 1>and among other people and answer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in part is the answer of sacrifice,</v>

307
00:17:33.421 --> 00:17:38.421
<v Speaker 1>which is to give up something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately want now that would even be </v>

308
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:42.141
<v Speaker 1>useful right now so that you accrue more</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit across a broader span of time.</v>

309
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 1>A very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult lesson for animals to </v>

310
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.421
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals have a terrible time learning </v>

311
00:17:50.421 --> 00:17:52.341
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even human have a terrible time </v>

312
00:17:52.341 --> 00:17:55.251
<v Speaker 1>doing it because there were some real </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence in getting while the </v>

313
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 1>getting is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a sub optimal strategy.</v>

314
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.200
<v Speaker 1>If you can stabilize the environment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>spread out your adaptive capability over</v>

315
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:09.201
<v Speaker 1>wider spans of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while so much the better you get what </v>

316
00:18:09.201 --> 00:18:12.531
<v Speaker 1>you need now and you get what you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>later and you get what you want and so </v>

317
00:18:12.531 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 1>does your family and other people at </v>
<v Speaker 1>much better solution.</v>

318
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:18.270
<v Speaker 1>But that requires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It requires precisely sacrificed because</v>

319
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 1>it requires sacrificing the present for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

320
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And that idea of sacrifice emerged like </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our ideas,</v>

321
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 1>first in in action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in acting these things out,</v>

322
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 1>and then conceptualizing them with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies like Indorama,</v>

323
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 1>just the way that piaget described </v>
<v Speaker 1>children first,</v>

324
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:41.450
<v Speaker 1>assimilating the structure of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents' actions by imitating them </v>

325
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 1>rather than by breaking them down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems of rules,</v>

326
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>understanding the rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporating the rules.</v>

327
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how we work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>react and figure things out in action.</v>

328
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Then we imitate our own actions.</v>

329
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And to imitate your own actions is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act yourself out or to act other people </v>

330
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that without having explicit,</v>

331
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:05.511
<v Speaker 1>articulated knowledge and that's it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial to understand that because it </v>

332
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.040
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it explains great mystery,</v>

333
00:19:08.041 --> 00:19:13.041
<v Speaker 1>which is how can we tell the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have meanings that are deeper than </v>

334
00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:16.221
<v Speaker 1>we know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is we have </v>

335
00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:18.710
<v Speaker 1>information encoded in our behavior that</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcends our understanding well how </v>

336
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.960
<v Speaker 1>well we're constantly modifying each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other constantly and the world's </v>

337
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.090
<v Speaker 1>constantly modifying us and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that wellbeing modified.</v>

338
00:19:27.091 --> 00:19:30.330
<v Speaker 1>We should also be able to track how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we're being modified.</v>

339
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.600
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure that out afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's extraordinarily difficult to </v>

340
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.860
<v Speaker 1>look at a whole culture or even a single</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and to say,</v>

341
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:39.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that person?</v>

342
00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Or what is that societal structure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It it.</v>

343
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.480
<v Speaker 1>It supersedes our conscious capacity for</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations were always playing </v>

344
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:47.480
<v Speaker 1>catch up.</v>

345
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.800
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that we don't act out </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

346
00:19:49.801 --> 00:19:51.630
<v Speaker 1>We think sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

347
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.990
<v Speaker 1>the causal pathway can't go the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way because it can,</v>

348
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.760
<v Speaker 1>but more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more frequently.</v>

349
00:19:56.761 --> 00:20:01.761
<v Speaker 1>It's bottom up rather than top down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how everything works in the </v>

350
00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:04.080
<v Speaker 1>biological world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals do and have wisdom,</v>

351
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what they do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can articulate their wisdom,</v>

352
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:10.800
<v Speaker 1>so it's self evident that a process like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this must've occurred.</v>

353
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about wolf dominance </v>

354
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.840
<v Speaker 1>behaviors online the other day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody tweeted and said that it's the </v>

355
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:25.170
<v Speaker 1>only captive wolves that dominate each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other through aggression.</v>

356
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.970
<v Speaker 1>It isn't necessarily the most aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>males that are dominant in the wild.</v>

357
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

358
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:36.380
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that that's what the wall has </v>

359
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.761
<v Speaker 1>already documented among chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that emerges as as appropriate</v>

360
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:47.570
<v Speaker 1>to lead and then to be imitated as </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader isn't untrammeled aggression.</v>

361
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.280
<v Speaker 1>It's some process that is a kin to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests and your interests matching </v>

362
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 1>over some period of time with all of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered simultaneously,</v>

363
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's some equilibrated state of social</v>

364
00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:04.570
<v Speaker 1>behavior embodied even in the behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>of wolves,</v>

365
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:05.680
<v Speaker 1>the behavior of rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

366
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.890
<v Speaker 1>who knew how to play fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The behavior of chimpanzees and </v>

367
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.981
<v Speaker 1>certainly in our own behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more complex be in no small part </v>

368
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 1>because our social structures are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than those of animals,</v>

369
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.050
<v Speaker 1>so therefore much more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robin Dunbar has indicated,</v>

370
00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of the best predictors of brain</v>

371
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:27.991
<v Speaker 1>size predictors or correlates more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely what are the highest correlates </v>

372
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:30.280
<v Speaker 1>at brain size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at.</v>

373
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I think he only looked within primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is group size and that makes sense,</v>

374
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:39.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the complexity of the social </v>

375
00:21:39.391 --> 00:21:41.221
<v Speaker 1>organization increases dramatically as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of individuals involved </v>

376
00:21:41.221 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 1>increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wouldn't say it's group size,</v>

377
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 1>brain size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that determines groups.</v>

378
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.380
<v Speaker 1>How is it's brain size determines group </v>
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>

379
00:21:47.381 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 1>determines brain size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>determines group size in a loop,</v>

380
00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.040
<v Speaker 1>and and many other factors are involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in expanding cortical representation as </v>

381
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.430
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as far as I can tell,</v>

382
00:21:57.431 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything contentious in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those claims and it gives us,</v>

383
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:06.690
<v Speaker 1>gives us a basis out of which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal stories can emerge and it </v>

384
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 1>explains why we can see revealed truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>in them so to speak.</v>

385
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Because the truth was instantiated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral realm,</v>

386
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 1>not in the conceptual realm and through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the you know,</v>

387
00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this in your own life.</v>

388
00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:20.680
<v Speaker 1>You Watch yourself and one day you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aha,</v>

389
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've been up to this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

390
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:25.030
<v Speaker 1>That happens to people in therapy all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

391
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Or you're dealing with some other person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they tell you something.</v>

392
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:32.791
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the last piece fell into </v>

393
00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:32.791
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

394
00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:32.791
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

395
00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I had you completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I get what you're up to.</v>

396
00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 1>And what's happened is my representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>has become more complete,</v>

397
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 1>but it also matches your behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

398
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a concordance between what I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>observed and what actually manifests </v>

399
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.111
<v Speaker 1>itself and so while so for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>derivation of of wisdom,</v>

400
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:53.050
<v Speaker 1>from the observation of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the same thing when you analyze a</v>

401
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:58.051
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Shakespeare play never </v>

402
00:22:58.051 --> 00:23:02.101
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Shakespeare extracted out patterns </v>

403
00:23:02.101 --> 00:23:03.890
<v Speaker 1>that happen all the time and if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't extracted the out,</v>

404
00:23:03.891 --> 00:23:08.891
<v Speaker 1>no one would watch the plays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plays are interesting precisely to </v>

405
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:11.560
<v Speaker 1>the degree that the play is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's about you and something</v>

406
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.050
<v Speaker 1>that's about you and something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

407
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.200
<v Speaker 1>It has to be something that's common to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone and you watch the play and you </v>

408
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>partake in it through invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're sitting down,</v>

409
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.160
<v Speaker 1>you partake in it through invitation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe later you go for coffee with </v>

410
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:26.160
<v Speaker 1>your friends and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

411
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:26.800
<v Speaker 1>what was that all about?</v>

412
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's your attempt to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior wisdom that's coded in the </v>

413
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.810
<v Speaker 1>story and make it articulate and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that all the time.</v>

414
00:23:34.811 --> 00:23:39.811
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you discuss a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that and that's how educated </v>

415
00:23:39.811 --> 00:23:39.910
<v Speaker 1>people actually interact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

416
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're uneducated,</v>

417
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go see a movie and you just go it,</v>

418
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 1>you never think about it as as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was produced.</v>

419
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.980
<v Speaker 1>You never think about it as a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>entity and you never do that higher </v>

420
00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.820
<v Speaker 1>order analysis and when you're full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your first encounter,</v>

421
00:23:55.821 --> 00:24:00.821
<v Speaker 1>the idea of even doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be resistant to it because it </v>

422
00:24:00.821 --> 00:24:01.940
<v Speaker 1>seems in some sense to destroy some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the magic of that,</v>

423
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.230
<v Speaker 1>of that pure immersion in the form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

424
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:10.240
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that people who go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to movies and don't talk about them </v>

425
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 1>afterwards aren't learning anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>

426
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.080
<v Speaker 1>They're just learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're learning using a very abstracted</v>

427
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:19.090
<v Speaker 1>form of imitation and then you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you don't go to a movie,</v>

428
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:23.380
<v Speaker 1>go to 100 movies and you imitate </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's clean,</v>

429
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 1>common across all the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

430
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

431
00:24:27.261 --> 00:24:32.261
<v Speaker 1>that's an archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The archetype is what's common across </v>

432
00:24:32.261 --> 00:24:35.531
<v Speaker 1>stories and so we're trying to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of what's common across </v>

433
00:24:35.531 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 1>stores and this is the best I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do.</v>

434
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 1>It also maps quite nicely onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger's representation of the world,</v>

435
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 1>which is something I only found out </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

436
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.740
<v Speaker 1>He has three domains of reality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>correspond to this very,</v>

437
00:24:45.741 --> 00:24:50.060
<v Speaker 1>very precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Freud's conception is also very</v>

438
00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:52.460
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Id Ego,</v>

439
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Superego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

440
00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:55.940
<v Speaker 1>The end is the natural force within you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative,</v>

441
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:58.850
<v Speaker 1>because Freud was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew there was always that dichotomy.</v>

442
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Then the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's you,</v>

443
00:25:00.531 --> 00:25:02.900
<v Speaker 1>the individual positive element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative element,</v>

444
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:07.930
<v Speaker 1>and the superego which controls you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>represses you inhibits you in civilized </v>

445
00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:13.091
<v Speaker 1>as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is also can also be a complete </v>

446
00:25:13.091 --> 00:25:13.091
<v Speaker 1>tyrant.</v>

447
00:25:13.091 --> 00:25:16.420
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason Freud's theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>obtained such purchase so rapidly was </v>

448
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
<v Speaker 1>because it filled a it filled in a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>and architect will hole that needed to </v>

449
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.531
<v Speaker 1>be filled for psychotherapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 1>practitioners who in some sense had </v>

450
00:25:26.531 --> 00:25:30.311
<v Speaker 1>taken the place of priests and ministers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that Sorta then rabbis and that sort</v>

451
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 1>of person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

452
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:38.020
<v Speaker 1>so that's the representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then while we've talked about the </v>

453
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.380
<v Speaker 1>representation of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would think about that,</v>

454
00:25:42.381 --> 00:25:46.250
<v Speaker 1>and this is a radical thing to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of predicated on the idea that</v>

455
00:25:46.251 --> 00:25:51.251
<v Speaker 1>what you confront in your in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience is not so much the material </v>

456
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:54.860
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but potential as such.</v>

457
00:25:54.861 --> 00:25:59.861
<v Speaker 1>It's the potential that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly contending with that can </v>

458
00:25:59.861 --> 00:26:03.011
<v Speaker 1>destroy you and bring you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also has has as part of its nature </v>

459
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.770
<v Speaker 1>that which you can extract and use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build and grow and and we don't think of</v>

460
00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:12.860
<v Speaker 1>ourselves as interacting with potential.</v>

461
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 1>We think of ourselves as determined by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>material substrate,</v>

462
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.560
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think the idea that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined by a material substrate is as</v>

463
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:26.420
<v Speaker 1>powerful an idea as the idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with potential and I also don't</v>

464
00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:31.421
<v Speaker 1>think that the idea that were determined</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a material substrate is a more </v>

465
00:26:31.421 --> 00:26:34.391
<v Speaker 1>scientific idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the idea that we're interacting </v>

466
00:26:34.391 --> 00:26:34.391
<v Speaker 1>with potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that,</v>

467
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:39.490
<v Speaker 1>and I do this with hesitancy because </v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you delve into the quantum </v>

468
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:42.470
<v Speaker 1>realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothetical quantum realm to ground</v>

469
00:26:42.471 --> 00:26:44.490
<v Speaker 1>your arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something very dangerous,</v>

470
00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:49.491
<v Speaker 1>but the quantum view of the world seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be something like being as a field of</v>

471
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:55.050
<v Speaker 1>potential from which forms emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and some of the</v>

472
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:57.570
<v Speaker 1>physicists like wheeler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

473
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.720
<v Speaker 1>believe that consciousness plays a key </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining role in that whatever that </v>

474
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.430
<v Speaker 1>role might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not reasonable to think of these</v>

475
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:10.110
<v Speaker 1>ideas that somehow outside of the realm </v>
<v Speaker 1>of scientific conjecture,</v>

476
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.370
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the least,</v>

477
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.700
<v Speaker 1>especially because they can also be </v>
<v Speaker 1>given a deep evolutionary grounding,</v>

478
00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:20.790
<v Speaker 1>and that is why do we represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential with assemble like this?</v>

479
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because that's a great symbol for </v>

480
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.120
<v Speaker 1>what lies outside our field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

481
00:27:27.121 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Predators,</v>

482
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.320
<v Speaker 1>dangerous predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>

483
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 1>raptors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carnivores all amalgamated together in a</v>

484
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:42.231
<v Speaker 1>monster and the monster that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the monster that even offers </v>

485
00:27:42.231 --> 00:27:42.990
<v Speaker 1>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story in in the.</v>

486
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.670
<v Speaker 1>In the story of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

487
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:50.450
<v Speaker 1>or in the story of Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously because you always hunt </v>

488
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 1>for nourishment in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>predation,</v>

489
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.300
<v Speaker 1>obviously always,</v>

490
00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 1>and that's a paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a paradox that's embedded in </v>

491
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.560
<v Speaker 1>everything that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strange thing about these categories</v>

492
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:09.561
<v Speaker 1>is they're not exactly logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories there paradoxical categories </v>

493
00:28:09.561 --> 00:28:13.440
<v Speaker 1>and those sorts of things aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to exist because generally the </v>

494
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.231
<v Speaker 1>rule for a category is it can't contain </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and its opposite at the same </v>

495
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:20.071
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you've ever dealt with a person </v>

496
00:28:20.071 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 1>on an intimate basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well that the </v>

497
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.131
<v Speaker 1>category indicated by their name </v>
<v Speaker 1>contains many paradoxical elements and </v>

498
00:28:27.341 --> 00:28:30.430
<v Speaker 1>they might be paradoxical enough so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even live with the person,</v>

499
00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not homogenous enough so that </v>

500
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.041
<v Speaker 1>you can plot a path forward with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>entity to many things pulling both you </v>

501
00:28:38.501 --> 00:28:43.501
<v Speaker 1>and them apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some things are a and only a and not </v>

502
00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:48.721
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some things are a and b at the same </v>

503
00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:49.300
<v Speaker 1>time and complex categories have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

504
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I showed you some of the representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Osiris and isis emerging from the </v>

505
00:28:58.341 --> 00:29:03.341
<v Speaker 1>conjoined serpent and that's what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram represents.</v>

506
00:29:03.951 --> 00:29:04.700
<v Speaker 1>To some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

507
00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:05.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the Kale,</v>

508
00:29:05.901 --> 00:29:10.901
<v Speaker 1>what does the pimp chaos of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>first differentiate itself into get to </v>

509
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:11.510
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

510
00:29:11.511 --> 00:29:13.670
<v Speaker 1>it differentiates itself into Yin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yang.</v>

511
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:19.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiates itself into chaos and </v>

512
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.241
<v Speaker 1>order and those and those are the father</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mother of everything that comes </v>

513
00:29:22.241 --> 00:29:26.621
<v Speaker 1>after them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it and </v>

514
00:29:26.621 --> 00:29:29.171
<v Speaker 1>they each have their symbolic realms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've listed some of the common </v>

515
00:29:29.171 --> 00:29:30.320
<v Speaker 1>symbols that are associated with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>two realms.</v>

516
00:29:30.321 --> 00:29:35.321
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a difficult thing to pin down </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what one of the symbols mean has</v>

517
00:29:37.491 --> 00:29:39.830
<v Speaker 1>to be defined in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

518
00:29:39.831 --> 00:29:42.880
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the sky,</v>

519
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 1>the earth in relationship to the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to make the earth feminine and</v>

520
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:49.480
<v Speaker 1>the Sky Masculine.</v>

521
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:54.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a common symbolic representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you contrast the earth with the </v>

522
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:58.591
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the water tends to be represented </v>

523
00:29:58.591 --> 00:30:01.471
<v Speaker 1>as feminine and the Earth is masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the symbolic representations can </v>

524
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:06.580
<v Speaker 1>shift depending on the literary context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the broader literary context,</v>

525
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 1>and that means you can't just do a one </v>
<v Speaker 1>to one mapping of the symbolic entity on</v>

526
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.860
<v Speaker 1>onto the underlying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto the underlying archetypal </v>

527
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.341
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be attentive to context and </v>

528
00:30:20.341 --> 00:30:20.341
<v Speaker 1>nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

529
00:30:20.341 --> 00:30:21.790
<v Speaker 1>because we're talking about literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

530
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:26.791
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you can use a dictionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>of symbols to get your way through </v>

531
00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:29.290
<v Speaker 1>something as complex as Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see,</v>

532
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you can see the underlying patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>use them.</v>

533
00:30:32.381 --> 00:30:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Especially I think if you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental map.</v>

534
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:39.721
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here are the more common symbolic </v>

535
00:30:39.721 --> 00:30:41.800
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A chaos transforms itself into the great</v>

536
00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:43.420
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the queen,</v>

537
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.000
<v Speaker 1>can be the evil queen or the queen.</v>

538
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
<v Speaker 1>It can be the fairy godmother or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>queen that provides the poisoned apple </v>

539
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.310
<v Speaker 1>to snow white or those or the queen that</v>
<v Speaker 1>locks the prince.</v>

540
00:30:55.150 --> 00:31:00.150
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the prince in sleeping </v>

541
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:00.190
<v Speaker 1>beauty and the dungeon and tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy him.</v>

542
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.700
<v Speaker 1>The queen them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about time out.</v>

543
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the material world,</v>

544
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.920
<v Speaker 1>material matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

545
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:14.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the material world is the mother of </v>

546
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:14.490
<v Speaker 1>all things and matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His mother,</v>

547
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.350
<v Speaker 1>the land of the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark water,</v>

548
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.180
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

549
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.460
<v Speaker 1>mother nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the night sky,</v>

550
00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 1>contrast it against the day sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>

551
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:25.780
<v Speaker 1>queen of the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the womb,</v>

552
00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbarian lands,</v>

553
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:31.510
<v Speaker 1>anomalous occurrences in the grave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the great father,</v>

554
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 1>the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emperor APP,</v>

555
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.620
<v Speaker 1>sue and tie a matte look together as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed in the Mesopotamian creation </v>

556
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.170
<v Speaker 1>myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancestral spirits,</v>

557
00:31:41.171 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city explored territory culture,</v>

558
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.480
<v Speaker 1>the day sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Cyrus God,</v>

559
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:48.610
<v Speaker 1>the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the village,</v>

560
00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 1>the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the predictable,</v>

561
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:55.260
<v Speaker 1>the monument stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's built in stone to last </v>

562
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.860
<v Speaker 1>is this representation of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

563
00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:02.040
<v Speaker 1>That's why there were monolithic </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion spread across the northern </v>

564
00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:04.510
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere for thousands and thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

565
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Those people were building things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>carving things in stone to make </v>

566
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:10.060
<v Speaker 1>memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what their monuments were for,</v>

567
00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:15.061
<v Speaker 1>to bring the past into the present and </v>
<v Speaker 1>future on a permanent basis and try to </v>

568
00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:19.420
<v Speaker 1>instantiate something solid that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone could stand apart.</v>

569
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes solid isn't what you need.</v>

570
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes what you need is fluid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid,</v>

571
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Speaker 1>but the solidity is there to give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to stand on even though it can</v>

572
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:33.541
<v Speaker 1>become something arid and dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see in the story of exodus is Moses </v>

573
00:32:33.541 --> 00:32:35.470
<v Speaker 1>is a master of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Pharaoh is,</v>

574
00:32:35.471 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the king of desert stone.</v>

575
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:42.661
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking in the and the Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt is portrayed as a tyranny because </v>

576
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:48.050
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing but dry stone and Moses </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings water to that.</v>

577
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:53.051
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly the Red Sea story and </v>

578
00:32:53.051 --> 00:32:55.781
<v Speaker 1>partly Moses ability to to get water out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of rocks and not and when that's </v>

579
00:32:55.881 --> 00:33:00.881
<v Speaker 1>necessary and part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's found to begin with floating on </v>

580
00:33:00.881 --> 00:33:04.031
<v Speaker 1>water when he's an infant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also something that almost </v>

581
00:33:04.031 --> 00:33:04.031
<v Speaker 1>killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

582
00:33:04.031 --> 00:33:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Because while you don't want to put your</v>
<v Speaker 1>infant in a basket of rushes and put </v>

583
00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.971
<v Speaker 1>them to float on the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a brief overview of the manner</v>

584
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:17.171
<v Speaker 1>in which images and stories can be used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent the first division of this </v>

585
00:33:17.811 --> 00:33:20.390
<v Speaker 1>underlying reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know nothing.</v>

586
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You establish a center,</v>

587
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you explore from the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a domain of safety and that's </v>

588
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.640
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and that's what children do.</v>

589
00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:34.130
<v Speaker 1>We already know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch how children explore,</v>

590
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:39.310
<v Speaker 1>it's more evident if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>children who are somewhat inhibited </v>

591
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.420
<v Speaker 1>because really extroverted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally stable children,</v>

592
00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:43.550
<v Speaker 1>they'll just explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will recede,</v>

593
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.130
<v Speaker 1>but children that are sort of balanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their emotional response badge,</v>

594
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:53.140
<v Speaker 1>do you bring a 18 month old to a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>playground?</v>

595
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:58.770
<v Speaker 1>All mothers standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the pillar at the center of the </v>

596
00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.691
<v Speaker 1>world around her is explored territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason this explored is because </v>

597
00:34:01.691 --> 00:34:05.330
<v Speaker 1>the child knows how to interact with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and so one thing you want to know</v>

598
00:34:05.331 --> 00:34:08.360
<v Speaker 1>about kids is you can have multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>caregivers for your kids.</v>

599
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 1>You can have a nanny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put them in daycare,</v>

600
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.570
<v Speaker 1>but they do not like having their </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary caregiver switched.</v>

601
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>transforms when that happens and it </v>

602
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.651
<v Speaker 1>destabilizes been badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to have other people </v>

603
00:34:23.651 --> 00:34:26.501
<v Speaker 1>take care of your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better that it's the same other </v>

604
00:34:26.501 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously,</v>

605
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:32.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're going to form an intimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and loving relationship with them with </v>

606
00:34:32.291 --> 00:34:34.400
<v Speaker 1>any luck and if that disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a death,</v>

607
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's worse than that in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>or or the reason that the death is bad </v>

608
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:43.610
<v Speaker 1>because the child's conceptual world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're familiar world familiar family,</v>

609
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.360
<v Speaker 1>they're familiar world collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so children hate that.</v>

610
00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Now they can bond to multiple people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a problem,</v>

611
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but they do not like having their </v>
<v Speaker 1>caregivers shifted because that defines </v>

612
00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.931
<v Speaker 1>their territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the child is adapted to the mother's </v>

613
00:34:58.931 --> 00:35:01.160
<v Speaker 1>presence and has been ever since birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everything's gone well,</v>

614
00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:03.170
<v Speaker 1>so it's a place of security and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability,</v>

615
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.810
<v Speaker 1>partly because the child knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act around the mother,</v>

616
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:11.050
<v Speaker 1>but also partly because if the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters anything that he or she </v>

617
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.980
<v Speaker 1>doesn't understand well in the presence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mother,</v>

618
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.160
<v Speaker 1>the mother will instantly intervene to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide the knowledge necessary to </v>

619
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:18.860
<v Speaker 1>encapsulate the unexpected occurrence.</v>

620
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the child is by the mother and the </v>

621
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.820
<v Speaker 1>baby he's holding on and that gives him </v>
<v Speaker 1>ventral contact.</v>

622
00:35:25.821 --> 00:35:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

623
00:35:26.631 --> 00:35:28.430
<v Speaker 1>It's comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's comforting.</v>

624
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.310
<v Speaker 1>It's produced is opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It decreases pain.</v>

625
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.640
<v Speaker 1>It's directly comforting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then the child is maybe they're </v>

626
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.030
<v Speaker 1>shy and they're going to take a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at what's first and start to their</v>

627
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:44.031
<v Speaker 1>frozen clinging to something secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if nothing negative happens,</v>

628
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:50.030
<v Speaker 1>they start to relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a rat that's been put into a </v>

629
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.490
<v Speaker 1>new cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start to relax and they'll start to</v>

630
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:55.491
<v Speaker 1>look and that's the first manifestations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of voluntary exploratory behavior and </v>

631
00:35:55.621 --> 00:36:00.621
<v Speaker 1>maybe if there's other people around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll look and smile and then they'll </v>

632
00:36:00.621 --> 00:36:00.621
<v Speaker 1>hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

633
00:36:00.621 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 1>and the smile is an invitation to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>or interact,</v>

634
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:04.290
<v Speaker 1>but so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a foray out into the world,</v>

635
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:06.270
<v Speaker 1>smile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eye contact and hide.</v>

636
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll do that multiple times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a game going,</v>

637
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.200
<v Speaker 1>not establishes something stable going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on between them and the stranger.</v>

638
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Does the stranger know how to play and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe they'll loosen up and they'll</v>

639
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:22.401
<v Speaker 1>start to explore and then they go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the mother and start </v>

640
00:36:22.401 --> 00:36:24.690
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the world until </v>
<v Speaker 1>something happens that overwhelms the.</v>

641
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll run back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a hug,</v>

642
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:32.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe half asleep because maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>processed enough and then you can </v>

643
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.201
<v Speaker 1>encourage them to go back and so what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is they have the flag </v>

644
00:36:36.201 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 1>planted on unknown territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's mom the flag,</v>

645
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

646
00:36:40.871 --> 00:36:43.890
<v Speaker 1>they circulate around there because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>secure.</v>

647
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Make forays outwards where the dragons </v>
<v Speaker 1>are gathered what's of interest and if </v>

648
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.330
<v Speaker 1>it's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they run back and then they end.</v>

649
00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.980
<v Speaker 1>The mom says it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem,</v>

650
00:36:52.981 --> 00:36:54.540
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or gives them a little,</v>

651
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rock or maybe feeds them something or </v>

652
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 1>and lets them have a little rest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then off you go play again.</v>

653
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Now they go again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what the child is doing is </v>

654
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:08.841
<v Speaker 1>continually moving out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extending it's explored territory into </v>

655
00:37:08.841 --> 00:37:12.891
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the Star Trek voyagers and </v>

656
00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:16.191
<v Speaker 1>then moving back to security and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving up farther and then moving back </v>

657
00:37:16.191 --> 00:37:19.941
<v Speaker 1>to security and hopefully at some point </v>
<v Speaker 1>they carry with them their own security </v>

658
00:37:19.941 --> 00:37:23.010
<v Speaker 1>once they become competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like once you've incorporated all of the</v>

659
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:27.120
<v Speaker 1>competence of your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to go back well,</v>

660
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.790
<v Speaker 1>and even if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't going to help you.</v>

661
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.880
<v Speaker 1>You've that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've transcended the security and </v>

662
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.370
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes you an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that happens.</v>

663
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.470
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why the,</v>

664
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:42.150
<v Speaker 1>the hero archetype is the central human </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

665
00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:43.840
<v Speaker 1>It's because that's how we learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

666
00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it's an images stick representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process by which we make sense out </v>

667
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.761
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course it's redemptive because by </v>

668
00:37:52.761 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 1>definition that's the pattern we use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>expand our competence in the world.</v>

669
00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:00.890
<v Speaker 1>How could it be anything other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>redemptive and it's tied in with the </v>

670
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:01.860
<v Speaker 1>here's how it's tied in with the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

671
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Every time you learn something </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially painfully,</v>

672
00:38:05.371 --> 00:38:10.371
<v Speaker 1>which really means you learned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things that you </v>

673
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:12.360
<v Speaker 1>already knew that you had to let go of </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're wrong and so there is no</v>

674
00:38:12.361 --> 00:38:17.361
<v Speaker 1>learning without sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now that means is that there is no </v>

675
00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:20.331
<v Speaker 1>learning without the retooling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that you've already been </v>

676
00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:22.971
<v Speaker 1>using and that's because you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a complete map of the world always,</v>

677
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's low resolution,</v>

678
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.620
<v Speaker 1>and then if you go out there and into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular area that you've only mapped </v>

679
00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.971
<v Speaker 1>in a low resolution way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll learn that force you to update </v>

680
00:38:37.971 --> 00:38:41.140
<v Speaker 1>the low resolution representations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that can mean abandoning whole</v>

681
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 1>pieces of it because they're just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think this is like this.</v>

682
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 1>You think your girlfriend is like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

683
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may find out that that's absolutely </v>

684
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:53.400
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the degree to which you use this low</v>

685
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.781
<v Speaker 1>resolution map to map her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to experience nothing but </v>

686
00:38:57.781 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in fact,</v>

687
00:38:58.151 --> 00:39:03.151
<v Speaker 1>in all likelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you'll experience because </v>

688
00:39:03.151 --> 00:39:03.151
<v Speaker 1>your girlfriend is not your mother,</v>

689
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:05.820
<v Speaker 1>or at least she shouldn't be.</v>

690
00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.920
<v Speaker 1>So when you go out and you encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>something new,</v>

691
00:39:10.921 --> 00:39:15.921
<v Speaker 1>it always means the demolition of parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you that are still uninformed and an </v>

692
00:39:15.921 --> 00:39:20.630
<v Speaker 1>incomplete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a sacrificial element to </v>

693
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.361
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why people don't like to </v>

694
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:25.881
<v Speaker 1>talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have ideas that are different </v>

695
00:39:25.881 --> 00:39:25.890
<v Speaker 1>than theirs because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well sure we differ.</v>

696
00:39:25.891 --> 00:39:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we just talk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know things,</v>

697
00:39:28.231 --> 00:39:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't all the better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

698
00:39:30.421 --> 00:39:35.421
<v Speaker 1>if you know something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know what's going to </v>

699
00:39:35.421 --> 00:39:36.540
<v Speaker 1>challenge something I already presumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it really challenges,</v>

700
00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:41.541
<v Speaker 1>it will disintegrate and all do a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>trip into the underworld before I can </v>

701
00:39:41.541 --> 00:39:44.400
<v Speaker 1>read structure myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you really challenged me,</v>

702
00:39:44.401 --> 00:39:49.350
<v Speaker 1>it might be almost complete dissolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you who wants that?</v>

703
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how you want that.</v>

704
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:57.950
<v Speaker 1>The only circumstance under which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>will want that is if you know that the </v>

705
00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:01.410
<v Speaker 1>alternative is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Continual small updates.</v>

706
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.240
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

707
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Differentiate you and make you strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shy away from that.</v>

708
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Your map stays low resolution and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make yourself weak because you're not.</v>

709
00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:16.090
<v Speaker 1>You're not practicing that process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting go and transforming and letting </v>

710
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.350
<v Speaker 1>go and transforming because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a master at that.</v>

711
00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be a master at </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarding your territory even though </v>

712
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.791
<v Speaker 1>that's extraordinarily useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to become a master of taking </v>

713
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:32.591
<v Speaker 1>the walls apart and extending them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>building them up and taking the walls </v>

714
00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:35.621
<v Speaker 1>apart and extending them and building </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up and that because you'll never </v>

715
00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:39.371
<v Speaker 1>run out of utility for that and that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that unknown becomes something </v>

716
00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:43.511
<v Speaker 1>that's your friend instead of your enemy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that would be a wonderful thing </v>

717
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:45.830
<v Speaker 1>because of course people respond to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown as if it's their terrible enemy.</v>

718
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:47.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure about that.</v>

719
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.700
<v Speaker 1>What you know might be your enemy.</v>

720
00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:55.180
<v Speaker 1>What you don't yet know might be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best friend you have and it's highly </v>

721
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.740
<v Speaker 1>probable because what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's an infinite number of things</v>

722
00:40:57.741 --> 00:41:02.741
<v Speaker 1>you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might as well make friends with </v>

723
00:41:02.741 --> 00:41:04.871
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also start to understand </v>

724
00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:07.310
<v Speaker 1>that you are precisely the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can move into the unknown,</v>

725
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:12.460
<v Speaker 1>as if it's welcoming and grow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop as a consequence,</v>

726
00:41:12.681 --> 00:41:17.681
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you a much different </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing than the thing that has to be </v>

727
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:20.711
<v Speaker 1>terrified of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't understand you're just in a </v>

728
00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:23.831
<v Speaker 1>permanent state of existential horror </v>
<v Speaker 1>under those conditions and you're </v>

729
00:41:23.831 --> 00:41:27.701
<v Speaker 1>dangerous to other people too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they don't agree with you </v>

730
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:31.030
<v Speaker 1>as another way of representing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dragon of chaos stands for the </v>

731
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.200
<v Speaker 1>potential that surrounds us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inside of that,</v>

732
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:38.950
<v Speaker 1>there's the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are knowing that you actually come </v>

733
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.950
<v Speaker 1>into contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

734
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:43.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the unknown as it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself in your world as </v>

735
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:44.720
<v Speaker 1>something you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of just the potential for that,</v>

736
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:45.710
<v Speaker 1>because we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

737
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well that as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting here,</v>

738
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.110
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of things you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know everywhere,</v>

739
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.720
<v Speaker 1>but where are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

740
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.720
<v Speaker 1>they're not manifesting themselves at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>

741
00:41:56.721 --> 00:41:58.940
<v Speaker 1>They're only in potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could.</v>

742
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:04.060
<v Speaker 1>We could have a discussion that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>became argumentative and then all of a </v>

743
00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:07.931
<v Speaker 1>sudden it would be as if emissaries of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that unknown had entered the space and </v>

744
00:42:07.931 --> 00:42:10.790
<v Speaker 1>that's the unknown that's defined in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what you know.</v>

745
00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what you actually experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of it only being potential.</v>

746
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough thing to get because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both unknown,</v>

747
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:17.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

748
00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:22.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can there be two different </v>

749
00:42:22.391 --> 00:42:22.391
<v Speaker 1>categories of unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well latent and manifest.</v>

750
00:42:22.391 --> 00:42:23.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

751
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going stable,</v>

752
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.660
<v Speaker 1>but you know that sooner or later </v>
<v Speaker 1>something will come up.</v>

753
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>op from where?</v>

754
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up from?</v>

755
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.080
<v Speaker 1>From beneath?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

756
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.850
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean beneath?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's from.</v>

757
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.510
<v Speaker 1>It's from your complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person you're in a relationship with</v>

758
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:47.050
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in width is complicated and complex </v>

759
00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:47.050
<v Speaker 1>that's implicit in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

760
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 1>it's inside your conceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

761
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 1>that's the way of looking at it now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then when there's a disagreement,</v>

762
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 1>it will manifest itself and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know that they're still trouble</v>

763
00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 1>brewing ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interrelationship always,</v>

764
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of what keeps them alive</v>

765
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:07.220
<v Speaker 1>was an interesting piece of empirical </v>
<v Speaker 1>work done on this a while back,</v>

766
00:43:07.221 --> 00:43:08.090
<v Speaker 1>so you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

767
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.840
<v Speaker 1>what is the optimal relationship look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in terms of positive and negative </v>

768
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:13.840
<v Speaker 1>emotion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

769
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:14.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utopia,</v>

770
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:18.380
<v Speaker 1>nothing but positive interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no.</v>

771
00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get people to code the interactions </v>

772
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 1>they have with your partner during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

773
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sample it,</v>

774
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:30.730
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that interaction positive or </v>

775
00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:32.411
<v Speaker 1>negative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what you're trying to do is </v>

776
00:43:32.411 --> 00:43:32.411
<v Speaker 1>predict the longevity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

777
00:43:32.411 --> 00:43:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's the data.</v>

778
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.160
<v Speaker 1>If it falls under five positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions to one negative </v>

779
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.520
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship doesn't continue.</v>

780
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much negative.</v>

781
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:47.530
<v Speaker 1>That's easy to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it exceeds 11 positive to one </v>

782
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship doesn't last.</v>

783
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

784
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.930
<v Speaker 1>New Challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

785
00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:54.730
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your partner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bless.</v>

786
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:55.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

787
00:43:55.901 --> 00:43:56.680
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

788
00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:01.780
<v Speaker 1>You want periods of peace punctuated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>a good fight and that because that means</v>

789
00:44:01.781 --> 00:44:06.781
<v Speaker 1>you respect them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>means you have something to offer each </v>

790
00:44:06.781 --> 00:44:09.241
<v Speaker 1>other and it means that you're both </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing and so you don't want the fight </v>

791
00:44:09.241 --> 00:44:10.690
<v Speaker 1>to be too dramatic because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you retreat.</v>

792
00:44:10.691 --> 00:44:15.691
<v Speaker 1>You can't settle it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the person that you can completely </v>

793
00:44:15.691 --> 00:44:15.850
<v Speaker 1>map and who only does positive things </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

794
00:44:15.851 --> 00:44:17.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that person,</v>

795
00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.680
<v Speaker 1>but they're not communicating with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>nor you with them.</v>

796
00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're just subordinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to you or you to them and </v>

797
00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.100
<v Speaker 1>you're not growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want someone who can.</v>

798
00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a real relationship is a wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>

799
00:44:30.281 --> 00:44:35.281
<v Speaker 1>It's a grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling phenomena that you both </v>

800
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:35.340
<v Speaker 1>emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed from,</v>

801
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 1>and that's what people want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to push over.</v>

802
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Not Not unless there's something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

803
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:45.730
<v Speaker 1>and when narcissistic person who never </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be challenged will want a </v>

804
00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.990
<v Speaker 1>partner who does nothing but deliver </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what they're told to deliver,</v>

805
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:52.950
<v Speaker 1>but they will mistreat them beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief and perhaps deservedly so.</v>

806
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:58.010
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's some symbolic representations.</v>

807
00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:04.470
<v Speaker 1>The two on the left are Jonah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah,</v>

808
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:09.470
<v Speaker 1>and the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the story of Jonah is an interesting </v>

809
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.350
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go over it very briefly.</v>

810
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:16.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a city and the city is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are sinful.</v>

811
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:17.490
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

812
00:45:17.491 --> 00:45:20.010
<v Speaker 1>to sin is an archery term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means to miss the mark.</v>

813
00:45:20.011 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So these are people who aren't oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly and so the city is in a chaotic</v>

814
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:26.440
<v Speaker 1>state and God tells Jonah that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>

815
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Go to that city and tell them just </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what's up with them.</v>

816
00:45:29.461 --> 00:45:30.180
<v Speaker 1>And Julie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

817
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:32.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>

818
00:45:32.321 --> 00:45:37.321
<v Speaker 1>And why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't require much </v>

819
00:45:37.321 --> 00:45:40.701
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how popular you are going to </v>

820
00:45:40.701 --> 00:45:42.771
<v Speaker 1>be if you go to a city full of chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and tell them why they're stupid </v>

821
00:45:42.841 --> 00:45:44.490
<v Speaker 1>and wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Joanna,</v>

822
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:45.060
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

823
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:50.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if God's telling me to do </v>

824
00:45:50.061 --> 00:45:50.061
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

825
00:45:50.061 --> 00:45:52.880
<v Speaker 1>So his conscience is telling him to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or his destiny is telling them to do </v>

826
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.211
<v Speaker 1>it or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or his orientation with higher morality </v>

827
00:45:56.211 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 1>is telling them to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can read it any way you want.</v>

828
00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And so he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

829
00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm hopping on this boat and I'm getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far away from that city as I possibly</v>

830
00:46:01.441 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he does that.</v>

831
00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:06.270
<v Speaker 1>And then the storm comes up because God </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks,</v>

832
00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting away if I told you to</v>

833
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:09.960
<v Speaker 1>do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting away from it.</v>

834
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.970
<v Speaker 1>A storm comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

835
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

836
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:18.351
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Betray your destiny and see how long it </v>

837
00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:24.530
<v Speaker 1>takes you to be drowning in a storm.</v>

838
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It will happen immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it will,</v>

839
00:46:28.201 --> 00:46:33.201
<v Speaker 1>because what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's calling you to be your best is </v>

840
00:46:33.201 --> 00:46:33.900
<v Speaker 1>exactly the thing that's pushing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

841
00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:36.360
<v Speaker 1>to manifest yourself most fully in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

842
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It's what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You run away from that.</v>

843
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.060
<v Speaker 1>The boat's going to start to rock very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

844
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all know that.</v>

845
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.160
<v Speaker 1>You know that perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

846
00:46:45.161 --> 00:46:46.850
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hell.</v>

847
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:51.860
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is not study for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exam that you know that's coming up to </v>

848
00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.580
<v Speaker 1>see everything start to the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water start to rise and everything start</v>

849
00:46:54.581 --> 00:46:56.820
<v Speaker 1>to rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bloody obvious.</v>

850
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.520
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on this boat and there's a storm.</v>

851
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:04.970
<v Speaker 1>And all of the people on the boat who </v>
<v Speaker 1>who can't quite discriminate chaos from </v>

852
00:47:05.551 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 1>whether because they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated the world to that degree,</v>

853
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:09.690
<v Speaker 1>thank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

854
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.520
<v Speaker 1>the boat wouldn't be about to be swamped</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we hadn't.</v>

855
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Some of us had done something stupid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

856
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:18.720
<v Speaker 1>and there's logic in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

857
00:47:18.721 --> 00:47:23.721
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well God has nothing personal against </v>

858
00:47:23.721 --> 00:47:24.600
<v Speaker 1>you because of the storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're confusing levels of analysis,</v>

859
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:26.640
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to give these people some</v>
<v Speaker 1>credit.</v>

860
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe they did do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

861
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they didn't cop the damn boat </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

862
00:47:31.301 --> 00:47:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the ropes aren't in as good as </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape as they might be.</v>

863
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:39.151
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they weren't paying attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weather when they went out on the </v>

864
00:47:39.151 --> 00:47:39.151
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

865
00:47:39.151 --> 00:47:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they haven't made peace with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their brother and so their hearts are </v>

866
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.011
<v Speaker 1>bent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted out of shape so they don't make </v>

867
00:47:47.011 --> 00:47:49.201
<v Speaker 1>particularly good sailors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea that you encounter </v>

868
00:47:49.201 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 1>restoring because you're stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong is a really good idea.</v>

869
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's not an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicability anyways.</v>

870
00:47:54.251 --> 00:47:57.370
<v Speaker 1>They draw lots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a primitive thing to do.</v>

871
00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

872
00:47:58.091 --> 00:47:59.650
<v Speaker 1>it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's someone's fault.</v>

873
00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.610
<v Speaker 1>We don't know who we're going to throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone overboard,</v>

874
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.830
<v Speaker 1>the worst sinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's what God wants.</v>

875
00:48:05.831 --> 00:48:10.831
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they all draw lots and someone loses </v>

876
00:48:10.831 --> 00:48:10.930
<v Speaker 1>and then Jonas stands up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

877
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.600
<v Speaker 1>sorry guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know that I've got a problem with</v>

878
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:18.601
<v Speaker 1>God at the moment so it's probably me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better throw me over and they don't </v>

879
00:48:18.601 --> 00:48:22.351
<v Speaker 1>really want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he finally convinces them over Egos </v>

880
00:48:22.351 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 1>and the storm settles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

881
00:48:23.231 --> 00:48:28.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if you're in a group of people</v>

882
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 1>in an organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is someone in the organization </v>

883
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.670
<v Speaker 1>who's head is screwed on exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and they know exactly why it is</v>

884
00:48:36.671 --> 00:48:41.671
<v Speaker 1>and what they've done wrong and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts them in that position and they are </v>

885
00:48:41.671 --> 00:48:43.900
<v Speaker 1>poisoning the entire enterprise and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw them overboard or better,</v>

886
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:49.110
<v Speaker 1>if they agreed voluntarily to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this storm will abate and </v>

887
00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:49.210
<v Speaker 1>everything will be okay.</v>

888
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:54.780
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they throw joe job over or Jonah </v>

889
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 1>overboard and a whale comes up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>swallows them and takes them down to the</v>

890
00:48:55.511 --> 00:48:56.500
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

891
00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:58.850
<v Speaker 1>we already know what that means because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we watched Pinocchio.</v>

892
00:48:58.851 --> 00:49:03.851
<v Speaker 1>It's like when God abandons you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've abandoned your destiny and the </v>

893
00:49:04.691 --> 00:49:09.691
<v Speaker 1>storms come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to be </v>

894
00:49:09.691 --> 00:49:11.440
<v Speaker 1>taken down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the depths is extraordinarily high,</v>

895
00:49:11.441 --> 00:49:13.390
<v Speaker 1>and that happens in people's lives all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

896
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Also down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah repents.</v>

897
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when you were in not </v>

898
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:21.300
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you've been there before,</v>

899
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.901
<v Speaker 1>when things fall apart on your friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>have abandoned you and you're not as </v>

900
00:49:24.901 --> 00:49:27.661
<v Speaker 1>popular as you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't stand to look at yourself in </v>

901
00:49:27.661 --> 00:49:27.661
<v Speaker 1>the mirror into the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go and you think,</v>

902
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done a lot of things wrong.</v>

903
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should reconcile myself with the</v>

904
00:49:32.081 --> 00:49:33.490
<v Speaker 1>world that I could get out of this.</v>

905
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.960
<v Speaker 1>We'll also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Jonah does.</v>

906
00:49:34.961 --> 00:49:35.710
<v Speaker 1>He thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

907
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I've got this destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better go do it.</v>

908
00:49:38.831 --> 00:49:43.831
<v Speaker 1>God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the whale spits them out onto the </v>

909
00:49:43.831 --> 00:49:44.650
<v Speaker 1>beach and off he goes to the city to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them what's wrong.</v>

910
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that represents,</v>

911
00:49:48.011 --> 00:49:49.540
<v Speaker 1>that these symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

912
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 1>it's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second one I really,</v>

913
00:49:51.911 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because you see joan</v>

914
00:49:54.761 --> 00:49:57.610
<v Speaker 1>and reemerging from the whale and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a halo around his head.</v>

915
00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:58.360
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

916
00:49:58.361 --> 00:50:01.300
<v Speaker 1>what's a halo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever looked at a quarter?</v>

917
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about a quarter.</v>

918
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.930
<v Speaker 1>A quarter is the moon and who's on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter?</v>

919
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>The Queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the queen is surrounded by the halo of </v>

920
00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.171
<v Speaker 1>the Moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Queens Queen of the Queen of the </v>

921
00:50:16.171 --> 00:50:17.740
<v Speaker 1>night gold coin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the king's head on the sun.</v>

922
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the halo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

923
00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.970
<v Speaker 1>what comes out of the belly of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fish?</v>

924
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:26.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the illuminated human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the spirit of the illuminated human</v>

925
00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that means.</v>

926
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

927
00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else would come out of chaos,</v>

928
00:50:32.031 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

929
00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:35.360
<v Speaker 2>if you fall apart and then you put </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself back together,</v>

930
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:39.620
<v Speaker 2>what is it that comes back out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at least you're in better shape than</v>

931
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:40.820
<v Speaker 2>you were before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

932
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:45.821
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe you do that 20 times in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life or 50 times and you do it </v>

933
00:50:45.821 --> 00:50:47.120
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time you do it,</v>

934
00:50:47.121 --> 00:50:51.140
<v Speaker 2>you're more like the thing with the halo</v>
<v Speaker 2>and less like the thing that's,</v>

935
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being thrown overboard by your friends.</v>

936
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:56.660
<v Speaker 2>And then you see this representation on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>

937
00:50:56.661 --> 00:50:58.820
<v Speaker 2>This is a very complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

938
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:04.240
<v Speaker 2>So in this one you see Christ who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying his cross with the sun behind </v>

939
00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.211
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the halo that I was talking </v>

940
00:51:08.211 --> 00:51:09.851
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the person who's voluntarily </v>

941
00:51:09.851 --> 00:51:10.670
<v Speaker 2>accepted the necessity of death and </v>
<v Speaker 2>renewal.</v>

942
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.290
<v Speaker 2>That's what the cross represents.</v>

943
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:13.580
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>

944
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>

945
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 2>an abstracted representation of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

946
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 2>further developed idea of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you see in the back,</v>

947
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.470
<v Speaker 2>this is a feminine symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

948
00:51:24.471 --> 00:51:26.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a symbol of birth.</v>

949
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:28.820
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll understand more when I,</v>

950
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 2>when I show you the symbols later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the eternal opening in the world</v>

951
00:51:33.201 --> 00:51:37.010
<v Speaker 2>from which new forms emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the place from which babies emerge.</v>

952
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:42.011
<v Speaker 2>And you can tell that if you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully because you see all these </v>

953
00:51:42.011 --> 00:51:44.411
<v Speaker 2>little heads there with wings on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are all spirits waiting to be </v>

954
00:51:44.411 --> 00:51:46.550
<v Speaker 2>born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the hero emerges from the,</v>

955
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:51.590
<v Speaker 2>from the eternal feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to die and suffer.</v>

956
00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:55.270
<v Speaker 2>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this defeating the snake,</v>

957
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.130
<v Speaker 2>the snake's down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the adversary at the same time.</v>

958
00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.250
<v Speaker 2>While it's no wonder we don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>those images,</v>

959
00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:06.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are so unbelievably rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>that how could you possibly articulate </v>

960
00:52:06.251 --> 00:52:07.460
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they emerged in images,</v>

961
00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:12.461
<v Speaker 2>stick form to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The artists get there before the </v>

962
00:52:12.461 --> 00:52:13.640
<v Speaker 2>philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long before the philosophers,</v>

963
00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.990
<v Speaker 2>the dramatists get there way before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists even.</v>

964
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:22.360
<v Speaker 2>And so we figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we represented it in art and literature </v>

965
00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.530
<v Speaker 2>and music and drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we're on the cusp,</v>

966
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:29.590
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of understanding it in a fully </v>

967
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:30.080
<v Speaker 2>articulated manner and not a moment too </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>

968
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.950
<v Speaker 2>So what does it mean for this symbol to </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge from the feminine symbol,</v>

969
00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:39.050
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to emerge from chaos?</v>

970
00:52:39.051 --> 00:52:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this picture,</v>

971
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.490
<v Speaker 2>this is a picture of Venus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goddess of love,</v>

972
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:48.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I cut this picture out of a </v>

973
00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:50.951
<v Speaker 2>larger picture and it's Venus </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifesting yourself in a transcendent </v>

974
00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:54.611
<v Speaker 2>space in the sky in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ did in the previous </v>

975
00:52:54.611 --> 00:52:57.701
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she has raised coming off her and </v>

976
00:52:57.701 --> 00:53:00.500
<v Speaker 2>there's all these men who are nights </v>
<v Speaker 2>kneeling in front of the image.</v>

977
00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

978
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that men use the image of </v>

979
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:08.200
<v Speaker 2>female perfection to motivate </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

980
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's precisely what they do.</v>

981
00:53:10.461 --> 00:53:15.461
<v Speaker 2>You see that in the Tom Sawyer story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Tom Sawyer is about 12 years old and </v>

982
00:53:15.461 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 2>he's still hanging around with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends like huck Finn and this one girl</v>

983
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:23.501
<v Speaker 2>moves across the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>becky and she comes out and he's struck </v>

984
00:53:23.501 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 2>by her for the first time in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something's changed.</v>

985
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing does is hot pop</v>

986
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 1>on a picket fence and show off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance in front of her.</v>

987
00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:29.970
<v Speaker 1>And he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

988
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:31.110
<v Speaker 1>look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>

989
00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the male bowerbird building </v>
<v Speaker 1>something beautiful.</v>

990
00:53:34.531 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 1>So the female will approve of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

991
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:38.910
<v Speaker 1>it's motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

992
00:53:38.911 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that I think modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>women don't really understand about men.</v>

993
00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:48.290
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand that at least to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree that males are uncorrupted </v>

994
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 1>and not better because of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected,</v>

995
00:53:50.611 --> 00:53:55.611
<v Speaker 1>they're doing everything they can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kneel before the eternal image of the </v>

996
00:53:55.611 --> 00:53:55.611
<v Speaker 1>feminine</v>

997
00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.000
<v Speaker 1>and try to make themselves worthy as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chivalry story.</v>

998
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you should encourage in your</v>

999
00:54:02.801 --> 00:54:07.300
<v Speaker 1>partner so and so out of chaos emerges </v>
<v Speaker 1>this first form.</v>

1000
00:54:07.301 --> 00:54:12.301
<v Speaker 1>It's the feminine form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly the form that represents </v>

1001
00:54:12.301 --> 00:54:15.700
<v Speaker 1>novelty as such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on one hand it's promise.</v>

1002
00:54:15.701 --> 00:54:20.701
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's threat that you wouldn't believe </v>

1003
00:54:20.701 --> 00:54:23.340
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know because I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the situation with </v>

1004
00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.160
<v Speaker 1>women as well as I understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation with men.</v>

1005
00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Obviously being a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if women had any idea </v>

1006
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:33.520
<v Speaker 1>how paralyzing they are to especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>young men.</v>

1007
00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:39.940
<v Speaker 1>A large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very large number of my clinical </v>

1008
00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:43.111
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also young men I've talked to in </v>

1009
00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:44.911
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are absolutely terrified of women </v>

1010
00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:48.360
<v Speaker 1>because they're terrified of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected and the terror exists in </v>

1011
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.870
<v Speaker 1>precise proportion to the attraction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman,</v>

1012
00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:52.630
<v Speaker 1>which is a horrible paradoxical </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1013
00:54:52.631 --> 00:54:57.631
<v Speaker 1>To be an insult and why men make such </v>
<v Speaker 1>fools of themselves in front of women </v>

1014
00:54:57.641 --> 00:54:59.500
<v Speaker 1>that they're attracted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because first of all,</v>

1015
00:54:59.501 --> 00:55:04.501
<v Speaker 1>they don't see the woman that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to because what the hell do </v>

1016
00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:05.020
<v Speaker 1>they know about her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't see her as an individual.</v>

1017
00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 1>They see her as the manifestation of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgmental ideal and then it's only in </v>

1018
00:55:10.601 --> 00:55:15.601
<v Speaker 1>establishing the relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual woman that they can start </v>

1019
00:55:15.601 --> 00:55:18.640
<v Speaker 1>differentiating between the judgmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal and the actual individual woman,</v>

1020
00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:22.390
<v Speaker 1>and that also requires the sacrifice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice is</v>

1021
00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you never can have an ideal woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to have a relationship with any </v>

1022
00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:33.951
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sacrifice the relationship </v>

1023
00:55:33.951 --> 00:55:36.411
<v Speaker 1>with the ideal woman and you have to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual woman and separate her </v>

1024
00:55:37.241 --> 00:55:42.241
<v Speaker 1>from the ideal and that's the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to the hero in sleeping </v>

1025
00:55:42.241 --> 00:55:42.241
<v Speaker 1>beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1026
00:55:42.241 --> 00:55:46.771
<v Speaker 1>He sees the evil queen who actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into the dragon of chaos and it's </v>

1027
00:55:46.771 --> 00:55:49.300
<v Speaker 1>not until he can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can defeat her,</v>

1028
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:53.050
<v Speaker 1>that he can establish a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the actual princess.</v>

1029
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:58.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a wonderful my clients who ran </v>

1030
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.920
<v Speaker 1>this men's group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was quite interesting.</v>

1031
00:55:59.921 --> 00:56:04.921
<v Speaker 1>One of the things they had initiates do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was very intelligent,</v>

1032
00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:09.060
<v Speaker 1>was to go out and ask 50 women in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day for their phone numbers.</v>

1033
00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Why politely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly you don't want.</v>

1034
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:13.930
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a.</v>

1035
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 1>It was a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a stupid game and the idea</v>

1036
00:56:16.921 --> 00:56:21.921
<v Speaker 1>was get over your fear of rejection and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that by encountering it </v>

1037
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.670
<v Speaker 1>continually and continually</v>

1038
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:28.840
<v Speaker 2>and continually so that you're no longer</v>
<v Speaker 2>paralyzed by this.</v>

1039
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this cartoon.</v>

1040
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:40.190
<v Speaker 2>This is from a underground comic for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people who smoke way too much </v>

1041
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:44.811
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and it's called a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are the fabulous furry </v>

1042
00:56:44.811 --> 00:56:47.700
<v Speaker 2>freak brothers and they were created by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gilbert Shelton who was one of the first</v>

1043
00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:53.030
<v Speaker 2>underground cartoonists and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least pathological ones with the best </v>

1044
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:57.201
<v Speaker 2>sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he writes these stories about these </v>

1045
00:56:57.201 --> 00:56:57.201
<v Speaker 2>stupid hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three of them,</v>

1046
00:56:57.201 --> 00:57:01.071
<v Speaker 2>the fabulous furry freak brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see two of them there and all they </v>

1047
00:57:01.071 --> 00:57:05.181
<v Speaker 2>do is smoke pot and avoid responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and run away from the police and it.</v>

1048
00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:10.790
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a nice satire and so and they </v>

1049
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:13.131
<v Speaker 2>have this cat and the fat one fat Freddy</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the cat and they're too lazy to even</v>

1050
00:57:14.221 --> 00:57:19.221
<v Speaker 2>give her the cat in name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's fat Freddy's cat and it has its </v>

1051
00:57:19.221 --> 00:57:22.320
<v Speaker 2>own adventure is mostly with an army of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cockroaches that that lives inside.</v>

1052
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.500
<v Speaker 2>They're like horrible slummy hell hole </v>
<v Speaker 2>of living place.</v>

1053
00:57:25.501 --> 00:57:29.700
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite comical and so the.</v>

1054
00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:33.780
<v Speaker 2>The hippies have stumbled across a small</v>
<v Speaker 2>fortune and stoned out of their minds on</v>

1055
00:57:33.781 --> 00:57:38.781
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go out to set up utopia in the </v>

1056
00:57:38.781 --> 00:57:38.781
<v Speaker 2>countryside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They buy this terrible piece of property</v>

1057
00:57:38.781 --> 00:57:42.210
<v Speaker 2>but they're so diluted that they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a mansion and they bring their</v>

1058
00:57:42.211 --> 00:57:44.400
<v Speaker 2>cat and I don't know if you've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cat,</v>

1059
00:57:44.401 --> 00:57:49.401
<v Speaker 2>but cats don't like to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really bugs them and so they're not </v>

1060
00:57:49.401 --> 00:57:50.700
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you bring them to a new place,</v>

1061
00:57:50.701 --> 00:57:53.820
<v Speaker 2>they're like the rat that's been taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of its comfortable cage and put into</v>

1062
00:57:53.821 --> 00:57:58.821
<v Speaker 2>a new cage and the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put a cat in a new room and it </v>

1063
00:57:58.821 --> 00:58:02.000
<v Speaker 2>depending on the cat obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally they'll retreat into a </v>

1064
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.941
<v Speaker 2>corner and be and now pityingly and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very unhappy for quite a substantial </v>

1065
00:58:04.941 --> 00:58:05.430
<v Speaker 2>amount of time.</v>

1066
00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:09.120
<v Speaker 2>And so the cartoonist actually map this </v>
<v Speaker 2>out quite nicely.</v>

1067
00:58:09.121 --> 00:58:13.020
<v Speaker 2>So the hippie takes the cat out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>box and says our new home,</v>

1068
00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.020
<v Speaker 2>it's there out in the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an urban cat.</v>

1069
00:58:16.021 --> 00:58:21.021
<v Speaker 2>It's never been in the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know what the hell is up in </v>

1070
00:58:21.021 --> 00:58:21.450
<v Speaker 2>the forest and the cat's looking rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>dubiously and things.</v>

1071
00:58:21.451 --> 00:58:26.451
<v Speaker 2>So this is the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's put on the ground and it </v>

1072
00:58:26.451 --> 00:58:26.960
<v Speaker 2>starts to slink as he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slink,</v>

1073
00:58:26.961 --> 00:58:30.420
<v Speaker 2>slink out into the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually what animals do.</v>

1074
00:58:30.421 --> 00:58:31.730
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a predator,</v>

1075
00:58:31.731 --> 00:58:33.000
<v Speaker 2>evasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crouch.</v>

1076
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.010
<v Speaker 2>And so if they're put in a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory,</v>

1077
00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:40.011
<v Speaker 2>they'll hunker down and freeze first and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they'll slowly unfreeze and start </v>

1078
00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:46.101
<v Speaker 2>to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sniff first and then they'll start </v>

1079
00:58:46.101 --> 00:58:46.830
<v Speaker 2>to move it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they do it like with trepidation and</v>

1080
00:58:46.831 --> 00:58:51.831
<v Speaker 2>slowly and tried to hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what the cat is doing and the </v>

1081
00:58:51.831 --> 00:58:54.801
<v Speaker 2>cat goes out into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far enough sniffing and all of a sudden </v>

1082
00:58:54.801 --> 00:58:56.070
<v Speaker 2>pow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes underneath the house.</v>

1083
00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:00.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like the toddler running back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother and the other,</v>

1084
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:02.550
<v Speaker 2>another hippie there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1085
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fineas says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where'd the cat disappeared?</v>

1086
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:09.090
<v Speaker 2>You now and the fats ready character </v>
<v Speaker 2>says under the house.</v>

1087
00:59:09.091 --> 00:59:14.091
<v Speaker 2>And then the cats onto there in the dark</v>
<v Speaker 2>with big eyes looking terrified saying </v>

1088
00:59:14.091 --> 00:59:15.510
<v Speaker 2>you'd hide too if you'd smelled what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1089
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:21.080
<v Speaker 2>And so what it smelled was this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has like the head of a wolf and a </v>

1090
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:21.990
<v Speaker 2>and antlers,</v>

1091
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.820
<v Speaker 1>like a deer in the tail of a skunk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the feet of a,</v>

1092
00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.410
<v Speaker 1>like a chicken and horrible clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1093
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1094
00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a monstrous amalgam of that which </v>

1095
00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:35.000
<v Speaker 1>lurks and not known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the cartoonists,</v>

1096
00:59:35.001 --> 00:59:37.070
<v Speaker 1>the comedian got it perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

1097
00:59:37.071 --> 00:59:37.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is there?</v>

1098
00:59:37.881 --> 00:59:41.930
<v Speaker 1>What is out in the unknown while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need one representation,</v>

1099
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:47.530
<v Speaker 1>not a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you take pieces of what's out </v>

1100
00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:50.951
<v Speaker 1>there that are relevant and you create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single image out of that and you say,</v>

1101
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's out there.</v>

1102
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.840
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1103
00:59:53.841 --> 00:59:58.841
<v Speaker 1>no such animal as that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually incorrect.</v>

1104
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:02.330
<v Speaker 1>An animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much animals,</v>

1105
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.300
<v Speaker 1>very much like that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a super ordinate,</v>

1106
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:09.320
<v Speaker 1>low resolution category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It includes all those weird animals that</v>

1107
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>might hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are out in the forest.</v>

1108
01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a useful category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird animals that might hurt you.</v>

1109
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

1110
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:23.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's differentiated things within </v>

1111
01:00:23.321 --> 01:00:23.321
<v Speaker 1>that category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1112
01:00:23.321 --> 01:00:25.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every category has that nature can still</v>

1113
01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>be further differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not protons,</v>

1114
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could even be differentiated with </v>

1115
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:36.311
<v Speaker 1>regards to location at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every category can be further </v>

1116
01:00:36.311 --> 01:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>differentiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is whether the category has</v>

1117
01:00:37.521 --> 01:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>some functional utility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least that's one of its questions.</v>

1118
01:00:40.881 --> 01:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the thing to be afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1119
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1120
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Now you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the category of all things to be</v>

1121
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:52.001
<v Speaker 1>afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do in response to that </v>

1122
01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:52.001
<v Speaker 1>category?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1123
01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:53.480
<v Speaker 1>so then we'd go to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1124
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>This is Kelly gay ally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindu goddess of destruction.</v>

1125
01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>She's the thing that you encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the thing that makes things go </v>

1126
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>bump in the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that thing?</v>

1127
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take it apart a little bit because</v>

1128
01:01:09.981 --> 01:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>you can't see this image until you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you understand it,</v>

1129
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:20.110
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be able to if you're Hindu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'd be in the culture and </v>

1130
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>you'd know what the image represented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people in here might be Hindu,</v>

1131
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 1>but not very many people.</v>

1132
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1133
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about this image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrifying image and so you.</v>

1134
01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:32.831
<v Speaker 1>Here's how this image emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It emerged in the imagination of people </v>

1135
01:01:32.831 --> 01:01:36.581
<v Speaker 1>who were tormented for Millennia about </v>
<v Speaker 1>just what the hell lurked out there in </v>

1136
01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>the unknown and some heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some artists was seized by a revelation,</v>

1137
01:01:39.981 --> 01:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>a horrifying revelation of just what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>

1138
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is it?</v>

1139
01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1140
01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>she's in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a container of fire.</v>

1141
01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Why fire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1142
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>fire is useful and destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1143
01:01:54.201 --> 01:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>And you also cannot look away from fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's a really good symbol of that</v>

1144
01:01:58.941 --> 01:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>which you cannot look away from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eternally meaningful.</v>

1145
01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Fire is eternally meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why we can't keep our hands off fire,</v>

1146
01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're descendants of the first insane </v>

1147
01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>ape who was so obsessed by fire that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't stay away from,</v>

1148
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.910
<v Speaker 1>from a burning landscape and learned how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to master it.</v>

1149
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And he's our forefather not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're obsessed</v>

1150
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:22.350
<v Speaker 2>by fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's magical to us.</v>

1151
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.710
<v Speaker 2>And it transforms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It Burns and transformed.</v>

1152
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.950
<v Speaker 2>So from a symbolic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very useful.</v>

1153
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Useful source of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of images.</v>

1154
01:02:29.941 --> 01:02:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Stick representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1155
01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:34.530
<v Speaker 2>The fire's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then inside the fire,</v>

1156
01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:37.410
<v Speaker 2>these are skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them all lined up there.</v>

1157
01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:41.970
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the fire of death that consumes.</v>

1158
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.600
<v Speaker 2>So that's where Kelly lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's fun to start with.</v>

1159
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:50.050
<v Speaker 2>And then there she is with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with her hair,</v>

1160
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:55.250
<v Speaker 2>hair on fire because her hair's on fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>in case she isn't frightening enough </v>

1161
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.860
<v Speaker 2>just because of where she lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their hair's on fire.</v>

1162
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.880
<v Speaker 2>And her head dresses made out of skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's nice.</v>

1163
01:02:59.881 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 2>And then she's like an insect like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spider.</v>

1164
01:03:02.371 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has all these legs and why is that?</v>

1165
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't really like insects and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1166
01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:10.770
<v Speaker 2>they set off our bug detectors and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can bite us and they're quite horrifying</v>

1167
01:03:10.771 --> 01:03:15.771
<v Speaker 2>and many people have spider phobias </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly and a and no wonder and </v>

1168
01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:20.220
<v Speaker 2>then she's got a weapon and one hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and,</v>

1169
01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:25.580
<v Speaker 2>but and then her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see she's eating something and you </v>

1170
01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 2>see here her belly is concave.</v>

1171
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1172
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in a birth position.</v>

1173
01:03:29.611 --> 01:03:34.611
<v Speaker 2>She's just given birth to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate character who happens to be </v>

1174
01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:38.001
<v Speaker 2>low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She who she happens to be standing upon </v>

1175
01:03:38.001 --> 01:03:40.320
<v Speaker 2>and he's disemboweled and she's eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>him intestines first and that's Kelly.</v>

1176
01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:45.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's horror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a representation of horror and </v>

1177
01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:48.780
<v Speaker 2>death and destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation.</v>

1178
01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:52.620
<v Speaker 2>It's feminine as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do in the face of his mother</v>

1179
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:57.621
<v Speaker 2>nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another negative element of </v>

1180
01:03:57.621 --> 01:03:57.621
<v Speaker 2>Mother Nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with something like this?</v>

1181
01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the eternal question and the </v>

1182
01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:04.631
<v Speaker 2>answer is quite straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make sacrifices to her and if you </v>

1183
01:04:04.631 --> 01:04:09.201
<v Speaker 2>make the proper sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then she turns into her beneficial </v>

1184
01:04:09.201 --> 01:04:10.610
<v Speaker 2>counterpart and that's exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do do in life.</v>

1185
01:04:10.611 --> 01:04:15.611
<v Speaker 2>If in the face of horror and death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make sacrifices so you transform the</v>

1186
01:04:16.381 --> 01:04:21.381
<v Speaker 2>terrible destructive element of nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>into that thing that continually offers </v>

1187
01:04:21.381 --> 01:04:23.520
<v Speaker 2>you what you need and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1188
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.960
<v Speaker 2>it's of that discovery is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unparalleled brilliance and you know we </v>

1189
01:04:29.341 --> 01:04:30.030
<v Speaker 2>don't get it.</v>

1190
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.550
<v Speaker 2>We think it's primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's and no wonder you know you,</v>

1191
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:36.090
<v Speaker 2>you can understand human sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds pretty primitive,</v>

1192
01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:37.470
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying,</v>

1193
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:40.610
<v Speaker 2>but the idea of sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's inactive.</v>

1194
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea itself is a conceptualization </v>

1195
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:48.111
<v Speaker 2>of otter genius and why do you expect it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come forward first in its perfect </v>

1196
01:04:48.111 --> 01:04:49.680
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to do that.</v>

1197
01:04:49.681 --> 01:04:54.681
<v Speaker 2>It's going to come forward in perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and roughly and brutally and then </v>

1198
01:04:54.681 --> 01:04:57.540
<v Speaker 2>hopefully be refined across time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what has happened.</v>

1199
01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:02.541
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the biblical stories that </v>

1200
01:05:02.541 --> 01:05:02.541
<v Speaker 2>transition from human sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificed animal sacrifice,</v>

1201
01:05:02.541 --> 01:05:07.371
<v Speaker 2>and then with us now it's the transition</v>
<v Speaker 2>from animal sacrifice to psychological </v>

1202
01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:09.360
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice because we're sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to do that,</v>

1203
01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:14.780
<v Speaker 2>we can let go of concepts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractions and things that were </v>

1204
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>holding onto that we should no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold onto and progress that manner.</v>

1205
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.920
<v Speaker 2>It's increasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulated psychological </v>

1206
01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.210
<v Speaker 2>sophistication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still make sacrifices and we hope</v>

1207
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:30.211
<v Speaker 2>that they'll be accepted and we hope </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're of high enough quality so </v>

1208
01:05:30.211 --> 01:05:33.451
<v Speaker 2>that they work well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a representation of Diana.</v>

1209
01:05:34.251 --> 01:05:36.650
<v Speaker 2>You can think of Diana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an opposite,</v>

1210
01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Speaker 2>a durga in Hinduism and she comes forth </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make the proper sacrifices to </v>

1211
01:05:42.891 --> 01:05:47.891
<v Speaker 2>Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to show you alternative </v>

1212
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:49.140
<v Speaker 2>representations from different cultures </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these archetypes forms.</v>

1213
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:52.220
<v Speaker 2>This is Diana Positive Feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1214
01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Multi breasted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1215
01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.260
<v Speaker 2>She's the thing that nourishes the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that would be on one hand your </v>

1216
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:02.771
<v Speaker 2>mother who obviously protects you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the terrible aspects of fire and danger,</v>

1217
01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:08.060
<v Speaker 2>but also my nature conceptualized as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive feminine in general,</v>

1218
01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:15.260
<v Speaker 2>the source of all fertility and all food</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all beings and all good things.</v>

1219
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Something that you want to have on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

1220
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:22.630
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you might say if you acted </v>

1221
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:26.081
<v Speaker 2>heroically properly and you played the </v>
<v Speaker 2>metagame and not the game and you made </v>

1222
01:06:26.081 --> 01:06:27.680
<v Speaker 2>the proper sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'd never encountered Kelly.</v>

1223
01:06:27.681 --> 01:06:31.160
<v Speaker 2>You would only encounter her benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterpart and so then you might say,</v>

1224
01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:32.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does she even exist?</v>

1225
01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Then that's something that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is because the degree to </v>

1226
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:41.291
<v Speaker 2>which the terrible part of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself in your life is </v>

1227
01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:45.140
<v Speaker 2>proportionate to how insufficient you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and we don't know the full extent of</v>

1228
01:06:45.141 --> 01:06:47.570
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you got your act together completely,</v>

1229
01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe all the suffering would disappear </v>
<v Speaker 2>from your life or at least maybe all the</v>

1230
01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:56.741
<v Speaker 2>unbearable suffering and maybe all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering or the unbearable suffering </v>

1231
01:06:56.741 --> 01:07:01.270
<v Speaker 2>from the lives of people around you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you already know that because there </v>

1232
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:05.471
<v Speaker 2>are people that you'll go to in a crisis</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can rely on and you know </v>

1233
01:07:05.471 --> 01:07:09.221
<v Speaker 2>they'll help you and you wonder what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world would be like if you were like </v>

1234
01:07:09.221 --> 01:07:09.680
<v Speaker 2>that and everyone else was like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1235
01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:14.480
<v Speaker 2>We'd have a lot fewer crises and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that we do have would be a lot more</v>

1236
01:07:14.481 --> 01:07:17.000
<v Speaker 2>manageable and so when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1237
01:07:17.001 --> 01:07:22.001
<v Speaker 2>why is the world so rife with suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One answer to that is because we're not </v>

1238
01:07:22.001 --> 01:07:26.981
<v Speaker 2>yet what we could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at least that's an answer that we </v>

1239
01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:26.981
<v Speaker 2>have some control over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1240
01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:29.630
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to talk God out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>making the world suffer.</v>

1241
01:07:29.631 --> 01:07:34.631
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not going to negotiate </v>

1242
01:07:34.631 --> 01:07:36.371
<v Speaker 2>directly with Mother Nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you might be able to put yourself </v>

1243
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:36.371
<v Speaker 2>together a little bit and see if that </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

1244
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:41.171
<v Speaker 2>At least it's under your control and God</v>
<v Speaker 2>only knows what the upper limit of that </v>

1245
01:07:41.171 --> 01:07:43.980
<v Speaker 2>might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1246
01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:47.100
<v Speaker 2>here's the decomposition of the of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental archetype.</v>

1247
01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:51.210
<v Speaker 2>The dragon of chaos differentiates on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the one hand into the feminine.</v>

1248
01:07:51.211 --> 01:07:54.780
<v Speaker 2>That's the unknown in the feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiates further into the negative</v>

1249
01:07:54.781 --> 01:07:59.781
<v Speaker 2>feminine than the Positive Feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The negative feminine is the reason for </v>

1250
01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:01.960
<v Speaker 2>which haunts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the reason for.</v>

1251
01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:08.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole group online called men </v>

1252
01:08:08.791 --> 01:08:11.250
<v Speaker 2>going their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>G T o w,</v>

1253
01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:14.370
<v Speaker 2>that's a very interesting group to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>

1254
01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 2>There's lots them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many</v>

1255
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>of them there are and most of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>

1256
01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:23.291
<v Speaker 1>Many of them are men who have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a particularly horrifying </v>

1257
01:08:23.291 --> 01:08:25.691
<v Speaker 1>divorce for one reason or another and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there they've had enough of women so </v>

1258
01:08:25.691 --> 01:08:30.551
<v Speaker 1>they stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell that young men that they're </v>

1259
01:08:30.551 --> 01:08:30.551
<v Speaker 1>teaching never have a permanent </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

1260
01:08:30.551 --> 01:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Never share your territory with a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never share your possessions.</v>

1261
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you never lived together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't stay with one long enough to enter</v>

1262
01:08:38.721 --> 01:08:43.721
<v Speaker 1>a common law relationship because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be stripped of everything that you </v>

1263
01:08:43.721 --> 01:08:43.721
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1264
01:08:43.721 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a thing to be telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1265
01:08:44.691 --> 01:08:49.691
<v Speaker 1>but what's happened is that the female </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been manifested in their life only </v>

1266
01:08:49.691 --> 01:08:54.191
<v Speaker 1>as the negative archetype and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got that confused with all women and </v>

1267
01:08:54.191 --> 01:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>that's partly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1268
01:08:54.741 --> 01:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>you gotta ask yourself if you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological stories.</v>

1269
01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you made the right sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have so much trouble with </v>

1270
01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:02.440
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

1271
01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question to ask yourself </v>

1272
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:06.170
<v Speaker 1>first and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would also say,</v>

1273
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:10.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a woman who has trouble with </v>

1274
01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:10.940
<v Speaker 1>man or you're a man who has trouble with</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

1275
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:16.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not the women and it's not the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you because the women are telling </v>

1276
01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:19.490
<v Speaker 1>you what's wrong with you and the men </v>
<v Speaker 1>are telling you what's wrong with you.</v>

1277
01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:23.780
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't listen then it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either you are all men.</v>

1278
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Well that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all men.</v>

1279
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:28.010
<v Speaker 1>While that's certainly how it's played </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the world right now,</v>

1280
01:09:28.011 --> 01:09:29.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1281
01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not all men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be by definition,</v>

1282
01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 1>by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not all women,</v>

1283
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:38.090
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have anything to do with</v>

1284
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.400
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a pathetic weasel.</v>

1285
01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:42.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the same statement.</v>

1286
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's some lovely representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Mary from represented in,</v>

1287
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.160
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in very different areas.</v>

1288
01:09:51.161 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 1>This is a very old witnesses about </v>
<v Speaker 1>twelfth century.</v>

1289
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:55.580
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely love this image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so profound.</v>

1290
01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.660
<v Speaker 1>So what you see here is Mary as in as </v>
<v Speaker 1>eternal mother of the infant.</v>

1291
01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's sitting on the crescent moon here.</v>

1292
01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:05.210
<v Speaker 1>She tweeted the night and underneath you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't see this very well,</v>

1293
01:10:05.211 --> 01:10:10.211
<v Speaker 1>but underneath the moon there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reptile and she's got a nice </v>

1294
01:10:10.211 --> 01:10:11.420
<v Speaker 1>nicely underneath their feet and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan in part,</v>

1295
01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.230
<v Speaker 1>which means protect your children from </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent,</v>

1296
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.820
<v Speaker 1>from malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the Predator.</v>

1297
01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:21.821
<v Speaker 1>And so what's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the proper orientation for </v>

1298
01:10:21.821 --> 01:10:25.330
<v Speaker 1>mother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protect your infant from malevolent </v>

1299
01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:25.330
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1300
01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:27.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the holy image of the mother.</v>

1301
01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.540
<v Speaker 1>So she's holding the infant safely in </v>
<v Speaker 1>her arms.</v>

1302
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:33.230
<v Speaker 1>She's queen of the universe and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of this strange tunnel.</v>

1303
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:35.330
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are called Amanda by the way.</v>

1304
01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:36.640
<v Speaker 1>This tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>

1305
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:40.130
<v Speaker 1>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be very strange,</v>

1306
01:10:40.131 --> 01:10:41.660
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to tell you what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

1307
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:46.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hole into the fabric of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and space and it's revealing in the </v>

1308
01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.950
<v Speaker 1>image that's eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's outside of time and space and </v>

1309
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:52.520
<v Speaker 1>it's outside of time and space because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it recurs all the time.</v>

1310
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It never ages that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1311
01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:00.820
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an image that transcends </v>

1312
01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:00.820
<v Speaker 1>temporality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

1313
01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:00.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it real?</v>

1314
01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:01.970
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1315
01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:05.780
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that transcends temporality is</v>

1316
01:11:05.781 --> 01:11:07.730
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

1317
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:09.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1318
01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:14.150
<v Speaker 1>that hole in the sky represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also represents the place from which </v>

1319
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:14.150
<v Speaker 1>all forms</v>

1320
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 2>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a biological component to it </v>

1321
01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1322
01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:22.341
<v Speaker 2>So it's as if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if these divine figures are standing </v>

1323
01:11:22.341 --> 01:11:26.451
<v Speaker 2>in front while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you in a minute of what </v>

1324
01:11:26.451 --> 01:11:28.071
<v Speaker 2>they're standing in front of and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>here the same thing with these little </v>

1325
01:11:28.071 --> 01:11:28.071
<v Speaker 2>poteat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're called,</v>

1326
01:11:28.071 --> 01:11:31.380
<v Speaker 2>sort of embedded in the fleshlight folds</v>
<v Speaker 2>law around here,</v>

1327
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 2>and you see mary here holding the infant</v>
<v Speaker 2>again away from the terrible predator.</v>

1328
01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:39.330
<v Speaker 2>That's the serpent of chaos down there </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1329
01:11:39.331 --> 01:11:42.120
<v Speaker 2>in the ocean and that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

1330
01:11:42.121 --> 01:11:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Why would the servant of chaos be in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean?</v>

1331
01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of our ancestral infants do you</v>

1332
01:11:46.831 --> 01:11:50.880
<v Speaker 2>suppose were eaten by crocodiles at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>waterhole and plenty,</v>

1333
01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:56.330
<v Speaker 2>plenty of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's something to be terrified </v>

1334
01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 2>of and to take precautions against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and then this image here,</v>

1335
01:11:58.321 --> 01:12:03.321
<v Speaker 2>the older one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see all these weird little figures in </v>

1336
01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:03.321
<v Speaker 2>the background here.</v>

1337
01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:05.440
<v Speaker 2>You can't see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're musical instruments there.</v>

1338
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:09.270
<v Speaker 2>There are all sorts of archaic musical </v>
<v Speaker 2>instruments and so here's,</v>

1339
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:14.300
<v Speaker 2>here's what the image means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means the potential from which this </v>

1340
01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 2>figure is emerging is like a musical </v>
<v Speaker 2>construction.</v>

1341
01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:21.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a symphony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this pattern layer.</v>

1342
01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:26.480
<v Speaker 2>It's patterns layer upon layers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>harmonious patterns that make up being </v>

1343
01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.040
<v Speaker 2>and out of that emerges this image and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what that image represents and </v>

1344
01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.541
<v Speaker 2>that's what music represents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It represents this pattern potential </v>

1345
01:12:35.541 --> 01:12:35.940
<v Speaker 2>that we're constantly interacting with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's deeply,</v>

1346
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:38.760
<v Speaker 2>deeply meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we love music so much.</v>

1347
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I've got a that's an absolute work of </v>
<v Speaker 2>genius to put those two things together.</v>

1348
01:12:42.871 --> 01:12:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1349
01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.330
<v Speaker 2>it's remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable image.</v>

1350
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:47.590
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1351
01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's stop there and we'll meet again in</v>

1352
01:12:56.730 --> 01:13:01.730
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes and then this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the positive feminine on the </v>

1353
01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:05.841
<v Speaker 2>left and then on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the Gorgon and that's the thing </v>

1354
01:13:05.841 --> 01:13:07.020
<v Speaker 2>that fills you with terror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at it,</v>

1355
01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:10.320
<v Speaker 2>there's another representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive feminine.</v>

1356
01:13:10.321 --> 01:13:13.260
<v Speaker 2>It's another representation of Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are representations very much like</v>

1357
01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:18.261
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I assist with horace on your lap and </v>

1358
01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:18.440
<v Speaker 2>people often consider those precursors </v>
<v Speaker 2>there Egypt,</v>

1359
01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian statues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>precursors to the Christian iconography </v>

1360
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:27.530
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose in some sense they are in so </v>

1361
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:30.270
<v Speaker 2>far as they predated them in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fundamental issue is that,</v>

1362
01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:36.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this image has to be held up as </v>

1363
01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:36.890
<v Speaker 2>transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by that I mean it's,</v>

1364
01:13:36.891 --> 01:13:41.891
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an image that's got to be at the </v>

1365
01:13:41.891 --> 01:13:43.851
<v Speaker 2>basis of a value structure that actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>works in so far as there's going to be </v>

1366
01:13:43.851 --> 01:13:47.841
<v Speaker 2>human beings because there aren't any </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings without the infinite and </v>

1367
01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:51.351
<v Speaker 2>the mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if that's not held up as a as an </v>

1368
01:13:51.351 --> 01:13:54.231
<v Speaker 2>image of ultimate value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everything falls apart and it's </v>

1369
01:13:54.231 --> 01:13:55.230
<v Speaker 2>something our culture does </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily badly.</v>

1370
01:13:55.740 --> 01:14:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I had a client recently admit to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ashamed tones that she wanted to have </v>

1371
01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.560
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought.</v>

1372
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:02.370
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1373
01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be ashamed of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially not if you're talking to me.</v>

1374
01:14:04.861 --> 01:14:05.370
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1375
01:14:05.371 --> 01:14:08.460
<v Speaker 2>that's such a relief because I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to anyone about it at work.</v>

1376
01:14:08.461 --> 01:14:10.230
<v Speaker 2>They seem to think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1377
01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>degrading thought that</v>

1378
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you can hardly diagnosed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The culture is more pathological than </v>

1379
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:20.970
<v Speaker 1>then that that's so appalling and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so hard is one of the things I really </v>

1380
01:14:20.970 --> 01:14:23.320
<v Speaker 1>feel badly for young women because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not guided through this with any</v>

1381
01:14:23.321 --> 01:14:26.140
<v Speaker 1>sense whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you what my experience has</v>

1382
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>been working with women and you can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>this for what it's worth.</v>

1383
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:34.770
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've worked with women who have </v>

1384
01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:34.770
<v Speaker 1>achieved the highest levels of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>profession.</v>

1385
01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean just in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a number of different fields.</v>

1386
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:40.270
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens will we'll take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical woman,</v>

1387
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.210
<v Speaker 1>conservative woman because they're more </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical conscientious,</v>

1388
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:46.480
<v Speaker 1>not particularly open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're there due to fool people,</v>

1389
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:51.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their existing within the structures of </v>

1390
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.760
<v Speaker 1>their society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll take female lawyers is a classic</v>

1391
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:53.620
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're very good at high school,</v>

1392
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:58.770
<v Speaker 1>very hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent but very but very </v>

1393
01:14:58.770 --> 01:14:59.080
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and often rather agreeable.</v>

1394
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's important because it means to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree that they want to please and</v>

1395
01:15:02.861 --> 01:15:07.861
<v Speaker 1>they'll do what they're told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason I think that </v>

1396
01:15:07.861 --> 01:15:07.900
<v Speaker 1>women are outperforming men in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in elementary,</v>

1397
01:15:07.901 --> 01:15:12.901
<v Speaker 1>junior high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school and university is because </v>

1398
01:15:12.901 --> 01:15:15.061
<v Speaker 1>they're more likely to be obedient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that to some degree because </v>

1399
01:15:15.061 --> 01:15:18.541
<v Speaker 1>we did analysis of students in Quebec </v>
<v Speaker 1>and found out that one thing that </v>

1400
01:15:18.541 --> 01:15:22.441
<v Speaker 1>predicted grades over and above </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and conscientiousness was </v>

1401
01:15:22.441 --> 01:15:26.401
<v Speaker 1>agreeable nus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And agreeable people got better grades </v>

1402
01:15:26.401 --> 01:15:26.710
<v Speaker 1>than their Iq and conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>would predict,</v>

1403
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's particularly negative for </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

1404
01:15:28.841 --> 01:15:33.841
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this is what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're a borderline student and </v>

1405
01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:37.600
<v Speaker 1>you're also a bit rebellious and anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>social.</v>

1406
01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fail you like you're right </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the cusp.</v>

1407
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Don't like you much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fail.</v>

1408
01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:46.720
<v Speaker 1>You have exactly the same grade profile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like you tick,</v>

1409
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you move ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

1410
01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's dividing</v>
<v Speaker 1>men from women as they progress through </v>

1411
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:55.330
<v Speaker 1>school is the degree to which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable.</v>

1412
01:15:55.540 --> 01:16:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Now that works out to some degree for </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in so far as the agreeableness </v>

1413
01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:04.861
<v Speaker 1>moves them forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they encountered the negative </v>

1414
01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:04.861
<v Speaker 1>elements of being agreeable later in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their careers.</v>

1415
01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are women are very good in high </v>

1416
01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:09.340
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they go to college.</v>

1417
01:16:09.341 --> 01:16:11.800
<v Speaker 1>They're very good in college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They nailed their damn grades.</v>

1418
01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:16.801
<v Speaker 1>They do their studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get their a's and they had the ace </v>

1419
01:16:16.801 --> 01:16:17.410
<v Speaker 1>their set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're smart too.</v>

1420
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Then they go off to do their articling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're really,</v>

1421
01:16:19.811 --> 01:16:24.811
<v Speaker 1>really good at it and then they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>offered an associate position and </v>

1422
01:16:24.811 --> 01:16:24.811
<v Speaker 1>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

1423
01:16:24.811 --> 01:16:29.011
<v Speaker 1>At it and then by the time they're 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>they make partner and let's say they're </v>

1424
01:16:29.011 --> 01:16:29.710
<v Speaker 1>in high pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high paying jobs,</v>

1425
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:31.540
<v Speaker 1>$250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

1426
01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:32.770
<v Speaker 1>$300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

1427
01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:34.630
<v Speaker 1>$500 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1428
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.950
<v Speaker 1>What's your life like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You work all the time,</v>

1429
01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.590
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy hours a week,</v>

1430
01:16:41.591 --> 01:16:46.591
<v Speaker 1>75 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat out and you don't get to make any </v>

1431
01:16:46.591 --> 01:16:49.540
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and if your client calls you at</v>
<v Speaker 1>three in the morning on Monday,</v>

1432
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.600
<v Speaker 1>on Sunday you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really glad to hear you hear from </v>

1433
01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.021
<v Speaker 1>you because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some hot law firm in New York </v>

1434
01:16:58.021 --> 01:16:59.740
<v Speaker 1>that'll take your client from you at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment's notice and the client is paying</v>

1435
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:04.741
<v Speaker 1>you whatever the firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven hundred and $50 an hour of which </v>

1436
01:17:04.741 --> 01:17:08.641
<v Speaker 1>maybe you get 3:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they want is an answer about </v>

1437
01:17:08.641 --> 01:17:08.950
<v Speaker 1>something really complicated right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bloody now.</v>

1438
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:14.530
<v Speaker 1>And you can say all you want about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that women have a difficult time </v>

1439
01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:16.500
<v Speaker 1>with that because it's a male dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy new.</v>

1440
01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Any female lawyer who's hit 30 and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner that has any sense at all knows </v>

1441
01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:21.800
<v Speaker 1>that's complete bloody rubbish.</v>

1442
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.870
<v Speaker 1>It's market determined right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>core.</v>

1443
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:26.720
<v Speaker 1>What happens to the women when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their thirties?</v>

1444
01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>They all leave the high end law firms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1445
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Because who in their right mind would </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to live like that?</v>

1446
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:36.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1447
01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Once you make about $60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year for your family,</v>

1448
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:45.191
<v Speaker 1>but let's say for you personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>additional income makes zero has zero </v>

1449
01:17:45.191 --> 01:17:47.600
<v Speaker 1>impact on your quality of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

1450
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:51.080
<v Speaker 1>So why work 80 hours a week while men </v>
<v Speaker 1>will do it?</v>

1451
01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Some men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few,</v>

1452
01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:58.300
<v Speaker 1>a handful of hyper competitive men who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are obsessed with hitting the pinnacle </v>

1453
01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:01.940
<v Speaker 1>of the given dominance hierarchy there </v>
<v Speaker 1>in will happily work 80 hours a week and</v>

1454
01:18:01.941 --> 01:18:04.610
<v Speaker 1>they'll forgo everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relationships,</v>

1455
01:18:04.611 --> 01:18:08.420
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children way in the second category,</v>

1456
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:13.630
<v Speaker 1>and so those men are often very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to live with too because </v>

1457
01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:16.331
<v Speaker 1>they're so obsessed with their career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to have a relationship with </v>

1458
01:18:16.331 --> 01:18:17.150
<v Speaker 1>them and maybe they don't have much of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with their kids,</v>

1459
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 1>but they're damn good at what they do.</v>

1460
01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:23.860
<v Speaker 1>And part of that is is they're smart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined and they'll work nonstop all</v>

1461
01:18:24.171 --> 01:18:29.171
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an obsession and that's the </v>

1462
01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:31.841
<v Speaker 1>sort of people who run things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people who run things </v>

1463
01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:33.410
<v Speaker 1>while they're often also disagreeable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to.</v>

1464
01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:36.410
<v Speaker 1>You wrote a manage people really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to like you,</v>

1465
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:39.140
<v Speaker 1>you know when it's not an easy thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be liked.</v>

1466
01:18:39.141 --> 01:18:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And actually if you're an agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and women are more agreeable than</v>

1467
01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:44.660
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite painful to be disliked.</v>

1468
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:47.180
<v Speaker 1>But if you're in a managerial and </v>
<v Speaker 1>executive position,</v>

1469
01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:50.420
<v Speaker 1>the probability that people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you is quite low.</v>

1470
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a real son of a bitch,</v>

1471
01:18:52.221 --> 01:18:54.230
<v Speaker 1>then they're going to dislike you more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's.</v>

1472
01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:59.231
<v Speaker 1>It's those sit in those positions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very stressful partly because of the </v>

1473
01:18:59.231 --> 01:19:00.800
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal dynamics and they're also </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly,</v>

1474
01:19:00.801 --> 01:19:02.390
<v Speaker 1>incredibly competitive.</v>

1475
01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.410
<v Speaker 1>So the women hit that at 30 and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely qualified in the law.</v>

1476
01:19:06.411 --> 01:19:11.411
<v Speaker 1>Firms are bloodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate to keep them because it's </v>

1477
01:19:11.411 --> 01:19:11.411
<v Speaker 1>really hard to find highly qualified </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1478
01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.550
<v Speaker 1>especially once you've put all that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>into training them,</v>

1479
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.040
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're also good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing in business.</v>

1480
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:19.330
<v Speaker 1>The law firm's trip over themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to keep them account.</v>

1481
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:22.400
<v Speaker 1>The women think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why in the world am I doing this?</v>

1482
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Why when the world would anyone in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>right mind do this?</v>

1483
01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Especially because they're often married</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that point too,</v>

1484
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:33.850
<v Speaker 1>and generally they've married a husband </v>
<v Speaker 1>who makes as much money or more than </v>

1485
01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 1>them so they don't need the damn money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they think,</v>

1486
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:37.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to life than this,</v>

1487
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:39.380
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the right thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1488
01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:44.500
<v Speaker 1>and so they go and find a job that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine to five and controllable so that </v>

1489
01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:47.570
<v Speaker 1>they can hire a nanny and have some kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a life and it's like,</v>

1490
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:50.000
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the intelligent thing to do.</v>

1491
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:53.090
<v Speaker 1>So we've got things backwards in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1492
01:19:53.091 --> 01:19:56.300
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't there more women in positions</v>

1493
01:19:56.301 --> 01:19:58.370
<v Speaker 1>of power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrong question.</v>

1494
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:04.090
<v Speaker 1>The right question is why are there any </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute all who want those positions of </v>

1495
01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:06.230
<v Speaker 1>power because it's not just positions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1496
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:08.610
<v Speaker 1>You have to be such a knothead to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1497
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:10.140
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a position of power.</v>

1498
01:20:10.141 --> 01:20:11.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

1499
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:15.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's a position of overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and if you make mistakes,</v>

1500
01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.790
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1501
01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:22.791
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you occupy that position </v>
<v Speaker 1>of power and everyone does what they're </v>

1502
01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:23.790
<v Speaker 1>told all the time in your life is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like forget about that.</v>

1503
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:27.930
<v Speaker 1>People are on your case to do exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right thing all the time,</v>

1504
01:20:27.931 --> 01:20:31.020
<v Speaker 1>100 percent of the time and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want that.</v>

1505
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:36.021
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the what I don't know what people </v>

1506
01:20:36.021 --> 01:20:38.691
<v Speaker 1>think is these people are all sitting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their offices with their feet up on the </v>

1507
01:20:38.691 --> 01:20:38.691
<v Speaker 1>desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking cigars,</v>

1508
01:20:38.691 --> 01:20:39.630
<v Speaker 1>no pressing the world.</v>

1509
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like that isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people,</v>

1510
01:20:41.821 --> 01:20:46.200
<v Speaker 1>they work flat out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1511
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:48.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's fine if that's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people are like that.</v>

1512
01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:50.490
<v Speaker 1>They're hyper industrious people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1513
01:20:50.491 --> 01:20:53.160
<v Speaker 1>From a trade perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you put them,</v>

1514
01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.100
<v Speaker 1>if you put them in a forest with an axe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just wander around,</v>

1515
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.170
<v Speaker 1>chopping down trees nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1516
01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Because there it's built into them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to have a balanced life </v>

1517
01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.560
<v Speaker 1>and you should want that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1518
01:21:04.561 --> 01:21:08.790
<v Speaker 1>because the other thing you'll find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is God's Gospel Truth,</v>

1519
01:21:08.791 --> 01:21:11.520
<v Speaker 1>is that the older you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sense at all,</v>

1520
01:21:11.521 --> 01:21:13.800
<v Speaker 1>the more important your family is to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1521
01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:18.850
<v Speaker 1>that the utility of your career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that peaks around 35 or 40 and it </v>

1522
01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:21.570
<v Speaker 1>starts to decline pretty rapidly after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1523
01:21:21.571 --> 01:21:26.571
<v Speaker 1>And what happens if you're fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have someone in your life that you </v>

1524
01:21:26.571 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've woven yourself together with</v>

1525
01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:32.541
<v Speaker 1>and you have some kids so that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do from the time you're 50 </v>

1526
01:21:32.541 --> 01:21:32.670
<v Speaker 1>till the time you're 80.</v>

1527
01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:36.510
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a real mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a barren future without children.</v>

1528
01:21:36.511 --> 01:21:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that it's a real mistake.</v>

1529
01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And so we do a terrible job of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting that image forward and saying,</v>

1530
01:21:43.321 --> 01:21:43.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1531
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:48.950
<v Speaker 1>now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because women have access to the birth </v>

1532
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:50.670
<v Speaker 1>control pill now and can compete in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same domains as men.</v>

1533
01:21:50.671 --> 01:21:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a real practical problem here.</v>

1534
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.900
<v Speaker 1>It's partly an economic problem now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I was roughly your age,</v>

1535
01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:03.080
<v Speaker 1>it was still possible for a one income </v>
<v Speaker 1>family to exist.</v>

1536
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that wages have been flat </v>

1537
01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:10.230
<v Speaker 1>except in the upper one percent since </v>
<v Speaker 1>1973.</v>

1538
01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1539
01:22:11.731 --> 01:22:16.731
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you double the labor </v>

1540
01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:16.731
<v Speaker 1>force?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

1541
01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:21.470
<v Speaker 1>You have the value of labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we're in a situation where it </v>

1542
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:22.260
<v Speaker 1>takes two people to make as much as one </v>
<v Speaker 1>did before.</v>

1543
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:27.500
<v Speaker 1>So we went from a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's career opportunities were </v>

1544
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:31.221
<v Speaker 1>relatively limited to where they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively unlimited and there were two </v>

1545
01:22:31.221 --> 01:22:35.511
<v Speaker 1>incomes to wear and so women could work </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a situation where women have to work </v>

1546
01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:39.000
<v Speaker 1>and they only make half as much as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have otherwise.</v>

1547
01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:40.920
<v Speaker 1>And now we're going to go into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1548
01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:46.040
<v Speaker 1>This is the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas women will work because men </v>

1549
01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.880
<v Speaker 1>won't and that's what's coming now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we.</v>

1550
01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:52.881
<v Speaker 1>There was an economics economist </v>
<v Speaker 1>articles showing that 50 percent now of </v>

1551
01:22:52.881 --> 01:22:57.150
<v Speaker 1>of boys in school or having trouble with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their basic subjects and you look around</v>

1552
01:22:57.151 --> 01:22:59.350
<v Speaker 1>you and universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see this happening now.</v>

1553
01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I've watched it over decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say 90 percent of the people in </v>

1554
01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.180
<v Speaker 1>my personality class are now women there</v>
<v Speaker 1>will a damn man left in university in 10</v>

1555
01:23:07.181 --> 01:23:12.181
<v Speaker 1>years except in the stem fields and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complete bloody catastrophe and it's a</v>

1556
01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:15.460
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe for women because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know where the hell you're going to find</v>

1557
01:23:15.461 --> 01:23:18.910
<v Speaker 1>someone to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to marry and have a family with.</v>

1558
01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.980
<v Speaker 1>If this keeps happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1559
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:24.250
<v Speaker 1>And you think when you're 19 because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so clueless when you're 19,</v>

1560
01:23:24.251 --> 01:23:25.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't know a bloody thing.</v>

1561
01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:26.080
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1562
01:23:26.081 --> 01:23:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really sure I want children </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

1563
01:23:27.911 --> 01:23:28.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

1564
01:23:28.601 --> 01:23:31.510
<v Speaker 1>You tell how well you've been educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1565
01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.790
<v Speaker 1>dismal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismal.</v>

1566
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Without fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>

1567
01:23:36.791 --> 01:23:41.791
<v Speaker 1>without fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched women go through their </v>

1568
01:23:41.791 --> 01:23:41.791
<v Speaker 1>professional careers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1569
01:23:41.791 --> 01:23:43.810
<v Speaker 1>many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very rare woman who at the age of</v>

1570
01:23:43.811 --> 01:23:48.811
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't consider having a child her </v>

1571
01:23:48.811 --> 01:23:49.960
<v Speaker 1>primary desire and the ones that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider that.</v>

1572
01:23:49.961 --> 01:23:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Generally in my observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something that isn't quite right</v>

1573
01:23:53.231 --> 01:23:55.870
<v Speaker 1>in the way that they're constituted are </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world.</v>

1574
01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get women who are truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>non maternal,</v>

1575
01:23:58.391 --> 01:24:03.391
<v Speaker 1>you know by temperament there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a masculine temporary </v>

1576
01:24:03.391 --> 01:24:03.391
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>

1577
01:24:03.391 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 1>They're not particularly compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not maternal.</v>

1578
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:07.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not that interested in kids.</v>

1579
01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1580
01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:13.200
<v Speaker 1>but there aren't that many of them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty who will not admit to </v>

1581
01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.340
<v Speaker 1>themselves that that's what they most </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately want.</v>

1582
01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Do you think women would be better off </v>
<v Speaker 4>if they had earlier?</v>

1583
01:24:22.710 --> 01:24:27.710
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like it really is a problem </v>

1584
01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:29.190
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a really tough one.</v>

1585
01:24:29.191 --> 01:24:31.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody knows the answer </v>
<v Speaker 5>to that because</v>

1586
01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:34.360
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>11,</v>

1587
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:37.090
<v Speaker 4>then you can go and get a bachelor's and</v>
<v Speaker 4>master's.</v>

1588
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:41.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>easy that way.</v>

1589
01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:44.860
<v Speaker 4>Having the career first and then trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to raise young kids.</v>

1590
01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:46.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1591
01:24:46.170 --> 01:24:51.170
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't answer that because I've seen </v>

1592
01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:53.100
<v Speaker 5>women do a good job of it both both ways</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you do get the odd woman who manages</v>

1593
01:24:53.101 --> 01:24:55.040
<v Speaker 5>a high powered career and kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Jesus,</v>

1594
01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.040
<v Speaker 5>those women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1595
01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:57.930
<v Speaker 5>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1596
01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:02.960
<v Speaker 5>they buy more powerful Mike Royce </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it'll take 45 seconds to cook </v>

1597
01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.620
<v Speaker 5>the food instead of a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not kidding.</v>

1598
01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:06.150
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're up at five.</v>

1599
01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:08.730
<v Speaker 5>They exercise for half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make breakfast,</v>

1600
01:25:08.731 --> 01:25:10.470
<v Speaker 5>they get their kids ready to work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go to work.</v>

1601
01:25:10.471 --> 01:25:13.740
<v Speaker 5>They worked 14 hours at 14 hour days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flat bloody out.</v>

1602
01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:16.650
<v Speaker 5>They come home and work for another two </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours to get their kids organized.</v>

1603
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:20.640
<v Speaker 5>They have a nanny to help them out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then they work for two more hours before</v>

1604
01:25:20.641 --> 01:25:25.641
<v Speaker 5>they go to bed at like one and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're up at five and they do that </v>

1605
01:25:25.641 --> 01:25:28.221
<v Speaker 5>again and I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you better be tough if you're going to </v>

1606
01:25:28.221 --> 01:25:30.711
<v Speaker 5>do that physically too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you'll just burn yourself to a </v>

1607
01:25:30.711 --> 01:25:30.711
<v Speaker 5>crisp.</v>

1608
01:25:30.711 --> 01:25:31.430
<v Speaker 5>I've seen some women manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1609
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:36.590
<v Speaker 5>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're tough and they're rare because </v>

1610
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:39.510
<v Speaker 5>that's a hell of a hell of a regimen and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then if anything goes wrong,</v>

1611
01:25:39.511 --> 01:25:44.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a sick kid or something like </v>

1612
01:25:44.511 --> 01:25:46.041
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or there's any sort of crisis in your </v>

1613
01:25:46.041 --> 01:25:46.041
<v Speaker 5>family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

1614
01:25:46.041 --> 01:25:49.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it then it becomes too much and I don't </v>

1615
01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:50.070
<v Speaker 5>know the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1616
01:25:50.071 --> 01:25:55.071
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the advantage women have is they live </v>

1617
01:25:55.071 --> 01:25:56.841
<v Speaker 5>about eight years longer than men </v>
<v Speaker 5>because testosterone kills men so well </v>

1618
01:25:58.921 --> 01:26:00.030
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's right.</v>

1619
01:26:00.031 --> 01:26:02.970
<v Speaker 5>They pay up front and gain on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

1620
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the long run.</v>

1621
01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:08.090
<v Speaker 5>But how it isn't clear how our society </v>
<v Speaker 5>should sort this out,</v>

1622
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.550
<v Speaker 5>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's partly we don't know what to do</v>

1623
01:26:10.551 --> 01:26:12.860
<v Speaker 5>now that women have control over their </v>
<v Speaker 5>reproductive function.</v>

1624
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:14.510
<v Speaker 5>It's a big mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1625
01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:22.080
<v Speaker 6>But I think from a practical,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the workforce later on,</v>

1626
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:27.710
<v Speaker 6>competition with people and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>always.</v>

1627
01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:33.960
<v Speaker 6>People are always hiring joggers because</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll have lots of.</v>

1628
01:26:36.170 --> 01:26:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1629
01:26:37.161 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the thing is young,</v>

1630
01:26:38.841 --> 01:26:41.120
<v Speaker 5>stupid people have the advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 5>being young,</v>

1631
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:47.050
<v Speaker 5>middle aged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid people have the disadvantage of </v>

1632
01:26:47.050 --> 01:26:49.391
<v Speaker 5>being middle aged and so if you're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to hire a young stupid person or a </v>

1633
01:26:49.391 --> 01:26:49.910
<v Speaker 5>middle aged stupid person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll go for the young,</v>

1634
01:26:49.911 --> 01:26:51.830
<v Speaker 5>stupid person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm stupid.</v>

1635
01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:52.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1636
01:26:52.431 --> 01:26:55.040
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not I'm being sarcastic obviously,</v>

1637
01:26:55.041 --> 01:27:00.041
<v Speaker 5>but I mean without,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without experience and just getting </v>

1638
01:27:00.041 --> 01:27:01.010
<v Speaker 5>started in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're much more likely to favor someone</v>

1639
01:27:01.011 --> 01:27:06.011
<v Speaker 5>young because there's an instant </v>
<v Speaker 5>explanation for their relative </v>

1640
01:27:06.011 --> 01:27:06.980
<v Speaker 5>cluelessness and it's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1641
01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.310
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know what the answer is,</v>

1642
01:27:10.311 --> 01:27:15.311
<v Speaker 5>but one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one answer certainly is at least in </v>

1643
01:27:15.311 --> 01:27:18.281
<v Speaker 5>part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to start letting young women know </v>

1644
01:27:18.281 --> 01:27:19.400
<v Speaker 5>what being 30 and being female is like </v>
<v Speaker 5>because.</v>

1645
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:24.490
<v Speaker 5>And also to disabuse them of the notion </v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's something magical about a </v>

1646
01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:24.490
<v Speaker 5>career.</v>

1647
01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:25.370
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people don't have careers,</v>

1648
01:27:25.371 --> 01:27:30.371
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have jobs and the reason you get </v>

1649
01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:32.951
<v Speaker 5>paid for a job is because you're being </v>
<v Speaker 5>asked to do things you wouldn't do </v>

1650
01:27:32.951 --> 01:27:33.680
<v Speaker 5>unless you were being paid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's not.</v>

1651
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:37.520
<v Speaker 5>It's not some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not some utopia of cigar smoking.</v>

1652
01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:39.410
<v Speaker 5>With your boots up on your desk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>

1653
01:27:39.411 --> 01:27:42.140
<v Speaker 5>Not Hot that that would be such a utopia</v>
<v Speaker 5>to begin with.</v>

1654
01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:44.900
<v Speaker 5>But alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

1655
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:50.350
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is more differentiation of the </v>

1656
01:27:50.781 --> 01:27:53.930
<v Speaker 5>archetype fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you see the dragon of chaos here,</v>

1657
01:27:53.931 --> 01:27:57.680
<v Speaker 5>the potential manifesting itself into </v>
<v Speaker 5>this ambivalent feminine figure.</v>

1658
01:27:57.681 --> 01:28:00.750
<v Speaker 5>Both both promise and threat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I've,</v>

1659
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:04.250
<v Speaker 5>I've mapped this one out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the ambivalent feminine figure,</v>

1660
01:28:04.251 --> 01:28:09.251
<v Speaker 5>so sort of multi valence gives rise to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the positive mother and then the </v>

1661
01:28:09.251 --> 01:28:10.970
<v Speaker 5>positive mother gives birth to the hero </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's Hercules there.</v>

1662
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:12.860
<v Speaker 5>And this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like this image a lot.</v>

1663
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:17.780
<v Speaker 5>So Hercules is in this container so that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can interpret that both as something</v>

1664
01:28:17.781 --> 01:28:18.830
<v Speaker 5>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the container,</v>

1665
01:28:18.831 --> 01:28:21.560
<v Speaker 5>but also as a representative of culture </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's a boat.</v>

1666
01:28:21.561 --> 01:28:24.530
<v Speaker 5>It's floating on the chaotic ocean here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's Hercules.</v>

1667
01:28:24.531 --> 01:28:29.210
<v Speaker 5>He asked to be in a container that </v>
<v Speaker 5>sustains him in the murky water of chaos</v>

1668
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 5>and you see he's going out into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>unknown and he's got a lion skin on.</v>

1669
01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:39.170
<v Speaker 5>And that's partly because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>initiation rituals for,</v>

1670
01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:44.260
<v Speaker 5>for young men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the reliance say in the Middle </v>

1671
01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:44.260
<v Speaker 5>East,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that wasn't very long ago,</v>

1672
01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:47.951
<v Speaker 5>was that you had to go out and kill a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lion with a spear and with a bow and </v>

1673
01:28:47.951 --> 01:28:50.330
<v Speaker 5>Arrow or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like that's impressive.</v>

1674
01:28:50.630 --> 01:28:53.060
<v Speaker 5>All things considered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you really think about that for a</v>

1675
01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:58.061
<v Speaker 5>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really want to go out and try to </v>

1676
01:28:58.061 --> 01:28:58.061
<v Speaker 5>kill a lion with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1677
01:28:58.061 --> 01:29:02.420
<v Speaker 5>it probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You probably wouldn't be quite the same </v>

1678
01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:02.420
<v Speaker 5>after you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be my guess.</v>

1679
01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:02.420
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1680
01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.000
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's.</v>

1681
01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:08.001
<v Speaker 2>Hercules has got his lion skin on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shows that he's assimilated to the </v>

1682
01:29:08.001 --> 01:29:11.541
<v Speaker 2>lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominant sort of animal and that </v>

1683
01:29:11.541 --> 01:29:11.541
<v Speaker 2>he's also mastered it and he's got his </v>
<v Speaker 2>bow and Arrow to.</v>

1684
01:29:11.541 --> 01:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to hit the target properly.</v>

1685
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:18.681
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's someone who doesn't sin because he </v>

1686
01:29:18.681 --> 01:29:20.751
<v Speaker 2>can hit the center of the target and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this club which I really liked </v>

1687
01:29:20.751 --> 01:29:22.020
<v Speaker 2>because it's covered with eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Martech.</v>

1688
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Mr Damian Hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1689
01:29:23.521 --> 01:29:25.320
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to do when you go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the unknown,</v>

1690
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:27.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like arm yourself and pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

1691
01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.210
<v Speaker 2>and so that's what you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce.</v>

1692
01:29:30.211 --> 01:29:33.990
<v Speaker 2>If you're a good mother is this figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can go out into the unknown,</v>

1693
01:29:33.991 --> 01:29:35.910
<v Speaker 2>armed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate,</v>

1694
01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:40.500
<v Speaker 2>and able to pay attention and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell of a thing to participate in.</v>

1695
01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:45.540
<v Speaker 2>It's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found having children incredibly </v>

1696
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:45.540
<v Speaker 2>entertaining.</v>

1697
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:48.150
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculously entertaining thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do because for a bunch of reasons.</v>

1698
01:29:48.151 --> 01:29:52.710
<v Speaker 2>One is that it's the only relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll ever have in your life where you,</v>

1699
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.800
<v Speaker 2>where you actually have a chance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishing something that's close to </v>

1700
01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.740
<v Speaker 2>perfect is with your kids because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're delivered to you,</v>

1701
01:29:58.741 --> 01:30:03.741
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there in some sense they're </v>

1702
01:30:03.741 --> 01:30:05.580
<v Speaker 2>perfect and your job is to maintain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection.</v>

1703
01:30:05.581 --> 01:30:07.830
<v Speaker 2>If you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do that by being a good parent,</v>

1704
01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.050
<v Speaker 2>by being encouraging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by being on their side,</v>

1705
01:30:10.051 --> 01:30:15.051
<v Speaker 2>by taking care of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can have an absolutely pristine </v>

1706
01:30:15.051 --> 01:30:19.251
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean it's not full of </v>

1707
01:30:19.251 --> 01:30:19.251
<v Speaker 2>trouble because it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

1708
01:30:19.251 --> 01:30:22.290
<v Speaker 2>It can easily be the best relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll ever have in your life,</v>

1709
01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:27.380
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it can be the worst to </v>

1710
01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.201
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you get unlucky in your child </v>

1711
01:30:30.201 --> 01:30:32.601
<v Speaker 2>is sick mentally or physically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things fall apart and it's not your </v>

1712
01:30:32.601 --> 01:30:33.810
<v Speaker 2>fault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it is your fault,</v>

1713
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's a real gift and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play this game of protection and </v>

1714
01:30:39.451 --> 01:30:40.530
<v Speaker 2>encouragement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1715
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Protection and encouragement and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dynamic right?</v>

1716
01:30:43.831 --> 01:30:48.831
<v Speaker 2>And then you build,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you help someone develop into something </v>

1717
01:30:48.831 --> 01:30:52.011
<v Speaker 2>that's well exactly this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can take on the trouble of the </v>

1718
01:30:52.011 --> 01:30:53.520
<v Speaker 2>world forthrightly and man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you want.</v>

1719
01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:56.790
<v Speaker 2>That will make it worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

1720
01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

1721
01:30:57.871 --> 01:30:59.640
<v Speaker 2>I got to figure out where I want to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>

1722
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about the dragon fight,</v>

1723
01:31:01.981 --> 01:31:03.270
<v Speaker 2>so I won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

1724
01:31:03.271 --> 01:31:04.830
<v Speaker 2>We might as well look at some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1725
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:08.750
<v Speaker 2>we'll look at the same thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal side of the equation so that</v>

1726
01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:12.990
<v Speaker 2>it's the great father and the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother that emerge out of chaos.</v>

1727
01:31:12.991 --> 01:31:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1728
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:19.670
<v Speaker 2>you can think about that over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary time span to because it's </v>

1729
01:31:19.670 --> 01:31:22.860
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental differentiation of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>into one into two sexes,</v>

1730
01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:27.900
<v Speaker 2>in the fundamental differentiation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being into two sexes that interact </v>

1731
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:30.150
<v Speaker 2>creatively to produce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce new being.</v>

1732
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:35.590
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very deep motif and so the dragon of </v>

1733
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:38.370
<v Speaker 2>chaos differentiates itself into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great farther and that's God the father.</v>

1734
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:43.430
<v Speaker 2>That's an image there and you see he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in front of the sun and the sun </v>

1735
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:46.110
<v Speaker 2>is behind him and the son is the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes up out of the darkness in the</v>

1736
01:31:46.111 --> 01:31:51.111
<v Speaker 2>morning and then shines the light on </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything with which we can see and </v>

1737
01:31:51.331 --> 01:31:53.760
<v Speaker 2>then collapses again into the darkness </v>
<v Speaker 2>at night.</v>

1738
01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and at night it fights.</v>

1739
01:31:55.711 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 2>It's battle with the forces of darkness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and chaos and emerges triumphant</v>

1740
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:02.440
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we have solar gods.</v>

1741
01:32:02.441 --> 01:32:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Because the highest day it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilated to the dominant,</v>

1742
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:12.150
<v Speaker 1>the dominant phenomena in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well no wonder because the sun is </v>

1743
01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:14.350
<v Speaker 1>also what gives life and that provides </v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

1744
01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:19.380
<v Speaker 1>And that does send the darkness away and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to notice that there's something </v>

1745
01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:24.211
<v Speaker 1>symbolically useful in now that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>also apply to the ideal person is </v>

1746
01:32:24.211 --> 01:32:28.930
<v Speaker 1>another active of conceptual metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius and so behind God.</v>

1747
01:32:28.931 --> 01:32:31.690
<v Speaker 1>The father is the son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>

1748
01:32:31.691 --> 01:32:36.691
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see he's ruling over a walled </v>

1749
01:32:36.691 --> 01:32:40.351
<v Speaker 1>city here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about God the father </v>

1750
01:32:40.351 --> 01:32:41.800
<v Speaker 1>here as the spirit of the walled city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

1751
01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.180
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why?</v>

1752
01:32:43.181 --> 01:32:44.710
<v Speaker 1>What is that spirit mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1753
01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:49.090
<v Speaker 1>forget about the supernatural element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this or the transcendent element of it.</v>

1754
01:32:49.091 --> 01:32:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Even.</v>

1755
01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:55.650
<v Speaker 1>How do you represent society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1756
01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.010
<v Speaker 1>you've got your walled city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1757
01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:03.020
<v Speaker 1>why is it wall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental structure of a </v>

1758
01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:03.110
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it walled?</v>

1759
01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to have a border </v>

1760
01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:09.651
<v Speaker 1>between what's yours and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a border between your territory and </v>

1761
01:33:09.651 --> 01:33:09.651
<v Speaker 1>outside world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1762
01:33:09.651 --> 01:33:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's not delineated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined.</v>

1763
01:33:12.090 --> 01:33:14.430
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's walled off.</v>

1764
01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:17.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a defined space inside that there's</v>

1765
01:33:17.761 --> 01:33:22.761
<v Speaker 1>a dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a masculine dominance hierarchy </v>

1766
01:33:22.761 --> 01:33:23.550
<v Speaker 1>because like chimps are fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>

1767
01:33:23.551 --> 01:33:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchy is masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1768
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:30.500
<v Speaker 1>So the dominance hierarchy is what's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same across all the men and then it's </v>

1769
01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.620
<v Speaker 1>more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1770
01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:37.540
<v Speaker 1>it's what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what's the same across all men in </v>

1771
01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:41.361
<v Speaker 1>so far as they found their position in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy in so far as </v>

1772
01:33:41.361 --> 01:33:45.201
<v Speaker 1>they're supporting it in so far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're expanding it and in so far as </v>

1773
01:33:45.201 --> 01:33:48.000
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to strive up it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's averaged across that,</v>

1774
01:33:48.001 --> 01:33:50.520
<v Speaker 1>but then it's more than that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just the man that lived.</v>

1775
01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the men that used to live and </v>

1776
01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:58.350
<v Speaker 1>the man that will live and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you relating to when you relate</v>

1777
01:33:58.351 --> 01:34:03.351
<v Speaker 1>to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while in part you're relating to the </v>

1778
01:34:03.351 --> 01:34:05.100
<v Speaker 1>spirit of the man that will soon live </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what a contract is,</v>

1779
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:10.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make a contract with the potential </v>

1780
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:12.360
<v Speaker 1>society of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's embodied as a spirit and so you act</v>

1781
01:34:12.810 --> 01:34:17.310
<v Speaker 1>appropriately in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal spirit because if you act in</v>

1782
01:34:17.311 --> 01:34:22.311
<v Speaker 1>accordance with that structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can extend your contractual </v>

1783
01:34:22.471 --> 01:34:24.720
<v Speaker 1>relationship with other people across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1784
01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:30.050
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant conceptualization and </v>

1785
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:31.590
<v Speaker 1>that's independent of any supernatural </v>
<v Speaker 1>or transcendent reality.</v>

1786
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it exists in in necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition to such things.</v>

1787
01:34:36.691 --> 01:34:41.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduce the idea of such things into </v>

1788
01:34:41.691 --> 01:34:43.980
<v Speaker 1>the conceptualization in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the symbolism.</v>

1789
01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more complicated than that </v>

1790
01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:51.540
<v Speaker 1>because if you think about this thing as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spirit,</v>

1791
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.040
<v Speaker 1>a spirit is an essential pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

1792
01:34:56.041 --> 01:35:01.041
<v Speaker 1>Let's call it that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the degree that you're a well </v>

1793
01:35:01.041 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 1>civilized representative of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1794
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:07.570
<v Speaker 1>you are actually inhabited by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit and so what should happen as you </v>

1795
01:35:07.570 --> 01:35:11.300
<v Speaker 1>mature is that as you become older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't become God the father.</v>

1796
01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:16.960
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to embody that central spirit </v>

1797
01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:21.371
<v Speaker 1>that characterizes the civilization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that spirit is very complex and that's </v>

1798
01:35:21.371 --> 01:35:24.290
<v Speaker 1>why you see often see it in relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the representation of God,</v>

1799
01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:29.291
<v Speaker 1>the son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the masculine spirit isn't the </v>

1800
01:35:29.291 --> 01:35:32.231
<v Speaker 1>spirit in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spirit of civilization isn't </v>

1801
01:35:32.231 --> 01:35:32.390
<v Speaker 1>exhausted by it's patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1802
01:35:32.391 --> 01:35:35.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the dogmatic form like Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1803
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:40.270
<v Speaker 1>It's only the structure that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>aligned with the thing that keeps the </v>

1804
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.270
<v Speaker 1>structure alive.</v>

1805
01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.010
<v Speaker 1>So you want to be both of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

1806
01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:48.610
<v Speaker 1>the embodiment of the civilization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the forest that transforms it and moves </v>

1807
01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:50.730
<v Speaker 1>it forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're supposed to be be</v>

1808
01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>being taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what university is for.</v>

1809
01:35:53.641 --> 01:35:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he used to be for now.</v>

1810
01:35:55.251 --> 01:35:58.130
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly there to produce politically</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed idiots.</v>

1811
01:35:58.730 --> 01:36:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

1812
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:03.050
<v Speaker 1>sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it gets very frustrating.</v>

1813
01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:04.570
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

1814
01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:06.200
<v Speaker 1>so that you'll get the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>

1815
01:36:06.201 --> 01:36:08.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what that represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's trying.</v>

1816
01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:13.210
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an idea that's been trying to </v>

1817
01:36:13.210 --> 01:36:15.311
<v Speaker 1>emerge in the human imagination since </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of time and it's not a </v>

1818
01:36:15.311 --> 01:36:17.420
<v Speaker 1>trivial idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably profound idea.</v>

1819
01:36:17.421 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it differentiates too.</v>

1820
01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:24.580
<v Speaker 1>And this is what makes it complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of relationship do you have </v>

1821
01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:25.820
<v Speaker 1>with your father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your real father?</v>

1822
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:27.470
<v Speaker 1>So often ambivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1823
01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Because the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of him that </v>

1824
01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:32.740
<v Speaker 1>encouraged you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>

1825
01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:33.410
<v Speaker 1>because without the encouragement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your father,</v>

1826
01:36:33.411 --> 01:36:35.480
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is a dismal place.</v>

1827
01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:40.430
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to be a courageous </v>
<v Speaker 1>person unless you have your father in,</v>

1828
01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.130
<v Speaker 1>in body and spirit behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very dear,</v>

1829
01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:48.160
<v Speaker 1>demoralizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it really kills people not to have </v>

1830
01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:48.800
<v Speaker 1>their mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't recover from that.</v>

1831
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:50.020
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1832
01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.740
<v Speaker 1>and I think people can recover from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmented father relationship,</v>

1833
01:36:54.741 --> 01:36:59.741
<v Speaker 1>but it's the next worst thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if your father rejects you or </v>

1834
01:37:00.010 --> 01:37:05.010
<v Speaker 1>doesn't form a relationship with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says if the spirit of civilization </v>

1835
01:37:05.010 --> 01:37:07.940
<v Speaker 1>has left you outside the walls as of </v>
<v Speaker 1>little worth,</v>

1836
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:10.400
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover from that.</v>

1837
01:37:10.730 --> 01:37:15.730
<v Speaker 1>So the father should be an encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest but can be a tyrannical and </v>

1838
01:37:15.730 --> 01:37:16.370
<v Speaker 1>crushing force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's very,</v>

1839
01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:18.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a very difficult thing to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1840
01:37:18.801 --> 01:37:23.801
<v Speaker 1>Partly because if you're my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I should impose the highest </v>

1841
01:37:25.251 --> 01:37:30.251
<v Speaker 1>standards of behavior on you and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should always be judging what you're </v>

1842
01:37:30.251 --> 01:37:32.060
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should be judging it with,</v>

1843
01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:35.600
<v Speaker 1>with the aim of making the best in you </v>
<v Speaker 1>come forward.</v>

1844
01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.960
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but getting that balance exactly right.</v>

1845
01:37:38.961 --> 01:37:41.360
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's easy to,</v>

1846
01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:44.360
<v Speaker 1>for a father to swing too much into </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment,</v>

1847
01:37:44.361 --> 01:37:46.580
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course mothers can play this</v>

1848
01:37:46.581 --> 01:37:51.581
<v Speaker 1>role to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to swing too far into the domain of </v>

1849
01:37:51.581 --> 01:37:53.951
<v Speaker 1>judgment and to be too harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to the degree that the father has </v>

1850
01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:55.560
<v Speaker 1>his own pathologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to do that in perfectly,</v>

1851
01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1852
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.980
<v Speaker 2>he might be someone who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the father who devours his son </v>

1853
01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 2>because he's jealous of the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility,</v>

1854
01:38:03.451 --> 01:38:06.600
<v Speaker 2>the new potential that the struggle for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1855
01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:11.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and love from the mother or </v>

1856
01:38:11.710 --> 01:38:14.091
<v Speaker 2>from the other children in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of things that can go </v>

1857
01:38:14.091 --> 01:38:16.560
<v Speaker 2>terribly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the farther as wise king.</v>

1858
01:38:16.561 --> 01:38:19.320
<v Speaker 2>And that's another symbol that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost,</v>

1859
01:38:19.321 --> 01:38:24.321
<v Speaker 2>I would say to a massive degree in </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern universities because all we're </v>

1860
01:38:24.321 --> 01:38:28.251
<v Speaker 2>taught is to tear that down and to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even notice that it manifests itself </v>

1861
01:38:28.471 --> 01:38:30.690
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the universities which are</v>

1862
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:35.990
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is close to an ideal environment </v>

1863
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:38.121
<v Speaker 2>as you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as human beings have ever been able to </v>

1864
01:38:38.121 --> 01:38:38.121
<v Speaker 2>create.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that.</v>

1865
01:38:38.121 --> 01:38:41.040
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't be grateful for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the structure of the university,</v>

1866
01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:46.041
<v Speaker 2>with all its imperfections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then you're completely blind to </v>

1867
01:38:46.041 --> 01:38:46.041
<v Speaker 2>this element of the architect.</v>

1868
01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:50.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's the opposite of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the sun that devours the king,</v>

1869
01:38:50.901 --> 01:38:53.650
<v Speaker 2>that devours his own son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a tyrant.</v>

1870
01:38:54.150 --> 01:38:59.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the mother who's too over </v>

1871
01:38:59.150 --> 01:39:01.051
<v Speaker 2>protective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the male version of that and the </v>

1872
01:39:01.051 --> 01:39:02.090
<v Speaker 2>mother that's too over protective says </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never let anything happen to you.</v>

1873
01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:07.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe you actually want to have </v>

1874
01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:07.420
<v Speaker 2>something happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1875
01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:08.660
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit of an all inclusive </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>

1876
01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:09.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1877
01:39:09.741 --> 01:39:14.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make you strong so any </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of things can happen to you and </v>

1878
01:39:14.741 --> 01:39:15.790
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you need some care,</v>

1879
01:39:15.791 --> 01:39:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I'll be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But otherwise,</v>

1880
01:39:17.121 --> 01:39:19.810
<v Speaker 2>like out into the world with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the right attitude.</v>

1881
01:39:19.811 --> 01:39:22.940
<v Speaker 2>And for the father it's like get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody act together,</v>

1882
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:28.090
<v Speaker 2>but I'm on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because not because I want to </v>

1883
01:39:28.090 --> 01:39:30.371
<v Speaker 2>destroy you or demean you or push you </v>
<v Speaker 2>down in the dominance hierarchy bit </v>

1884
01:39:30.371 --> 01:39:30.800
<v Speaker 2>because I want the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you?</v>

1885
01:39:30.801 --> 01:39:33.560
<v Speaker 2>To emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you need standards.</v>

1886
01:39:33.561 --> 01:39:35.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like what are you doing wasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life?</v>

1887
01:39:35.751 --> 01:39:40.040
<v Speaker 2>There's way more than that to you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your act together and bring it out.</v>

1888
01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:45.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's a message that people really </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to hear if they have any sense at </v>

1889
01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:45.280
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And generally they do want to hear it.</v>

1890
01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:47.720
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1891
01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I was talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking to a lot of people </v>

1892
01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:54.180
<v Speaker 2>recently as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as perhaps you know,</v>

1893
01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:58.291
<v Speaker 2>and what I was talking to one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders of the Conservatives this </v>

1894
01:39:58.291 --> 01:40:01.350
<v Speaker 2>morning and they're asking me about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person was asking me about bill see </v>

1895
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:05.091
<v Speaker 2>16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more specifically about talking to </v>

1896
01:40:05.091 --> 01:40:06.650
<v Speaker 2>young people in because the conservative</v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership</v>

1897
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.530
<v Speaker 2>struggle is going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking to a bunch of them and</v>

1898
01:40:10.531 --> 01:40:11.190
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1899
01:40:11.191 --> 01:40:14.670
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you could do for young</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that no one's doing is to talk to</v>

1900
01:40:14.671 --> 01:40:19.671
<v Speaker 2>them about responsibility because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone talks to young people about </v>

1901
01:40:19.671 --> 01:40:21.570
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like we need our rights.</v>

1902
01:40:21.571 --> 01:40:22.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1903
01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:25.020
<v Speaker 2>how many rights do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1904
01:40:25.021 --> 01:40:30.021
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have more privileges than any </v>

1905
01:40:30.021 --> 01:40:30.060
<v Speaker 2>people who've ever lived anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1906
01:40:30.061 --> 01:40:33.420
<v Speaker 2>it's so dull to hear that so dull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so pathetic.</v>

1907
01:40:33.421 --> 01:40:34.640
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1908
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:39.950
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so demeaning that you have to be </v>

1909
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:40.620
<v Speaker 2>protected and have your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I said,</v>

1910
01:40:40.621 --> 01:40:43.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge marketplace for </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

1911
01:40:43.381 --> 01:40:45.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what you want to talk to young </v>
<v Speaker 2>people about.</v>

1912
01:40:45.211 --> 01:40:48.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like get your act together and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something worthwhile with your life.</v>

1913
01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.660
<v Speaker 2>For the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my entire adult life,</v>

1914
01:40:51.661 --> 01:40:54.490
<v Speaker 2>the conservatives actually have </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to sell young people,</v>

1915
01:40:54.491 --> 01:40:54.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1916
01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:57.790
<v Speaker 2>They could sell them responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1917
01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:58.450
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1918
01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Because that's where my life has meaning</v>
<v Speaker 2>with responsibility.</v>

1919
01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:07.320
<v Speaker 2>The more responsibility you take on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more meaning your life has and the </v>

1920
01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:11.890
<v Speaker 2>the higher degree of responsibility that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you agreed voluntarily to try to bear,</v>

1921
01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:17.350
<v Speaker 2>the richer your life will be and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one's ever told that in the case.</v>

1922
01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:18.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have.</v>

1923
01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.890
<v Speaker 2>You have four kids say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1924
01:41:20.891 --> 01:41:23.830
<v Speaker 2>that's plenty of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have meaning.</v>

1925
01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:25.570
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1926
01:41:25.571 --> 01:41:30.571
<v Speaker 2>because it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a complicated job and you try </v>

1927
01:41:30.571 --> 01:41:31.600
<v Speaker 2>to help the careers of the people around</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1928
01:41:31.630 --> 01:41:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you try to solve tough problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>aid suffering and do all of that.</v>

1929
01:41:35.561 --> 01:41:38.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like its weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its responsibility,</v>

1930
01:41:38.471 --> 01:41:40.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's glory in it.</v>

1931
01:41:40.271 --> 01:41:42.930
<v Speaker 2>There's real glory and there's deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning in it and,</v>

1932
01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:48.380
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and young people are starving for that </v>

1933
01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:51.421
<v Speaker 2>because no one ever tells them that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're way more than you </v>

1934
01:41:51.421 --> 01:41:51.421
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1935
01:41:51.421 --> 01:41:52.870
<v Speaker 2>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do something difficult.</v>

1936
01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Do something difficult and heroic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1937
01:41:55.990 --> 01:42:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Burst out of your barns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's a good message.</v>

1938
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a necessary message because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be more than we are because if </v>

1939
01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.060
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we aren't,</v>

1940
01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.260
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to survive.</v>

1941
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the sun devouring father,</v>

1942
01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:17.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a painting by Medina of Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty horrifying one,</v>

1943
01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:24.680
<v Speaker 2>and that's Captain Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the figure of Captain </v>

1944
01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Hook some of these popular mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>

1945
01:42:26.731 --> 01:42:31.731
<v Speaker 2>Myths based fairytales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Modern fairy tales have got things </v>

1946
01:42:31.731 --> 01:42:31.731
<v Speaker 2>really right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Captain Hook.</v>

1947
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a pirate.</v>

1948
01:42:34.290 --> 01:42:39.290
<v Speaker 2>So I think I told you that in the Google</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineers investigations of female </v>

1949
01:42:39.871 --> 01:42:44.871
<v Speaker 2>sexual fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pirate played a large role werewolf </v>

1950
01:42:44.871 --> 01:42:48.690
<v Speaker 2>vampire pirate surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaire credibly comic comical.</v>

1951
01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Well pirate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1952
01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:53.030
<v Speaker 2>captain of the high seas and someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to break rules.</v>

1953
01:42:53.031 --> 01:42:55.140
<v Speaker 2>There's a romance in that figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1954
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:58.560
<v Speaker 2>so the idea of the great father as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pirate is a good one.</v>

1955
01:42:58.830 --> 01:43:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kirk is kind of a pathetic pirate and of</v>

1956
01:43:01.861 --> 01:43:04.410
<v Speaker 2>course pirates are precisely that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're all also crooked.</v>

1957
01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:07.650
<v Speaker 2>And so what makes empathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1958
01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:12.740
<v Speaker 2>it isn't because he's got a hook </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely because maybe that's just a </v>

1959
01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:16.191
<v Speaker 2>sign of adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because he's being chased by a </v>

1960
01:43:16.191 --> 01:43:16.191
<v Speaker 2>crocodile with a clock in its stomach.</v>

1961
01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the dragon of chaos right now.</v>

1962
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:19.800
<v Speaker 2>It's time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>

1963
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:20.700
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick.</v>

1964
01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Your life is going to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already got a piece of you and it's</v>

1965
01:43:24.391 --> 01:43:27.480
<v Speaker 2>coming for the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so hook is terrified of that.</v>

1966
01:43:27.481 --> 01:43:31.850
<v Speaker 2>He's terrified into resentment and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the evil roughly speaking,</v>

1967
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:36.950
<v Speaker 2>why he can prey on other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the father in the Peter </v>

1968
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Pan Story out in Neverland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the archetypal domain captain </v>

1969
01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Hook's the farther,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1970
01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:43.620
<v Speaker 2>why would peter pan want to grow up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be Captain Hook?</v>

1971
01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't,</v>

1972
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:47.190
<v Speaker 2>and so he stays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pan.</v>

1973
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Pan Means everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1974
01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Like pantheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he stays everything.</v>

1975
01:43:51.861 --> 01:43:54.440
<v Speaker 2>He's the divine child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never wants to grow up.</v>

1976
01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you sacrifice the potential of</v>

1977
01:43:56.841 --> 01:44:01.160
<v Speaker 2>youth to become nothing but a death </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed tyrant?</v>

1978
01:44:01.730 --> 01:44:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the story in,</v>

1979
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:06.620
<v Speaker 2>in Peter Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course Wendy's in the story.</v>

1980
01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:09.830
<v Speaker 2>And so as Tinkerbell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tinkerbell is the imagined feminine.</v>

1981
01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.320
<v Speaker 2>She's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't even exist.</v>

1982
01:44:12.321 --> 01:44:17.321
<v Speaker 2>She's just this perfect little thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always around whatever peter pan </v>

1983
01:44:17.321 --> 01:44:20.981
<v Speaker 2>needs her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with Tinkerbell is that </v>

1984
01:44:20.981 --> 01:44:22.370
<v Speaker 2>she's a fairy and fairies don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has wendy there.</v>

1985
01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.550
<v Speaker 2>She's a real girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She grows up and actually marry someone.</v>

1986
01:44:25.551 --> 01:44:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Peter Pan stays king of the lost boys </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever and you know,</v>

1987
01:44:28.881 --> 01:44:30.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's better to be king of the lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys,</v>

1988
01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:33.980
<v Speaker 2>but not to be king at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe not to.</v>

1989
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:38.780
<v Speaker 2>King of the dam is not exactly something</v>
<v Speaker 2>to snort a dominance hierarchy to strive</v>

1990
01:44:38.781 --> 01:44:42.980
<v Speaker 2>for dominating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the Peter Pan Story and it's a</v>

1991
01:44:42.981 --> 01:44:45.080
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the right story for the modern age,</v>

1992
01:44:45.081 --> 01:44:50.081
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a negative element of the </v>

1993
01:44:50.081 --> 01:44:50.150
<v Speaker 2>great father.</v>

1994
01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Here's the positive element of the great</v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

1995
01:44:54.331 --> 01:44:59.331
<v Speaker 2>These are both read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a representation of Moses </v>

1996
01:44:59.331 --> 01:45:00.750
<v Speaker 2>receiving the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules for living from God on high.</v>

1997
01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:05.780
<v Speaker 2>What we talked about that already know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I see that that's a story of the </v>

1998
01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:08.670
<v Speaker 2>revelation of structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the story of mankind.</v>

1999
01:45:08.850 --> 01:45:11.340
<v Speaker 2>We're acting out a moral structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2000
01:45:11.341 --> 01:45:16.341
<v Speaker 2>what is it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we get a glimpse of what the </v>

2001
01:45:16.341 --> 01:45:18.981
<v Speaker 2>moral structure isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hits people with the force of a </v>

2002
01:45:18.981 --> 01:45:18.981
<v Speaker 2>revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it can be articulated,</v>

2003
01:45:18.981 --> 01:45:20.760
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly what the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moses lays out.</v>

2004
01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Then you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this picture,</v>

2005
01:45:23.701 --> 01:45:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I really liked this one too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a supplicant.</v>

2006
01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Basically someone who's who's hit hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>by a divine vision.</v>

2007
01:45:30.031 --> 01:45:31.740
<v Speaker 2>It's God in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2008
01:45:31.741 --> 01:45:36.741
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar to this with with a cross </v>

2009
01:45:36.741 --> 01:45:39.501
<v Speaker 2>in the background and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that to transcend your littleness </v>

2010
01:45:39.690 --> 01:45:40.830
<v Speaker 2>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's looking up.</v>

2011
01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:43.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what's at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hurricane.</v>

2012
01:45:43.290 --> 01:45:48.290
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the top of all possible dominance </v>

2013
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:51.021
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies look up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the father who supports the </v>

2014
01:45:51.021 --> 01:45:52.970
<v Speaker 2>sudden that's transcending his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability,</v>

2015
01:45:52.971 --> 01:45:57.971
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Willing to bear it voluntarily and not </v>

2016
01:45:57.971 --> 01:45:57.971
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not to shirk from that.</v>

2017
01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.080
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly right and it is what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>admire in people you know,</v>

2018
01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:05.220
<v Speaker 2>you admire people who are courageous and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were strong,</v>

2019
01:46:05.221 --> 01:46:10.221
<v Speaker 2>and when you decompose that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that they're able to act </v>

2020
01:46:10.221 --> 01:46:13.140
<v Speaker 2>appropriately and in a helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassionate,</v>

2021
01:46:13.141 --> 01:46:18.141
<v Speaker 2>wise and tough manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that there be set with </v>

2022
01:46:18.141 --> 01:46:20.190
<v Speaker 2>all of the problems of mortality that </v>
<v Speaker 2>beset everyone else.</v>

2023
01:46:22.570 --> 01:46:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does it go wrong?</v>

2024
01:46:24.370 --> 01:46:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all propaganda for Hitler.</v>

2025
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Look at the imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2026
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:30.620
<v Speaker 2>he's a night that's on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the.</v>

2027
01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.710
<v Speaker 2>He's the night of nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2028
01:46:32.711 --> 01:46:34.330
<v Speaker 2>that's God the father to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2029
01:46:34.630 --> 01:46:36.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit one sided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2030
01:46:36.581 --> 01:46:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Because there's more to the farther than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>

2031
01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.320
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing and that's the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with nationalism and it's totalitarian </v>

2032
01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.770
<v Speaker 2>variance and we're moving in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction fast,</v>

2033
01:46:47.771 --> 01:46:52.771
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see Europe right now fragmenting </v>

2034
01:46:52.771 --> 01:46:54.801
<v Speaker 2>again because the European Union is too </v>
<v Speaker 2>amorphous and maybe not well enough </v>

2035
01:46:55.261 --> 01:46:59.160
<v Speaker 2>bordered and everyone is getting nervous</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're saying back to the state,</v>

2036
01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:00.960
<v Speaker 2>back to the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fair enough.</v>

2037
01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to be around people who are </v>

2038
01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:06.140
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

2039
01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:10.440
<v Speaker 2>what you have built a consensus with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to subordinate yourself to the state</v>

2040
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:13.410
<v Speaker 2>and to make its head that the bearer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2041
01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:14.190
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2042
01:47:14.210 --> 01:47:18.960
<v Speaker 2>the archetype of the night without </v>
<v Speaker 2>having that element of individuality and</v>

2043
01:47:18.961 --> 01:47:20.460
<v Speaker 2>it is absolutely pathological.</v>

2044
01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:22.350
<v Speaker 2>We've already been down that road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2045
01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Because the national socialists were </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper national,</v>

2046
01:47:24.751 --> 01:47:27.810
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it both in Germany and in Italy and</v>

2047
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:29.100
<v Speaker 2>it's attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2048
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:32.850
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see hit the rest of the night and up</v>

2049
01:47:32.851 --> 01:47:37.851
<v Speaker 2>here there's a bird and that bird should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the dove because that should be the </v>

2050
01:47:37.851 --> 01:47:38.070
<v Speaker 2>holy ghost if the iconography was </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper,</v>

2051
01:47:38.071 --> 01:47:40.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an eagle and an eagle is a burden.</v>

2052
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Carry a neater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2053
01:47:43.650 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 2>It feeds on corpses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2054
01:47:46.021 --> 01:47:51.021
<v Speaker 2>it's worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the woman worshiping the </v>

2055
01:47:51.021 --> 01:47:54.931
<v Speaker 2>strong father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another representation of Hitler as a </v>

2056
01:47:54.931 --> 01:47:57.411
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's Hitler as wise father </v>

2057
01:47:57.411 --> 01:47:59.421
<v Speaker 2>you see is surrounded by people there </v>
<v Speaker 2>who focused in on him as if he's an </v>

2058
01:47:59.421 --> 01:48:01.340
<v Speaker 2>architect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Archetype will import and then this is a</v>

2059
01:48:02.190 --> 01:48:07.190
<v Speaker 2>poster from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Lis and anti Nazi poster from </v>

2060
01:48:07.190 --> 01:48:10.971
<v Speaker 2>the Allies and you see right there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler and the Nazis are assimilated to </v>

2061
01:48:10.971 --> 01:48:11.520
<v Speaker 2>a mess of predatory snakes.</v>

2062
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:12.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2063
01:48:12.001 --> 01:48:12.630
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2064
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:17.340
<v Speaker 2>if you want to appeal to someone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>determination to destroy you say,</v>

2065
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:19.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you are and you're all ready to go.</v>

2066
01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Let's go kill some snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone can say yes and then you </v>

2067
01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:24.920
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2068
01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:25.980
<v Speaker 2>there's the snakes right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

2069
01:48:25.981 --> 01:48:29.070
<v Speaker 2>it's true to some degree because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have plenty of snakes.</v>

2070
01:48:29.071 --> 01:48:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Just like everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's easy.</v>

2071
01:48:31.351 --> 01:48:34.860
<v Speaker 2>That's the first step towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonization and you can do it just like</v>

2072
01:48:34.861 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no problem.</v>

2073
01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:41.480
<v Speaker 2>The archetype will map perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if there's already tension </v>

2074
01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:44.961
<v Speaker 2>between the groups or if the other group</v>
<v Speaker 2>is identifiable in some manner or you </v>

2075
01:48:44.961 --> 01:48:47.790
<v Speaker 2>can make it identifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Discussed is the best way to do that,</v>

2076
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:49.770
<v Speaker 2>not fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgust,</v>

2077
01:48:50.010 --> 01:48:53.340
<v Speaker 2>fear to fear someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to respect them.</v>

2078
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.410
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to burn everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person that you fear owns.</v>

2079
01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:02.520
<v Speaker 2>You want to burn everything that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who disgusts you owns,</v>

2080
01:49:02.670 --> 01:49:07.670
<v Speaker 2>and so you'll see people who are pushing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nationalist agenda hard and Hitler </v>

2081
01:49:07.670 --> 01:49:08.400
<v Speaker 2>did this beautifully.</v>

2082
01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Everything that was outside of the area </v>
<v Speaker 2>in domain of purity wasn't to be feared.</v>

2083
01:49:13.561 --> 01:49:18.561
<v Speaker 2>It was disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was contemptuous and it should be </v>

2084
01:49:18.561 --> 01:49:22.131
<v Speaker 2>destroyed and purified by fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was his message and Nazis were </v>

2085
01:49:22.131 --> 01:49:26.340
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably great at using fire of </v>
<v Speaker 2>purification as a symbolic message.</v>

2086
01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2087
01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.920
<v Speaker 2>it has an archetype will power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you see here,</v>

2088
01:49:32.010 --> 01:49:36.090
<v Speaker 2>this is an English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a poster from the World War II.</v>

2089
01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking people to buy bonds to fund </v>
<v Speaker 2>the American or the British war effort,</v>

2090
01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:45.270
<v Speaker 2>and you see these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these talon like plause,</v>

2091
01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Japan and Nazi reaching out to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>virgin mother and her infant child,</v>

2092
01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:52.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deep,</v>

2093
01:49:52.810 --> 01:49:57.130
<v Speaker 2>deep use of deep subordination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of archetypal imagery for the purposes.</v>

2094
01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:02.340
<v Speaker 2>While I hesitate to say propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 2>because world war in some sense was </v>

2095
01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:06.901
<v Speaker 2>pretty clear cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you get the point and there's the </v>

2096
01:50:06.901 --> 01:50:08.440
<v Speaker 2>uniform reoccur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That uniformity of the state,</v>

2097
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:09.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the goose step,</v>

2098
01:50:09.911 --> 01:50:11.680
<v Speaker 2>everybody moves exactly the same way.</v>

2099
01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's turned into exactly the same</v>

2100
01:50:14.801 --> 01:50:19.801
<v Speaker 2>carbon copy of everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the diversity is pushed out of the </v>

2101
01:50:19.801 --> 01:50:23.581
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's subordinated to the supreme leader </v>

2102
01:50:23.581 --> 01:50:23.581
<v Speaker 2>in the hierarchy becomes incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigid and,</v>

2103
01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:24.720
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2104
01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:25.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2105
01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.370
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and homogenous.</v>

2106
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:28.000
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2107
01:50:28.001 --> 01:50:33.001
<v Speaker 2>that's great for fast action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's terrible if you don't know </v>

2108
01:50:33.001 --> 01:50:33.001
<v Speaker 2>where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need some diversity,</v>

2109
01:50:33.001 --> 01:50:37.831
<v Speaker 2>needs some flaws in the cliffs </v>
<v Speaker 2>crystalline structure in case you're on </v>

2110
01:50:37.831 --> 01:50:41.551
<v Speaker 2>the wrong path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you can't have everyone </v>

2111
01:50:41.551 --> 01:50:45.031
<v Speaker 2>being the supreme leader's acolytes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole bloody thing wanders off in </v>

2112
01:50:45.031 --> 01:50:49.081
<v Speaker 2>one direction and because we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right direction to go wandering off </v>

2113
01:50:49.081 --> 01:50:51.550
<v Speaker 2>in a single direction is extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

2114
01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:56.610
<v Speaker 2>You will eventually fall over a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's the Nazis use of of light at </v>

2115
01:50:59.171 --> 01:51:04.171
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were unbelievably good at there at </v>

2116
01:51:04.171 --> 01:51:06.781
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that made </v>

2117
01:51:06.781 --> 01:51:06.781
<v Speaker 2>fascism so difficult to fight because </v>
<v Speaker 2>with communism,</v>

2118
01:51:06.781 --> 01:51:08.470
<v Speaker 2>because it was a fully articulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>

2119
01:51:08.471 --> 01:51:12.160
<v Speaker 2>you could attack it rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fascism never really did that.</v>

2120
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:14.830
<v Speaker 2>What they did instead was used ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2121
01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Huge mass rallies and highly emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 2>supercharged meetings and then the use </v>

2122
01:51:20.801 --> 01:51:25.801
<v Speaker 2>of light and fire and so Hitler built </v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest parade grounds in human </v>

2123
01:51:26.081 --> 01:51:31.081
<v Speaker 2>history to host the Nuremberg rallies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would get in front of them on </v>

2124
01:51:31.081 --> 01:51:32.750
<v Speaker 2>this huge stage with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2125
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:37.790
<v Speaker 2>with Greek columns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very impressive looking and have blocks </v>

2126
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:39.130
<v Speaker 2>of thousands of people organized </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly orderly.</v>

2127
01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:42.340
<v Speaker 2>The Germans are good at order in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>is associated with disgust,</v>

2128
01:51:42.341 --> 01:51:44.560
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly organized,</v>

2129
01:51:44.561 --> 01:51:49.561
<v Speaker 2>orderly displays complete and then at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night with fire and behind him he would </v>

2130
01:51:49.561 --> 01:51:53.560
<v Speaker 2>have all of the search lights from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Luther author lined up,</v>

2131
01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:57.100
<v Speaker 2>dozens of them shooting their light </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight up miles into the sky,</v>

2132
01:51:57.101 --> 01:52:01.900
<v Speaker 2>so we stand in front of these incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>impressive displays of light long before</v>

2133
01:52:01.901 --> 01:52:04.270
<v Speaker 2>there were rock shows and so forth doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2134
01:52:04.271 --> 01:52:09.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was unparalleled in history and and </v>

2135
01:52:09.271 --> 01:52:10.240
<v Speaker 2>addressed the crowd and it was very good</v>
<v Speaker 2>at addressing the crowd.</v>

2136
01:52:10.450 --> 01:52:15.450
<v Speaker 2>He'd say something and if people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening he'd say more of it and if </v>

2137
01:52:15.450 --> 01:52:18.040
<v Speaker 2>they were listening you'd say more of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because he was addressing the mob,</v>

2138
01:52:18.610 --> 01:52:23.610
<v Speaker 2>the mob God exactly from Hitler what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted and we saw what that was </v>

2139
01:52:23.610 --> 01:52:27.001
<v Speaker 2>like $120 million people dead in no time</v>
<v Speaker 2>flat and the worst horrors that were </v>

2140
01:52:27.001 --> 01:52:31.501
<v Speaker 2>ever perpetrated on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because there's no shortage of </v>

2141
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:36.250
<v Speaker 2>perpetrated horrors stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>

2142
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Stalin the great father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2143
01:52:38.081 --> 01:52:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Wise man at the helm of the ship of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

2144
01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:46.360
<v Speaker 2>This is after the wall came down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some old man kissing a a gilded statue,</v>

2145
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.630
<v Speaker 5>stellan before it's going to be before </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be torn down.</v>

2146
01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:54.640
<v Speaker 5>There he is with happy children and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>the children that has policies starve to</v>

2147
01:52:55.491 --> 01:52:57.290
<v Speaker 5>death as you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you might well imagine.</v>

2148
01:52:57.630 --> 01:53:00.410
<v Speaker 5>Areas in his military uniform sitting on</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's all,</v>

2149
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:02.420
<v Speaker 5>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a throne.</v>

2150
01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:04.820
<v Speaker 5>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is really an uncanny one.</v>

2151
01:53:04.821 --> 01:53:06.590
<v Speaker 5>It's very positive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2152
01:53:06.710 --> 01:53:09.110
<v Speaker 5>That's Hitler is or still in his head of</v>
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>

2153
01:53:09.111 --> 01:53:14.111
<v Speaker 5>He's in this hellish Mandela of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect with God the father at his head.</v>

2154
01:53:14.121 --> 01:53:15.950
<v Speaker 5>That's Lennon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2155
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:16.910
<v Speaker 5>who people still,</v>

2156
01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:21.290
<v Speaker 1>who people still revere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may know and perhaps you don't,</v>

2157
01:53:21.291 --> 01:53:24.500
<v Speaker 1>that I was nominated to be rector of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Glasgow.</v>

2158
01:53:24.501 --> 01:53:26.780
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an honorary position.</v>

2159
01:53:26.781 --> 01:53:31.781
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today yesterday the different candidates</v>

2160
01:53:32.511 --> 01:53:35.660
<v Speaker 1>put up their manifestos and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the student newspaper paper put them</v>

2161
01:53:35.661 --> 01:53:40.661
<v Speaker 1>up and then wrote an analysis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestos which were biased and there </v>

2162
01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:46.481
<v Speaker 1>were appallingly biased in one sided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote and told them that they </v>

2163
01:53:46.481 --> 01:53:46.481
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2164
01:53:46.481 --> 01:53:48.290
<v Speaker 1>we have a perfect right to our political</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

2165
01:53:48.291 --> 01:53:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2166
01:53:49.041 --> 01:53:50.290
<v Speaker 1>well for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2167
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:55.510
<v Speaker 1>you are journalists after all and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be just trying to tell what's </v>

2168
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.970
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2169
01:53:55.971 --> 01:53:56.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2170
01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:57.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's none of that.</v>

2171
01:53:58.070 --> 01:54:00.260
<v Speaker 1>And they said that one of the candidates</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

2172
01:54:00.261 --> 01:54:05.261
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they clearly recommended who seems </v>

2173
01:54:05.261 --> 01:54:07.070
<v Speaker 1>to be a person who's perfectly heroic in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own right.</v>

2174
01:54:07.071 --> 01:54:12.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taken on very many difficult legal </v>

2175
01:54:12.071 --> 01:54:14.051
<v Speaker 1>cases and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and work for the oppressed and </v>

2176
01:54:14.051 --> 01:54:14.190
<v Speaker 1>downtrodden who clearly exist.</v>

2177
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was either him or another candidate </v>

2178
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:22.211
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as bolshy and an outspoken </v>

2179
01:54:22.211 --> 01:54:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Bolshie meaning Bolshevik,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2180
01:54:23.631 --> 01:54:24.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2181
01:54:24.201 --> 01:54:25.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's appropriately bullshit.</v>

2182
01:54:25.721 --> 01:54:27.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than saying,</v>

2183
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:29.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's appropriately not see.</v>

2184
01:54:29.421 --> 01:54:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the hell is that?</v>

2185
01:54:31.610 --> 01:54:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were 50 million people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were killed in the Soviet Union by the </v>

2186
01:54:36.610 --> 01:54:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Bolsheviks and maybe twice that many in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in China.</v>

2187
01:54:39.111 --> 01:54:44.111
<v Speaker 1>And that does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says nothing about Cambodia and all </v>

2188
01:54:44.111 --> 01:54:44.510
<v Speaker 1>the other places there were radical left</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood bass.</v>

2189
01:54:44.511 --> 01:54:47.730
<v Speaker 1>You think it's cute to call someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolshie Jesus.</v>

2190
01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2191
01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:50.250
<v Speaker 5>It's appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's appalling.</v>

2192
01:54:50.430 --> 01:54:52.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not some fashionable thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2193
01:54:53.070 --> 01:54:58.070
<v Speaker 1>It's participation in some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deepest intellectual morasses of evil </v>

2194
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:59.910
<v Speaker 1>that human beings have ever managed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>

2195
01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:02.610
<v Speaker 1>and yet it's fashionable and shows you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2196
01:55:02.611 --> 01:55:02.650
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

2197
01:55:02.650 --> 01:55:05.380
<v Speaker 5>the universities are worth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2198
01:55:05.381 --> 01:55:07.600
<v Speaker 5>there's the downside of Stella.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:13.380
<v Speaker 5>Stella and his hangman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sort of cartoon would have gotten </v>

2200
01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:16.151
<v Speaker 5>you killed in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stalin as st himself in a stain glass </v>

2201
01:55:16.151 --> 01:55:20.671
<v Speaker 5>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a statue of Stella and covered </v>

2202
01:55:20.671 --> 01:55:24.120
<v Speaker 5>with red paint for the blood after the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wall came down there Astella as what?</v>

2203
01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:26.530
<v Speaker 5>It's very much like Medina's Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2204
01:55:26.531 --> 01:55:29.020
<v Speaker 5>You look at that and it's exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same.</v>

2205
01:55:29.021 --> 01:55:31.180
<v Speaker 5>Marketable idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the Americans going.</v>

2206
01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:33.740
<v Speaker 5>It had a cap in hand to get a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>large.</v>

2207
01:55:33.741 --> 01:55:35.050
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>From Papa stalad.</v>

2208
01:55:35.290 --> 01:55:40.120
<v Speaker 5>That's a painting of the Communists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forcibly collectivizing,</v>

2209
01:55:40.121 --> 01:55:43.000
<v Speaker 5>the productive farmers in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 5>Union,</v>

2210
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:45.150
<v Speaker 5>the early 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The kulaks right.</v>

2211
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:50.750
<v Speaker 5>Everything from whom they stalled and </v>
<v Speaker 5>rape them and murdered them and ship </v>

2212
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:54.531
<v Speaker 5>them off to Siberia and killed them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>wiped out the productive farmers of the </v>

2213
01:55:54.531 --> 01:55:57.270
<v Speaker 5>Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then starved 6 million Ukrainians to</v>

2214
01:55:57.271 --> 01:56:01.230
<v Speaker 5>death and there is some poor kid in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>19 thirties who's ribs are showing,</v>

2215
01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:04.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking a bath in this part with his eyes</v>

2216
01:56:04.171 --> 01:56:04.590
<v Speaker 5>wide.</v>

2217
01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:09.590
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's one of the fortunate ones because </v>

2218
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:09.590
<v Speaker 5>he's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like bull sheet.</v>

2219
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:10.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cute.</v>

2220
01:56:10.770 --> 01:56:13.950
<v Speaker 5>Pretty Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fashionable,</v>

2221
01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:19.250
<v Speaker 5>lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the decomposition of chaos </v>

2222
01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:19.590
<v Speaker 5>into God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The father,</v>

2223
01:56:19.591 --> 01:56:23.280
<v Speaker 5>half providing security in order and </v>
<v Speaker 5>half providing tyranny.</v>

2224
01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:25.350
<v Speaker 5>That's the archetype you have to put up </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>

2225
01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:30.380
<v Speaker 5>That's what your society is like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You try to interact with it in a way </v>

2226
01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:31.740
<v Speaker 5>that enables the positive part of it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>come forth.</v>

2227
01:56:31.741 --> 01:56:36.741
<v Speaker 5>And then it does the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chaos gives rise to the father who's </v>

2228
01:56:37.330 --> 01:56:38.410
<v Speaker 5>nurturing and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2229
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:40.350
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and encouraging.</v>

2230
01:56:40.770 --> 01:56:45.770
<v Speaker 5>And that gives rise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That produces the son was very hard to </v>

2231
01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:48.210
<v Speaker 5>find that image I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2232
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:53.300
<v Speaker 5>And then that gives rise to the proper </v>
<v Speaker 5>balance of the proper attitude from the </v>

2233
01:56:53.551 --> 01:56:55.530
<v Speaker 5>father produces the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>sutton,</v>

2234
01:56:55.531 --> 01:56:57.480
<v Speaker 5>who's the hero of the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's the hero?</v>

2235
01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:02.720
<v Speaker 5>The consciousness that conflict </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness of the child that's </v>

2236
01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:06.351
<v Speaker 5>willing to go forth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes opened and voluntarily confront </v>

2237
01:57:06.351 --> 01:57:10.290
<v Speaker 5>chaos and turn it into order and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>the proper pathway for human beings.</v>

2238
01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:16.040
<v Speaker 5>So here's a way of thinking about it or </v>
<v Speaker 5>showed you that diagram you know of how </v>

2239
01:57:17.311 --> 01:57:21.420
<v Speaker 5>you decompose the value structure and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do it right down to the level of</v>

2240
01:57:21.421 --> 01:57:22.170
<v Speaker 5>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2241
01:57:22.171 --> 01:57:27.120
<v Speaker 5>so you want to make dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go below that higher resolution,</v>

2242
01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:30.060
<v Speaker 5>you cut up vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you move your arm,</v>

2243
01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:35.140
<v Speaker 5>you it decomposes all the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>differentiates down all the way to </v>

2244
01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:36.330
<v Speaker 5>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You put these skills together,</v>

2245
01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:41.090
<v Speaker 1>represent them with abstract concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make dinner,</v>

2246
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I can take care of my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can undertake this job at work.</v>

2247
01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:49.080
<v Speaker 1>That makes me a decent father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of being a good pr.</v>

2248
01:57:49.190 --> 01:57:54.190
<v Speaker 1>That's part of being a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is what's at the pinnacle </v>

2249
01:57:54.190 --> 01:57:58.391
<v Speaker 1>of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the upper end of the abstraction </v>

2250
01:57:58.391 --> 01:57:58.391
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because these things should be organized</v>

2251
01:57:58.391 --> 01:57:59.930
<v Speaker 1>all the way up into a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

2252
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:03.680
<v Speaker 1>What is it mean to be a good person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2253
01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:08.980
<v Speaker 1>it means we've walked through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you win the set of games,</v>

2254
01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:14.210
<v Speaker 1>you go out into the world and exploring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring back what you've found and you</v>

2255
01:58:14.211 --> 01:58:16.730
<v Speaker 1>build yourself out of it and you share </v>
<v Speaker 1>it with other people.</v>

2256
01:58:17.450 --> 01:58:22.450
<v Speaker 1>That's an old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old story that's no different than the </v>

2257
01:58:22.450 --> 01:58:22.820
<v Speaker 1>story of the collective hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same thing,</v>

2258
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:24.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2259
01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you build yourself into someone that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a low,</v>

2260
01:58:26.590 --> 01:58:29.540
<v Speaker 1>have a longterm relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone of the opposite sex,</v>

2261
01:58:29.690 --> 01:58:34.690
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can bring children into the </v>

2262
01:58:34.690 --> 01:58:35.960
<v Speaker 1>world and turn them into exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes in stabilize the state.</v>

2263
01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:38.960
<v Speaker 1>That's what should be at the top and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing that's at the top,</v>

2264
01:58:38.961 --> 01:58:42.220
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's integration of all</v>

2265
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:45.580
<v Speaker 2>of those things into the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the same as the sun.</v>

2266
01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:50.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the same as the halo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same as the thing that emerges </v>

2267
01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:53.671
<v Speaker 2>from the belly of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all of those things and you also </v>

2268
01:58:53.671 --> 01:58:57.040
<v Speaker 2>know that because you know that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capacity for admiration,</v>

2269
01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 2>it's in you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in you.</v>

2270
01:58:58.601 --> 01:59:02.440
<v Speaker 2>It's locked into your biology and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>locked into your sociology.</v>

2271
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:07.800
<v Speaker 2>You see what you admire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to partial representation of the </v>

2272
01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:08.380
<v Speaker 2>ultimate ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that.</v>

2273
01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:10.630
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of nested this.</v>

2274
01:59:10.631 --> 01:59:15.631
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I should just explain this diagram </v>

2275
01:59:15.631 --> 01:59:18.061
<v Speaker 2>briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a map I tried to make in some </v>

2276
01:59:18.061 --> 01:59:21.691
<v Speaker 2>sense of my own identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just using myself as an example </v>

2277
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:24.820
<v Speaker 2>of someone typically situated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

2278
01:59:24.821 --> 01:59:29.620
<v Speaker 2>So now I have this role which is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a high resolution role.</v>

2279
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:34.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm a father and a husband and I also </v>
<v Speaker 2>run a business and so the father and </v>

2280
01:59:34.770 --> 01:59:38.671
<v Speaker 2>husband thing is sort of nested inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that because it's dependent on my </v>

2281
01:59:38.671 --> 01:59:39.250
<v Speaker 2>economic success to some degree.</v>

2282
01:59:39.730 --> 01:59:44.730
<v Speaker 2>And then that's nested inside a </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalist structure and then that's </v>

2283
01:59:44.730 --> 01:59:46.060
<v Speaker 2>nested inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I said American personality,</v>

2284
01:59:46.061 --> 01:59:51.061
<v Speaker 2>but it's sort of that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's nested inside the </v>

2285
01:59:51.061 --> 01:59:54.931
<v Speaker 2>humanistic western personality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the Judeo Christian personality </v>

2286
01:59:54.931 --> 01:59:58.801
<v Speaker 2>and that's all nested inside this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's best conceptualized as something </v>

2287
01:59:58.801 --> 02:00:01.430
<v Speaker 2>approximating the exploratory hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a,</v>

2288
02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:04.240
<v Speaker 2>that's a value structure that's and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you can different.</v>

2289
02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:08.290
<v Speaker 2>You could differentiate that to a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher level than father and husband.</v>

2290
02:00:08.291 --> 02:00:10.840
<v Speaker 2>And we did that when we decompose things</v>
<v Speaker 2>right down to,</v>

2291
02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:16.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their motor actions and you want what </v>

2292
02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:18.481
<v Speaker 2>you want this and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something that's </v>

2293
02:00:18.481 --> 02:00:23.040
<v Speaker 2>transcendent about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want all those things stacked up so </v>

2294
02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:24.790
<v Speaker 2>they're all operating properly at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>

2295
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:30.120
<v Speaker 2>all the way up and all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't even know how far down </v>

2296
02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:30.120
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

2297
02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Like if you get all those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

2298
02:00:31.810 --> 02:00:35.440
<v Speaker 2>your physiology be organized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented properly to oh well,</v>

2299
02:00:35.441 --> 02:00:37.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means your organs work properly</v>

2300
02:00:37.511 --> 02:00:40.510
<v Speaker 2>in the micro elements of the board </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly and all the way down.</v>

2301
02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And then if everything is organized like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to the society starts to work,</v>

2302
02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:49.620
<v Speaker 2>everything starts to organize itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>along the horizontal axis where each </v>

2303
02:00:49.901 --> 02:00:53.110
<v Speaker 2>level of the structure supports every </v>
<v Speaker 2>other lecture level.</v>

2304
02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And you can feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's what you feel when </v>

2305
02:00:58.260 --> 02:00:58.330
<v Speaker 2>you're engaged in doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>

2306
02:00:58.331 --> 02:01:03.331
<v Speaker 2>You can feel those things coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and you can also feel that as </v>

2307
02:01:03.331 --> 02:01:03.490
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a kind of strength.</v>

2308
02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:06.190
<v Speaker 2>It pushes you forward instead of pulling</v>
<v Speaker 2>you backwards.</v>

2309
02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:07.510
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

2310
02:01:07.511 --> 02:01:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you're,</v>

2311
02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:13.480
<v Speaker 2>our nervous systems are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated and they orient us in time</v>

2312
02:01:13.481 --> 02:01:18.481
<v Speaker 2>and space and they can tell us when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in the right place at the right </v>

2313
02:01:18.481 --> 02:01:18.550
<v Speaker 2>time and people love that.</v>

2314
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:21.610
<v Speaker 2>And I think you experienced that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're deeply engaged in music as well.</v>

2315
02:01:21.611 --> 02:01:23.140
<v Speaker 2>It puts you there momentarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2316
02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Say you're in a cathedral and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to some remarkable music.</v>

2317
02:01:26.710 --> 02:01:31.710
<v Speaker 2>If the light pouring in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in trees because that's what it </v>

2318
02:01:31.710 --> 02:01:31.710
<v Speaker 2>cathedral is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what this,</v>

2319
02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:35.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what the arches is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its light coming through the trees.</v>

2320
02:01:35.231 --> 02:01:38.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what's represented in the stones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in there,</v>

2321
02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:41.390
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pouring down at you,</v>

2322
02:01:41.391 --> 02:01:46.391
<v Speaker 2>you're in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at the center of the world and </v>

2323
02:01:46.391 --> 02:01:48.221
<v Speaker 2>there's a great piece of music playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an indication that everything </v>

2324
02:01:48.221 --> 02:01:52.301
<v Speaker 2>is stacking up along this one poll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's supposed to produce </v>

2325
02:01:52.301 --> 02:01:56.740
<v Speaker 2>that produces a religious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it works properly and you know that </v>

2326
02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:58.220
<v Speaker 2>you go to rock concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go listen to music.</v>

2327
02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:59.960
<v Speaker 2>So what the hell do you think you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing there?</v>

2328
02:02:00.150 --> 02:02:02.420
<v Speaker 2>You're not having a quasi religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

2329
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:07.570
<v Speaker 2>You think you'd go otherwise and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know that that's what </v>

2330
02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:07.570
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's happening,</v>

2331
02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:12.521
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean it isn't what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have been gathering together in </v>

2332
02:02:12.521 --> 02:02:15.860
<v Speaker 2>groups and transcending the limits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their pathological individuality through</v>

2333
02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:18.170
<v Speaker 2>music and ritual since the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2334
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Why would it be any different for us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lights there?</v>

2335
02:02:21.261 --> 02:02:24.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what the light show is for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>

2336
02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:28.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just that the religious element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is stripped away partly because we've</v>

2337
02:02:28.281 --> 02:02:33.281
<v Speaker 2>criticized that to death so carelessly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can't integrate it anymore into </v>

2338
02:02:33.281 --> 02:02:34.400
<v Speaker 2>ceremonies like that and I mean fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

2339
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.000
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not like that comes without a </v>

2340
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.401
<v Speaker 2>loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People hunger for that more deeply than </v>

2341
02:02:42.401 --> 02:02:42.401
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

2342
02:02:45.850 --> 02:02:47.350
<v Speaker 5>Questions?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2343
02:02:58.570 --> 02:03:03.570
<v Speaker 4>Sacrifice human sacrifice and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological gratification and this </v>

2344
02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:11.330
<v Speaker 4>correlation between.</v>

2345
02:03:13.110 --> 02:03:14.260
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>

2346
02:03:14.261 --> 02:03:18.850
<v Speaker 5>is there a relationship between the idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>of sacrificed and delay of gratification</v>

2347
02:03:18.851 --> 02:03:20.800
<v Speaker 5>and is that related to </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness?</v>

2348
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:22.750
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2349
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:25.240
<v Speaker 5>the conscientiousness relationship is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tough one.</v>

2350
02:03:25.241 --> 02:03:27.760
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we tested to see if conscientious people</v>

2351
02:03:27.761 --> 02:03:32.761
<v Speaker 5>were more likely to delay gratification </v>
<v Speaker 5>in classic delay of gratification tasks </v>

2352
02:03:32.771 --> 02:03:37.771
<v Speaker 5>and we found no effect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We found Iq effect and we found a </v>

2353
02:03:37.771 --> 02:03:39.640
<v Speaker 5>reverse effect for extroversion and </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive mood,</v>

2354
02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:44.080
<v Speaker 5>and so what happens is that happier </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are more impulsive,</v>

2355
02:03:44.081 --> 02:03:46.810
<v Speaker 5>they're more likely to grasp what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>right in front of them in the present,</v>

2356
02:03:46.811 --> 02:03:50.800
<v Speaker 5>but conscientiousness is an </v>
<v Speaker 5>extraordinarily tough nut to crack and I</v>

2357
02:03:50.801 --> 02:03:55.210
<v Speaker 5>do think it's associated to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the proclivity for sacrifice of the</v>

2358
02:03:55.211 --> 02:04:00.211
<v Speaker 5>present to the future,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but finding ways of testing that has </v>

2359
02:04:00.211 --> 02:04:00.211
<v Speaker 5>proved very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very difficult.</v>

2360
02:04:00.211 --> 02:04:02.050
<v Speaker 5>So but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2361
02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:05.020
<v Speaker 5>the relationship between sacrifice and </v>
<v Speaker 5>delay of gratification,</v>

2362
02:04:05.230 --> 02:04:07.360
<v Speaker 5>those are the same words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2363
02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:12.070
<v Speaker 5>Delayed gratification is a sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's and you know,</v>

2364
02:04:12.071 --> 02:04:13.720
<v Speaker 5>there's famous experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2365
02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:18.780
<v Speaker 5>you may know the marshmallow experiment </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that is basically you take kids four</v>

2366
02:04:20.121 --> 02:04:24.490
<v Speaker 5>or so and you say you sit them in a room</v>
<v Speaker 5>and at a little table and you say,</v>

2367
02:04:24.491 --> 02:04:27.100
<v Speaker 5>here's a marshmallow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't eat that for 10 minutes,</v>

2368
02:04:27.101 --> 02:04:28.630
<v Speaker 5>we'll come in and give you another </v>
<v Speaker 5>marshmallow.</v>

2369
02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:34.140
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the kids and they videotape the </v>

2370
02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:36.571
<v Speaker 5>kids and the tapes are actually pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>funny because the poor kids do </v>

2371
02:04:36.571 --> 02:04:36.571
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can know what to look at that candy</v>

2372
02:04:36.571 --> 02:04:38.430
<v Speaker 5>or marshmallow like they sit on their </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands,</v>

2373
02:04:38.431 --> 02:04:40.020
<v Speaker 5>they hum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look at the ceiling.</v>

2374
02:04:40.021 --> 02:04:43.820
<v Speaker 5>It's like they try to distract </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves and some of them just know.</v>

2375
02:04:43.821 --> 02:04:44.280
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2376
02:04:44.281 --> 02:04:49.281
<v Speaker 5>to hell with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They eat it and then others can manage </v>

2377
02:04:49.281 --> 02:04:49.281
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and those were the.</v>

2378
02:04:49.281 --> 02:04:50.700
<v Speaker 5>The.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The data showed.</v>

2379
02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:55.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say this study has been </v>

2380
02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:57.621
<v Speaker 5>replicated many times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the data showed quite clearly that </v>

2381
02:04:57.621 --> 02:04:58.470
<v Speaker 5>the kids who could delay gratification </v>
<v Speaker 5>out in early stage,</v>

2382
02:04:58.471 --> 02:05:00.690
<v Speaker 5>we're doing quite a bit better later in </v>
<v Speaker 5>life now.</v>

2383
02:05:00.691 --> 02:05:05.691
<v Speaker 5>I don't know to what degree that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>controlled for Icu because such things </v>

2384
02:05:05.691 --> 02:05:07.590
<v Speaker 5>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the point is is that,</v>

2385
02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:08.910
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the point is,</v>

2386
02:05:08.911 --> 02:05:11.490
<v Speaker 5>the point that you're making is that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can delay.</v>

2387
02:05:11.491 --> 02:05:16.491
<v Speaker 5>You can only delay gratification </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligently though if the social </v>

2388
02:05:16.491 --> 02:05:16.560
<v Speaker 5>structure is stable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2389
02:05:16.561 --> 02:05:19.080
<v Speaker 5>Because basically what if you delay </v>
<v Speaker 5>gratification,</v>

2390
02:05:19.081 --> 02:05:22.770
<v Speaker 5>you're making a bargain with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>potential future and the bargaining has.</v>

2391
02:05:22.771 --> 02:05:27.771
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's going to keep acting the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same way so that the future is the same </v>

2392
02:05:27.771 --> 02:05:30.981
<v Speaker 5>as the present because otherwise you'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>delay gratification and then everything </v>

2393
02:05:30.981 --> 02:05:32.460
<v Speaker 5>will fall apart and you won't get your </v>
<v Speaker 5>cake and you won't get to eat it,</v>

2394
02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:38.060
<v Speaker 5>and so society has to be quite stable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has to be stabilized by the </v>

2395
02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:40.770
<v Speaker 5>contractual relationship between people </v>
<v Speaker 5>before delaying.</v>

2396
02:05:40.771 --> 02:05:45.771
<v Speaker 5>Gratification is a useful strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is also why you see in chaotic </v>

2397
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:49.320
<v Speaker 5>circumstances where the future becomes </v>
<v Speaker 5>uncertain.</v>

2398
02:05:49.321 --> 02:05:52.080
<v Speaker 5>People forgo delay of gratification </v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2399
02:05:52.081 --> 02:05:55.590
<v Speaker 5>very rapidly and and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and perhaps appropriately so,</v>

2400
02:05:55.591 --> 02:05:57.900
<v Speaker 5>although you can get a spiral going in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other direction.</v>

2401
02:05:58.340 --> 02:05:58.560
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2402
02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:19.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2403
02:06:26.530 --> 02:06:31.530
<v Speaker 5>I would say it's a chicken and egg </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem because what happens as you </v>

2404
02:06:31.530 --> 02:06:32.890
<v Speaker 5>stabilize societies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being conscientious,</v>

2405
02:06:33.190 --> 02:06:38.190
<v Speaker 5>conscientious becomes more useful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so then you're going to be selected </v>

2406
02:06:39.401 --> 02:06:44.401
<v Speaker 5>for as a consequence of being </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientious and that's going to </v>

2407
02:06:44.401 --> 02:06:45.250
<v Speaker 5>stabilize the society even more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are,</v>

2408
02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:47.620
<v Speaker 5>these are roughly known as Baldwin </v>
<v Speaker 5>Effects.</v>

2409
02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:51.610
<v Speaker 5>So that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's call it a genetic transformation,</v>

2410
02:06:51.611 --> 02:06:54.970
<v Speaker 5>produces a behavioral transformation </v>
<v Speaker 5>that transforms the environment.</v>

2411
02:06:54.971 --> 02:06:57.910
<v Speaker 5>So the genetic transformation is more </v>
<v Speaker 5>likely to propagate.</v>

2412
02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:03.180
<v Speaker 5>You can get unbelievably rapid </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary movements when when you get</v>

2413
02:07:03.401 --> 02:07:05.800
<v Speaker 5>a loop like that developing and and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2414
02:07:05.801 --> 02:07:09.910
<v Speaker 5>they happen frequently and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's also how in some sense of meaning</v>

2415
02:07:09.911 --> 02:07:14.770
<v Speaker 5>can be turned into a genetic can </v>
<v Speaker 5>manifest itself genetically,</v>

2416
02:07:14.771 --> 02:07:19.771
<v Speaker 5>so if you have an idea that spreads </v>
<v Speaker 5>through the culture and it tilts the </v>

2417
02:07:19.771 --> 02:07:21.850
<v Speaker 5>culture in a certain way such that those</v>
<v Speaker 5>who hold that idea are likely to be more</v>

2418
02:07:21.851 --> 02:07:26.851
<v Speaker 5>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the meme in the biology will align </v>

2419
02:07:26.851 --> 02:07:29.761
<v Speaker 5>themselves across time and and while I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think you see that happening,</v>

2420
02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:35.480
<v Speaker 5>that's that to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what's happened as religious </v>

2421
02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:35.480
<v Speaker 5>stories have propagated themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2422
02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:39.100
<v Speaker 5>because as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the idea of the hero becomes clear,</v>

2423
02:07:39.190 --> 02:07:44.190
<v Speaker 5>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it manifests itself more </v>

2424
02:07:44.190 --> 02:07:44.470
<v Speaker 5>clearly in the society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then there's more rewards for doing it.</v>

2425
02:07:44.650 --> 02:07:49.650
<v Speaker 5>Then the selection pressures get more </v>
<v Speaker 5>positively related to that kind of </v>

2426
02:07:49.650 --> 02:07:50.800
<v Speaker 5>behavior in the whole thing loops </v>
<v Speaker 5>upwards.</v>

2427
02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:53.230
<v Speaker 5>So it's something like that.</v>

2428
02:07:55.090 --> 02:07:57.380
<v Speaker 4>In terms of treating mental health </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorders,</v>

2429
02:07:57.381 --> 02:08:02.381
<v Speaker 4>where do you think we should or have be </v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical interventions secretary?</v>

2430
02:08:08.230 --> 02:08:13.230
<v Speaker 4>At what point is depression and anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be treated with medicine?</v>

2431
02:08:13.770 --> 02:08:16.540
<v Speaker 4>That's what the.</v>

2432
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:19.230
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a good question.</v>

2433
02:08:19.231 --> 02:08:24.231
<v Speaker 5>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you differentiate the utility of </v>

2434
02:08:24.231 --> 02:08:27.800
<v Speaker 5>behavioral slash psychotherapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 5>treatments for conditions like </v>

2435
02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:28.830
<v Speaker 5>depression versus medical treatments?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2436
02:08:28.831 --> 02:08:30.600
<v Speaker 5>so the first thing I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2437
02:08:31.230 --> 02:08:33.990
<v Speaker 5>don't underestimate the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 5>medical interventions.</v>

2438
02:08:34.890 --> 02:08:36.720
<v Speaker 5>Depression is a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a catastrophe.</v>

2439
02:08:36.721 --> 02:08:41.721
<v Speaker 5>It carries with it a very high suicide </v>
<v Speaker 5>rate and it also levels people out and </v>

2440
02:08:41.721 --> 02:08:44.650
<v Speaker 5>it's really hard on their families and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so and it,</v>

2441
02:08:44.651 --> 02:08:47.370
<v Speaker 5>and it's physiologically extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 5>damaging.</v>

2442
02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:52.110
<v Speaker 5>And so if you're in a depressive state </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's severe,</v>

2443
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:56.040
<v Speaker 5>you can try an antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll know in a month if it works,</v>

2444
02:08:56.430 --> 02:09:01.430
<v Speaker 5>if it works well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it'll help you get your life </v>

2445
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.430
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we could say,</v>

2446
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:02.160
<v Speaker 5>well maybe you're depressed because your</v>
<v Speaker 5>life isn't very well together.</v>

2447
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:05.010
<v Speaker 5>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes people are depressed,</v>

2448
02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:10.160
<v Speaker 5>their life is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it isn't fine because no one's life is </v>

2449
02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:10.160
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

2450
02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:13.550
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's life is a tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes people have their lives in</v>

2451
02:09:13.561 --> 02:09:18.561
<v Speaker 5>order,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much as you could expect anyone to </v>

2452
02:09:18.561 --> 02:09:18.561
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have friends,</v>

2453
02:09:18.561 --> 02:09:19.830
<v Speaker 5>they have an intimate relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a career that they like,</v>

2454
02:09:20.050 --> 02:09:20.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

2455
02:09:20.710 --> 02:09:25.710
<v Speaker 5>they're qualified,</v>
<v Speaker 5>industrious people working hard on what </v>

2456
02:09:25.710 --> 02:09:25.710
<v Speaker 5>they're doing and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2457
02:09:25.710 --> 02:09:30.640
<v Speaker 5>and really playing a minimum number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>games with themselves and they're </v>

2458
02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:33.210
<v Speaker 5>terribly depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Antidepressant man that's sometimes that</v>

2459
02:09:33.211 --> 02:09:35.610
<v Speaker 5>will just fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so hooray,</v>

2460
02:09:35.611 --> 02:09:40.611
<v Speaker 5>like you were biological entity if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's something out there that can </v>

2461
02:09:40.611 --> 02:09:43.110
<v Speaker 5>help you strengthen yourself so that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can prevail.</v>

2462
02:09:43.410 --> 02:09:44.850
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2463
02:09:44.851 --> 02:09:46.140
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hear,</v>

2464
02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:48.120
<v Speaker 5>everyone takes antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2465
02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:53.180
<v Speaker 5>everyone's taking them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like no one takes those bloody </v>

2466
02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.401
<v Speaker 5>things without serious consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Half the time I spend with my clients </v>

2467
02:09:55.401 --> 02:09:59.721
<v Speaker 5>who are depressed is often the two years</v>
<v Speaker 5>long attempt to get them to tentatively </v>

2468
02:09:59.721 --> 02:10:04.371
<v Speaker 5>try an antidepressant because there are </v>
<v Speaker 5>so guilty that they're relying on an </v>

2469
02:10:04.371 --> 02:10:06.480
<v Speaker 5>external crutch to sort out their lives </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they can't even tolerate it.</v>

2470
02:10:07.230 --> 02:10:08.010
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say,</v>

2471
02:10:08.011 --> 02:10:10.800
<v Speaker 5>well look man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if you had diabetes,</v>

2472
02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:15.000
<v Speaker 5>you know are going to take your insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you got stressed.</v>

2473
02:10:15.001 --> 02:10:20.001
<v Speaker 5>He blew out at your weakest point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens when you get </v>

2474
02:10:20.001 --> 02:10:22.521
<v Speaker 5>stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there's something out there that </v>

2475
02:10:22.521 --> 02:10:22.521
<v Speaker 5>might help you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like try it for God's sake,</v>

2476
02:10:22.521 --> 02:10:26.040
<v Speaker 5>you'll know in a month and you'd just </v>
<v Speaker 5>stop if it doesn't work.</v>

2477
02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:31.400
<v Speaker 5>Now having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to do a multidimensional </v>

2478
02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:31.400
<v Speaker 5>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2479
02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:32.340
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you have any friends?</v>

2480
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:35.360
<v Speaker 5>Do you have an intimate relationship or </v>
<v Speaker 5>are you pursuing one?</v>

2481
02:10:35.361 --> 02:10:38.000
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a reasonable career?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you as educated as you are?</v>

2482
02:10:38.001 --> 02:10:43.001
<v Speaker 5>Intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have something useful to do with </v>

2483
02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:43.430
<v Speaker 5>your time outside of work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a drug or alcohol problem?</v>

2484
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:48.550
<v Speaker 5>Are there other behavioral issues like </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleep dysregulation and lack of eating </v>

2485
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.950
<v Speaker 5>that are contributing to the pathology?</v>

2486
02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:54.160
<v Speaker 5>You want to differentiate all of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and wherever you can make a behavioral </v>

2487
02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:57.671
<v Speaker 5>intervention so much the better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes too you're dealing with </v>

2488
02:10:57.671 --> 02:10:59.120
<v Speaker 5>people whose lives are so rare that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't even know where to start.</v>

2489
02:10:59.330 --> 02:11:04.330
<v Speaker 5>There are different than the ones who </v>
<v Speaker 5>have everything in order to say and you </v>

2490
02:11:04.330 --> 02:11:04.330
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2491
02:11:04.330 --> 02:11:08.110
<v Speaker 5>try this man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you won't cut your throat in the </v>

2492
02:11:08.110 --> 02:11:09.680
<v Speaker 5>next month because if your dad it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be hard to work with you and so</v>

2493
02:11:10.130 --> 02:11:13.880
<v Speaker 5>so medical interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

2494
02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:19.420
<v Speaker 5>If you're sick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do what is necessary to get better </v>

2495
02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:20.810
<v Speaker 5>and you leave your pride behind if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have to,</v>

2496
02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:24.410
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that says nothing about the utility</v>

2497
02:11:24.411 --> 02:11:29.411
<v Speaker 5>of the behavioral interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to hit the problem with </v>

2498
02:11:29.411 --> 02:11:32.231
<v Speaker 5>everything you have at your disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But some antidepressants especially,</v>

2499
02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:36.650
<v Speaker 5>especially for people whose lives are </v>
<v Speaker 5>together and who are depressed,</v>

2500
02:11:36.651 --> 02:11:38.900
<v Speaker 5>antidepressants can be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>miraculous.</v>

2501
02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:44.620
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you hear about the clinical </v>

2502
02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:47.920
<v Speaker 5>evidence in their favor being iffy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's partly because the diagnosis </v>

2503
02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:48.170
<v Speaker 5>of depression isn't very well </v>
<v Speaker 5>formulated.</v>

2504
02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:52.010
<v Speaker 5>It's very different to have a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>life than to be depressed.</v>

2505
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:55.850
<v Speaker 5>And antidepressants can only help you so</v>
<v Speaker 5>much if you have a terrible life.</v>

2506
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:57.290
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2507
02:11:58.830 --> 02:11:59.040
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2508
02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:01.650
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

2509
02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:10.790
<v Speaker 4>these activities that are meaningful and</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness would be very good at </v>

2510
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:15.091
<v Speaker 4>identifying and I feel like some things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are not as useful.</v>

2511
02:12:26.670 --> 02:12:29.070
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what does some personalities,</v>

2512
02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:33.000
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>video games are.</v>

2513
02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:38.060
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the question is can that sense of </v>

2514
02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:38.060
<v Speaker 5>meaning behind jacked?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer to that is absolutely,</v>

2515
02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:43.340
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you could say that the ultimate </v>

2516
02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:46.110
<v Speaker 5>sense of meaning is composed of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Union of fragmentary senses,</v>

2517
02:12:46.111 --> 02:12:49.410
<v Speaker 5>of meaning and the fragmentary senses of</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning can be overwhelmingly powerful,</v>

2518
02:12:49.530 --> 02:12:52.440
<v Speaker 5>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexual lust and and,</v>

2519
02:12:52.441 --> 02:12:55.140
<v Speaker 5>and those sorts of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced when say when you're playing</v>

2520
02:12:55.141 --> 02:12:58.650
<v Speaker 5>a video game which are very carefully </v>
<v Speaker 5>calibrated to keep you on the,</v>

2521
02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:03.680
<v Speaker 5>on the edge of exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say now I'm not a full of video </v>

2522
02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:08.361
<v Speaker 5>games because games are complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it isn't clear what people are doing </v>

2523
02:13:08.361 --> 02:13:08.780
<v Speaker 5>when they're playing them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2524
02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.190
<v Speaker 5>they may be expanding their cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>skills,</v>

2525
02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:16.280
<v Speaker 5>they may be learning to cooperate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they may be learning to engage in </v>

2526
02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:19.071
<v Speaker 5>complex problem solving and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but part of it's also a matter of </v>

2527
02:13:19.071 --> 02:13:19.920
<v Speaker 5>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2528
02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:23.220
<v Speaker 5>50 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably not,</v>

2529
02:13:23.730 --> 02:13:26.100
<v Speaker 5>unless you're going to go pro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2530
02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:29.010
<v Speaker 5>Because there's other things you need to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be attending to.</v>

2531
02:13:29.011 --> 02:13:32.730
<v Speaker 5>It's not a stable solution for your </v>
<v Speaker 5>family,</v>

2532
02:13:33.330 --> 02:13:35.640
<v Speaker 5>your society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's too one sided.</v>

2533
02:13:35.850 --> 02:13:38.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you can get pulled down rabbit holes</v>

2534
02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:42.090
<v Speaker 5>of all sorts that are one sided pursuits</v>
<v Speaker 5>of meaning.</v>

2535
02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:47.450
<v Speaker 5>So it's something we're actually going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to talk about as the later classes </v>

2536
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:49.440
<v Speaker 5>unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is how do you stop yourself</v>

2537
02:13:49.441 --> 02:13:52.500
<v Speaker 5>from falling prey to a path or a sense </v>
<v Speaker 5>of meaning?</v>

2538
02:13:52.890 --> 02:13:57.890
<v Speaker 5>And I think one of the answers to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>is don't lie because what you're hoping </v>

2539
02:13:58.051 --> 02:14:02.430
<v Speaker 5>is that your nervous system is </v>
<v Speaker 5>sufficiently healthy and well program so</v>

2540
02:14:02.431 --> 02:14:07.431
<v Speaker 5>that what it reads out to you is </v>
<v Speaker 5>reliable and if you pathologize your </v>

2541
02:14:08.490 --> 02:14:13.080
<v Speaker 5>psyche by either through sins of </v>
<v Speaker 5>omission,</v>

2542
02:14:13.081 --> 02:14:18.081
<v Speaker 5>let's say or or outright deception,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna work that internal </v>

2543
02:14:18.081 --> 02:14:21.441
<v Speaker 5>structure and it's not going to read out</v>
<v Speaker 5>properly to you and then your sense of </v>

2544
02:14:21.441 --> 02:14:21.441
<v Speaker 5>meaning will lead you astray.</v>

2545
02:14:21.441 --> 02:14:25.380
<v Speaker 5>So like one of the reasons for speaking </v>
<v Speaker 5>the truth,</v>

2546
02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:27.780
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't say that because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know how to speak the truth,</v>

2547
02:14:27.781 --> 02:14:31.770
<v Speaker 5>but you do know how not to lie and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>a game.</v>

2548
02:14:31.771 --> 02:14:34.080
<v Speaker 5>You're playing with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can define the damn lies.</v>

2549
02:14:34.081 --> 02:14:36.370
<v Speaker 5>No one else has to do that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

2550
02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:41.600
<v Speaker 5>you try not to otter falsehoods because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you wore your neurological structure by </v>

2551
02:14:41.941 --> 02:14:44.580
<v Speaker 5>doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it will read out pathologically</v>

2552
02:14:44.581 --> 02:14:48.090
<v Speaker 5>and then if you rely on it to guide you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will run you right off a cliff.</v>

2553
02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:53.780
<v Speaker 5>So that's why there's a moral element to</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is if you're going to rely on your </v>

2554
02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:57.501
<v Speaker 5>sense of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make sure that you don't pollute the </v>

2555
02:14:57.501 --> 02:14:58.390
<v Speaker 5>mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

2556
02:14:58.410 --> 02:15:03.410
<v Speaker 5>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is partly why people go to </v>

2557
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:03.410
<v Speaker 5>confession,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2558
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:07.851
<v Speaker 5>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like a serious </v>

2559
02:15:07.851 --> 02:15:07.851
<v Speaker 5>psychotherapeutic technique.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2560
02:15:07.851 --> 02:15:11.210
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what stupid miserable wretched things </v>

2561
02:15:11.210 --> 02:15:11.210
<v Speaker 5>did I do this week?</v>

2562
02:15:11.210 --> 02:15:12.840
<v Speaker 5>That's a good thing too to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscious,</v>

2563
02:15:12.841 --> 02:15:17.841
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because maybe you cannot do them the </v>

2564
02:15:17.841 --> 02:15:17.841
<v Speaker 5>next week and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2565
02:15:17.841 --> 02:15:17.841
<v Speaker 5>why would you bother?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2566
02:15:17.841 --> 02:15:22.671
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in a ship sailing across the the </v>

2567
02:15:22.671 --> 02:15:24.150
<v Speaker 5>stormy seas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

2568
02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:29.180
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're hacking holes in it with a </v>

2569
02:15:29.180 --> 02:15:31.671
<v Speaker 5>pick ax,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should probably pay attention to </v>

2570
02:15:31.671 --> 02:15:32.550
<v Speaker 5>that before you sink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's a good idea to keep,</v>

2571
02:15:32.910 --> 02:15:37.910
<v Speaker 5>to keep what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's stupid in mind so that you can </v>

2572
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:40.611
<v Speaker 5>stop doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so then you can more and more rely </v>

2573
02:15:40.611 --> 02:15:41.010
<v Speaker 5>on yourself and your and your own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2574
02:15:41.011 --> 02:15:44.280
<v Speaker 5>your own conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

2575
02:15:44.281 --> 02:15:45.780
<v Speaker 5>as a guide to proper action.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2576
02:15:45.781 --> 02:15:50.781
<v Speaker 5>in the Pinocchio story is that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscious was not an unerring guide for </v>

2577
02:15:50.781 --> 02:15:54.780
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It had to learn and so and so.</v>

2578
02:15:55.170 --> 02:16:00.170
<v Speaker 5>It's also partly pushing yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 5>new situations and differentiating </v>

2579
02:16:00.170 --> 02:16:04.011
<v Speaker 5>yourself so that you get wiser and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's courage as well as truth,</v>

2580
02:16:04.970 --> 02:16:08.370
<v Speaker 5>that those might be the two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's more beauty,</v>

2581
02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:09.240
<v Speaker 5>courage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>truth,</v>

2582
02:16:09.241 --> 02:16:11.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fundamental virtues.</v>

2583
02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:14.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why be virtuous?</v>

2584
02:16:14.731 --> 02:16:19.731
<v Speaker 5>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that you can bear the suffering </v>

2585
02:16:19.731 --> 02:16:22.050
<v Speaker 5>of life without becoming corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2586
02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:25.560
<v Speaker 5>It's practical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's practical.</v>

2587
02:16:25.561 --> 02:16:27.480
<v Speaker 5>If there's nothing more practical than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2588
02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 5>so unless you want misery and</v>

2589
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:32.320
<v Speaker 3>people do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it's exciting.</v>

2590
02:16:33.010 --> 02:16:36.190
<v Speaker 3>Misery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So other questions?</v>

2591
02:16:39.170 --> 02:16:39.880
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

2592
02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:44.590
<v Speaker 3>See you next Wednesday.</v>
