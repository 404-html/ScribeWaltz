1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 2>so one of the propositions that I set </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth for you last week was that the </v>

3
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:26.131
<v Speaker 2>most real things are the things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>most permanent across time and that </v>

4
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 2>manifest themselves in the largest </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of situations and those are the </v>

5
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.770
<v Speaker 2>things that you have to map successfully</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to survive,</v>

6
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 2>survive as individuals but survive as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>species over a very long period of time.</v>

7
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:45.811
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one question is what are the constants </v>

8
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:52.261
<v Speaker 2>of experience if you are a follower of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary psychologists and to </v>

9
00:00:55.391 --> 00:01:00.391
<v Speaker 2>some degree the evolutionary biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say more the psychologists </v>

10
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 2>like to be and caused me these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a very afro centric view of </v>

11
00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 2>human evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea basically is that</v>

12
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>after we diverged from the common </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestor between chimpanzees,</v>

13
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Bonobos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and human beings,</v>

14
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 2>we spent a tremendous amount of time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the African environment,</v>

15
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>mostly on the velt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although we're not absolutely certain </v>

16
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.111
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're also very good in water human </v>

17
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:36.830
<v Speaker 2>beings and we have some of the features </v>
<v Speaker 2>of aquatic mammals.</v>

18
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>while hairlessness being one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women have a subcutaneous layer of fat </v>

20
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:46.520
<v Speaker 2>or theater quite nicely adapted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming.</v>

21
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.010
<v Speaker 2>And so buckminster fuller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I wouldn't call it mainstream </v>

22
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesized back in the seventies that </v>

23
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.631
<v Speaker 2>we spent some period of time in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary history living on beaches </v>

24
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 2>near the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that idea really a echoes for me </v>

25
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 2>because we like beaches a lot and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great place if you want to get easy food</v>

26
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 2>and we're pretty damn good at swimming </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

27
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 2>for terrestrial mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we are hairless and we do cry salt </v>

28
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 2>tears and there's a lot of evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we end our feet.</v>

29
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 2>If you think about our feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're quite slipper.</v>

30
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Like I know we have stand up and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and walk.</v>

31
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of the adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're pretty good at swimming.</v>

32
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classical evolutionary psychology </v>

33
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.751
<v Speaker 2>view is that we spent most of our time </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the African Veldt in the critical </v>

34
00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 2>period of our evolutionary development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

35
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:41.291
<v Speaker 2>after we diverged from this common </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestor and that were adapted for that </v>

36
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:45.971
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the consequences of that is </v>

37
00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:49.421
<v Speaker 2>the idea that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that things have changed so much around </v>

38
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 2>us that we're really not adapted to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment that we're in anymore.</v>

39
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 2>And I don't really believe that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the idea that the primary </v>

40
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.811
<v Speaker 2>forces that shaped our evolution shape </v>
<v Speaker 2>them during that period of time call it </v>

41
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 2>us roughly a 7 million period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>year period of time,</v>

42
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

43
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.710
<v Speaker 2>And that that was somehow a special time</v>
<v Speaker 2>for human evolution that's set our </v>

44
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that,</v>

45
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's true to some degree,</v>

46
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:25.111
<v Speaker 2>but it's more useful to view the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution of human cognitive processes </v>

47
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:30.541
<v Speaker 2>over the entire span of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>history and not necessarily give </v>

48
00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 2>preference to any particular epoch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I certainly believe that the idea </v>

49
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:39.241
<v Speaker 2>that we're no longer adapted to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment because of our rapid </v>

50
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 2>technological transformations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's simply not true.</v>

51
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I think that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>true is because the fundamental </v>

52
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 2>constants of the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

53
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:50.791
<v Speaker 2>or it's more of the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitute constituent elements of </v>

54
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:54.211
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the right way to think </v>

55
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:54.211
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the same.</v>

56
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:57.660
<v Speaker 2>They haven't changed a bit and there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>no way of changing them as far as I can </v>

57
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.801
<v Speaker 2>tell without us being radically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>incomprehensibly different than we are </v>

58
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 2>and you know with with the rapid rise of</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence and robotics and</v>

59
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:11.581
<v Speaker 2>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly possible that in 500 </v>

60
00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 2>years will be completely will be so like</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike the way we are now,</v>

61
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 2>that we won't even be the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>

62
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>great outcome,</v>

63
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are the fundamental constituent </v>

64
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 2>elements?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While they're expressed in mythology,</v>

65
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 2>but they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not merely symbolic.</v>

66
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the wrong way to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

67
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>There are symbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they reflect a very deep reality and</v>

68
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 2>they actually reflect the reality that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not easily apprehensible directly by the</v>

69
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:42.841
<v Speaker 2>census.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now your senses are tuned for a </v>

70
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 2>particular duration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's roughly,</v>

71
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's roughly the duration that you </v>

72
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

73
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the duration.</v>

74
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that duration is across which </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful actions take place and we </v>

75
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 2>kind of have some idea of what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>duration is.</v>

76
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at us,</v>

77
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 2>a computer screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it has a refresh rate of less than 60</v>

78
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 2>hertz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see it flickering,</v>

79
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 2>but above 60 hertz you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uniform.</v>

80
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:12.200
<v Speaker 2>And with movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

81
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 2>anywhere between 20 and 50 frames a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

82
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 2>is it enough to give you the illusion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>continual motion?</v>

83
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

84
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.790
<v Speaker 2>we live in a universe that's above the </v>
<v Speaker 2>10th of a second domain or maybe the </v>

85
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 2>hundredth of a second somewhere in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

86
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:30.541
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it's not like time isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost infinitely sub dividable at </v>

87
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:34.951
<v Speaker 2>higher levels of resolution than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't operate generally speaking </v>

88
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 2>at higher temporal resolution than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

89
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

90
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 2>we're our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

91
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 2>our feeling of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the felt moment seems to be,</v>

92
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I would say something approximating half</v>
<v Speaker 2>a second to a second,</v>

93
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's an estimate obviously,</v>

94
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:55.351
<v Speaker 2>but a second is a meaningful unit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time for a person and 100th of a second </v>

95
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:58.230
<v Speaker 2>really isn't in certainly a billionth of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a second isn't then you know,</v>

96
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>we can think across hours and days and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks and months,</v>

97
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 2>but we really can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you start getting out into years,</v>

98
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:09.491
<v Speaker 2>it gets kind of sketchy and it's hard to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think more than five years down the </v>

99
00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:09.491
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

100
00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:13.210
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular is upon which you're basing </v>

101
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 2>your predictions are likely to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently over a five year period.</v>

102
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:21.251
<v Speaker 2>So that extending out your vision past </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just exposes you to accelerating </v>

103
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 2>error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

104
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 2>And that of course that's the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with predicting the future period.</v>

105
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 2>So we live in a time range that's about </v>
<v Speaker 2>say a 10th of a second,</v>

106
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:29.140
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

107
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

108
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Now I know it can expand beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

109
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 2>that's kinda where we're set in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our senses seemed to be tuned to those </v>

110
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.311
<v Speaker 2>durations and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to be operative so that we make </v>

111
00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:43.740
<v Speaker 2>proper decisions within those durations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

112
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.810
<v Speaker 2>and also from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a particular spatial positioning </v>

113
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.810
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

114
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.050
<v Speaker 2>how your eyes see what's roughly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we could say a walkable distance </v>

115
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 2>in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

116
00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.210
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you didn't detect things and in the </v>

117
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 2>locale that enables you to immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with things,</v>

118
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.470
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't necessarily the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>senses that are tuned to do that are </v>

119
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.001
<v Speaker 2>also tuned to inform you directly about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the most permanent things about </v>

120
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 2>being itself are.</v>

121
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I think that those things have to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>third and there's some,</v>

122
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 2>there's some supporting evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing from a,</v>

123
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.230
<v Speaker 2>from psycho linguistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

124
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a level of,</v>

125
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.800
<v Speaker 2>of categorization that we seem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest more or less automatically or </v>

126
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:32.930
<v Speaker 2>implicitly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

127
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.160
<v Speaker 2>when children perceive animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

128
00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:41.161
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they perceive at the level of cat or </v>

129
00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:41.161
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

130
00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 2>they don't perceive that the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>subspecies like cat or,</v>

131
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

132
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or uh,</v>

133
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 2>let's say salmonoid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

135
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what they call that </v>

136
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.060
<v Speaker 2>base category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

137
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 2>It's usually specified by very short </v>
<v Speaker 2>words that are easily learnable.</v>

138
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 2>And so the linguistic system seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>map right onto the,</v>

139
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.200
<v Speaker 2>to the object recognition </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics of the sensory systems </v>

140
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.970
<v Speaker 2>that are built right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

141
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 2>and if they weren't built into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't communicate easily because </v>

142
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 2>our natural categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it,</v>

143
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably wrong.</v>

144
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Our natural categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be the same for everyone or</v>

145
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 2>it would be very difficult for us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate.</v>

146
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So having said all that,</v>

147
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 2>then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

148
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 2>what are the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the most real categories?</v>

149
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real division in ways to think</v>

150
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 2>about this because there's a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of thinking about it.</v>

151
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in that case,</v>

152
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:41.801
<v Speaker 2>the most real categories are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well mathematical equations certainly </v>

153
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:45.791
<v Speaker 2>seem to be in the top category there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the equations that describe the physical</v>

154
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:48.020
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then then the,</v>

155
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:53.070
<v Speaker 2>the hypothesis of the existence of such </v>
<v Speaker 2>things as protons and electrons and you </v>

156
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:54.750
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

157
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the material elements that make up </v>

158
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.361
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's every element of being with the </v>

159
00:09:02.361 --> 00:09:03.590
<v Speaker 2>possible exception of empty space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

160
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.160
<v Speaker 2>but in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mythological world to categories </v>

161
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.370
<v Speaker 2>I think are more derived from Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the effect of Darwinian processes on </v>

162
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 2>cognitive and perceptual function.</v>

163
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 2>So which is to say that we have learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>to perceive and then to infer those </v>

164
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 2>things that are most necessary for us in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to continue our existence,</v>

165
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 2>propagate live well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of those things.</v>

166
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 2>And that would be true at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual survival.</v>

167
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's also true at the level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>group survival.</v>

168
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:37.821
<v Speaker 2>Although you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a tremendous debate among </v>

169
00:09:37.821 --> 00:09:41.001
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary biologists about whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>not selection can take place at the </v>

170
00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:44.601
<v Speaker 2>level of the group anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are these basic level categories </v>

171
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:49.881
<v Speaker 2>that manifest themselves to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's categories of the </v>

172
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 2>imagination that you have to infer up </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the sensory domain,</v>

173
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:56.541
<v Speaker 2>and we do that partly in science by </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparing our sensory representations </v>

174
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:01.851
<v Speaker 2>across people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also do it by thinking </v>

175
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:01.851
<v Speaker 2>abstractly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizing abstractly,</v>

176
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:07.010
<v Speaker 2>and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's interesting </v>

177
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.321
<v Speaker 2>about abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear whether they're more or </v>

178
00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 2>less real than the things they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>obstructed from,</v>

179
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a perennial debate among,</v>

180
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.590
<v Speaker 2>let's call them ontologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were interested in the fundamental,</v>

181
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.690
<v Speaker 2>fundamental nature of reality itself.</v>

182
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent of conceptual structures.</v>

183
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Our numbers more or less real than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things they represent.</v>

184
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a really hard question to answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because knowing like using numbers as a </v>

185
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Speaker 2>representational system gives you </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable power.</v>

186
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.070
<v Speaker 2>And there are mathematicians that </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that there isn't anything more </v>

187
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.070
<v Speaker 2>real than mathematical representations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

188
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.810
<v Speaker 2>it depends to some degree of course on </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you classify reality.</v>

189
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with a question like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

190
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 2>a equivalent to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer to that always is.</v>

191
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends on how you define a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it depends on how you define be.</v>

192
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.960
<v Speaker 2>So generally it's not a very useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

193
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:59.961
<v Speaker 2>but you can still get the point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something very real about </v>

194
00:10:59.961 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 2>abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly real,</v>

195
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise why would you bother </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them?</v>

196
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:04.680
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't give you any handle on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

197
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.040
<v Speaker 2>So what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the most useful or what's the </v>

198
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.221
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the broadest possible level of </v>

199
00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:16.011
<v Speaker 2>abstraction and is there any use of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility in thinking in that manner.</v>

200
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:21.050
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to make the case last time </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that in the mythological world </v>

201
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:26.541
<v Speaker 2>there are three categories or four </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on what you do with the </v>

202
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:29.911
<v Speaker 2>strange fourth category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the fourth category is sort of </v>

203
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:33.200
<v Speaker 2>the category of uncategorizable entities</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's sort of the category of </v>

204
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:35.640
<v Speaker 2>everything that not only do you not </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

205
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:37.440
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know it hits,</v>

206
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 2>or you can think about it as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>category of potential.</v>

207
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that's the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it is that it's the dragon </v>

208
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.230
<v Speaker 2>of chaos is the category of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do believe that we're.</v>

209
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Our materialist view is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

210
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that the proper way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the at being is that being his </v>

211
00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.230
<v Speaker 2>potential and from that potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever consciousness is,</v>

212
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:02.780
<v Speaker 2>extracts out the reality that we inhabit</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

213
00:12:02.781 --> 00:12:07.781
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint and and but it's not just a </v>

214
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:07.781
<v Speaker 2>mythological viewpoint.</v>

215
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

216
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a sequence of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

217
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:15.190
<v Speaker 2>that deeply underlies the thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own piaget and piaget by the way.</v>

218
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 2>It was very interested in reconciling </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gap between religion and science.</v>

219
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:21.760
<v Speaker 2>That's really what he devoted his life </v>
<v Speaker 2>to doing and so,</v>

220
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.910
<v Speaker 2>and there are other streams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy and I would say heidegger </v>

221
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.420
<v Speaker 2>that phenomenologists are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are thinking along lines that are </v>

222
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.481
<v Speaker 2>similar to this as well because </v>
<v Speaker 2>heidegger was concerned not with the </v>

223
00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:35.220
<v Speaker 2>nature of material reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with being as such and,</v>

224
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you can extract out the viewpoint</v>

225
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 2>that I just described from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from mythology,</v>

226
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:45.910
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't the only source of such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

227
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.030
<v Speaker 2>A high hypotheses is probably the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

228
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the idea,</v>

229
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.350
<v Speaker 2>you can think about this as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bootstrapping process in some senses.</v>

230
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 2>In order for anything to get going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to bootstrap itself up and become</v>

231
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Speaker 2>more and more complex as it does that.</v>

232
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this is the answer to the </v>

233
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:07.620
<v Speaker 2>chicken and egg problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

234
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Which was first the chicken or the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

235
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 2>neither something from which both the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken and egg were derived,</v>

236
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:12.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the,</v>

237
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.660
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate answer to that is the </v>

238
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:17.660
<v Speaker 2>answer to how there are things at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

239
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.810
<v Speaker 2>but at some point there were neither </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens nor eggs,</v>

240
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:22.570
<v Speaker 2>but there were the things that were the </v>
<v Speaker 2>precursors to those things.</v>

241
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.680
<v Speaker 2>And so they spiraled upwards in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

242
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:27.390
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

243
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>initial,</v>

244
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prodo entities,</v>

245
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.720
<v Speaker 2>single celled animals for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to go back farther than that.</v>

246
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 2>But we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

247
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 2>single cell animals differentiated over </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

248
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's this looping process that,</v>

249
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.920
<v Speaker 2>that differentiates out into both the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken and the egg.</v>

250
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.470
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the question is,</v>

251
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 2>what do you need in order for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>process to begin?</v>

252
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's really the question of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental constituent elements of </v>

253
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.801
<v Speaker 2>reality are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the mythological hypothesis is that </v>

254
00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:02.041
<v Speaker 2>there are three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the fact that there has to be </v>

255
00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:02.470
<v Speaker 2>something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

256
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.440
<v Speaker 2>that that manifests itself as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>observer.</v>

257
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:10.470
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some kind of observer now where that </v>

258
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 2>process of observation starts in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phylogenetic chain is very,</v>

259
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

260
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 2>we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

261
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:21.271
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly no possibility of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious observer until there's a </v>

262
00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:24.691
<v Speaker 2>differentiated nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then prior to the emergence of </v>

263
00:14:24.691 --> 00:14:28.231
<v Speaker 2>differentiated nervous systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were animals that were complex </v>

264
00:14:28.231 --> 00:14:29.590
<v Speaker 2>enough to react with the environment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a manner that,</v>

265
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single celled animals,</v>

266
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 2>they're quite complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

267
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.210
<v Speaker 2>some of them are unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

268
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can move themselves through space,</v>

269
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 2>they can orient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can follow chemical trails.</v>

270
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.930
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not stupid by any stretch of the</v>

271
00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

272
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what degree they have being,</v>

273
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as something they could represent.</v>

274
00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:52.921
<v Speaker 2>Well we don't have to speculate on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the elements of conscious being are </v>

275
00:14:53.451 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need,</v>

276
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.500
<v Speaker 2>you need a being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need that.</v>

277
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:03.620
<v Speaker 2>The structure of that being through </v>
<v Speaker 2>which the the entirety of being itself </v>

278
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 2>is interpreted and you need the </v>
<v Speaker 2>surround.</v>

279
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.700
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize that is something that </v>

280
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.020
<v Speaker 2>knows that's the knower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it knows,</v>

281
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the interpretive structure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that which needs to be known or you </v>

282
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:25.151
<v Speaker 2>could come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could conceptualize that as the </v>

283
00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:27.790
<v Speaker 2>individual in explored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nested inside unexplored territory.</v>

284
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.480
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can think about it as the </v>

285
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.241
<v Speaker 2>individual inside culture and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual culture has nested inside </v>

286
00:15:37.241 --> 00:15:42.191
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of looking at it or </v>

287
00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:44.201
<v Speaker 2>you can think of it as the knower and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order surrounded by chaos.</v>

288
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all these things,</v>

289
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all attempts to articulate the </v>

290
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.821
<v Speaker 2>same underlying structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that in narratives continually </v>

291
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 2>and I think Pinocchio is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of that because in Pinocchio you</v>

292
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:02.861
<v Speaker 2>have the culture that's Japan and Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>always obviously creative,</v>

293
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:08.501
<v Speaker 2>but also insufficient and dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why he ends up in the belly of </v>

294
00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:12.311
<v Speaker 2>the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the blue fairy who's whose </v>

295
00:16:12.311 --> 00:16:12.311
<v Speaker 2>mother nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For all intents and purposes,</v>

296
00:16:12.311 --> 00:16:16.961
<v Speaker 2>the negative feminine doesn't Manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>Itself Much in a Pinocchio story except </v>

297
00:16:16.961 --> 00:16:19.550
<v Speaker 2>implicitly in the form of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing at the bottom,</v>

298
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:24.551
<v Speaker 2>the which is more like the dragon of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos than something feminine that </v>

299
00:16:24.551 --> 00:16:28.121
<v Speaker 2>swallows up the the swallows up culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have nature or culture,</v>

300
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

301
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:34.811
<v Speaker 2>the blue fairy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the puppet Pinocchio and you </v>

302
00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 2>know from a strictly scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

303
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:41.741
<v Speaker 2>we think of human beings as nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>the children of nature and culture and </v>

304
00:16:41.741 --> 00:16:43.930
<v Speaker 2>that pushes you towards a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>deterministic view.</v>

305
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 2>What causes your behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

306
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:47.780
<v Speaker 2>it's either nature or culture because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't anything else,</v>

307
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:53.140
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't how the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>story lays itself out because it says </v>

308
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.411
<v Speaker 2>there is something else and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever your consciousness is and that </v>

309
00:16:56.411 --> 00:17:00.101
<v Speaker 2>consciousness seems to be able to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>with nature and culture in a non </v>

310
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:04.181
<v Speaker 2>deterministic manner in order to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>well in order for what?</v>

311
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.410
<v Speaker 2>In order to bring itself forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

312
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:14.411
<v Speaker 2>and that's really what's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that I think is that it isn't </v>

313
00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:18.490
<v Speaker 2>obviously just the plot of Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's virtually the plot of any story is </v>

314
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.490
<v Speaker 2>the story of the development of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

315
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Now the story is order chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher order,</v>

316
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.770
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can get variance of that.</v>

317
00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:32.771
<v Speaker 2>You can get order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collapses into disorder and nothing is </v>

318
00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:34.160
<v Speaker 2>resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a tragedy,</v>

319
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.790
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and you can get so,</v>

320
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.780
<v Speaker 2>so you don't have to have the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>story represented in this story,</v>

321
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:45.200
<v Speaker 2>but you get fragments of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a classic you shaped story and what</v>

322
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:50.201
<v Speaker 2>it is is the story of the development of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual across time as a </v>

323
00:17:50.201 --> 00:17:53.960
<v Speaker 2>consequence of his or her adventures in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and space and every story is </v>

324
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.941
<v Speaker 2>exactly that and those are </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of the manner in which </v>

325
00:17:58.941 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 2>you come to be in the world for better </v>
<v Speaker 2>or for worse.</v>

326
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.550
<v Speaker 2>It's differentiated so the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a negative and a pause.</v>

327
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Development and culture has a negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a positive element to nature does as</v>

328
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:13.980
<v Speaker 2>well and that makes the potential for </v>
<v Speaker 2>plots much broader.</v>

329
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:19.550
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's also very useful to </v>

330
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.400
<v Speaker 2>know that entire story because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that protects you</v>

331
00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 2>against ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

332
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if someone tells you a political</v>

333
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 2>story or a story of any sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can always ask,</v>

334
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are the missing characters?</v>

335
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've erected a culture that's </v>

336
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:33.910
<v Speaker 2>destroying the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nature has been,</v>

337
00:18:33.911 --> 00:18:36.990
<v Speaker 2>if you know benevolent and and pristine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

338
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:37.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>

339
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're missing half the characters </v>

340
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.950
<v Speaker 2>because humans aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't just terrible.</v>

341
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Rip Patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures and culture is not just a </v>

342
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.480
<v Speaker 2>destructive force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nature is by no means on our side.</v>

343
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 2>So where's the missing characters?</v>

344
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 2>You need all of the characters in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation to get it right.</v>

345
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 2>And I really believe this to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

346
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 2>if you want to protect yourself against </v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma,</v>

347
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:04.490
<v Speaker 2>as you move forward in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be very aware of the three,</v>

348
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:09.520
<v Speaker 2>three negative characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to know that the human </v>

349
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.280
<v Speaker 2>individual has an adversarial element </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's malevolent right to the core.</v>

350
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't know that and you will </v>
<v Speaker 2>run across someone who's malevolent,</v>

351
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.760
<v Speaker 2>you will end up damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because first you won't build it,</v>

352
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.770
<v Speaker 2>defend yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll just be like a ripe fruit tree </v>

353
00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:23.770
<v Speaker 2>for the plucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>

354
00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.830
<v Speaker 2>the mere existence of someone like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will pose such a threat to the way that </v>

355
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 2>you've organized the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it might collapse on you,</v>

356
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.640
<v Speaker 2>that happens to people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it really matters whether you know </v>

357
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.280
<v Speaker 2>these categories and it matters that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

358
00:19:35.281 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 2>that culture can become tyrannical.</v>

359
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.020
<v Speaker 2>It really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that it's also your father that's </v>

360
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.020
<v Speaker 2>given you everything and it matters that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.910
<v Speaker 2>everything good comes from nature and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we need to live in harmony with </v>

362
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.971
<v Speaker 2>nature to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that it's also held band on our </v>

363
00:19:49.971 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 2>destruction every second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very paradoxical.</v>

364
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a hard thing to reconcile with,</v>

365
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

366
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:55.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

367
00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:00.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thought structure like modern science </v>

368
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.871
<v Speaker 2>that's based on a strict logic that </v>
<v Speaker 2>always says something can't be itself </v>

369
00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 2>and its opposite at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

370
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:08.820
<v Speaker 2>human beings can certainly be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's opposite the at the same time.</v>

371
00:20:08.821 --> 00:20:12.620
<v Speaker 2>And anything truly complex can have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and does have that bench.</v>

372
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Or if someone offers you a new job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

373
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:16.200
<v Speaker 2>well that's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

374
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:17.010
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

375
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.940
<v Speaker 2>It's positive and negative and complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be the solution to your </v>

376
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:26.871
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same set time it's going to </v>

377
00:20:26.871 --> 00:20:26.871
<v Speaker 2>generate a whole host of other problems.</v>

378
00:20:26.871 --> 00:20:28.260
<v Speaker 2>So lots of times we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

379
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.320
<v Speaker 2>we're encountering entities in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that have internally paradoxical </v>

380
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.390
<v Speaker 2>structure and we have to deal with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire set of paradoxes or,</v>

381
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.450
<v Speaker 2>or we don't survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really a matter of survival.</v>

382
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

383
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.320
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

384
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.450
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this overarching symbol which is</v>

385
00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:50.451
<v Speaker 2>the dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is potential itself and it's the </v>

386
00:20:50.451 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 2>potential from which all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories emerge.</v>

387
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.150
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

388
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.830
<v Speaker 2>the most abstract category of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination is that which is beyond our </v>

389
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.990
<v Speaker 2>understanding the category of that which</v>
<v Speaker 2>is beyond our understanding.</v>

390
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:07.230
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to me to be represented </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we can only use the </v>

391
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.590
<v Speaker 2>representational structures that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved,</v>

392
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:13.950
<v Speaker 2>is that it's represented in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradoxical representation of the </v>

393
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Predator and the treasure that lies </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the perimeter.</v>

394
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 2>That perimeter perimeters of our safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies.</v>

395
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 2>So what's out there beyond?</v>

396
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know,</v>

397
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Speaker 2>but we need to know because we need </v>
<v Speaker 2>always to deal with what we don't know.</v>

398
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:32.670
<v Speaker 2>So weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to come up with a category of </v>

399
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.041
<v Speaker 2>what we don't know in order to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>formalizing a theory about how we might </v>

400
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.150
<v Speaker 2>progress towards it and interact with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

401
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 2>It's very paradoxical idea and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>paradoxical answer,</v>

402
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:41.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

403
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:46.501
<v Speaker 2>it's the terrible Predator that lurks in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknown that also harbor is </v>

404
00:21:46.501 --> 00:21:47.170
<v Speaker 2>something of great value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

405
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

406
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

407
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.680
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that is a reflection of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that human beings are Predator </v>

408
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.190
<v Speaker 2>animals and prey animals at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

409
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.460
<v Speaker 2>So what's out there in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the terrible darkness,</v>

410
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 2>something that can destroy you but also </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you absolutely need.</v>

411
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.530
<v Speaker 2>So how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you prepare yourself for that?</v>

412
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 2>And that's the ultimate question of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

413
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not how do you deal with death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although death is a sub component of the</v>

414
00:22:13.901 --> 00:22:18.901
<v Speaker 2>terrible unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's how do you deal with </v>

415
00:22:18.901 --> 00:22:21.541
<v Speaker 2>that which is beyond your understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is constantly manifesting itself </v>

416
00:22:21.541 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 2>in the world and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that manifests itself every time you</v>

417
00:22:24.431 --> 00:22:27.040
<v Speaker 2>categorize something and the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>escapes from the category.</v>

418
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.150
<v Speaker 2>And that happens most in interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships because people are so damn</v>

419
00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:32.710
<v Speaker 2>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get them figured out,</v>

420
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.740
<v Speaker 2>boxed in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you even make a contract that neither </v>

421
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:37.740
<v Speaker 2>review,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll jump outside the box,</v>

422
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 2>but you jump outside the box </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually.</v>

423
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's why a relationship requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>constant negotiation and </v>

424
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.331
<v Speaker 2>reconceptualization because you do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhaust the person with your perceptual </v>

425
00:22:48.331 --> 00:22:53.161
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course you don't exhaust the </v>

426
00:22:53.161 --> 00:22:53.161
<v Speaker 2>world with your perceptual categories </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

427
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.530
<v Speaker 2>This is partly why the existentialists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this concept called </v>

428
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.461
<v Speaker 2>alienation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea was that human beings </v>

429
00:23:02.461 --> 00:23:02.461
<v Speaker 2>become alienated from their creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>products.</v>

430
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is,</v>

431
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.940
<v Speaker 2>and here's why it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine a Henry Ford makes the </v>

432
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 2>assembly line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

433
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 2>So for it has no idea what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen when he makes the assembly line,</v>

434
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.510
<v Speaker 2>like because he's just trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a fast way to make cars or he thinks</v>

435
00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:21.511
<v Speaker 2>that what he's making his cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he thinks he's making an assembly </v>

436
00:23:21.511 --> 00:23:22.150
<v Speaker 2>line for cars and he thinks he's making </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

437
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.500
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

438
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

439
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:27.400
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assembly line absolutely transformed</v>

440
00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 2>the entire planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

441
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it brought in the era of mass cheap </v>

442
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.420
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it just,</v>

443
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.080
<v Speaker 2>it was way more than he thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then did he make a car?</v>

444
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a car is something that hypothetically </v>

445
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 2>takes you relatively effectively from </v>
<v Speaker 2>point a to b.</v>

446
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 2>It was really a replacement for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horse and buggy.</v>

447
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the first cars looked like </v>

448
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:53.770
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were horseless carriages.</v>

449
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he make a car?</v>

450
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is God.</v>

451
00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:59.951
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell what Henry Ford made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made a very effective way for </v>

452
00:23:59.951 --> 00:24:01.430
<v Speaker 2>transforming the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

453
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:06.431
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that it also happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take you from point a to point b might </v>

454
00:24:06.431 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 2>be completely irrelevant compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that it was the internal combustion</v>

455
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:12.900
<v Speaker 2>engine and its rapid distribution </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely changed the constituent,</v>

456
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:13.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

457
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:18.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental chemical structure of </v>

458
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It completely transformed cities.</v>

459
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 2>It blew out the rural community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone moved to the cities,</v>

460
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:27.881
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made all the cities built around the </v>

461
00:24:27.881 --> 00:24:30.851
<v Speaker 2>automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then it had this tremendous </v>

462
00:24:30.851 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 2>political and economic significance too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

463
00:24:31.131 --> 00:24:32.900
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

464
00:24:32.901 --> 00:24:36.830
<v Speaker 2>well is a car is a way to get from point</v>
<v Speaker 2>a to point b,</v>

465
00:24:36.831 --> 00:24:37.520
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

466
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 2>it's not a machine.</v>

467
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.470
<v Speaker 2>It's also the embodiment of an idea and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very strange idea.</v>

468
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.620
<v Speaker 2>A collectivist society would have never </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented the car because the car is </v>

469
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.800
<v Speaker 2>predicated on the idea that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>own a conveyance that would get only you</v>

470
00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 2>and only you from somewhere to somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>else without ever asking anybody for any</v>

471
00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.360
<v Speaker 2>permission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the funny thing is is when you </v>

472
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.361
<v Speaker 2>build something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those presuppositions are built into it </v>

473
00:25:04.361 --> 00:25:05.750
<v Speaker 2>and then when you export that say to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Russia,</v>

474
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:10.990
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't just take the car and leave </v>

475
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.870
<v Speaker 2>the political implications behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

476
00:25:11.871 --> 00:25:16.871
<v Speaker 2>The mere fact that you step into one and</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive it is an indication that you're </v>

477
00:25:16.871 --> 00:25:21.521
<v Speaker 2>accepting the political ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions that are part of the </v>

478
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:25.640
<v Speaker 2>fact that that thing even exists and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's alienation.</v>

479
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:30.641
<v Speaker 2>It's like even something you make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think what you have control over </v>

480
00:25:30.641 --> 00:25:32.090
<v Speaker 2>what you make because you've made it.</v>

481
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:33.320
<v Speaker 2>You understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

482
00:25:33.321 --> 00:25:33.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

483
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:39.130
<v Speaker 2>You understand a tiny fraction of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You launch it out in the world man and </v>

484
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 2>the snakes inside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hydras and high inside of it </v>

485
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.290
<v Speaker 2>multiply their heads massively </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly and you and you and you can't</v>

486
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:47.360
<v Speaker 2>really keep track of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

487
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.560
<v Speaker 2>so even even in your relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>created entities,</v>

488
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:55.700
<v Speaker 2>you still see the reemergence of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying fundamental substructure,</v>

489
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even inside it's the,</v>

490
00:25:57.741 --> 00:26:02.741
<v Speaker 2>it's the garden of Eden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always a snake inside the thing </v>

491
00:26:02.741 --> 00:26:02.741
<v Speaker 2>that's walled in always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

492
00:26:02.741 --> 00:26:07.631
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even God himself could not get rid of </v>

493
00:26:07.631 --> 00:26:08.060
<v Speaker 2>the snakes in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And partly what that means is that,</v>

494
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.640
<v Speaker 2>you know the garden is a conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

495
00:26:10.641 --> 00:26:13.580
<v Speaker 2>It's the conceptual system within which </v>
<v Speaker 2>people exist.</v>

496
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:16.040
<v Speaker 2>That's Eden is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a walled garden.</v>

497
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Paradise means walled garden and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>walled because a walled garden is where </v>

498
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.570
<v Speaker 2>people live because the wall is culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the garden is nature natured.</v>

499
00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:27.380
<v Speaker 2>We always lived in a structure that said</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amalgam of nature and culture,</v>

500
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.220
<v Speaker 2>so we set it up so it's paradisical as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as we're unconscious,</v>

501
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:36.340
<v Speaker 2>but we can't manage it because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>always something chaotic that's coming </v>

502
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.430
<v Speaker 2>in that we will interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's human beings.</v>

503
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:42.730
<v Speaker 2>You put a snake in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the first bloody thing we're going </v>

504
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:42.730
<v Speaker 2>to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for better or worse,</v>

505
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 2>it makes us conscious and awake.</v>

506
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 3>It makes us aware of our mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does all sorts of terrible things to </v>

507
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter because that's,</v>

508
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.190
<v Speaker 3>that's the path that human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 3>what chosen,</v>

509
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.680
<v Speaker 3>because that's the implication in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>story and it's,</v>

510
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.700
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very difficult thing to answer </v>

511
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.551
<v Speaker 3>because we certainly choose each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>for self awareness and consciousness and</v>

512
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:07.740
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if you're,</v>

513
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Speaker 3>if you're choosing a mate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an arms race in human beings.</v>

514
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:17.241
<v Speaker 3>We're choosing intelligent mates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially that's especially the case </v>

515
00:27:17.241 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 3>for women in relationship to men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

516
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

517
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 3>the idea that that's a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

518
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:27.201
<v Speaker 3>that's partly why it's eve that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>out himself conscious in the garden of </v>

519
00:27:27.201 --> 00:27:27.201
<v Speaker 3>Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

520
00:27:27.201 --> 00:27:30.621
<v Speaker 3>She offers him the apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's the one that makes him self </v>

521
00:27:30.621 --> 00:27:33.321
<v Speaker 3>conscious and I think that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate because the evidence from the </v>

522
00:27:33.321 --> 00:27:36.861
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary biologist is that human </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual female sexual selection was what </v>

523
00:27:36.861 --> 00:27:39.270
<v Speaker 3>are the driving factors that </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiate us from chimpanzees.</v>

524
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:44.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a major factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chimpanzee females are not selective </v>

525
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 3>maters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go into estrus,</v>

526
00:27:45.451 --> 00:27:50.451
<v Speaker 3>they'll mate with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens is the dominant males </v>

527
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 3>chased the subordinate males away and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they end up leaving more offspring,</v>

528
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:57.441
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a consequence of selection </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the part of the females in human </v>

529
00:27:57.441 --> 00:27:57.441
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's completely different.</v>

530
00:27:57.441 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Concealed ovulation and intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>selection pressure from women on men.</v>

531
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.680
<v Speaker 3>You have twice as many female ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you have male ancestors and people </v>

532
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.670
<v Speaker 3>could never have have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 3>working that out arithmetically,</v>

533
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:11.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just think on average,</v>

534
00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:15.870
<v Speaker 3>every woman had one child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half of men had none,</v>

535
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:20.871
<v Speaker 3>and the other half had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's approximately correct if you </v>

536
00:28:20.871 --> 00:28:23.610
<v Speaker 3>average across the entire history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human sexuality.</v>

537
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 3>So human males in particular are subject</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a vicious selection,</v>

538
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:32.661
<v Speaker 3>pressure on the part of females,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I also think that's partly why </v>

539
00:28:32.661 --> 00:28:36.530
<v Speaker 3>nature is represented symbolically as </v>
<v Speaker 3>female among human beings,</v>

540
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:39.660
<v Speaker 3>because after all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature is what selects.</v>

541
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.660
<v Speaker 3>There's no better definition of nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>then that which selects so now.</v>

542
00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:47.430
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's,</v>

543
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.500
<v Speaker 3>here's why I want to talk to you about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain a little bit,</v>

544
00:28:49.501 --> 00:28:54.501
<v Speaker 3>because if you make the radical case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that these are actually the </v>

545
00:28:54.501 --> 00:28:56.520
<v Speaker 3>categories of reality and we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

546
00:28:56.521 --> 00:28:57.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality is what?</v>

547
00:28:57.571 --> 00:28:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Select for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the sake of,</v>

548
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 3>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the sake of argument,</v>

549
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:06.860
<v Speaker 3>then the than our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our neurological structures and our </v>

550
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.880
<v Speaker 3>physical structure should be adapted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that reality.</v>

551
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:09.540
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

552
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.360
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a necessary conclusion from that.</v>

553
00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:13.830
<v Speaker 3>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

554
00:29:13.831 --> 00:29:15.960
<v Speaker 3>are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as far as I can tell,</v>

555
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 3>the answer to that is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we'll,</v>

556
00:29:18.391 --> 00:29:23.391
<v Speaker 3>we'll go through the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neuropsychological evidence quite </v>

557
00:29:23.391 --> 00:29:27.590
<v Speaker 3>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first bit of evidence is that you </v>

558
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.590
<v Speaker 3>have two hemispheres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

559
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:33.710
<v Speaker 3>One deals with the unknown and the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>deals with the known that sale Conan </v>

560
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Goldberg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

561
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:38.150
<v Speaker 3>that's hypothesized completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>independently of any of this underlying </v>

562
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.211
<v Speaker 3>mythological substructure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really important thing to note </v>

563
00:29:41.211 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 3>because if you're trying to determine </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether</v>

564
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.260
<v Speaker 2>or not something is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>valid,</v>

565
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 2>if the constructs upon which you base </v>
<v Speaker 2>your thinking are valid and true,</v>

566
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:54.330
<v Speaker 2>there's rules for doing that and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules is you have to be able to </v>

567
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.680
<v Speaker 2>detect the existence of the categories </v>
<v Speaker 2>using multiple methods of,</v>

568
00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.680
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

569
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.880
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what using multiple methods.</v>

570
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.540
<v Speaker 2>It's the multi-method multitrack Matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technically speaking,</v>

571
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.770
<v Speaker 2>it was established as a technique by two</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists named crone,</v>

575
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:21.061
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to figure out how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine if something actually has an </v>

576
00:30:21.061 --> 00:30:24.301
<v Speaker 2>existence like anger or anxiety as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you could study </v>

577
00:30:24.301 --> 00:30:24.430
<v Speaker 2>scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

578
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:29.431
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to measure it </v>

579
00:30:29.431 --> 00:30:30.610
<v Speaker 2>multiple ways and all those measurements</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to read the same way.</v>

580
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

581
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by multiple ways?</v>

582
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Because his sight and vision is sight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hearing different.</v>

583
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.500
<v Speaker 2>While somewhat and somewhat the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

584
00:30:41.501 --> 00:30:46.501
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make them as different as you can </v>

585
00:30:46.501 --> 00:30:46.501
<v Speaker 2>manage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

586
00:30:46.501 --> 00:30:46.660
<v Speaker 2>and our sensory systems are quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

587
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecular signature,</v>

588
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.540
<v Speaker 2>sound is auditory are you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>auditory pressure,</v>

589
00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 2>you need a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gas around you or some liquid in order</v>

590
00:30:55.601 --> 00:30:57.700
<v Speaker 2>for that to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Site uses light,</v>

591
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:57.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

592
00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:01.960
<v Speaker 2>we're using different inputs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>converge and allow us to say,</v>

593
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:06.961
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we get convergent information across </v>

594
00:31:06.961 --> 00:31:08.881
<v Speaker 2>these multiple measurements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll assume that the thing we're </v>

595
00:31:08.881 --> 00:31:11.730
<v Speaker 2>perceiving is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We even extend that in science because </v>

596
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.121
<v Speaker 2>we say if you take your multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurement system and you take your </v>

597
00:31:15.121 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 2>multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple measurement system and then you</v>

598
00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:21.451
<v Speaker 2>compare them will only allow what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>constant across both those comparisons </v>

599
00:31:21.451 --> 00:31:25.651
<v Speaker 2>to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the multi-method multi </v>

600
00:31:25.651 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 2>trade matrix process essentially.</v>

601
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:31.470
<v Speaker 2>And my sense is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that the pattern that I'm </v>

602
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.360
<v Speaker 2>describing to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's manifested itself evolutionarily.</v>

603
00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:39.361
<v Speaker 2>It manifests itself at the mural in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>literal logical space and it manifests </v>

604
00:31:39.361 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 2>itself in the conceptual space and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability of all three of those things</v>

605
00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:46.240
<v Speaker 2>happening at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without there being something valid,</v>

606
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:51.241
<v Speaker 2>there is lessons with each level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation you manage to stack on </v>

607
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:53.350
<v Speaker 2>top of one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the,</v>

608
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 2>that's the method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

609
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:58.720
<v Speaker 2>so let's think about the brain a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit and I'll tell you a little bit about</v>

610
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:03.721
<v Speaker 2>how the brain works and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

611
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:07.300
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this stuff I'm telling you </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now is quite old.</v>

612
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it was,</v>

613
00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:10.900
<v Speaker 2>worked out in the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 eighties,</v>

614
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's been remarkably stable as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I can tell.</v>

615
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:16.930
<v Speaker 2>In some sense we're filling in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>details and not in every sense,</v>

616
00:32:16.931 --> 00:32:19.210
<v Speaker 2>but in some sense we're filling in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>details.</v>

617
00:32:19.211 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you take,</v>

618
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.160
<v Speaker 2>this is from Alexander Luria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the,</v>

619
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.200
<v Speaker 2>the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the greatest neuropsychologist </v>

620
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:28.270
<v Speaker 2>who ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a Russian,</v>

621
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.780
<v Speaker 2>a more work mostly after the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>world war,</v>

622
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:35.810
<v Speaker 2>mostly on people who had brain damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was interested in trying to </v>

623
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.810
<v Speaker 2>outline the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

624
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

625
00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overarching picture of</v>

626
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.130
<v Speaker 3>brain function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he did that partly by looking at </v>

627
00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:48.671
<v Speaker 3>its function,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also partly by looking at its </v>

628
00:32:48.671 --> 00:32:50.651
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get both of those things </v>

629
00:32:50.651 --> 00:32:50.651
<v Speaker 3>working simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we'll,</v>

630
00:32:50.651 --> 00:32:52.640
<v Speaker 3>we'll go through a brief picture of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain works.</v>

631
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:57.641
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the ways of so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can look at the brain from front to </v>

632
00:32:57.641 --> 00:33:02.381
<v Speaker 3>back and you can divided roughly into </v>
<v Speaker 3>two sections and one section has to do </v>

633
00:33:02.381 --> 00:33:06.131
<v Speaker 3>with sensory processing and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly the back half and one section </v>

634
00:33:06.131 --> 00:33:09.731
<v Speaker 3>has to do with motor output.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now those things aren't as clearly </v>

635
00:33:09.731 --> 00:33:11.610
<v Speaker 3>differentiated as you might think </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you.</v>

636
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 3>There's very little sensation without </v>
<v Speaker 3>motor output.</v>

637
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the part that closest to an exception is</v>

638
00:33:18.471 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 3>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>

639
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 3>But you at least have to breathe in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

640
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:24.320
<v Speaker 3>and when an animal is actively searching</v>
<v Speaker 3>out a scent trail,</v>

641
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:25.070
<v Speaker 3>it's breathing in.</v>

642
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:30.070
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's using its motor output constantly </v>

643
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.471
<v Speaker 3>to modify the sensory stream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really difficult to dissociate the </v>

644
00:33:32.471 --> 00:33:32.720
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're looking at something you</v>

645
00:33:32.721 --> 00:33:37.721
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of feels to you like you're a </v>

646
00:33:37.721 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 3>passive recipient of sense data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're no such thing.</v>

647
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Your eyes are moving back and forth in </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple ways all the time,</v>

648
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.130
<v Speaker 3>including the ways that you can control </v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily.</v>

649
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:51.160
<v Speaker 3>So there's multiple involuntary systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are moving your eyes in multiple </v>

650
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.461
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really what you're doing is feeling </v>

651
00:33:54.461 --> 00:33:54.461
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the array of,</v>

652
00:33:54.461 --> 00:33:58.990
<v Speaker 3>of electromagnetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the electromagnetic spectrum with </v>

653
00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:02.021
<v Speaker 3>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're feeling it and you're actively </v>

654
00:34:02.021 --> 00:34:04.331
<v Speaker 3>exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not a passive recipient at </v>

655
00:34:04.331 --> 00:34:04.580
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even in sensation,</v>

656
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.760
<v Speaker 3>you can't purely pull sensation out for </v>
<v Speaker 3>motor processing and say I'm getting </v>

657
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:15.011
<v Speaker 3>untrammeled unbiased sense data because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't look at something without </v>

658
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 3>focusing and you can't focus without </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to look at something.</v>

659
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.460
<v Speaker 3>You can't just lie there with you while </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

660
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:24.590
<v Speaker 3>with your eyes have crossed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

661
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:29.740
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine you dropped a video recorder </v>

662
00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.030
<v Speaker 3>from an airplane and it just spun around</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an unfocused manner.</v>

663
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the world sampled randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

664
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.530
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you gonna do with that?</v>

665
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

666
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:39.800
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're concentrating on the,</v>

667
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:44.890
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the auditory stream constantly and </v>

668
00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:46.280
<v Speaker 3>segregating out some things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppressing others.</v>

669
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Like if you listen in the classroom,</v>

670
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:51.660
<v Speaker 4>you can hear</v>

671
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:58.180
<v Speaker 3>probably four or five different types of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanical noise going on at the same </v>

672
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.231
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time in the classroom that </v>

673
00:35:02.231 --> 00:35:05.671
<v Speaker 3>silent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't hear it like you don't hear </v>

674
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:05.671
<v Speaker 3>your fridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except when it turns on or off,</v>

675
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:06.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Zero that out.</v>

676
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.200
<v Speaker 3>And so you're very selective in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception.</v>

677
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.780
<v Speaker 3>So you can't really technically separate</v>
<v Speaker 3>out motor output from sensory input.</v>

678
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:19.781
<v Speaker 3>And that's really useful to know because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it destroys the idea that you're just a </v>

679
00:35:19.781 --> 00:35:24.420
<v Speaker 3>pat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that there's a world of </v>

680
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.051
<v Speaker 3>sensation out there that's imprinting </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself on you and that's how you get </v>

681
00:35:26.051 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 3>your information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really the.</v>

682
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:31.550
<v Speaker 3>That's the fundamental presupposition of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the empiricists of the raw empiricists.</v>

683
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.850
<v Speaker 3>There's a world of sense data out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sample it randomly and that's what </v>

684
00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:36.850
<v Speaker 3>informs you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

685
00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:41.141
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except that you're always an active </v>

686
00:35:41.141 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 3>harvester of the information so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get rid of the interpretive </v>

687
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 3>structure a priority.</v>

688
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.890
<v Speaker 3>That was a manual count by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who first established out in his </v>

689
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.311
<v Speaker 3>critique of pure reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't get away from the fact that </v>

690
00:35:52.311 --> 00:35:53.550
<v Speaker 3>you're actively harvesting the data so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>

691
00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where does human structure come from?</v>

692
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.780
<v Speaker 3>The census data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of the blank slate idea.</v>

693
00:35:57.781 --> 00:36:02.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like no wrong because a blank slate</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot process information.</v>

694
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.220
<v Speaker 3>You're actively engaged right at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

695
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.370
<v Speaker 3>so that's another example of the knower </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the unknown,</v>

696
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working in a cyclical manner because you</v>

697
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:16.960
<v Speaker 3>interact with something you divided up </v>
<v Speaker 3>into you,</v>

698
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:21.990
<v Speaker 3>you and the world roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean you really make it that way </v>

699
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 3>because you build yourself out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and then of course that </v>

700
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:28.611
<v Speaker 3>makes you a more differentiated </v>
<v Speaker 3>processor with a broader range of </v>

701
00:36:28.611 --> 00:36:29.130
<v Speaker 3>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you interact with the unknown.</v>

702
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:34.131
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gather more information at </v>

703
00:36:34.131 --> 00:36:34.131
<v Speaker 3>differentiates the world.</v>

704
00:36:34.131 --> 00:36:37.430
<v Speaker 3>It makes you a more differentiated </v>
<v Speaker 3>harvester and then so it's just </v>

705
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 3>continually cycling and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

706
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:43.941
<v Speaker 3>the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the knower is that thing that's doing </v>

707
00:36:43.941 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 3>that harvesting and you can never say </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not there.</v>

708
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.410
<v Speaker 3>Now what happens is that it's in it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nascent form to begin with,</v>

709
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.160
<v Speaker 3>low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nascent for low resolution knower,</v>

710
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.910
<v Speaker 3>low resolution category system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low resolution world,</v>

711
00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.360
<v Speaker 3>but that's enough to kick it and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start a differentiated and that happens </v>

712
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.400
<v Speaker 3>as you develop as an individual because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you start out as a single celled </v>

713
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:12.411
<v Speaker 3>organism for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very low resolution thing in a very </v>

714
00:37:12.411 --> 00:37:16.791
<v Speaker 3>low resolution world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that differentiates itself across </v>

715
00:37:16.791 --> 00:37:16.860
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But exactly the same thing happened over</v>

716
00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

717
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 3>so there isn't a time when those three </v>
<v Speaker 3>elements aren't there.</v>

718
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.040
<v Speaker 3>For all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're always there.</v>

719
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.270
<v Speaker 3>They're permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

720
00:37:27.271 --> 00:37:28.740
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the brain,</v>

721
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.080
<v Speaker 3>since century unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

722
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.370
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

723
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 3>the back half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

724
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 3>huge chunk of that is devoted to visual </v>
<v Speaker 3>processing in human beings,</v>

725
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:38.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

726
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Most animals organized around smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not us,</v>

727
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:46.550
<v Speaker 3>somewhat stale because smell is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful evoker of memories and it has a</v>

728
00:37:47.281 --> 00:37:52.281
<v Speaker 3>direct relationship with emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems because you need to know if </v>

729
00:37:52.281 --> 00:37:53.400
<v Speaker 3>something is edible or inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible or,</v>

730
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.260
<v Speaker 3>or good very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>

731
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.600
<v Speaker 3>But human beings are organized around </v>
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>

732
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.380
<v Speaker 3>So we have a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive amounts of our cortex devoted to</v>

733
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:05.130
<v Speaker 3>differentiated visual processing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the motor unit,</v>

734
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 3>so what you have is each of these little</v>
<v Speaker 3>zones here.</v>

735
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.130
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the back here,</v>

736
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.480
<v Speaker 3>that's the primary visual area and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>secondary visual area.</v>

737
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.840
<v Speaker 3>And then this is the primary auditory </v>
<v Speaker 3>area in the middle of the brain here on </v>

738
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.110
<v Speaker 3>the outside and the secondary auditory </v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

739
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.150
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

740
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.710
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

741
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.670
<v Speaker 3>this is for body representation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the primary area and the secondary area.</v>

742
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:33.570
<v Speaker 3>And you can think about those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those areas of primary,</v>

743
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:34.770
<v Speaker 3>primary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secondary,</v>

744
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 3>and then tertiary</v>

745
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.980
<v Speaker 2>primary does the base level processing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tertiary expands that up into more </v>

746
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:45.571
<v Speaker 2>abstract representate or secondary </v>
<v Speaker 2>expands that up into more abstract </v>

747
00:38:45.571 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 2>representations and tertiary are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas where the sensors come together.</v>

748
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what you seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>most conscious of,</v>

749
00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:57.140
<v Speaker 2>right action in the tertiary areas </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't really see the world </v>

750
00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:01.651
<v Speaker 2>as a separate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think about the auditory stream </v>

751
00:39:01.651 --> 00:39:02.050
<v Speaker 2>separate from the visual stream and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

752
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 2>and you can think about touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>separately,</v>

753
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:06.880
<v Speaker 2>but you attended it consciously </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced things as a unity,</v>

754
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 2>as a comprehensive unity of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>senses simultaneously,</v>

755
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:17.080
<v Speaker 2>so consciousness seems to occur only at </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time at the highest level of</v>

756
00:39:17.081 --> 00:39:22.081
<v Speaker 2>integration and you would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated consciousness more with the </v>

757
00:39:22.081 --> 00:39:25.561
<v Speaker 2>tertiary areas where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the senses are talking to one </v>

758
00:39:25.561 --> 00:39:28.771
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's more complicated than that </v>

759
00:39:28.771 --> 00:39:30.370
<v Speaker 2>because there's obviously subcortical </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures all the way down to the spine</v>

760
00:39:30.371 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 2>that are involved heavily in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is.</v>

761
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:37.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not merely a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cortical activity,</v>

762
00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:42.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to think that because human </v>

763
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.401
<v Speaker 2>beings have massively expanded cortical </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures and we think of ourselves as </v>

764
00:39:44.401 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 2>the most conscious creatures and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable,</v>

765
00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:50.530
<v Speaker 2>but you can take an awful lot of cortex </v>
<v Speaker 2>off someone and they're still conscious.</v>

766
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.920
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can leave them with almost no brain </v>

767
00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.830
<v Speaker 2>at all and they're still conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we really have a rough time trying to</v>

768
00:39:56.831 --> 00:39:59.800
<v Speaker 2>figure out what consciousness is and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's related to brain structure.</v>

769
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:06.240
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the sensory and the motor </v>

770
00:40:06.521 --> 00:40:08.390
<v Speaker 2>unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the,</v>

771
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 2>the primary unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secondary unit,</v>

772
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 2>and the promoter or the prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cortex,</v>

773
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:16.910
<v Speaker 2>and the prefrontal cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in a huge human beings.</v>

774
00:40:16.911 --> 00:40:21.670
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that it's this primary and </v>
<v Speaker 2>secondary areas that allow you to,</v>

775
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.750
<v Speaker 2>to first of all to act voluntarily and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then two,</v>

776
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.840
<v Speaker 2>and then to play around in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your actions,</v>

777
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like imagine that,</v>

778
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:36.690
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you're a child building </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Legos and you can think with the </v>

779
00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.411
<v Speaker 2>legos without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without really having to think </v>

780
00:40:40.411 --> 00:40:40.411
<v Speaker 2>abstractly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

781
00:40:40.411 --> 00:40:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Because you can play around and build </v>
<v Speaker 2>different sorts of structures and so you</v>

782
00:40:42.191 --> 00:40:47.191
<v Speaker 2>can think at the level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a level of motor output without </v>

783
00:40:47.191 --> 00:40:50.821
<v Speaker 2>having to depend on abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you develop the prefrontal cortex</v>

784
00:40:51.341 --> 00:40:56.341
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which emerged out of the motor and </v>

785
00:40:56.341 --> 00:40:56.341
<v Speaker 2>premotor areas over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution.</v>

786
00:40:56.341 --> 00:40:57.760
<v Speaker 2>So it's a differentiation of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>

787
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 2>So this is dealing with the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is dealing mostly with the real </v>

788
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.110
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but starting to abstract and,</v>

789
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.780
<v Speaker 2>and experiment a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this one,</v>

790
00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.130
<v Speaker 2>this part deals with abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pure and simple.</v>

791
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.590
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

792
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can lift this and then I can play with</v>

793
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:19.831
<v Speaker 2>lifting it and then I can put it aside </v>
<v Speaker 2>and think about it abstractly.</v>

794
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I can think about all the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I might do with it.</v>

795
00:41:22.781 --> 00:41:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

796
00:41:23.171 --> 00:41:24.820
<v Speaker 2>I could throw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can take it apart.</v>

797
00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.370
<v Speaker 2>I could throw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could toss it near,</v>

798
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I could juggle it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could use it as a doorstop,</v>

799
00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could kick it across the room.</v>

800
00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:35.850
<v Speaker 2>And so basically what I'm doing there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using my prefrontal Cortex to </v>

801
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:40.061
<v Speaker 2>generate an abstract representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and then to plot out motor </v>

802
00:41:40.061 --> 00:41:44.111
<v Speaker 2>strategies before implementing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically what abstract </v>

803
00:41:44.111 --> 00:41:45.740
<v Speaker 2>thought is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fundamentally.</v>

804
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:47.060
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

805
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:52.660
<v Speaker 2>it's the hypothesis of abstract action </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the analysis of the outcome and</v>

806
00:41:53.271 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 2>then the implementation into action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that there's something about</v>

807
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:02.771
<v Speaker 2>that that actually defines the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between intelligence and </v>

808
00:42:02.771 --> 00:42:03.890
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness because weirdly </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

809
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the correlation between intelligence and</v>

810
00:42:06.171 --> 00:42:10.820
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No relationship whatsoever.</v>

811
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Which is quite strange because </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people plan and so forth.</v>

812
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:19.931
<v Speaker 2>But I think what it is is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is an indicator of the </v>

813
00:42:19.931 --> 00:42:23.360
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness of abstraction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is an indicator of the</v>

814
00:42:23.361 --> 00:42:26.270
<v Speaker 2>probability of implementation and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>are very,</v>

815
00:42:26.271 --> 00:42:31.271
<v Speaker 2>very different problems and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just go from abstraction to </v>

816
00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 2>implementation because if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to think,</v>

817
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:32.900
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

818
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:38.110
<v Speaker 2>The thinking has to be torn away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the implementation or what you're doing </v>

819
00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:41.810
<v Speaker 2>isn't thinking it's just acting so and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

820
00:42:41.811 --> 00:42:46.811
<v Speaker 2>I think that accounts for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometric independence of those two </v>

821
00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:50.580
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's annoying because you can think up </v>

822
00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:54.461
<v Speaker 2>something that you should do and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't do it because there's no </v>

823
00:42:54.461 --> 00:42:56.570
<v Speaker 2>deterministic causal pathway from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception to the action.</v>

824
00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:01.780
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to take something like </v>

825
00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.070
<v Speaker 2>willpower in order to transform the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction into an implementation and </v>

826
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:10.510
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand that very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to understand the resistance </v>

827
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:13.460
<v Speaker 2>to doing it because Mo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the default position of your body should</v>

828
00:43:13.461 --> 00:43:14.600
<v Speaker 2>be something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

829
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.940
<v Speaker 2>it never do anything except eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:22.400
<v Speaker 2>because doing something requires the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expenditure of energy and resources.</v>

831
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.370
<v Speaker 2>And so unless you have a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationale for it,</v>

832
00:43:25.371 --> 00:43:30.371
<v Speaker 2>you should probably not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the body is sort of intransigent </v>

833
00:43:30.371 --> 00:43:30.550
<v Speaker 2>by nature.</v>

834
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.920
<v Speaker 2>It's an oversimplification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to come up with a good reason </v>

835
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.080
<v Speaker 2>to impella it into motion and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

836
00:43:36.081 --> 00:43:41.081
<v Speaker 2>because you have to pay for action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay for it with energy and </v>

837
00:43:41.081 --> 00:43:45.641
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there should be resistance against </v>

838
00:43:45.641 --> 00:43:45.641
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still annoying.</v>

839
00:43:45.641 --> 00:43:45.800
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

840
00:43:45.801 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 2>so that's one way of thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

841
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.270
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to sense and the world,</v>

842
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:55.280
<v Speaker 2>something to act upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the brain has fundamental </v>

843
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.010
<v Speaker 2>divisions of sensing and acting upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there,</v>

844
00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:02.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a constantly interacting loop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't separate them really anymore </v>

845
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.370
<v Speaker 2>than we are separating them </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptually.</v>

846
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Now on the motor strip</v>

847
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:13.690
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

848
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:21.630
<v Speaker 2>the body is represented and this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered at the Montreal neurological </v>

849
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:22.180
<v Speaker 2>institute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

850
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.460
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

851
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:27.490
<v Speaker 2>when brain surgery was been doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was being done on,</v>

852
00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:30.250
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on people generally who had epilepsy or,</v>

853
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 2>or some other terrible brain illness.</v>

854
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:35.220
<v Speaker 3>You have brain surgery when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>awake,</v>

855
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.890
<v Speaker 3>which is a rather horrifying thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know about.</v>

856
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:43.190
<v Speaker 3>But the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally speaking is so that something </v>

857
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.540
<v Speaker 3>isn't taken out that you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

858
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that happened while </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were having brain surgery done,</v>

859
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:50.700
<v Speaker 3>and this would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

860
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:55.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the exact time between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thirties and the fifties,</v>

861
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:56.800
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

862
00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.600
<v Speaker 3>and I think it was hab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I remember properly,</v>

863
00:45:00.601 --> 00:45:02.910
<v Speaker 3>who was one of Canada's great </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuropsychologists,</v>

864
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:09.040
<v Speaker 3>do brain stimulation while people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>having brain surgery and they could map </v>

865
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.460
<v Speaker 3>out the way the body was represented on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cortical surface.</v>

866
00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 3>And so you imagine there's two </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations.</v>

867
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:17.190
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a sensory representation of your</v>

868
00:45:17.191 --> 00:45:22.191
<v Speaker 3>body on the cortical surface and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a motor representation of your body on </v>

869
00:45:22.191 --> 00:45:23.670
<v Speaker 3>the cortical surface.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are both called.</v>

870
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.190
<v Speaker 3>The representations are called </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

871
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Monkey will either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like the body has been laid out </v>

872
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:30.720
<v Speaker 3>on this strange strip or the strip of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tissue.</v>

873
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 3>You can look up the whole monkey lie </v>
<v Speaker 3>online and see what they're like,</v>

874
00:45:33.421 --> 00:45:38.421
<v Speaker 3>but I'll show you a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sort of stretched out weirdly </v>

875
00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.100
<v Speaker 3>long here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be the motor one.</v>

876
00:45:43.101 --> 00:45:45.290
<v Speaker 3>And then along here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the sensory one.</v>

877
00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:50.560
<v Speaker 3>And you can Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of detect with your own </v>

878
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.360
<v Speaker 3>consciousness how your body is </v>
<v Speaker 3>represented in your brain.</v>

879
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:55.490
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

880
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:59.360
<v Speaker 3>can I get you to stand up if you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn around?</v>

881
00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how many fingers on your back?</v>

882
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.420
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

883
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why low resolution?</v>

884
00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:13.250
<v Speaker 3>He's like a row on his back is like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>low resolution,</v>

885
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.740
<v Speaker 3>a array of pixels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

886
00:46:15.741 --> 00:46:20.741
<v Speaker 3>And so it's virtually impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just don't have enough sensory </v>

887
00:46:20.741 --> 00:46:22.460
<v Speaker 3>tissue on your back to make that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could tell I was pushing,</v>

888
00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.640
<v Speaker 3>but it could have been a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could have been five fingers.</v>

889
00:46:25.641 --> 00:46:30.641
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe your pixel is this big or </v>

890
00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:30.641
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

891
00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:35.260
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I put a finger on your lip like </v>

892
00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:35.360
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

893
00:46:35.361 --> 00:46:38.630
<v Speaker 3>you've got it right now or on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>tongue because your tongue,</v>

894
00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:43.660
<v Speaker 3>there's more sensory representation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your tongue than your entire trunk and </v>

895
00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:43.910
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

896
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:45.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to bite your tongue that,</v>

897
00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to talk.</v>

898
00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.250
<v Speaker 3>You want to really differentiate what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating.</v>

899
00:46:52.251 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Speaker 3>If you're eating fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to eat the bones.</v>

900
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:59.230
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know when your tongue is </v>

901
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:00.470
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably crazily sensitive and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that too,</v>

902
00:47:00.471 --> 00:47:05.471
<v Speaker 3>that if you have a tooth pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your tongue will investigate that area </v>

903
00:47:05.511 --> 00:47:07.180
<v Speaker 3>for like six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

904
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:12.350
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your attention wanes and your tongue is </v>

905
00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:15.731
<v Speaker 3>in there like mapping like mad mapping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that little hole to update your body </v>

906
00:47:15.731 --> 00:47:15.731
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

907
00:47:15.731 --> 00:47:20.651
<v Speaker 3>And it's just this crazy thing that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably well represented.</v>

908
00:47:20.961 --> 00:47:25.961
<v Speaker 3>Set from the sensory perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also from the motor perspective because </v>

909
00:47:25.961 --> 00:47:26.750
<v Speaker 3>you could manipulate your tongue like </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

910
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like a quarter of your motor output</v>
<v Speaker 3>system is devoted to tongue </v>

911
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:34.660
<v Speaker 3>manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

912
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:38.320
<v Speaker 3>And so here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a picture of the homonculus.</v>

913
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.960
<v Speaker 3>This is a motor homunculus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

914
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:45.961
<v Speaker 3>and that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what your brain thinks of your </v>

915
00:47:45.961 --> 00:47:45.961
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's a good way of thinking about</v>

916
00:47:45.961 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what a human being is like</v>

917
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:48.310
<v Speaker 3>in terms of his or her output.</v>

918
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.700
<v Speaker 3>And so what you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at a sensory homonculus,</v>

919
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.890
<v Speaker 3>it's quite similar except the feet are </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>

920
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:58.891
<v Speaker 3>The Genitalia or bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Logically they don't have much motor </v>

921
00:47:58.891 --> 00:47:59.290
<v Speaker 3>utility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have a lot of sensor utility.</v>

922
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.960
<v Speaker 3>But the rest of it's quite similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's,</v>

923
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the motor and the sensory homonculus are</v>

924
00:48:04.121 --> 00:48:09.121
<v Speaker 3>quite similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm going to talk about the motor </v>

925
00:48:09.121 --> 00:48:09.121
<v Speaker 3>homunculus because it's sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>action representation.</v>

926
00:48:09.121 --> 00:48:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what are human beings like?</v>

927
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all hands.</v>

928
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:16.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you,</v>

929
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.940
<v Speaker 3>if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

930
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.900
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievably high resolution and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your fingertips and,</v>

931
00:48:21.901 --> 00:48:22.630
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

932
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.960
<v Speaker 3>and the sensory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we can manipulate our hands like </v>

933
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're unbelievably articulate it.</v>

934
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:34.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing that makes us able </v>

935
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:34.620
<v Speaker 3>to change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes us what dolphins aren't.</v>

936
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:39.780
<v Speaker 3>And so a huge part of our brain is </v>
<v Speaker 3>devoted towards being able to move our </v>

937
00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:39.780
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>

938
00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.280
<v Speaker 3>Now it enables us to take things apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put them together.</v>

939
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.820
<v Speaker 3>And then once we learned to take things </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart and put them together,</v>

940
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.270
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about how we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a lot of what we're doing.</v>

941
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:51.280
<v Speaker 3>And that's the hands in the mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tongue.</v>

942
00:48:51.281 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's how I took something apart.</v>

943
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I made out of it.</v>

944
00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how I did it.</v>

945
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 3>And then you received that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy about it,</v>

946
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:07.770
<v Speaker 3>and then you can do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's imitation facilitated by </v>

947
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

948
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:12.400
<v Speaker 3>here's what I did with my body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm propagating the cross space.</v>

949
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.640
<v Speaker 3>You're taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mapping it onto your body.</v>

950
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:17.530
<v Speaker 3>Now you can do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

951
00:49:17.531 --> 00:49:18.430
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

952
00:49:18.431 --> 00:49:20.950
<v Speaker 3>it might be simple like this is how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick up a rock,</v>

953
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:26.250
<v Speaker 3>but it might be complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like here's how you go after the dragon </v>

954
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:26.250
<v Speaker 3>of chaos.</v>

955
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:30.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's sort of maps onto that </v>

956
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:33.990
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing that we've talked about in </v>

957
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 3>some detail this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're telling a story to people,</v>

958
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:38.080
<v Speaker 3>when you're informing them about </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

959
00:49:38.081 --> 00:49:40.840
<v Speaker 3>you can talk to them at a very high </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of resolution,</v>

960
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:44.740
<v Speaker 3>which you do with your child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's how you slice up some Broccoli,</v>

961
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you move up the obstruction and</v>

962
00:49:47.621 --> 00:49:52.621
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how you act like a civilized </v>

963
00:49:52.621 --> 00:49:52.621
<v Speaker 3>person at the dinner table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

964
00:49:52.621 --> 00:49:54.580
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of being a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can tell stories about,</v>

965
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I just went and saw logan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I really liked.</v>

966
00:49:57.701 --> 00:49:58.750
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super violent,</v>

967
00:49:58.751 --> 00:50:00.660
<v Speaker 3>but I really did like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

968
00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 3>it's got a very elegant mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

969
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:07.810
<v Speaker 3>which is not surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a scene in this logan movie.</v>

970
00:50:07.811 --> 00:50:08.470
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

971
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.160
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

972
00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:14.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not a spoiler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has this child with him who has not </v>

973
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:18.661
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's been raised roughly in the </v>

974
00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:18.760
<v Speaker 3>laboratory and she has absolutely no </v>
<v Speaker 3>table manners.</v>

975
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:23.910
<v Speaker 3>And so they're sitting at the dinner </v>
<v Speaker 3>with some people that they've run into </v>

976
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 3>and she's eating like a total barbarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course everybody's eyebrows race.</v>

977
00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Like where did this person come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

978
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:35.260
<v Speaker 3>the fact that that high order behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't there is something that's of </v>

979
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.990
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary interest to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

980
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you teach your children micro strategies</v>

981
00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:45.881
<v Speaker 3>and you teach the macro strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the macro strategies you're </v>

982
00:50:45.881 --> 00:50:49.121
<v Speaker 3>teaching them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even understand you because </v>

983
00:50:49.121 --> 00:50:52.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the strategies they're built </v>

984
00:50:52.511 --> 00:50:52.511
<v Speaker 3>into you because of an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

985
00:50:52.511 --> 00:50:54.230
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you say things like,</v>

986
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:56.090
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter whether you win or </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose.</v>

987
00:50:56.091 --> 00:50:59.270
<v Speaker 3>It matters how you play the game and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand what that means.</v>

988
00:50:59.271 --> 00:51:04.271
<v Speaker 3>Although you know it's right and you try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to act that out for your children and </v>

989
00:51:04.271 --> 00:51:06.830
<v Speaker 3>they incorporate it in their action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though they can't represent that,</v>

990
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:11.831
<v Speaker 3>they cannot come up with a fully </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulated representation of what that </v>

991
00:51:11.831 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 3>means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they're like children,</v>

992
00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.910
<v Speaker 3>the [inaudible] children.</v>

993
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:20.080
<v Speaker 3>Children can only play by themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 3>begin with while they're integrating </v>

994
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.980
<v Speaker 3>themselves internally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they start to play in parallel with</v>

995
00:51:21.981 --> 00:51:24.290
<v Speaker 3>other children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you'll you're to.</v>

996
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.230
<v Speaker 3>You play your game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That child plays his or her gait,</v>

997
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.960
<v Speaker 3>little interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't unite the games.</v>

998
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Then you're between two and four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start to be able to unite the games </v>

999
00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:36.650
<v Speaker 3>and you can either do that by acting </v>
<v Speaker 3>them out.</v>

1000
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:38.360
<v Speaker 3>You can do this even with a younger </v>
<v Speaker 3>child,</v>

1001
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:43.190
<v Speaker 3>they can catch peekaboo very rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you're between two and four and</v>

1002
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:45.470
<v Speaker 3>you start getting linguistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could start saying,</v>

1003
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:50.471
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's play this game and that means </v>

1004
00:51:50.471 --> 00:51:51.110
<v Speaker 3>we're going to unite our attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards a particular goal.</v>

1005
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:55.610
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna unite our motor activity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe cooperate and compete towards that</v>

1006
00:51:55.611 --> 00:51:58.820
<v Speaker 3>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So beginning of of the social structure,</v>

1007
00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.560
<v Speaker 3>so the beginning of the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

1008
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.440
<v Speaker 3>and you get really good at that between </v>
<v Speaker 3>two and four,</v>

1009
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.140
<v Speaker 3>but you don't necessarily know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>

1010
00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:11.260
<v Speaker 3>You can't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Piaget's experiments indicated that </v>

1011
00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:15.011
<v Speaker 3>if you take children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they've got to the point where </v>

1012
00:52:15.011 --> 00:52:15.170
<v Speaker 3>they can play quite a social game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're five or six,</v>

1013
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:20.260
<v Speaker 3>they're playing marbles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take them out of the game and you </v>

1014
00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:20.260
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1015
00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:20.360
<v Speaker 3>tell me the rules of the game of </v>
<v Speaker 3>marbles.</v>

1016
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:23.690
<v Speaker 3>They give incoherent representations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1017
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Because their behavior is more </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated than their representation.</v>

1018
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.810
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you understand that,</v>

1019
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:33.140
<v Speaker 3>that is a wild thing to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it answers the question.</v>

1020
00:52:33.141 --> 00:52:38.141
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you have dreams that tell you </v>

1021
00:52:38.141 --> 00:52:39.050
<v Speaker 3>things you don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1022
00:52:39.051 --> 00:52:40.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the hell can that possibly be?</v>

1023
00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:45.850
<v Speaker 3>You're coming up with the damn dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can the dream tell you things you </v>

1024
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:46.670
<v Speaker 3>don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or analogously?</v>

1025
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 3>How can people tell stories that contain</v>
<v Speaker 3>information that they don't understand?</v>

1026
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is the information is </v>
<v Speaker 3>coded in our behavior.</v>

1027
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll go back to a chimpanzee troop.</v>

1028
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:00.890
<v Speaker 3>All the chimpanzees in the troop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1029
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:05.950
<v Speaker 3>the dominance hierarchy structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you take a chimpanzee out from </v>

1030
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:08.720
<v Speaker 3>the truth and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the dominant structure?</v>

1031
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:12.410
<v Speaker 3>The chimpanzee is gonna do whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzee does.</v>

1032
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:17.411
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to have a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with you about the nature </v>

1033
00:53:17.411 --> 00:53:21.251
<v Speaker 3>of the dominance hierarchy so it can act</v>
<v Speaker 3>out its knowledge and it might even be </v>

1034
00:53:21.251 --> 00:53:25.841
<v Speaker 3>able to represent it as an image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it can't articulate it.</v>

1035
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would we be any different?</v>

1036
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:32.220
<v Speaker 3>We aren't obviously because we're more </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex than we understand,</v>

1037
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:37.640
<v Speaker 3>so the fact that we're more complex than</v>
<v Speaker 3>we understand means that we contain </v>

1038
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.200
<v Speaker 3>information that we cannot articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't that reveal itself?</v>

1039
00:53:40.201 --> 00:53:42.960
<v Speaker 3>It does all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a revelation.</v>

1040
00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:44.420
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aha,</v>

1041
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.410
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1042
00:53:46.411 --> 00:53:47.890
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's you.</v>

1043
00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're in psychotherapy and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about some things about your past </v>

1044
00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:52.940
<v Speaker 3>and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1045
00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:52.940
<v Speaker 3>this happened.</v>

1046
00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Then this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then this happened.</v>

1047
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1048
00:53:54.241 --> 00:53:57.120
<v Speaker 3>there's a pattern whap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's overwhelming.</v>

1049
00:53:57.121 --> 00:54:02.121
<v Speaker 3>It's like now there's a concordance </v>
<v Speaker 3>between your knowledge and the things </v>

1050
00:54:02.121 --> 00:54:03.420
<v Speaker 3>that you're acting out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what comes as a revelation.</v>

1051
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.420
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 3>exodus,</v>

1052
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Moses is leading his people through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desert,</v>

1053
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.700
<v Speaker 3>classic u shaped story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in a tyranny to begin with,</v>

1054
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the.</v>

1055
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:16.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the insufficient present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the old order.</v>

1056
00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.320
<v Speaker 3>And then they crossed the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the destructive water.</v>

1057
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:20.670
<v Speaker 3>That's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the flood.</v>

1058
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Then they're out in the desert wandering</v>
<v Speaker 3>without direction.</v>

1059
00:54:24.001 --> 00:54:27.210
<v Speaker 3>They start worshiping idols,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're wandering without direction,</v>

1060
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:32.940
<v Speaker 3>and then Moses goes up on the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is by the way,</v>

1061
00:54:32.941 --> 00:54:37.941
<v Speaker 3>what happens in Logan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because if you're going to go see </v>

1062
00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:37.941
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might as well know that because it's</v>

1063
00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:42.071
<v Speaker 3>a journey up the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes up the mountain and he gets </v>

1064
00:54:42.071 --> 00:54:42.420
<v Speaker 3>rules revealed to him.</v>

1065
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the story is structured is </v>

1066
00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.551
<v Speaker 3>stored nearly interesting because Moses </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes this people away from this tier </v>

1067
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:54.771
<v Speaker 3>Annette tyrannical structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't go from tyranny to </v>

1068
00:54:54.771 --> 00:54:56.880
<v Speaker 3>paradise to the promised land in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>

1069
00:54:56.881 --> 00:55:01.881
<v Speaker 3>That isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to go from a tyranny to </v>

1070
00:55:01.881 --> 00:55:04.701
<v Speaker 3>absolute chaos where everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting and killing each other and </v>

1071
00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:08.240
<v Speaker 3>having a terrible time of it and half </v>
<v Speaker 3>starving and and having to pass through </v>

1072
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:12.891
<v Speaker 3>the Red Sea like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go from tyranny to catastrophe </v>

1073
00:55:12.891 --> 00:55:16.820
<v Speaker 3>before they go to higher order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Moses doesn't even make it to the </v>

1074
00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.990
<v Speaker 3>place of higher order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he dies before he gets there,</v>

1075
00:55:18.991 --> 00:55:23.991
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite the catastrophe and the </v>

1076
00:55:23.991 --> 00:55:26.031
<v Speaker 3>Israelites are all confused when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in the desert because even though </v>

1077
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:26.031
<v Speaker 3>they were in a tyranny and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaves,</v>

1078
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 3>now they're nowhere and they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1079
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:32.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of them actually start </v>

1080
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:35.541
<v Speaker 3>thinking about how good the damn tyranny</v>
<v Speaker 3>was compared to wandering around in the </v>

1081
00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:39.831
<v Speaker 3>desert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what happened to the </v>

1082
00:55:39.831 --> 00:55:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's huge nostalgia for the </v>

1083
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Stalinist era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these stories,</v>

1084
00:55:43.501 --> 00:55:45.960
<v Speaker 3>they are always true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always happening.</v>

1085
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:51.470
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens to Moses is that the story </v>

1086
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.280
<v Speaker 3>is quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Israelites start to fight amongst</v>

1087
00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:58.281
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course they do because there's </v>

1088
00:55:58.281 --> 00:56:00.560
<v Speaker 3>no higher order authority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then Moses sits and judges the </v>

1089
00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:05.840
<v Speaker 3>like literally like a judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he sits for hours everyday and the </v>

1090
00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:06.630
<v Speaker 3>squabbling Israelites come up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1091
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:08.940
<v Speaker 3>he did this to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you did this to me,</v>

1092
00:56:08.941 --> 00:56:12.270
<v Speaker 3>and so then Moses has to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's right and who's wrong.</v>

1093
00:56:12.271 --> 00:56:17.271
<v Speaker 3>And he's doing this for like hours and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours for days and days for weeks and </v>

1094
00:56:17.271 --> 00:56:17.280
<v Speaker 3>weeks for months.</v>

1095
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like the origin of English common </v>
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>

1096
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:25.250
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly what happened with common </v>
<v Speaker 3>law because in common law what happens </v>

1097
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:26.230
<v Speaker 3>is that you have all the rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>

1098
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.260
<v Speaker 3>if you to have a dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go before the judiciary,</v>

1099
00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 3>you sort out the dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That becomes a precedent.</v>

1100
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Now that's part of the body of laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The body of laws is what you act out.</v>

1101
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:38.320
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's a body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1102
00:56:38.321 --> 00:56:42.520
<v Speaker 3>that's what Moses does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's sitting there making judgments,</v>

1103
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very finely tuned,</v>

1104
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:49.890
<v Speaker 3>discreet moral judgements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how difficult that is when two </v>

1105
00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:51.460
<v Speaker 3>people have a dispute to try to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to mediate between that,</v>

1106
00:56:51.461 --> 00:56:53.740
<v Speaker 3>you don't know who's lying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's telling the truth.</v>

1107
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.740
<v Speaker 3>You don't know exactly what an </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptable solution would be like.</v>

1108
00:56:56.741 --> 00:57:01.741
<v Speaker 3>It's really ridiculously hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he walks through this entire process </v>

1109
00:57:01.741 --> 00:57:06.661
<v Speaker 3>of continual judicial intermediation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he goes up the mountain and what </v>

1110
00:57:06.661 --> 00:57:06.690
<v Speaker 3>does he get?</v>

1111
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Tablet of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1112
00:57:08.531 --> 00:57:09.880
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1113
00:57:09.881 --> 00:57:14.881
<v Speaker 3>he spent his 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours investigating the structure of </v>

1114
00:57:15.251 --> 00:57:18.610
<v Speaker 3>morality in a practical way and it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

1115
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.390
<v Speaker 3>this is what we've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the rules.</v>

1116
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:27.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's no rules to begin </v>
<v Speaker 3>with and those are opposed because that </v>

1117
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.500
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that way.</v>

1118
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:35.310
<v Speaker 3>You have to take how people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extract out what the pattern of what </v>

1119
00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:37.630
<v Speaker 3>they are is reflect that back to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1120
00:57:37.631 --> 00:57:39.610
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the story of Moses and it's,</v>

1121
00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.780
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a myth.</v>

1122
00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:44.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a metal story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a story about how rules come to be.</v>

1123
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.070
<v Speaker 3>We act a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have certain kinds of expectations.</v>

1124
00:57:48.071 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 3>We have certain kinds of disputes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1125
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:53.740
<v Speaker 3>a pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pattern way of being emerges.</v>

1126
00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Then we map the pattern way of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We say,</v>

1127
00:57:56.141 --> 00:57:57.190
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the rules.</v>

1128
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:01.090
<v Speaker 3>There's 10 of them or however many you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to extract.</v>

1129
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1130
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:05.200
<v Speaker 3>it's a moving target in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't kill other people.</v>

1131
00:58:05.201 --> 00:58:08.470
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't steal what other people have,</v>

1132
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.310
<v Speaker 3>honor your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

1133
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mEan these are.</v>

1134
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 3>You could come up with a different basic</v>
<v Speaker 3>set of rules,</v>

1135
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.770
<v Speaker 3>but there'd be some overlap and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't bad to begin with.</v>

1136
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:20.650
<v Speaker 3>There were far more rules than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those were the central ones.</v>

1137
00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.380
<v Speaker 3>And so then you mIght say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1138
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:28.800
<v Speaker 3>if you took all 10 of those rules and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you tried to extract out one rule from </v>

1139
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:33.811
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be at the top of the </v>

1140
00:58:33.811 --> 00:58:33.811
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would that be?</v>

1141
00:58:33.811 --> 00:58:36.490
<v Speaker 3>And in western culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea there is that do unto others as</v>

1142
00:58:36.491 --> 00:58:40.600
<v Speaker 3>you would have them do unto you is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rule that it's the mega rule that guides</v>

1143
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:42.660
<v Speaker 3>all other rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like the one ring in the,</v>

1144
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:44.110
<v Speaker 3>in the lord of the rings.</v>

1145
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:49.000
<v Speaker 3>And so it's this consistent pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstraction of ethical guidelines.</v>

1146
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.680
<v Speaker 3>So okaY,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so well and so that maps onto,</v>

1147
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:55.420
<v Speaker 3>well there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a micro,</v>

1148
00:58:55.450 --> 00:59:00.450
<v Speaker 3>there's a micro level that you instruct </v>
<v Speaker 3>people at and that then there's a more </v>

1149
00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:05.911
<v Speaker 3>abstract level that you instruct them </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and then there's a more abstract </v>

1150
00:59:05.911 --> 00:59:09.121
<v Speaker 3>level while maybe at that point you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't exactly directly instruct them </v>

1151
00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.270
<v Speaker 3>your number in the pinocchio story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan,</v>

1152
00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:16.340
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sits pennock or the cricket gemini sits </v>

1153
00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:19.620
<v Speaker 3>pinocchio down and tries to lecture to </v>
<v Speaker 3>him about what the highest level of </v>

1154
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 3>moral virtue is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sounds like a complete fraud.</v>

1155
00:59:22.311 --> 00:59:27.311
<v Speaker 3>He sounds like a propaganda artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a soapbox preacher and pinocchio </v>

1156
00:59:27.311 --> 00:59:31.820
<v Speaker 3>doesn't understand them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>why has to be acted out now?</v>

1157
00:59:31.821 --> 00:59:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Maybe as a parent you can be a model for</v>
<v Speaker 3>emulation,</v>

1158
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.550
<v Speaker 3>which is so you're a mortal for </v>
<v Speaker 3>imitation.</v>

1159
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:42.700
<v Speaker 3>What you say matters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't say as much matter as </v>

1160
00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:42.700
<v Speaker 3>much as what you do.</v>

1161
00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it would if what you said and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did were the same.</v>

1162
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 3>That's the ideal situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1163
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:49.100
<v Speaker 3>That's what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a parent,</v>

1164
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.440
<v Speaker 3>if you say one thing and act </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently,</v>

1165
00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:56.441
<v Speaker 3>your kids will torture you to death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're right to do it too because </v>

1166
00:59:56.441 --> 01:00:00.311
<v Speaker 3>you're confused and confusing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes them anxious and aggressive and </v>

1167
01:00:00.311 --> 01:00:00.890
<v Speaker 3>they will go after you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistency,</v>

1168
01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:02.360
<v Speaker 3>consistency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistency.</v>

1169
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.120
<v Speaker 3>And if you can't provide it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he will drive them crazy.</v>

1170
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:06.250
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1171
01:00:06.251 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 3>you want to bring your words and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>actions into alignment.</v>

1172
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:14.830
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the development of </v>

1173
01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:14.830
<v Speaker 3>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1174
01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so back to the brain.</v>

1175
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:22.200
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's,</v>

1176
01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.240
<v Speaker 3>there's the motor homunculus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now what I want to tell you about </v>

1177
01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.240
<v Speaker 3>that is you just think about what this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is like.</v>

1178
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:33.440
<v Speaker 3>It's taking the world apart and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about it.</v>

1179
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.440
<v Speaker 3>So that's what a human being is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

1180
01:00:36.441 --> 01:00:39.080
<v Speaker 3>to me that's kind of an image of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological hero.</v>

1181
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.890
<v Speaker 3>It's the thing that can speak magic </v>
<v Speaker 3>words and take the world's apart.</v>

1182
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:48.130
<v Speaker 3>Take the world apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in one of the stories I'm going to </v>

1183
01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:49.100
<v Speaker 3>tell you today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the story of the enuma elish,</v>

1184
01:00:49.101 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 3>which is the oldest written story that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>

1185
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:56.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a mesopotamian story and it's from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same pool of stories that the </v>

1186
01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.670
<v Speaker 3>creation account in genesis was </v>
<v Speaker 3>extracted.</v>

1187
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 3>It isn't obvious what the temporal </v>
<v Speaker 3>sequence was,</v>

1188
01:01:00.981 --> 01:01:05.981
<v Speaker 3>but imagine there was a pool of stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the middle east that were of </v>

1189
01:01:05.981 --> 01:01:09.070
<v Speaker 3>indefinite age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tens of thousands of years and in needs </v>

1190
01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:10.670
<v Speaker 3>of the more developed in a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>

1191
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Although the themes underneath were </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar.</v>

1192
01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.400
<v Speaker 3>There are great parallels between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mesopotamian creation account and the </v>

1193
01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.340
<v Speaker 3>first part of the creation account in </v>
<v Speaker 3>genesis,</v>

1194
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:24.700
<v Speaker 3>so it was discovered in the late 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and isis just destroyed a huge </v>

1195
01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.810
<v Speaker 3>treasure trove of that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>manuscripts.</v>

1196
01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.660
<v Speaker 3>So just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so at nineveh,</v>

1197
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:37.990
<v Speaker 3>so we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can thank the war in the middle east </v>

1198
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:40.751
<v Speaker 3>for the destruction of a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a huge treasure house of irreplaceable </v>

1199
01:01:40.751 --> 01:01:45.671
<v Speaker 3>human knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that's happening that's </v>

1200
01:01:45.671 --> 01:01:45.671
<v Speaker 3>happening very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very frequently.</v>

1201
01:01:45.671 --> 01:01:48.560
<v Speaker 3>It's an absolute bloody disgraceful </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe.</v>

1202
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:53.240
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know that that's the human being.</v>

1203
01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Lips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tongues,</v>

1204
01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:55.670
<v Speaker 3>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the face.</v>

1205
01:01:55.671 --> 01:02:00.671
<v Speaker 3>Your face is also extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>amenable to voluntary manipulation,</v>

1206
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:06.140
<v Speaker 3>so you can learn to move single neurons </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the tissue underneath your eyes.</v>

1207
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:11.530
<v Speaker 3>That's how that's how high resolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>your faces and that's partly because </v>

1208
01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:14.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a broadcast screed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why people are always looking </v>

1209
01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:14.980
<v Speaker 3>at it.</v>

1210
01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:15.380
<v Speaker 3>RighT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why if you watch a movie,</v>

1211
01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:20.381
<v Speaker 3>it's always concentrating on people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>faces because they're just broadcasting </v>

1212
01:02:20.381 --> 01:02:24.290
<v Speaker 3>what they're broadcasting their stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly and we're looking at their </v>

1213
01:02:25.171 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 3>faces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you looking at?</v>

1214
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 3>What are your eyes pointing at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you up to?</v>

1215
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:30.750
<v Speaker 3>What's your emotional expression?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do next?</v>

1216
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:35.751
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are you going and you're brought </v>

1217
01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.590
<v Speaker 3>like you find someone who has had too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much plastic surgery.</v>

1218
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:42.591
<v Speaker 3>Uncanny because their face is dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you cannot tell what they're up </v>

1219
01:02:42.591 --> 01:02:43.820
<v Speaker 3>to there they've got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all and be like aspect.</v>

1220
01:02:43.821 --> 01:02:46.500
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying and people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1221
01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:51.530
<v Speaker 3>people like that got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we're not like that or they </v>

1222
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:55.491
<v Speaker 3>didn't meet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you want to know what that </v>

1223
01:02:55.491 --> 01:02:55.491
<v Speaker 3>other person is up to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I told you already.</v>

1224
01:02:55.491 --> 01:02:55.950
<v Speaker 3>That's how the whites of our eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved,</v>

1225
01:02:55.951 --> 01:02:56.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1226
01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:01.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't you remember that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gorillas don't have that distinction </v>

1227
01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:05.211
<v Speaker 3>between the irs and the whites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like human beings and our eyes are </v>

1228
01:03:05.211 --> 01:03:08.421
<v Speaker 3>very sharp and one thing we really want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to know is what are you looking at and </v>

1229
01:03:08.421 --> 01:03:09.240
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you up to?</v>

1230
01:03:09.241 --> 01:03:10.740
<v Speaker 3>And if I can tell what you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

1231
01:03:10.741 --> 01:03:15.741
<v Speaker 3>I can infer what you're going to do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to broadcast that well,</v>

1232
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:17.670
<v Speaker 3>except when you don't want to broadcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1233
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:22.700
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time you want to be pretty </v>

1234
01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:25.131
<v Speaker 3>transparent to other people because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise they won't trust you and if </v>

1235
01:03:25.131 --> 01:03:25.290
<v Speaker 3>they don't trust you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they won't cooperate with you,</v>

1236
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.500
<v Speaker 3>they won't compete with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the probability that they'll come </v>

1237
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.991
<v Speaker 3>after you is extraordinarily high </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you'll be evil predator in no </v>

1238
01:03:32.991 --> 01:03:34.350
<v Speaker 3>time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1239
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:40.220
<v Speaker 3>okAy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll take a look at the brain from </v>

1240
01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:42.330
<v Speaker 3>another perspective.</v>

1241
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this I got from alcoa conan </v>

1242
01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:49.100
<v Speaker 3>goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1243
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not exactly right.</v>

1244
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I had laid up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laid this out before that,</v>

1245
01:03:53.011 --> 01:03:58.011
<v Speaker 3>but I found out and goldberg's readings </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards and he was a student of </v>

1246
01:03:58.011 --> 01:04:00.420
<v Speaker 3>lyricists and he was trying to account </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the y.</v>

1247
01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:05.421
<v Speaker 3>We had different hemispheres roughly </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking because it's not self evident </v>

1248
01:04:05.421 --> 01:04:09.021
<v Speaker 3>that we should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're actually somewhat separate </v>

1249
01:04:09.021 --> 01:04:09.570
<v Speaker 3>consciousnesses and they they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they communicate,</v>

1250
01:04:09.571 --> 01:04:14.571
<v Speaker 3>but the communication isn't complete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like our brain is modularized and </v>

1251
01:04:14.571 --> 01:04:18.210
<v Speaker 3>unified at the same time and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it like a meeting of people.</v>

1252
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Why do you want it mod your mod </v>
<v Speaker 3>muellerized while so if one person goes </v>

1253
01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:23.910
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them don't.</v>

1254
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.740
<v Speaker 3>That's one one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at some separation of function,</v>

1255
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 3>why else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1256
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:36.230
<v Speaker 3>each little module can do its own </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative thing independently of the </v>

1257
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:39.810
<v Speaker 3>others and that's useful and then there </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be communication between them and so</v>

1258
01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:45.440
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's utility in modularity and </v>

1259
01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.991
<v Speaker 3>there's utility and integration and part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what we're trying to work out on the </v>

1260
01:04:47.991 --> 01:04:51.171
<v Speaker 3>global political scene right now is how </v>
<v Speaker 3>modular things should be and how </v>

1261
01:04:51.171 --> 01:04:54.531
<v Speaker 3>integrated they should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the erp and the community rushed </v>

1262
01:04:54.531 --> 01:04:57.771
<v Speaker 3>into integration and that's bothering </v>
<v Speaker 3>people dreadfully because they feel that</v>

1263
01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:01.230
<v Speaker 3>the advantages of modularization have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been washed away.</v>

1264
01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:06.530
<v Speaker 3>You saw that and maybe they're right </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you saw what happened when </v>

1265
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Greece collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1266
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:07.830
<v Speaker 3>And Greece is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very corrupt,</v>

1267
01:05:07.831 --> 01:05:09.600
<v Speaker 3>incredibly corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Germany,</v>

1268
01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:12.270
<v Speaker 3>whatever else you might think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany is not corrupt,</v>

1269
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:16.980
<v Speaker 3>and so the eec tried to bring Greece and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany together.</v>

1270
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:19.360
<v Speaker 3>That didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no unity there.</v>

1271
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 3>The modularity was actually useful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that Greece was so destabilized</v>

1272
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:27.610
<v Speaker 3>and Italy also very corrupt and Spain </v>
<v Speaker 3>also very corrupt,</v>

1273
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.640
<v Speaker 3>was very shaky just about brought the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing down.</v>

1274
01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:35.780
<v Speaker 3>It it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The argument is the modularity would </v>

1275
01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 3>have been better conserved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1276
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1277
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Because modularity is useful and so it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>integration,</v>

1278
01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 3>but full integration seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistake and sodas,</v>

1279
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:45.460
<v Speaker 3>full modularity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you get that?</v>

1280
01:05:45.461 --> 01:05:46.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

1281
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:49.990
<v Speaker 3>That's why we're arguing about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now there's a backlash.</v>

1282
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 3>We're pulling away from the integration </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you you can see why too,</v>

1283
01:05:54.131 --> 01:05:57.160
<v Speaker 3>because in 2008 when the american </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy collapsed,</v>

1284
01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.200
<v Speaker 3>the world economy just about collapsed.</v>

1285
01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:01.640
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1286
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.500
<v Speaker 3>you might want some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some separate nest so that if one system</v>

1287
01:06:05.501 --> 01:06:10.501
<v Speaker 3>malfunctions and goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole bloody thing doesn't go into </v>

1288
01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 3>flames.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we don't know.</v>

1289
01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:13.270
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how to manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really,</v>

1290
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:17.590
<v Speaker 3>really complicated problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyways.</v>

1291
01:06:17.591 --> 01:06:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how did the,</v>

1292
01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.380
<v Speaker 3>how does the brain work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1293
01:06:20.381 --> 01:06:25.381
<v Speaker 3>the left roughly speaking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>right-handed males and the reason that </v>

1294
01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:30.211
<v Speaker 3>I'm concentrating on right handed males </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because there are simpler in their </v>

1295
01:06:30.211 --> 01:06:34.141
<v Speaker 3>neurological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women have a more complicated </v>

1296
01:06:34.141 --> 01:06:36.901
<v Speaker 3>neurological structure and lefthanded </v>
<v Speaker 3>people tend to have a more complicated </v>

1297
01:06:36.901 --> 01:06:40.681
<v Speaker 3>neurological structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll just say that we'll just go </v>

1298
01:06:40.681 --> 01:06:43.960
<v Speaker 3>with the standard model to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can assume that the same systems</v>

1299
01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:49.440
<v Speaker 3>are there in every person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not laid out on the </v>

1300
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:49.660
<v Speaker 3>hemispheric structure quite as neatly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're still there,</v>

1301
01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.240
<v Speaker 3>so it's sort of like these are </v>
<v Speaker 3>tendencies.</v>

1302
01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.550
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a.</v>

1303
01:06:55.210 --> 01:07:00.210
<v Speaker 3>So there's a tendency for the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere to specialize for what's </v>

1304
01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:03.271
<v Speaker 3>relatively unknown and the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere to specialize for what's </v>

1305
01:07:03.271 --> 01:07:05.980
<v Speaker 3>relatively mastered and you can think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it this way too,</v>

1306
01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.860
<v Speaker 5>left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1307
01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.010
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1308
01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:14.640
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

1309
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:20.470
<v Speaker 3>large scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low resolution abstractions tend to be </v>

1310
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.600
<v Speaker 3>the province of the right high </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution,</v>

1311
01:07:20.601 --> 01:07:23.540
<v Speaker 3>detailed knowledge structures tend to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>the province of the left.</v>

1312
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:28.750
<v Speaker 3>The left is linguistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the detailed structures </v>

1313
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:28.750
<v Speaker 3>manifest themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In articulation,</v>

1314
01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:33.350
<v Speaker 3>but the fundamental difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left and right isn't language versus</v>

1315
01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:39.530
<v Speaker 3>non language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fundamental distinction is </v>

1316
01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:42.350
<v Speaker 3>relatively explored and mastered versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively unexplored and not mastered,</v>

1317
01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:46.280
<v Speaker 3>and that's both in terms of structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right hemisphere has a less granular</v>

1318
01:07:46.281 --> 01:07:48.350
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's less differentiated.</v>

1319
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:51.050
<v Speaker 3>It's also responsible mostly for </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative emotion,</v>

1320
01:07:51.051 --> 01:07:54.080
<v Speaker 3>especially in the prefrontal part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is,</v>

1321
01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:59.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you encounter what's absolutely </v>

1322
01:07:59.290 --> 01:07:59.840
<v Speaker 3>unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagination and emotion,</v>

1323
01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:05.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you that little experiment that </v>

1324
01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.890
<v Speaker 3>you could do if you're alone in a house </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you hear a strange noise at night in</v>

1325
01:08:06.891 --> 01:08:09.320
<v Speaker 3>a room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn off the lights and put your hand in</v>

1326
01:08:09.321 --> 01:08:09.770
<v Speaker 3>the room.</v>

1327
01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like your brain will just flash off</v>
<v Speaker 3>monsters like mad.</v>

1328
01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.740
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be nervous because that what's in</v>

1329
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:18.080
<v Speaker 3>that room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to make you nervous.</v>

1330
01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 3>That's a very low resolution category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1331
01:08:20.391 --> 01:08:25.391
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's some indeterminant manifestation of</v>

1332
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:27.560
<v Speaker 3>the category of things that might hurt </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1333
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Very low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a very smart category.</v>

1334
01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't put your hand in there.</v>

1335
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.040
<v Speaker 3>You put your hand in there and you watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>your imagination.</v>

1336
01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:39.041
<v Speaker 3>It's like monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll generate monsters like matt and </v>

1337
01:08:39.041 --> 01:08:39.041
<v Speaker 3>that's what the right hemisphere is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1338
01:08:39.041 --> 01:08:43.571
<v Speaker 3>It's saying what's in there is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>exemplar of the category of things that </v>

1339
01:08:43.571 --> 01:08:45.140
<v Speaker 3>are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a bunch of images of those things</v>

1340
01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.710
<v Speaker 3>and that thing in there is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>partake of that essence.</v>

1341
01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:51.890
<v Speaker 3>That's a and that's a very low </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution hypothesis.</v>

1342
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:54.200
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of what horror movies do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>

1343
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:54.500
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

1344
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 3>They sort of lead them through that </v>
<v Speaker 3>initial process and so and so.</v>

1345
01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:03.821
<v Speaker 3>That's what the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right hemisphere seems to me to be </v>

1346
01:09:03.821 --> 01:09:06.521
<v Speaker 3>dominated by dominated by subcortical </v>
<v Speaker 3>processes was the left hemisphere is </v>

1347
01:09:06.521 --> 01:09:11.351
<v Speaker 3>reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cortex is more or less got dominion </v>

1348
01:09:11.351 --> 01:09:14.410
<v Speaker 3>and so the right hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we'll walk through this </v>

1349
01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:17.531
<v Speaker 3>neurologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the right hemisphere is responds </v>

1350
01:09:17.531 --> 01:09:20.630
<v Speaker 3>rapidly to what's unknown and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>subcortical is the hippocampus,</v>

1351
01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:25.670
<v Speaker 3>is is doing an awful lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Noting a mismatch and then it's using </v>

1352
01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:29.951
<v Speaker 3>the right hemisphere to to abstractly </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent what the possibility space is </v>

1353
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:37.030
<v Speaker 3>in relationship to unexpected things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the right hemisphere is tracking </v>

1354
01:09:37.161 --> 01:09:42.161
<v Speaker 3>that continually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What those unexpected things are and </v>

1355
01:09:42.161 --> 01:09:44.741
<v Speaker 3>coming up with models of what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't yet mastered and that's kept </v>

1356
01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:49.841
<v Speaker 3>separate from the left hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which already has functional models and </v>

1357
01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:53.711
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to blast the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere continually with the </v>

1358
01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:56.340
<v Speaker 3>normalist information because you blow </v>
<v Speaker 3>out its structure and then you don't </v>

1359
01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:56.340
<v Speaker 3>know what to do.</v>

1360
01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:00.640
<v Speaker 3>So the right hemisphere generates new </v>
<v Speaker 3>models in some sense out of nothing,</v>

1361
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:06.970
<v Speaker 3>and then when the time is right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taps information into the left </v>

1362
01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.930
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere slowly so that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrupt its function too much and that's</v>

1363
01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 3>a lot of that seems to happen when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dreaming by the way it happens at</v>

1364
01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:14.840
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and what happens with the dreams.</v>

1365
01:10:14.841 --> 01:10:19.841
<v Speaker 3>You think about how dreams work as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might think of dreams as part of that </v>

1366
01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:22.670
<v Speaker 3>process where ideas come to be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're low resolution to begin with,</v>

1367
01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:27.671
<v Speaker 3>mostly a majestic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really highly emotional and incoherent </v>

1368
01:10:27.671 --> 01:10:31.460
<v Speaker 3>less coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you can't be coherent less.</v>

1369
01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:32.810
<v Speaker 3>You know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1370
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:33.440
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>

1371
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:34.010
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>e,</v>

1372
01:10:34.011 --> 01:10:36.260
<v Speaker 3>f if that's working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got coherence.</v>

1373
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:38.270
<v Speaker 3>But if you're dealing with something you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>

1374
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:40.760
<v Speaker 3>you have to muck about with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>category structures.</v>

1375
01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:43.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's what dreams do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1376
01:10:43.461 --> 01:10:48.461
<v Speaker 3>when you're interpreting a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you watch for is the </v>

1377
01:10:48.461 --> 01:10:48.461
<v Speaker 3>dream.</v>

1378
01:10:48.461 --> 01:10:49.070
<v Speaker 3>The dream presents this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this.</v>

1379
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:50.690
<v Speaker 3>That's called metonymy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1380
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:54.290
<v Speaker 3>from a literary perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what that implies is this is related</v>

1381
01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.500
<v Speaker 3>to this in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why else would they be co activated?</v>

1382
01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:58.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people sAy,</v>

1383
01:10:58.971 --> 01:11:00.020
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams are random.</v>

1384
01:11:00.021 --> 01:11:01.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the stupidest theory I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard.</v>

1385
01:11:01.821 --> 01:11:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Like white noise is random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dreams are not random.</v>

1386
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 3>They're hard to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're anything but random.</v>

1387
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:11.840
<v Speaker 3>They're more random than real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1388
01:11:11.841 --> 01:11:16.650
<v Speaker 3>that's because what you don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>these really random and you're organized</v>

1389
01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:21.651
<v Speaker 3>and there has to be an intermediary that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of quasi random between the more </v>

1390
01:11:21.651 --> 01:11:23.090
<v Speaker 3>you'll never get from one to the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dreams,</v>

1391
01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 3>fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>myths,</v>

1392
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:29.571
<v Speaker 3>all of that is part of that process that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stretches you out beyond what you </v>

1393
01:11:29.571 --> 01:11:32.490
<v Speaker 3>know into the absolute unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1394
01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 3>and you're hemispheres are </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentially specialized for that.</v>

1395
01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:42.921
<v Speaker 3>So roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right hemisphere operation and </v>

1396
01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:49.551
<v Speaker 3>unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a really good way of thinking </v>

1397
01:11:49.551 --> 01:11:49.551
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1398
01:11:49.551 --> 01:11:50.610
<v Speaker 3>You need a system that tells you what to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do when you don't know what to do.</v>

1399
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:55.970
<v Speaker 3>A huge part of the subcortical </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures of doing that to unknown </v>

1400
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:56.280
<v Speaker 3>freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then what?</v>

1401
01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Imagine right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freeze emotion.</v>

1402
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Imagine then explore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then differentiate,</v>

1403
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.700
<v Speaker 3>then master.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the process.</v>

1404
01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:08.580
<v Speaker 3>That's the process of learning and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing is you're.</v>

1405
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:13.700
<v Speaker 3>You're transforming low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations of what's frightening </v>

1406
01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.860
<v Speaker 3>into high resolution representations </v>
<v Speaker 3>that enabled you to master it,</v>

1407
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:20.760
<v Speaker 3>to take the world park and to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingenious things out of it.</v>

1408
01:12:20.761 --> 01:12:25.761
<v Speaker 3>So there's this very cool part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mesopotamian creation myths so that the </v>

1409
01:12:25.761 --> 01:12:29.250
<v Speaker 3>major hero whose name is martech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>confronts the dragon of chaos.</v>

1410
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:34.310
<v Speaker 3>Tiamat who's feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he cuts her into paces and he makes </v>

1411
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:36.000
<v Speaker 3>the world out of her pieces and one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>his names,</v>

1412
01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:36.990
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had 50,</v>

1413
01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:41.991
<v Speaker 3>60 names and I think that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those were amalgams of tribal gods and </v>

1414
01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:47.180
<v Speaker 3>one of the names was he who makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingenious things out of the conflict </v>

1415
01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:47.180
<v Speaker 3>with taya matt.</v>

1416
01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:50.490
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what human beings do,</v>

1417
01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:55.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We confront that terrible predatory </v>

1418
01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:59.690
<v Speaker 3>potential that lies outside our domain </v>
<v Speaker 3>of experience and we make ingenious </v>

1419
01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:04.281
<v Speaker 3>things out of it and then we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how we did it and then we model how we </v>

1420
01:13:04.281 --> 01:13:08.241
<v Speaker 3>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the basis of our ethics and </v>

1421
01:13:08.241 --> 01:13:08.241
<v Speaker 3>our morality and the way that that ties </v>
<v Speaker 3>into think about.</v>

1422
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.400
<v Speaker 3>One of the things we talked about was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the mythological hero was a </v>

1423
01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.251
<v Speaker 3>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not of the being that was at the top of </v>

1424
01:13:16.251 --> 01:13:19.431
<v Speaker 3>the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of the being that was at the top of </v>

1425
01:13:19.431 --> 01:13:19.500
<v Speaker 3>the set of all possible dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies.</v>

1426
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.390
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's the cool equation.</v>

1427
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:27.350
<v Speaker 3>The hero who goes out into the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 3>to who make contact with the dragon and </v>

1428
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:31.461
<v Speaker 3>to bring back the treasurer is the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that wins the battle across sets </v>

1429
01:13:31.461 --> 01:13:34.020
<v Speaker 3>of dominance hierarchies and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 3>the two things come together.</v>

1430
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so brilliant.</v>

1431
01:13:36.061 --> 01:13:39.750
<v Speaker 3>It's so absolutely brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's the mythological hero.</v>

1432
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Mythological hero is the representation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what's,</v>

1433
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:48.230
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at the top of one dominance </v>

1434
01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:48.230
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the top of all of them.</v>

1435
01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:49.740
<v Speaker 3>That's the eye that's above the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why the eye?</v>

1436
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Because it pays attention and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do.</v>

1437
01:13:53.170 --> 01:13:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Like none of this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not fiction,</v>

1438
01:13:56.970 --> 01:13:59.250
<v Speaker 3>it's method truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a right way to think about it.</v>

1439
01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.790
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're socially anxious.</v>

1440
01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens when you're socially </v>

1441
01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:08.300
<v Speaker 3>anxious?</v>

1442
01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.690
<v Speaker 3>You go to a party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your heart's beating.</v>

1443
01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Why the party is a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1444
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Because it's judging you and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>judging you.</v>

1445
01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:18.970
<v Speaker 3>It's putting you low down the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy because that's what a negative</v>

1446
01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:22.750
<v Speaker 3>judgment is and that interferes with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your sexual success.</v>

1447
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:27.370
<v Speaker 3>And that means that you're being harshly</v>
<v Speaker 3>evaluated by nature itself,</v>

1448
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:32.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you are confronting the dragon of </v>

1449
01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:32.950
<v Speaker 3>chaos when you go into the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

1450
01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:35.500
<v Speaker 3>And so what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like this,</v>

1451
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:37.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hunch over and that's low dominance.</v>

1452
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm no threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like whoa,</v>

1453
01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:41.440
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to get you very far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1454
01:14:41.441 --> 01:14:43.370
<v Speaker 3>but that's a logical thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the,</v>

1455
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:46.540
<v Speaker 3>in the face of a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm no threat.</v>

1456
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:48.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at the king and your dad,</v>

1457
01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:52.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm no threat and hunched over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what's happening internally,</v>

1458
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:54.220
<v Speaker 3>howard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are people thinking about me?</v>

1459
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:56.860
<v Speaker 3>What are people thinking about me or am </v>
<v Speaker 3>I looking stupid?</v>

1460
01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Am I looking foolish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geez,</v>

1461
01:14:58.211 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate being here,</v>

1462
01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sweating too much.</v>

1463
01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.890
<v Speaker 3>It's all internalized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1464
01:15:02.891 --> 01:15:06.940
<v Speaker 3>It's all self focused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The isn't work.</v>

1465
01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:10.090
<v Speaker 3>the eye isn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you tell people?</v>

1466
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't stop thinking about yourself </v>

1467
01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.060
<v Speaker 3>because you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1468
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:18.550
<v Speaker 3>don't think of a white elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white elephant,</v>

1469
01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:19.210
<v Speaker 3>white elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>

1470
01:15:19.211 --> 01:15:24.211
<v Speaker 3>elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell someone to stop thinking </v>

1471
01:15:24.211 --> 01:15:24.211
<v Speaker 3>about something because they get caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the loop.</v>

1472
01:15:24.211 --> 01:15:26.260
<v Speaker 3>What you do with socially anxious people</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

1473
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.860
<v Speaker 3>look at other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at them.</v>

1474
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1475
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell what they're thinking and </v>

1476
01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:36.960
<v Speaker 3>then you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're.</v>

1477
01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're terribly socialized and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are,</v>

1478
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:43.950
<v Speaker 3>some people have no social skills and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason they can't go to a party is </v>

1479
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:44.560
<v Speaker 3>because they don't even know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce themselves.</v>

1480
01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Like they're just no one ever taught </v>
<v Speaker 3>them how to behave and so they're really</v>

1481
01:15:48.551 --> 01:15:53.551
<v Speaker 3>good candidates for behavior therapy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you walk them through the </v>

1482
01:15:53.551 --> 01:15:58.321
<v Speaker 3>process of how you actually manifest the</v>
<v Speaker 3>procedures that are associated with </v>

1483
01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.720
<v Speaker 3>social acceptability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people aren't like that.</v>

1484
01:16:01.721 --> 01:16:05.020
<v Speaker 3>They have the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if they're really introverted in high</v>

1485
01:16:05.021 --> 01:16:10.021
<v Speaker 3>in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can usuaLly talk quite well to </v>

1486
01:16:10.021 --> 01:16:10.021
<v Speaker 3>someone one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1487
01:16:10.021 --> 01:16:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Because they looked at them on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I look at you,</v>

1488
01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:17.340
<v Speaker 3>it's another thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're ever speaking to a group of </v>

1489
01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:17.820
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never speak to the group of people there</v>

1490
01:16:17.821 --> 01:16:22.821
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talk to individuals and then they </v>

1491
01:16:22.821 --> 01:16:25.990
<v Speaker 3>reflect for you the entire group because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all in trained.</v>

1492
01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:31.300
<v Speaker 3>You look At one person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they broadcast what everyone's thinking </v>

1493
01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:33.040
<v Speaker 3>and you know how to talk to one person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's easy.</v>

1494
01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.610
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as you focus on the person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not you,</v>

1495
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:39.580
<v Speaker 3>you push your attention outward.</v>

1496
01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:44.580
<v Speaker 3>Use your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I push your attention outward and you </v>

1497
01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.921
<v Speaker 3>start watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then all your automatic mechanisms </v>

1498
01:16:46.921 --> 01:16:48.460
<v Speaker 3>kick in and you start being awkward </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if we're talking and I'm looking</v>

1499
01:16:48.461 --> 01:16:53.461
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're going to do </v>

1500
01:16:53.461 --> 01:16:55.060
<v Speaker 3>next and I'm going to put disjunctions </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the like,</v>

1501
01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:58.060
<v Speaker 3>they're like a bad chords and the melody</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our,</v>

1502
01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:03.390
<v Speaker 3>of our conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason is I'm not paying </v>

1503
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:06.421
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's why the I is the thing at the </v>

1504
01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:09.301
<v Speaker 3>top of the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the thing that enables you to </v>

1505
01:17:09.301 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 3>win the set of all possible dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies is the I pay attention.</v>

1506
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the critical issue.</v>

1507
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:16.730
<v Speaker 3>That's why the egyptians worshiped </v>
<v Speaker 3>horace.</v>

1508
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:19.970
<v Speaker 3>That's why horace was the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>rescued osiris from the.</v>

1509
01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.700
<v Speaker 3>From the depths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the capacity to pay attention.</v>

1510
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:24.470
<v Speaker 3>What do you pay attention to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most?</v>

1511
01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:30.670
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your right hemisphere signals as </v>

1512
01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:30.670
<v Speaker 3>anomalous.</v>

1513
01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:31.490
<v Speaker 3>It attracts your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this isn't going quite right.</v>

1514
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:36.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm not looking at that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you look at.</v>

1515
01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:39.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's not going right,</v>

1516
01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:40.700
<v Speaker 3>because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1517
01:17:40.701 --> 01:17:42.680
<v Speaker 3>that's the terrible monster that might </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat you,</v>

1518
01:17:42.681 --> 01:17:45.170
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the place you get all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

1519
01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:50.860
<v Speaker 3>so that's why it's useful to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions with your enemies because </v>

1520
01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:55.451
<v Speaker 3>they will tell you things you do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>know and that's such a great thing </v>

1521
01:17:55.451 --> 01:17:56.840
<v Speaker 3>because if you don't know them well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not very smart,</v>

1522
01:17:56.841 --> 01:17:58.040
<v Speaker 3>are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1523
01:17:58.041 --> 01:17:59.600
<v Speaker 3>there may be a time when you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere,</v>

1524
01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:04.770
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing you need to know and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe your enemy will tell you why </v>

1525
01:18:04.770 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 3>you're such a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of other things that aren't true</v>

1526
01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:09.920
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even one thing that's accurate,</v>

1527
01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:10.460
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1528
01:18:10.461 --> 01:18:15.461
<v Speaker 3>thanks very much man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll do Some work on that and I </v>

1529
01:18:15.461 --> 01:18:15.530
<v Speaker 3>won't have to carry that forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1530
01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:18.950
<v Speaker 3>And then that's part of the reason again</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the terrible predator.</v>

1531
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:21.380
<v Speaker 3>It's always the terrible predator that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has the gold.</v>

1532
01:18:21.381 --> 01:18:24.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's the person who delivers </v>
<v Speaker 3>the message you do not want to hear.</v>

1533
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.540
<v Speaker 3>So it's rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's rough,</v>

1534
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:29.180
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life is rough.</v>

1535
01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how are these specialized?</v>

1536
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:39.360
<v Speaker 3>The right hemisphere operation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unexplored territory and that unexplored</v>

1537
01:18:39.361 --> 01:18:43.260
<v Speaker 3>territory emerges whenever what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing doesn't work.</v>

1538
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:48.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can conceptualize it as that which </v>

1539
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:51.321
<v Speaker 3>is beyond the walls of the city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the city is a category structure </v>

1540
01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:53.220
<v Speaker 3>abstractly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abstractly,</v>

1541
01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:58.670
<v Speaker 3>but there's no difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>barbarians that invade the world's city </v>

1542
01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:04.370
<v Speaker 3>and the things that happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world that damaged your category </v>

1543
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.600
<v Speaker 3>structure there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the same thing from a,</v>

1544
01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:06.000
<v Speaker 3>from a practical perspective,</v>

1545
01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:16.260
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right hemisphere operation and </v>

1546
01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:16.260
<v Speaker 3>unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative emotion,</v>

1547
01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.460
<v Speaker 3>inhibition of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's this.</v>

1548
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:23.670
<v Speaker 3>That's anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens when the medusa </v>

1549
01:19:23.670 --> 01:19:23.670
<v Speaker 3>looks at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You turned to stone,</v>

1550
01:19:23.670 --> 01:19:24.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the basilisk in Harry Potter.</v>

1551
01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:26.470
<v Speaker 3>It freezes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1552
01:19:26.890 --> 01:19:29.140
<v Speaker 3>You're moving forward according to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>schema.</v>

1553
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:34.590
<v Speaker 3>If you're moving fruit forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>property you're getting to where you </v>

1554
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:37.681
<v Speaker 3>want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the schema is being validated </v>

1555
01:19:37.681 --> 01:19:39.691
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm moving forward and the map is </v>

1556
01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:40.150
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happens that's unexpected.</v>

1557
01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:42.430
<v Speaker 3>What should you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

1558
01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.550
<v Speaker 3>What else are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stopped first.</v>

1559
01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Then the predator can't see you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1560
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the freezing reaction of a prey </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>

1561
01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:51.640
<v Speaker 3>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1562
01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:53.140
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's built very,</v>

1563
01:19:53.141 --> 01:19:55.720
<v Speaker 3>very deeply into very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very old circuits.</v>

1564
01:19:55.721 --> 01:20:00.721
<v Speaker 3>Do that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's a real orienting reflects to </v>

1565
01:20:00.721 --> 01:20:03.481
<v Speaker 3>something that's normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll go like this and that's to stop </v>

1566
01:20:03.481 --> 01:20:04.870
<v Speaker 3>the thing that will jump on your back </v>
<v Speaker 3>from carrying out your throat and that's</v>

1567
01:20:04.871 --> 01:20:06.010
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fast.</v>

1568
01:20:06.011 --> 01:20:11.011
<v Speaker 3>It's almost as fast spinal snake </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflects circuitry extraordinarily fast </v>

1569
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 3>and that you know that's conserved over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and evolutionary span.</v>

1570
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.480
<v Speaker 3>That predator defense system is at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom of your cognitive apparatus.</v>

1571
01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Everything's been built on that.</v>

1572
01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:28.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a low resolution pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a higher resolution pattern.</v>

1573
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.190
<v Speaker 3>That's the same pattern is built on top </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

1574
01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Then a higher resolution pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the same pattern is built on top </v>

1575
01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:40.121
<v Speaker 3>of that and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that initial architecture is </v>

1576
01:20:40.121 --> 01:20:43.601
<v Speaker 3>duplicated across the levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiation of the nervous system </v>

1577
01:20:43.601 --> 01:20:45.920
<v Speaker 3>and that's partly why these symbols can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be so archaic and still be accurate.</v>

1578
01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.610
<v Speaker 3>it's still the way the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative emotion,</v>

1579
01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:51.830
<v Speaker 3>inhibition of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>image processing,</v>

1580
01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:54.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because image hang about images is there</v>

1581
01:20:54.891 --> 01:20:56.660
<v Speaker 3>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1582
01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:59.300
<v Speaker 3>a picture is worth a thousand words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1583
01:20:59.301 --> 01:21:00.970
<v Speaker 3>You get the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1584
01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:03.530
<v Speaker 3>get the picture is actually something </v>
<v Speaker 3>you say to someone.</v>

1585
01:21:03.531 --> 01:21:05.210
<v Speaker 3>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you understand?</v>

1586
01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To get the picture is very,</v>

1587
01:21:07.191 --> 01:21:09.680
<v Speaker 3>very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the right hemisphere managers,</v>

1588
01:21:09.681 --> 01:21:13.190
<v Speaker 3>that holistic thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that low resolution thinking that</v>

1589
01:21:13.191 --> 01:21:16.160
<v Speaker 3>generalizes across instances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern recognition,</v>

1590
01:21:16.161 --> 01:21:18.710
<v Speaker 3>pattern generation and gross motor </v>
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>

1591
01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freeze and get the hell out of there.</v>

1592
01:21:22.011 --> 01:21:27.011
<v Speaker 3>That's gross motor action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right hemisphere is very good at </v>

1593
01:21:27.011 --> 01:21:27.590
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why if you're right handed,</v>

1594
01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:30.340
<v Speaker 3>use your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're right handed,</v>

1595
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:35.420
<v Speaker 3>you use your left hemisphere to manage </v>
<v Speaker 3>the really fine motor details,</v>

1596
01:21:35.421 --> 01:21:36.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You write with it,</v>

1597
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:39.200
<v Speaker 3>you write with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because that's very,</v>

1598
01:21:39.201 --> 01:21:39.590
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

1599
01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:47.200
<v Speaker 3>If you're right handed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tend to use your left hand to open </v>

1600
01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:47.540
<v Speaker 3>the top of jars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1601
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.730
<v Speaker 3>You use your left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a gross motor action.</v>

1602
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes people are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>lateralized than not,</v>

1603
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:54.950
<v Speaker 3>but the left hemisphere specialized for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fine grain.</v>

1604
01:21:54.951 --> 01:21:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Things that you know very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly yet.</v>

1605
01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.270
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left hemisphere,</v>

1606
01:21:59.690 --> 01:22:04.690
<v Speaker 3>well the left hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is associated with positive </v>

1607
01:22:04.690 --> 01:22:07.901
<v Speaker 3>emotion by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's specialized for operation </v>

1608
01:22:07.901 --> 01:22:11.610
<v Speaker 3>unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now what we might say is that you </v>

1609
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:12.230
<v Speaker 3>spend your whole life trying not to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right hemisphere turn on</v>

1610
01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:17.310
<v Speaker 3>because why would you want that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the monsters pop up.</v>

1611
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:22.550
<v Speaker 3>So you stay in explored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you also tentatively expand </v>

1612
01:22:22.591 --> 01:22:25.860
<v Speaker 3>its borders and the left hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to be involved in that too.</v>

1613
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:30.990
<v Speaker 3>So if you're curious about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's usually something usually something</v>

1614
01:22:30.991 --> 01:22:34.560
<v Speaker 3>minor enough so that it won't blow your </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire category structure if you explore</v>

1615
01:22:34.561 --> 01:22:35.040
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1616
01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:37.260
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you get unlucky and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1617
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:42.590
<v Speaker 3>eve in the garden of eden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go have a little chat with this </v>

1618
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:45.480
<v Speaker 3>little snake that seems to be of no </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance whatsoever,</v>

1619
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:47.880
<v Speaker 3>and it feeds you something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The apple,</v>

1620
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:51.330
<v Speaker 3>it feeds you something and bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything falls apart,</v>

1621
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:52.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You claps and you're,</v>

1622
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:56.100
<v Speaker 3>you're out there in history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're no longer in your old paradise.</v>

1623
01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:00.150
<v Speaker 3>So activation of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1624
01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:03.810
<v Speaker 3>well that's because positive emotion is </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with movement forward.</v>

1625
01:23:03.811 --> 01:23:07.450
<v Speaker 3>like if you're where you want to be and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are going well,</v>

1626
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 3>then your behavior should be activated </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that you go and get things.</v>

1627
01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the negative consequences of that</v>

1628
01:23:13.481 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 3>is that if you're really in a good mood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really happy,</v>

1629
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:21.421
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be impulsive and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistakes because you hear these dough </v>

1630
01:23:21.421 --> 01:23:22.510
<v Speaker 3>headed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very minor word.</v>

1631
01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:28.140
<v Speaker 3>people who are always pushing happiness </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the as the key measure for for </v>

1632
01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:29.530
<v Speaker 3>successful existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so</v>

1633
01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:35.550
<v Speaker 3>ill informed that it's embarrassing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that even happens.</v>

1634
01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Positive emotion makes people impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maniacs for example,</v>

1635
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:41.920
<v Speaker 3>which is really if that's mania,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1636
01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:44.490
<v Speaker 3>Bipolar disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're manic,</v>

1637
01:23:44.491 --> 01:23:47.580
<v Speaker 3>you're one happy person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way too happy.</v>

1638
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Everything is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing but wonderful things that are </v>

1639
01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.331
<v Speaker 3>beyond your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are going to happen to you and </v>

1640
01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:59.241
<v Speaker 3>they're going to happen fast and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're down to the mall to buy </v>

1641
01:23:59.241 --> 01:24:02.451
<v Speaker 3>everything you can possibly get your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands on because you have 100 uses for </v>

1642
01:24:02.451 --> 01:24:06.441
<v Speaker 3>everything and then a week later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you crash into your depressive </v>

1643
01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:09.630
<v Speaker 3>episode and you realize that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>$150,000</v>

1644
01:24:09.631 --> 01:24:11.910
<v Speaker 3>in debt and you've alienated everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know.</v>

1645
01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:14.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's untrammeled positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion.</v>

1646
01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.780
<v Speaker 3>So how about no,</v>

1647
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:21.670
<v Speaker 3>you're the appear index of positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion is no way of determining whether</v>

1648
01:24:21.671 --> 01:24:24.400
<v Speaker 3>or not a system is working properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even your own system,</v>

1649
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.340
<v Speaker 3>you need a balance between positive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative emotions.</v>

1650
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Plus positive emotions are absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhausting because if you're in a manic </v>

1651
01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:37.501
<v Speaker 3>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's time to get everything </v>

1652
01:24:37.501 --> 01:24:37.501
<v Speaker 3>good right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

1653
01:24:37.501 --> 01:24:40.120
<v Speaker 3>but you won't sleep for a week and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you die because you just burned yourself</v>

1654
01:24:40.121 --> 01:24:45.121
<v Speaker 3>to a crisp and so to be overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>enthusiastic about everything sounds </v>

1655
01:24:46.001 --> 01:24:51.001
<v Speaker 3>like a real blast and I've seen full </v>
<v Speaker 3>blown mannix and they're having plenty </v>

1656
01:24:51.001 --> 01:24:54.181
<v Speaker 3>of fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is not a pleasant thing to </v>

1657
01:24:54.181 --> 01:24:56.470
<v Speaker 3>behold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just all over the place and you </v>

1658
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.830
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1659
01:24:57.010 --> 01:24:59.470
<v Speaker 3>it's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really not good.</v>

1660
01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:04.471
<v Speaker 3>You need a balance between these two </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems because the whole world isn't </v>

1661
01:25:04.471 --> 01:25:07.540
<v Speaker 3>explored territory bursting with nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>but promise.</v>

1662
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.130
<v Speaker 3>That's not the world.</v>

1663
01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:14.670
<v Speaker 3>The world is that the bounded space a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit without absolute horror show </v>

1664
01:25:15.371 --> 01:25:20.371
<v Speaker 3>going out around the periphery and both </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your both systems need to be active </v>

1665
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:26.070
<v Speaker 3>in order to keep you balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People do unfortunately sustain damage </v>

1666
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:30.901
<v Speaker 3>sometimes to the left Prefrontal cortex </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for positive emotion or the </v>

1667
01:25:30.901 --> 01:25:33.220
<v Speaker 3>right prefrontal cortex responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative emotion,</v>

1668
01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:36.190
<v Speaker 3>and if you sustain right hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 3>prefontal damage,</v>

1669
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:41.191
<v Speaker 3>it makes you inappropriately happy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsive and your and your life just </v>

1670
01:25:41.191 --> 01:25:44.941
<v Speaker 3>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just spiraled downhill because you </v>

1671
01:25:44.941 --> 01:25:47.791
<v Speaker 3>make nothing but impulsive decisionS and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what the world world </v>

1672
01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:51.511
<v Speaker 3>consequence of that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you get drunk and be impulsive </v>

1673
01:25:51.511 --> 01:25:55.591
<v Speaker 3>for one night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can learn what the bloody </v>

1674
01:25:55.591 --> 01:25:57.331
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try living like that for a month </v>

1675
01:25:57.331 --> 01:26:00.840
<v Speaker 3>independently of iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing that's so </v>

1676
01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:04.111
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can blow out your left prefrontal </v>

1677
01:26:04.111 --> 01:26:05.900
<v Speaker 3>cortex and not much of a decrease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in crystallized intelligence,</v>

1678
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:09.320
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that you're running on </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing but sorry,</v>

1679
01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:14.380
<v Speaker 3>your right hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're running on nothing but positive </v>

1680
01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:14.630
<v Speaker 3>emotion is going to argue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You write it into the ground and then if</v>

1681
01:26:14.631 --> 01:26:19.631
<v Speaker 3>you're perhaps even more unlucky and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose the left prefrontal cortex,</v>

1682
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:24.800
<v Speaker 3>then you're permanently depressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's nothing but</v>

1683
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:31.340
<v Speaker 3>the unexplored manifesting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that if you take depressive,</v>

1684
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.400
<v Speaker 3>depressed people and you do eeg </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis,</v>

1685
01:26:34.401 --> 01:26:37.310
<v Speaker 3>that they have predominant lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>predominant,</v>

1686
01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:41.750
<v Speaker 3>resting right hemisphere eeg activation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1687
01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:48.220
<v Speaker 3>so that's roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why is this well unknown territory </v>

1688
01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.460
<v Speaker 3>known territory you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1689
01:26:49.461 --> 01:26:50.750
<v Speaker 3>is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1690
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.880
<v Speaker 3>it's real enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how your brain evolved.</v>

1691
01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:56.210
<v Speaker 3>That seems pretty damn real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then we can think about it.</v>

1692
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Sub cortically and we might as well do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1693
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:02.840
<v Speaker 3>This is mapped out on the hippocampus </v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1694
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:07.870
<v Speaker 3>most particularly by Jeffrey gray who is</v>
<v Speaker 3>influenced by soul glove and vinegar,</v>

1695
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:10.070
<v Speaker 3>dover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were also students have luria,</v>

1696
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:15.520
<v Speaker 3>Jeffrey Gray used cybernetic theory that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was developed by norbert wiener and </v>

1697
01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.600
<v Speaker 3>which has an ai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1698
01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:20.480
<v Speaker 3>which he was the father Of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

1699
01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.960
<v Speaker 3>And some of that was actually integrated</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well into peer jetty and thought </v>

1700
01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.740
<v Speaker 3>because piaget and white wiener,</v>
<v Speaker 3>norbert,</v>

1701
01:27:27.741 --> 01:27:30.350
<v Speaker 3>wiener and luria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

1702
01:27:30.351 --> 01:27:34.100
<v Speaker 3>all went to the same conference back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the early 19 twenties,</v>

1703
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:36.650
<v Speaker 3>mid 19 twenties and heard norbert wiener</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>

1704
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:41.890
<v Speaker 3>So that's how cybernetic theory got </v>
<v Speaker 3>built into some of these underlying </v>

1705
01:27:41.890 --> 01:27:43.310
<v Speaker 3>theories and sort of manifested itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

1706
01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 3>So gray gray uses a model very much like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this derived from cybernetic theory,</v>

1707
01:27:48.381 --> 01:27:50.540
<v Speaker 3>and so here's the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does the brain work?</v>

1708
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:52.250
<v Speaker 3>You have a target in mind</v>

1709
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
<v Speaker 3>and you aCt too to manifest the target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you act to transform the world into the </v>

1710
01:27:59.101 --> 01:28:04.101
<v Speaker 3>target and then you compare the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of your actions to the </v>

1711
01:28:04.101 --> 01:28:04.101
<v Speaker 3>target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they match,</v>

1712
01:28:04.101 --> 01:28:05.700
<v Speaker 3>then that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they don't match,</v>

1713
01:28:05.701 --> 01:28:07.770
<v Speaker 3>then that's what they were negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion comes from.</v>

1714
01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how does that work?</v>

1715
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:11.310
<v Speaker 3>The hippocampus seems to be central to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1716
01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.710
<v Speaker 3>So it detects mismatch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1717
01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.770
<v Speaker 3>So in the classic behavioral theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1718
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:21.240
<v Speaker 3>So this would be Grazed theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have your expectations of the world.</v>

1719
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:24.750
<v Speaker 3>So that would be your model and you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>your sensor input,</v>

1720
01:28:24.751 --> 01:28:29.751
<v Speaker 3>which iS the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the hippocampus is mapping one </v>

1721
01:28:29.751 --> 01:28:31.400
<v Speaker 3>onto the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one from a top downstream,</v>

1722
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:34.260
<v Speaker 3>one from a bottom uPstream and saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>match,</v>

1723
01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:35.130
<v Speaker 3>match,</v>
<v Speaker 3>match,</v>

1724
01:28:35.131 --> 01:28:37.230
<v Speaker 3>match,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as long as everything matches,</v>

1725
01:28:37.231 --> 01:28:40.080
<v Speaker 3>then the hippocampus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an oversimplification,</v>

1726
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:45.350
<v Speaker 3>keeps the subcortical emotional systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhibiteD because you don't need them </v>

1727
01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.380
<v Speaker 3>except for maybe my mild positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion to keep you moving forward.</v>

1728
01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:54.740
<v Speaker 3>If there's a mismatch that's anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anxiety system gets disinhibited </v>

1729
01:28:55.090 --> 01:28:56.810
<v Speaker 3>because it's on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't get activated,</v>

1730
01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:58.740
<v Speaker 3>gets disinhibited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that freezes you,</v>

1731
01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.960
<v Speaker 3>and all the other motivational systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>are prime.</v>

1732
01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.360
<v Speaker 3>God only knows what you're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do next.</v>

1733
01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:07.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then if you make a mistake,</v>

1734
01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:10.320
<v Speaker 3>given that scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to modify the world in order to</v>

1735
01:29:10.321 --> 01:29:13.410
<v Speaker 3>rectify the mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to modify your motor outputs so</v>

1736
01:29:13.411 --> 01:29:17.070
<v Speaker 3>that you put the world back in order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's basically grays model,</v>

1737
01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:22.700
<v Speaker 3>but gray model is insufficient because </v>
<v Speaker 3>gray presumes that what you're comparing</v>

1738
01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.030
<v Speaker 3>your expectation with is the real world,</v>

1739
01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:30.420
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have access to the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1740
01:29:30.421 --> 01:29:35.421
<v Speaker 3>What really happens is that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>compares the model of the world that you</v>

1741
01:29:35.941 --> 01:29:37.770
<v Speaker 3>want to have happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's desired,</v>

1742
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:42.120
<v Speaker 3>not expected with the model of the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you think is happening.</v>

1743
01:29:42.190 --> 01:29:47.190
<v Speaker 3>There are both models.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no direct contact with the </v>

1744
01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:47.970
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what that means,</v>

1745
01:29:47.971 --> 01:29:52.080
<v Speaker 3>and this is what's horrible about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if your model fails,</v>

1746
01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:57.081
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't only mean that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjust your expectation and change your </v>

1747
01:29:57.081 --> 01:30:01.461
<v Speaker 3>motor activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means you might have to bloody well </v>

1748
01:30:01.461 --> 01:30:04.131
<v Speaker 3>retool your perceptions well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot more horrifying than just </v>

1749
01:30:04.131 --> 01:30:06.360
<v Speaker 3>having to change your motor output.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you will be trained me,</v>

1750
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.930
<v Speaker 3>then I have to see you differently and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I've.</v>

1751
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:15.020
<v Speaker 3>If we've interacted a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've built up a hell of a model of you.</v>

1752
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:17.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's taken a tremendous amount of effort</v>

1753
01:30:17.131 --> 01:30:22.131
<v Speaker 3>to generate and I may have used that </v>
<v Speaker 3>model as a predicate for all sorts of </v>

1754
01:30:22.131 --> 01:30:26.241
<v Speaker 3>other plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you do with an intimate </v>

1755
01:30:26.241 --> 01:30:28.851
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then if you do something that </v>

1756
01:30:28.851 --> 01:30:31.940
<v Speaker 3>indicates our true mismatch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't only that I have to adjust my </v>

1757
01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:34.350
<v Speaker 3>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God only knows what I'm going to have to</v>

1758
01:30:34.351 --> 01:30:36.990
<v Speaker 3>retool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I may even have to retool my perceptions</v>

1759
01:30:36.991 --> 01:30:39.750
<v Speaker 3>of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a lot more gullible than I thought I</v>

1760
01:30:39.751 --> 01:30:40.740
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1761
01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:43.440
<v Speaker 3>and god only knows what the implications</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that are.</v>

1762
01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:48.600
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're close to me And you could do </v>

1763
01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:48.600
<v Speaker 3>this to me,</v>

1764
01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:53.110
<v Speaker 3>is that my flaw and environment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I carrying that into other </v>

1765
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:54.710
<v Speaker 3>relationships?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an absolute catastrophe and so gray</v>

1766
01:30:54.711 --> 01:30:59.711
<v Speaker 3>actually underestimated the degree of </v>
<v Speaker 3>severity of mismatch because he only </v>

1767
01:30:59.711 --> 01:30:59.711
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1768
01:30:59.711 --> 01:31:04.460
<v Speaker 3>it was motor output and and and re and </v>
<v Speaker 3>re world adjusting.</v>

1769
01:31:04.461 --> 01:31:09.461
<v Speaker 3>That would have to be repaired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not perception because like most </v>

1770
01:31:09.461 --> 01:31:12.671
<v Speaker 3>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the behaviors had this idea of </v>

1771
01:31:12.671 --> 01:31:12.671
<v Speaker 3>stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1772
01:31:12.671 --> 01:31:13.910
<v Speaker 3>The stimulus produces the response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1773
01:31:13.911 --> 01:31:16.130
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what stimulus?</v>

1774
01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never went there.</v>

1775
01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:20.270
<v Speaker 3>They just assumed that the stimulus </v>
<v Speaker 3>spoke for itself,</v>

1776
01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:25.450
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the fundamental weakness of </v>

1777
01:31:25.450 --> 01:31:27.881
<v Speaker 3>behavioral theory is that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>they could get rid of the mind was </v>

1778
01:31:27.881 --> 01:31:29.780
<v Speaker 3>because they hid it invisibly inside the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the stimulus,</v>

1779
01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:32.690
<v Speaker 3>which is all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just something that was a sense,</v>

1780
01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.860
<v Speaker 3>like a piece of sense data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that had motivation built into it.</v>

1781
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1782
01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:42.260
<v Speaker 3>you know you can't do tHat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The motivation.</v>

1783
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:45.620
<v Speaker 3>You can put the motivation into object,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it's no longer an object.</v>

1784
01:31:45.710 --> 01:31:50.230
<v Speaker 3>It's something completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1785
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:51.580
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's stop there.</v>

1786
01:31:51.581 --> 01:31:56.581
<v Speaker 3>When you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you a bunch of </v>

1787
01:31:56.581 --> 01:31:56.581
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1788
01:31:56.581 --> 01:31:58.990
<v Speaker 3>so we'll break for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine what happens.</v>

1789
01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 3>The civilization</v>

1790
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.420
<v Speaker 2>develops and develops out of an amalgam </v>
<v Speaker 2>of tribal organizations,</v>

1791
01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:08.200
<v Speaker 2>and so each of those tribes has their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own god,</v>

1792
01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 2>which has their own sort of imaginative </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and their attempt to make sense</v>

1793
01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:16.981
<v Speaker 2>out of the moral landscape of being and </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath all of those representations </v>

1794
01:32:17.831 --> 01:32:22.831
<v Speaker 2>is a pattern and the reason there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern there is because all of those </v>

1795
01:32:22.831 --> 01:32:24.490
<v Speaker 2>tribes are made up of people and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be.</v>

1796
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:27.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a domain within which </v>
<v Speaker 2>variation is going to occur.</v>

1797
01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:32.350
<v Speaker 2>So if we're going to set up a structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that works across time,</v>

1798
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:36.670
<v Speaker 2>it's going to at least be roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on the same structures that a</v>

1799
01:32:36.671 --> 01:32:41.671
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy is predicated on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be predicated on tHe same </v>

1800
01:32:41.671 --> 01:32:43.600
<v Speaker 2>patterns of interactions that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize a chimpanzee troop.</v>

1801
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1802
01:32:44.490 --> 01:32:46.270
<v Speaker 2>there's this basic biological,</v>

1803
01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:53.630
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a realm of biological necessity </v>

1804
01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:57.051
<v Speaker 2>that constitutes the boundary space </v>
<v Speaker 2>within which human interactions that </v>

1805
01:32:57.051 --> 01:32:57.180
<v Speaker 2>have to take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1806
01:32:57.330 --> 01:33:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I can't be so violent that I kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in my tribe that's not gonna be</v>

1807
01:33:01.291 --> 01:33:03.700
<v Speaker 2>very helpful because I'm in tribal </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures,</v>

1808
01:33:03.701 --> 01:33:05.970
<v Speaker 2>so without the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do?</v>

1809
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:11.390
<v Speaker 2>And so I have to be vaguely acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 2>to other people because otherwise </v>

1810
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:12.990
<v Speaker 2>they'll kill me even if I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really powerful,</v>

1811
01:33:12.991 --> 01:33:17.991
<v Speaker 2>they'll take me down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so because I have to deal with you </v>

1812
01:33:17.991 --> 01:33:21.771
<v Speaker 2>and you and you and you and you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to modify each other continually </v>

1813
01:33:21.771 --> 01:33:22.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and within parameters.</v>

1814
01:33:22.261 --> 01:33:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Now the parameters are wide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not nonexistent.</v>

1815
01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.750
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see what those parameters are.</v>

1816
01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Genuinely if you look at something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a wolf pack or a chimpanzee troop,</v>

1817
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:36.830
<v Speaker 2>because those are stable across really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the structure itself is stable across at</v>

1818
01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:40.680
<v Speaker 2>least hundreds of thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not millions of years.</v>

1819
01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.870
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's um,</v>

1820
01:33:43.230 --> 01:33:46.060
<v Speaker 2>so frans de waal shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for examPle,</v>

1821
01:33:46.061 --> 01:33:47.460
<v Speaker 2>that with the chimpanzee troops,</v>

1822
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:53.130
<v Speaker 2>if you have a pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he studied them mostly at the arnhem zoo</v>

1823
01:33:53.190 --> 01:33:56.160
<v Speaker 2>and I would recommend his writings </v>
<v Speaker 2>highly diwal d,</v>

1824
01:33:56.161 --> 01:33:58.200
<v Speaker 2>e,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w a l,</v>

1825
01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:03.540
<v Speaker 2>m.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's interested in the prototypical </v>

1826
01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:06.651
<v Speaker 2>moral behavior among chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very interesting study and what </v>

1827
01:34:06.651 --> 01:34:11.331
<v Speaker 2>he's showed for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you have a particularly the </v>

1828
01:34:11.331 --> 01:34:12.840
<v Speaker 2>the dominant dominance hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees is male,</v>

1829
01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 2>a female dominance hierarchy to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>overlaps the mail and some of the </v>

1830
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.660
<v Speaker 2>females are more dominant than many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the males,</v>

1831
01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.530
<v Speaker 2>but the fundamental structure looks like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's patriarchal,</v>

1832
01:34:22.531 --> 01:34:26.130
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking among chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you put a really rough,</v>

1833
01:34:26.190 --> 01:34:28.380
<v Speaker 2>tough barbaric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal dictator,</v>

1834
01:34:28.381 --> 01:34:30.720
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1835
01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:35.810
<v Speaker 2>his reign tends to be unstable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent because he isn't good at </v>

1836
01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:39.390
<v Speaker 2>negotiating social support and so he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have any.</v>

1837
01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:44.070
<v Speaker 2>And so that means two chimpanzees that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are friends can take them out.</v>

1838
01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.390
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what happens.</v>

1839
01:34:45.630 --> 01:34:50.630
<v Speaker 2>And so the desk bought chimp is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unstable leader and they've all shown </v>

1840
01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:55.700
<v Speaker 2>that the more stable chimp leaders are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more chimpanzee.</v>

1841
01:34:55.701 --> 01:34:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Attarian I guess Would be right word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not humanitarian.</v>

1842
01:34:59.300 --> 01:34:59.910
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1843
01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:03.090
<v Speaker 2>they do know they have friends and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1844
01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:07.580
<v Speaker 2>friendship is predicated on reciprocity </v>
<v Speaker 2>even among chimpanzees.</v>

1845
01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:12.470
<v Speaker 2>And so if a predicate of power is </v>
<v Speaker 2>reciprocity,</v>

1846
01:35:12.471 --> 01:35:15.680
<v Speaker 2>then that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>alleviates the dictatorial tendency.</v>

1847
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:18.100
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my,</v>

1848
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:21.950
<v Speaker 2>my point is when a great civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerges,</v>

1849
01:35:21.951 --> 01:35:24.200
<v Speaker 2>it emerges from the amalgam of tribal </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>

1850
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:29.650
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and each of the tribal groups has their </v>

1851
01:35:29.650 --> 01:35:29.650
<v Speaker 2>own ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that ethic is,</v>

1852
01:35:29.650 --> 01:35:31.640
<v Speaker 2>isn't the ethics aren't entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate from one another.</v>

1853
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.120
<v Speaker 2>That's why tribes can trade because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do trade,</v>

1854
01:35:35.150 --> 01:35:35.750
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1855
01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:38.450
<v Speaker 2>they interact with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of half.</v>

1856
01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how here too,</v>

1857
01:35:42.411 --> 01:35:46.640
<v Speaker 2>for separated tribes begin to trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know,</v>

1858
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:51.880
<v Speaker 2>you meet each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cross the river and it's like you got </v>

1859
01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:54.620
<v Speaker 2>your bows and arrows and someone makes a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake and it's like warfare and so,</v>

1860
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:58.100
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to start the damn war</v>
<v Speaker 2>because maybe you'll die.</v>

1861
01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:03.100
<v Speaker 2>So you're sitting there with your bow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and arrows watching these guys and now </v>

1862
01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.270
<v Speaker 2>you know they're there and so then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to your tribe and you think,</v>

1863
01:36:05.271 --> 01:36:10.271
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are we going to do about </v>

1864
01:36:10.271 --> 01:36:10.271
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one solution is,</v>

1865
01:36:10.271 --> 01:36:10.271
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's find out where they are.</v>

1866
01:36:10.271 --> 01:36:11.200
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll go in there at night and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll like,</v>

1867
01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:13.580
<v Speaker 2>we'll kill a bunch of theM are will wipe</v>
<v Speaker 2>them out or something like that.</v>

1868
01:36:13.581 --> 01:36:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Or another solution might be did you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the neat stuff they had?</v>

1869
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:22.450
<v Speaker 2>And so then what do you do is you find a</v>
<v Speaker 2>border area and you go and you put some </v>

1870
01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:26.150
<v Speaker 2>things out there that are valuable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you run away and then you watch from the</v>

1871
01:36:26.151 --> 01:36:31.151
<v Speaker 2>trees and you see what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 2>these other people discover these </v>

1872
01:36:31.151 --> 01:36:34.991
<v Speaker 2>valuable things that you left there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're like little under </v>

1873
01:36:34.991 --> 01:36:38.710
<v Speaker 2>psychopathic side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pick it all up and giggle and run </v>

1874
01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:38.710
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1875
01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:39.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's the end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they have any sense,</v>

1876
01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:44.650
<v Speaker 2>what they do is they leave some cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff on the ground too and then they </v>

1877
01:36:44.650 --> 01:36:46.070
<v Speaker 2>run off and then you can go pick up </v>
<v Speaker 2>their cool stuff and leave.</v>

1878
01:36:46.071 --> 01:36:50.750
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like step one in the trust</v>
<v Speaker 2>process and then maybe you do that,</v>

1879
01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:51.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a year.</v>

1880
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And it starts to fall into a cadence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you know,</v>

1881
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:58.100
<v Speaker 2>you get a little closer when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>washing,</v>

1882
01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:03.130
<v Speaker 2>watching in the bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe one day you have enough </v>

1883
01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:03.130
<v Speaker 2>courage to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sending your biggest ugliest guy out</v>

1884
01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:03.920
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1885
01:37:03.921 --> 01:37:06.980
<v Speaker 2>they do the same and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look at each other and finally they</v>

1886
01:37:06.981 --> 01:37:11.981
<v Speaker 2>shake hands or something like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade and then well then you've got a </v>

1887
01:37:11.981 --> 01:37:14.951
<v Speaker 2>trading relationship established and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see in that the emergence of a,</v>

1888
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:20.590
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiated consensual moral structure </v>

1889
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:22.040
<v Speaker 2>that allows trading to take place.</v>

1890
01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:25.160
<v Speaker 2>And there's gonna be rules emerge right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

1891
01:37:25.161 --> 01:37:30.161
<v Speaker 2>which is well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better leave me something that's of </v>

1892
01:37:30.161 --> 01:37:32.870
<v Speaker 2>approximately equal value or I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to play the game again.</v>

1893
01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:36.380
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that's so cool is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we only play a game once,</v>

1894
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I can do whatever I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

1895
01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.920
<v Speaker 2>that's what psychopaths do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They play with game once and then they </v>

1896
01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:45.890
<v Speaker 2>go play with someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we're going to play the same game</v>

1897
01:37:45.891 --> 01:37:50.330
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the dominance hierarchy across</v>

1898
01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:55.331
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a different rule for playing a </v>

1899
01:37:55.331 --> 01:37:57.821
<v Speaker 2>game once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there is for playing a game a </v>

1900
01:37:57.821 --> 01:37:57.821
<v Speaker 2>thousand times</v>

1901
01:37:57.821 --> 01:38:00.510
<v Speaker 3>and if we're in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game we want to play is one that can</v>

1902
01:38:00.511 --> 01:38:04.110
<v Speaker 3>be duplicated a thousand times and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's really tight constraints on that</v>

1903
01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 3>and so that's the origin that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>consider that the biological,</v>

1904
01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.720
<v Speaker 3>it's not even biological exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's predicated in biology,</v>

1905
01:38:12.721 --> 01:38:14.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's a consequence of continual </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction.</v>

1906
01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:18.240
<v Speaker 3>The ethic emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the rats that I told you about</v>

1907
01:38:18.241 --> 01:38:21.330
<v Speaker 3>that you knoW the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rats that play with each other,</v>

1908
01:38:21.331 --> 01:38:24.690
<v Speaker 3>the big roundhouse to let the little rat</v>
<v Speaker 3>win 30 percent of the time or the little</v>

1909
01:38:24.691 --> 01:38:27.570
<v Speaker 3>rat won't play anymore and so because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the little rat,</v>

1910
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:31.320
<v Speaker 3>that's the biological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biological framing,</v>

1911
01:38:31.321 --> 01:38:33.870
<v Speaker 3>the limitation is the little rat doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to lose all the time.</v>

1912
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:37.050
<v Speaker 3>That just produces negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun.</v>

1913
01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not motivating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why would the little rat go play </v>

1914
01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:42.080
<v Speaker 3>again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1915
01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.551
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the constraints on our interactions are </v>

1916
01:38:46.551 --> 01:38:49.251
<v Speaker 3>our biological constraints and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest themselves in a patterned way </v>

1917
01:38:49.251 --> 01:38:53.181
<v Speaker 3>across time and there isn't any </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between you and me </v>

1918
01:38:53.181 --> 01:38:53.181
<v Speaker 3>interacting across time.</v>

1919
01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Then there is between you and me acting </v>
<v Speaker 3>say in the next hour or so with everyone</v>

1920
01:38:57.901 --> 01:38:59.820
<v Speaker 3>in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing.</v>

1921
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 3>It's just continual human interactions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the ethic emerges from that.</v>

1922
01:39:03.630 --> 01:39:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Now different groups are going to code </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ethic differently,</v>

1923
01:39:07.081 --> 01:39:08.880
<v Speaker 3>so they're going to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>different images,</v>

1924
01:39:08.881 --> 01:39:11.430
<v Speaker 3>stick representations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and different stories.</v>

1925
01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things they're trying to </v>

1926
01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:17.330
<v Speaker 3>figure out is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1927
01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:18.570
<v Speaker 3>let's do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do it in the tribal way.</v>

1928
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:23.990
<v Speaker 3>You have to do this inside the tribe to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have 100 people and 10 of them are </v>

1929
01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.340
<v Speaker 3>leaders in one way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then out of that 10,</v>

1930
01:39:29.341 --> 01:39:29.760
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1931
01:39:29.761 --> 01:39:33.870
<v Speaker 3>who's the who's the best person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to have a hierarchy of value</v>

1932
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:37.140
<v Speaker 3>to determine what the most important </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of the ethic is,</v>

1933
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:42.470
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to be something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust because that's the predicate for </v>

1934
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.470
<v Speaker 3>continued interaction.</v>

1935
01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Trustworthiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not any real,</v>

1936
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:47.040
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really any different than honesty.</v>

1937
01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:49.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not really any different from </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth.</v>

1938
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:54.830
<v Speaker 3>So there's a really powerful necessity </v>
<v Speaker 3>for honesty to emerge as a,</v>

1939
01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:58.410
<v Speaker 3>as a canonical value carrying might </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerge,</v>

1940
01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:02.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power might emerge,</v>

1941
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:04.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ability to exert physical power,</v>

1942
01:40:04.891 --> 01:40:07.410
<v Speaker 3>especially in places where war is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>continual,</v>

1943
01:40:07.890 --> 01:40:09.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is continually likely.</v>

1944
01:40:09.571 --> 01:40:14.571
<v Speaker 3>And in lots of tribal landscapes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just nonstop tribal trade in </v>

1945
01:40:14.571 --> 01:40:14.850
<v Speaker 3>warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1946
01:40:15.090 --> 01:40:20.090
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can see how different ethics </v>

1947
01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:20.090
<v Speaker 3>would eMerge as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as canonical depending to some degree on</v>

1948
01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:24.801
<v Speaker 3>the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But trust is a really crucial one </v>

1949
01:40:24.801 --> 01:40:24.801
<v Speaker 3>because without that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships.</v>

1950
01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you've got tribe and it's got its </v>

1951
01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:30.380
<v Speaker 3>tribal gods and its and its traditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of that.</v>

1952
01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:35.010
<v Speaker 3>It's representation of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being in its images and stories.</v>

1953
01:40:35.011 --> 01:40:37.080
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got try b and you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried seeing,</v>

1954
01:40:37.130 --> 01:40:40.290
<v Speaker 3>you've got tribe d and now they're all </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming together.</v>

1955
01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.460
<v Speaker 3>So what happens exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1956
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:50.630
<v Speaker 3>the tribes can go to war or they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk and we're,</v>

1957
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:53.530
<v Speaker 3>we're thinking about a communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be extending across</v>

1958
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.260
<v Speaker 2>thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your beliefs.</v>

1959
01:40:56.261 --> 01:40:58.990
<v Speaker 2>I have my beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can overwhelm you,</v>

1960
01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I can subsume you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even then I'm likely to get </v>

1961
01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:04.690
<v Speaker 2>indigestion from doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

1962
01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:09.691
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to wipe out a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs without wiping out all of the </v>

1963
01:41:09.691 --> 01:41:12.490
<v Speaker 2>people and that kind of nullifies the </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility of unification.</v>

1964
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:18.390
<v Speaker 2>The more there are a view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better you can defend yourself </v>

1965
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:21.190
<v Speaker 2>against other organizations that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to be larger.</v>

1966
01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:26.340
<v Speaker 2>So there's a powerful self preservation </v>
<v Speaker 2>impetus to cooperation and so one of the</v>

1967
01:41:27.611 --> 01:41:32.611
<v Speaker 2>things you see happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of the stories in the old </v>

1968
01:41:32.611 --> 01:41:32.611
<v Speaker 2>testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1969
01:41:32.611 --> 01:41:35.590
<v Speaker 2>we know this about genesis in particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there were at least this is.</v>

1970
01:41:35.710 --> 01:41:39.250
<v Speaker 2>This is relatively recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so say for 3000 years ago,</v>

1971
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:41.380
<v Speaker 2>not 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1972
01:41:41.890 --> 01:41:44.890
<v Speaker 2>There were two different stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two different stories in,</v>

1973
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:50.070
<v Speaker 2>in the genesis account told by two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different storytellers and people who </v>

1974
01:41:50.441 --> 01:41:55.441
<v Speaker 2>are very good at textual analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to separate them and they </v>

1975
01:41:55.441 --> 01:41:55.450
<v Speaker 2>were put together.</v>

1976
01:41:56.530 --> 01:41:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I don'T remember when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1977
01:41:57.941 --> 01:42:02.080
<v Speaker 2>it's probably about something between </v>
<v Speaker 2>2000 and 3000 years ago.</v>

1978
01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:07.260
<v Speaker 2>They were put together by what appeared </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a single editor and so he took </v>

1979
01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:09.730
<v Speaker 2>these disparate accounts and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize them into something that looked</v>

1980
01:42:09.731 --> 01:42:14.731
<v Speaker 2>like a logical narrative and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the process by which different </v>

1981
01:42:14.731 --> 01:42:19.410
<v Speaker 2>tribal representations of the world were</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought into something under which the </v>

1982
01:42:20.021 --> 01:42:25.021
<v Speaker 2>tribes as you as a unit could </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously exist so you can think </v>

1983
01:42:25.021 --> 01:42:26.910
<v Speaker 2>about it as a competition between </v>
<v Speaker 2>images,</v>

1984
01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.920
<v Speaker 2>stick representations across time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the emergence of some unifying </v>

1985
01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.941
<v Speaker 2>narrative that that captures the key </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of all of them well enough to </v>

1986
01:42:35.941 --> 01:42:40.621
<v Speaker 2>bring them into some sort of union and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be a story with motivational </v>

1987
01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:45.061
<v Speaker 2>power because otherwise no one will call</v>
<v Speaker 2>it non to it and it has to be a story </v>

1988
01:42:45.061 --> 01:42:48.640
<v Speaker 2>that keeps uncertainty at bay because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise it doesn't have any utility.</v>

1989
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:53.760
<v Speaker 2>So it has to be a functional story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to tell you a story like </v>

1990
01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.240
<v Speaker 2>that and just the story of marduk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the mesopotamian story.</v>

1991
01:42:55.690 --> 01:43:00.690
<v Speaker 2>And mesopotamia is one of the earliest </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations and it emerged as a </v>

1992
01:43:00.690 --> 01:43:03.550
<v Speaker 2>consequence of the amalgam of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of middle eastern tribes.</v>

1993
01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:08.820
<v Speaker 2>So the over a very long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could thank the gods of all of these</v>

1994
01:43:09.131 --> 01:43:11.830
<v Speaker 2>tribes were worrying in an abstract </v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

1995
01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:16.890
<v Speaker 2>in a conceptual space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would be the space of </v>

1996
01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:16.950
<v Speaker 2>argumentation and conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And out of that a,</v>

1997
01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 2>a story emerged and this is the medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>story and it's one of a host of similar </v>

1998
01:43:22.421 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 2>medical stories that came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle east,</v>

1999
01:43:24.401 --> 01:43:26.650
<v Speaker 2>one of which is the account in genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2000
01:43:26.651 --> 01:43:31.651
<v Speaker 2>So here's The story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are two primary day at east to </v>

2001
01:43:33.401 --> 01:43:37.270
<v Speaker 2>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>app suit and tie I'm at now.</v>

2002
01:43:37.271 --> 01:43:39.730
<v Speaker 2>In order to understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2003
01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:43.000
<v Speaker 2>here's how the mesopotamians </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize the world.</v>

2004
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:49.870
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it a disc that salt water.</v>

2005
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2006
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:57.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens when you go to the end of </v>

2007
01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:57.160
<v Speaker 3>the continent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salt water everywhere,</v>

2008
01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:57.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So wherever you go,</v>

2009
01:43:57.650 --> 01:44:02.650
<v Speaker 3>you run into salt water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the desk that surrounds </v>

2010
01:44:02.650 --> 01:44:02.650
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2011
01:44:02.650 --> 01:44:05.390
<v Speaker 3>why Is it a disk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world is a dome on a desk.</v>

2012
01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2013
01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.260
<v Speaker 3>say you're standing in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>

2014
01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:14.860
<v Speaker 3>What does the world look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dome on a disk.</v>

2015
01:44:16.190 --> 01:44:18.440
<v Speaker 3>So it's a phenomenal logical </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>

2016
01:44:19.190 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 3>So the bottom of the dome is the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>on which you stand.</v>

2017
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:26.810
<v Speaker 3>What happens if you dig deep water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh water.</v>

2018
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:31.930
<v Speaker 3>So the dome of the land is on a disk of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh water.</v>

2019
01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:34.280
<v Speaker 3>What happens if you go to the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the land?</v>

2020
01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:39.340
<v Speaker 3>You run into saltwater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dome of the land is on a disk of </v>

2021
01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:39.500
<v Speaker 3>fresh water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a disk of salt water.</v>

2022
01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the two gods.</v>

2023
01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:47.380
<v Speaker 3>Timeout is god and salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Water and absolute has guarded </v>

2024
01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:50.610
<v Speaker 3>freshwater and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happened stamps in some sense </v>

2025
01:44:50.610 --> 01:44:54.011
<v Speaker 3>because that's the masculine and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminine and they could be attributed </v>

2026
01:44:54.011 --> 01:44:55.780
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different geographical </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>

2027
01:44:55.781 --> 01:44:56.630
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

2028
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:02.030
<v Speaker 2>see if I can think of a good example.</v>

2029
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:08.270
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just leave that for now.</v>

2030
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2031
01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the two primary gods are absent,</v>

2032
01:45:12.831 --> 01:45:17.831
<v Speaker 2>and timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Timeout is female and absolute is male </v>

2033
01:45:17.831 --> 01:45:21.550
<v Speaker 2>and there are locked together in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inseparable embrace.</v>

2034
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you understand that?</v>

2035
01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Easy yin and yang?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same idea.</v>

2036
01:45:27.130 --> 01:45:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Here is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's another representation.</v>

2037
01:45:28.781 --> 01:45:33.781
<v Speaker 2>This is a cool one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a couple of them here that are </v>

2038
01:45:33.781 --> 01:45:34.270
<v Speaker 2>really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from China,</v>

2039
01:45:36.190 --> 01:45:41.190
<v Speaker 2>so this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is foxy and new.</v>

2040
01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I think I've got that right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2041
01:45:43.061 --> 01:45:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I just love that reference is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>insanely cool.</v>

2042
01:45:45.701 --> 01:45:50.701
<v Speaker 2>This representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see sort of the primary mother </v>

2043
01:45:51.521 --> 01:45:56.521
<v Speaker 2>and father of humanity emerging from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this underlying snake like entity with </v>

2044
01:45:56.521 --> 01:45:59.690
<v Speaker 2>it's tails tangled together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a ripper.</v>

2045
01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's very complicated to </v>

2046
01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:05.110
<v Speaker 2>explain why I really believe that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of dna,</v>

2047
01:46:06.490 --> 01:46:08.980
<v Speaker 2>so and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that representation,</v>

2048
01:46:08.981 --> 01:46:12.340
<v Speaker 2>that entwined double helix that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

2049
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:17.550
<v Speaker 2>You can see it in our australian </v>
<v Speaker 2>aboriginal art and I'm using the </v>

2050
01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:20.911
<v Speaker 2>australians as an example because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were isolated in Australia for like </v>

2051
01:46:20.911 --> 01:46:20.911
<v Speaker 2>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2052
01:46:20.911 --> 01:46:24.160
<v Speaker 2>They're the most archaic people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were ever discovered and they have clear</v>

2053
01:46:24.161 --> 01:46:26.830
<v Speaker 2>representations of these double helix </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures in their art.</v>

2054
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:29.650
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are the two giant serpents out</v>

2055
01:46:29.651 --> 01:46:31.960
<v Speaker 2>of which the world is made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking.</v>

2056
01:46:32.230 --> 01:46:34.750
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that in the staff of asclepius,</v>

2057
01:46:34.751 --> 01:46:37.060
<v Speaker 2>which is the healing symbol that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physicians use.</v>

2058
01:46:37.061 --> 01:46:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Although usually that's only one snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's too.</v>

2059
01:46:40.450 --> 01:46:41.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2060
01:46:42.130 --> 01:46:42.880
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2061
01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:46.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a chinese representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a,</v>

2062
01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the representation.</v>

2063
01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:53.460
<v Speaker 2>We talked about the egyptian story the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day,</v>

2064
01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:56.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about isis and those cyrus.</v>

2065
01:46:58.050 --> 01:47:03.050
<v Speaker 2>So there they are cobras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their tails are twined together because </v>

2066
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:03.050
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they emerge out of that.</v>

2067
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:07.620
<v Speaker 2>That's the dragon of chaos that </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself as culture in nature.</v>

2068
01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:10.920
<v Speaker 2>That's the representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unbelievably cool.</v>

2069
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:13.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2070
01:47:13.051 --> 01:47:15.030
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to back to,</v>

2071
01:47:15.031 --> 01:47:17.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the mesopotamian story.</v>

2072
01:47:17.730 --> 01:47:21.510
<v Speaker 2>So absent entire amount or they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>primordial deities,</v>

2073
01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:25.680
<v Speaker 2>nature and culture there in twined </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and they give rise to the,</v>

2074
01:47:25.890 --> 01:47:28.890
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to their first category of children.</v>

2075
01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:34.130
<v Speaker 2>and those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you could think about them as </v>

2076
01:47:34.130 --> 01:47:36.660
<v Speaker 2>the elder gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what do they represent?</v>

2077
01:47:36.661 --> 01:47:41.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is what did the gods </v>

2078
01:47:41.661 --> 01:47:43.131
<v Speaker 2>represent and they represent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They represent sort of like primary </v>

2079
01:47:43.131 --> 01:47:43.890
<v Speaker 2>modes of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

2080
01:47:43.891 --> 01:47:47.430
<v Speaker 2>So think about aries or mars' the god of</v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

2081
01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a representation of single minded</v>

2082
01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:55.160
<v Speaker 2>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can think about error oss </v>

2083
01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:57.750
<v Speaker 2>or venus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a primary representation of </v>

2084
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.750
<v Speaker 2>sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

2085
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:59.340
<v Speaker 2>well why are those deities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2086
01:47:59.341 --> 01:48:04.341
<v Speaker 2>that's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live forever and they control you </v>

2087
01:48:04.341 --> 01:48:05.340
<v Speaker 2>and their personalities.</v>

2088
01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:08.010
<v Speaker 2>So that's that for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2089
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:13.070
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you know and you know that </v>

2090
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.200
<v Speaker 2>you're under the sway of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not in control of yourself.</v>

2091
01:48:13.201 --> 01:48:16.050
<v Speaker 2>If you're under the sway of of erotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>possession,</v>

2092
01:48:16.051 --> 01:48:21.051
<v Speaker 2>you make a fool out of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a tool of the power that drives </v>

2093
01:48:21.051 --> 01:48:22.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the continuation of the species forward.</v>

2094
01:48:22.770 --> 01:48:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Hunger is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any primordial motivational drive we've </v>

2095
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:30.330
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized in this class as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>

2096
01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:33.350
<v Speaker 2>but those are transcendent personalities</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their returnal.</v>

2097
01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:36.060
<v Speaker 2>They there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why the greeks,</v>

2098
01:48:36.061 --> 01:48:41.061
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that human beings were just the </v>

2099
01:48:41.061 --> 01:48:43.190
<v Speaker 2>play things of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is echoed in the </v>

2100
01:48:43.190 --> 01:48:46.011
<v Speaker 2>mesopotamian story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you can think about it sort of </v>

2101
01:48:46.011 --> 01:48:48.270
<v Speaker 2>neuro developmentally as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that out of out of nothing,</v>

2102
01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:53.660
<v Speaker 2>out of culture and nature emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say the two year old two year old is a </v>

2103
01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:57.711
<v Speaker 2>battle ground of primary motivational </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces and something like that is being </v>

2104
01:48:57.711 --> 01:49:00.870
<v Speaker 2>hinted at in the mesopotamian creation </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

2105
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:05.990
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first progeny of the fundamental </v>

2106
01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:11.330
<v Speaker 2>union of chaos and order app suit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tie math is the proliferation of these </v>

2107
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:16.280
<v Speaker 2>primary motivational forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sorta like the titans or the or </v>

2108
01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:16.370
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2109
01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:19.160
<v Speaker 2>what did what it was that the greek gods</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept in the,</v>

2110
01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:21.330
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath the mountain.</v>

2111
01:49:21.331 --> 01:49:24.000
<v Speaker 2>That's zeus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the name of that?</v>

2112
01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.960
<v Speaker 2>They're like prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are earthquakes and fires and that</v>

2113
01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:30.110
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're primordial forces.</v>

2114
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

2115
01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:34.440
<v Speaker 2>so these children are produced and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens?</v>

2116
01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:40.280
<v Speaker 2>They're very noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They run around doing all sorts of </v>

2117
01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:42.231
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could think about them as grown up </v>

2118
01:49:42.231 --> 01:49:42.231
<v Speaker 2>to year olds causing all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>

2119
01:49:42.231 --> 01:49:46.100
<v Speaker 2>The first thing they do is kill appsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make their home on his corpse.</v>

2120
01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:52.620
<v Speaker 2>That's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the story doesn't say much about </v>

2121
01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:52.620
<v Speaker 2>aps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

2122
01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture,</v>

2123
01:49:52.690 --> 01:49:57.690
<v Speaker 2>daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a prop primary culture data is not </v>

2124
01:49:57.690 --> 01:49:58.540
<v Speaker 2>elaborated up that much in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mesopotamian story.</v>

2125
01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:03.750
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's probably because at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time of the mesopotamian </v>

2126
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:07.591
<v Speaker 2>civilization was new enough so that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hadn't mapped the mythology of </v>

2127
01:50:08.471 --> 01:50:10.450
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The egyptians did that much more.</v>

2128
01:50:10.451 --> 01:50:13.510
<v Speaker 2>And I know I told you that story first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just how it goes.</v>

2129
01:50:13.810 --> 01:50:18.810
<v Speaker 2>So the elder gods make their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their home on the corpse of absolute </v>

2130
01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:20.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

2131
01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2132
01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:25.870
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of how he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You inhabit the corpse of culture,</v>

2133
01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:28.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the dad passed and,</v>

2134
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.630
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just the dead past.</v>

2135
01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:35.680
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's very cool about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mesopotamian story is that the elder</v>

2136
01:50:35.681 --> 01:50:39.800
<v Speaker 2>gods are foolish enough to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the death of god by the way.</v>

2137
01:50:39.801 --> 01:50:44.801
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no different from what nisha </v>

2138
01:50:44.801 --> 01:50:44.801
<v Speaker 2>pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has been going on for a very,</v>

2139
01:50:44.801 --> 01:50:47.410
<v Speaker 2>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This collapse of belief systems,</v>

2140
01:50:48.850 --> 01:50:53.850
<v Speaker 2>they kill it carelessly because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand what it is that they </v>

2141
01:50:53.850 --> 01:50:54.200
<v Speaker 2>need to survive it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill it carelessly,</v>

2142
01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.590
<v Speaker 2>carelessly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they try to live on the corpse.</v>

2143
01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what the postmodernists </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2144
01:51:00.191 --> 01:51:03.070
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they assume we have this,</v>

2145
01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:08.100
<v Speaker 2>this tremendous system of value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been built up across time and it </v>

2146
01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:13.261
<v Speaker 2>sustains us and everyone is criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and criticizing and trying to destroy</v>

2147
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:19.291
<v Speaker 2>it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in it's corpse and that will </v>

2148
01:51:19.291 --> 01:51:23.850
<v Speaker 2>nourish us forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be replenished and there's </v>

2149
01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:26.410
<v Speaker 2>nothing in the postmodernist philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can act to replenish anyways.</v>

2150
01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:32.010
<v Speaker 2>They kill app.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens when you kill order?</v>

2151
01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Chaos comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tie a math.</v>

2152
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Now this is time out</v>

2153
01:51:40.710 --> 01:51:41.100
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

2154
01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 2>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the dragon.</v>

2155
01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:45.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2156
01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:50.340
<v Speaker 2>it's you think out of this fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>reptilian treasure bearer culture and </v>

2157
01:51:52.971 --> 01:51:56.380
<v Speaker 2>nature emerge and they can pull back </v>
<v Speaker 2>into that very rapidly.</v>

2158
01:51:56.381 --> 01:51:58.690
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've all seen sleeping beauty.</v>

2159
01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:03.780
<v Speaker 2>I presumed the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of you have seen sleeping </v>

2160
01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:03.780
<v Speaker 2>beauty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The disney film?</v>

2161
01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:04.090
<v Speaker 2>How many of you haven't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2162
01:52:04.091 --> 01:52:07.810
<v Speaker 2>so there's a couple that habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a scene in sleeping beauty where</v>

2163
01:52:07.811 --> 01:52:11.650
<v Speaker 2>the evil queen has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has imprisoned the prince who's going to</v>

2164
01:52:11.651 --> 01:52:14.590
<v Speaker 2>wake sleeping beauty up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's the logos so that he's the,</v>

2165
01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:19.620
<v Speaker 2>he's the heroic individual or he's that </v>
<v Speaker 2>element of her consciousness that wakes </v>

2166
01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:19.620
<v Speaker 2>her up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can read it either way.</v>

2167
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:23.440
<v Speaker 2>She's got him trapped in a dungeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's the kind of ultimate,</v>

2168
01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.840
<v Speaker 2>ultimate eatable mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2169
01:52:26.110 --> 01:52:30.190
<v Speaker 2>she's the mother that has her 40 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old son in the basement who's overweight</v>

2170
01:52:30.191 --> 01:52:35.191
<v Speaker 2>and unhealthy and watch and watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>video games and being covered with </v>

2171
01:52:35.191 --> 01:52:36.130
<v Speaker 2>cheeto dust and she always liked feeds </v>
<v Speaker 2>him sandwiches so we won't leave,</v>

2172
01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:36.880
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2173
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:37.840
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2174
01:52:37.841 --> 01:52:42.841
<v Speaker 2>it's good thing you didn't go out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and make some poor woman </v>

2175
01:52:42.841 --> 01:52:42.841
<v Speaker 2>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

2176
01:52:42.841 --> 01:52:47.261
<v Speaker 2>so that's the evil queen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the hero trapped in the </v>

2177
01:52:47.261 --> 01:52:47.261
<v Speaker 2>dungeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he goes out,</v>

2178
01:52:47.261 --> 01:52:51.710
<v Speaker 2>he escapes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she goes after them to try to </v>

2179
01:52:51.710 --> 01:52:52.520
<v Speaker 2>bring them back and turns into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon.</v>

2180
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:55.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens in sleeping beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's that reversion of the,</v>

2181
01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.460
<v Speaker 2>of the arChetype into it's even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>primordial force.</v>

2182
01:52:58.850 --> 01:53:00.700
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so timeout.</v>

2183
01:53:00.710 --> 01:53:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Matt is kind of an amalgam of feminine </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature and also this more underlying </v>

2184
01:53:05.710 --> 01:53:06.330
<v Speaker 2>primordial assemble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

2185
01:53:06.331 --> 01:53:09.350
<v Speaker 2>she is not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is not happy that these,</v>

2186
01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:12.410
<v Speaker 2>her children killed her husband.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she thinks,</v>

2187
01:53:12.411 --> 01:53:14.570
<v Speaker 2>oh well enough for these creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna,</v>

2188
01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:16.790
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna do the men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So flood myth,</v>

2189
01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:20.120
<v Speaker 2>it's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens in the story of noah,</v>

2190
01:53:20.121 --> 01:53:23.390
<v Speaker 2>this happens worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that human beings get all corrupt and</v>

2191
01:53:23.391 --> 01:53:25.850
<v Speaker 2>make a lot of racket and break all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of rules,</v>

2192
01:53:25.851 --> 01:53:26.840
<v Speaker 2>and god thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>

2193
01:53:26.841 --> 01:53:28.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now for you,</v>

2194
01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.470
<v Speaker 2>we'll just bring in a flood and wipe it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all out.</v>

2195
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:34.850
<v Speaker 2>That's chaos returning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You destabilize order too badly.</v>

2196
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:40.390
<v Speaker 2>There's a flood and that brings with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of new things because it's </v>

2197
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.390
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just drowns you,</v>

2198
01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:45.820
<v Speaker 2>drowns you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now noah is a good man so he can ride </v>

2199
01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:48.641
<v Speaker 2>out the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the hero that can go down into the </v>

2200
01:53:48.641 --> 01:53:51.701
<v Speaker 2>chaos and then back up because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hasn't let go of his morality despite</v>

2201
01:53:52.581 --> 01:53:54.890
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the entire society has </v>
<v Speaker 2>disintegrated.</v>

2202
01:53:55.220 --> 01:54:00.220
<v Speaker 2>So he sAves everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like moses crossing the red sea </v>

2203
01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:01.130
<v Speaker 2>and then coming out the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same,</v>

2204
01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:04.970
<v Speaker 2>same sort of idea anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so tie amount.</v>

2205
01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:10.300
<v Speaker 2>She's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not happy and these gods are </v>

2206
01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:10.300
<v Speaker 2>careless to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impulsive.</v>

2207
01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:12.920
<v Speaker 2>They're making a lot of noise and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity disturbs her.</v>

2208
01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:15.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can see echoes of that fear,</v>

2209
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:19.730
<v Speaker 2>that mythological fear in modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

2210
01:54:19.731 --> 01:54:22.100
<v Speaker 2>because we tell ourselves the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

2211
01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:23.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2212
01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:27.350
<v Speaker 2>The story is if we keep running around </v>
<v Speaker 2>making enough racket,</v>

2213
01:54:27.650 --> 01:54:30.350
<v Speaker 2>mother nature is going to take offense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wipe us out.</v>

2214
01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:35.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's the story that's at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the sort of apocalyptic </v>

2215
01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.140
<v Speaker 2>element of the global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2216
01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:37.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2217
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:40.340
<v Speaker 2>apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if we,</v>

2218
01:54:40.341 --> 01:54:43.040
<v Speaker 2>if we mock about badly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature will take its revenge.</v>

2219
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

2220
01:54:43.761 --> 01:54:44.750
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2221
01:54:44.751 --> 01:54:46.730
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a story that's always been true.</v>

2222
01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:51.020
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gods are making a lot of noise there</v>

2223
01:54:51.021 --> 01:54:54.080
<v Speaker 2>being impulsive and then they make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatal error of killing app suit.</v>

2224
01:54:54.081 --> 01:54:56.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so taya,</v>

2225
01:54:56.110 --> 01:54:57.260
<v Speaker 2>matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks all right.</v>

2226
01:54:57.261 --> 01:55:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Now for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wakes up and she thinks I'm going to</v>

2227
01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.310
<v Speaker 2>wipe them all out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the,</v>

2228
01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.900
<v Speaker 2>these gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are gods say,</v>

2229
01:55:02.901 --> 01:55:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're not trivial characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're pretty worried because there</v>

2230
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:09.440
<v Speaker 2>are gods but tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>matt is their mother.</v>

2231
01:55:09.441 --> 01:55:11.480
<v Speaker 2>She gave birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is mother nature.</v>

2232
01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:16.340
<v Speaker 2>And if she's angry about it then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jigs up.</v>

2233
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:21.370
<v Speaker 2>And so what time does is she prepares </v>
<v Speaker 2>this army of monsters and that they're </v>

2234
01:55:21.370 --> 01:55:21.890
<v Speaker 2>described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2235
01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 different kinds of monsters in their </v>

2236
01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:26.980
<v Speaker 2>chi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>merrick images,</v>

2237
01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:27.950
<v Speaker 2>they're images of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2238
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:29.570
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like dragons,</v>

2239
01:55:29.571 --> 01:55:32.750
<v Speaker 2>they're half snake and half bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half animal,</v>

2240
01:55:32.751 --> 01:55:37.751
<v Speaker 2>and they're monstrous images and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the mesopotamians attempt to </v>

2241
01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:41.990
<v Speaker 2>images typically represent those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that might come forward as an onslaught.</v>

2242
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 2>And so generates a whole</v>

2243
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:49.430
<v Speaker 3>13 major monsters and then puts a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>army behind him and she elects one of </v>

2244
01:55:49.591 --> 01:55:53.040
<v Speaker 3>them king who is his name as had </v>
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

2245
01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:55.440
<v Speaker 3>So he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all intents and purposes,</v>

2246
01:55:55.441 --> 01:55:59.250
<v Speaker 3>he's an early representation of sate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like king of the bad guys.</v>

2247
01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:01.460
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's important to know about him because</v>

2248
01:56:01.461 --> 01:56:03.720
<v Speaker 3>if something happens later in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2249
01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:09.380
<v Speaker 3>so timeouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>preparing her army of monsters to chi </v>

2250
01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:14.190
<v Speaker 3>maris to wipe out the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gods.</v>

2251
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:16.680
<v Speaker 3>And so they're like shorting out about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2252
01:56:16.681 --> 01:56:19.440
<v Speaker 3>But while they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still making a lot of rocket and</v>

2253
01:56:19.441 --> 01:56:21.850
<v Speaker 3>living the high life and absolutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>corpse and,</v>

2254
01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:24.690
<v Speaker 3>and propagating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while they're doing that,</v>

2255
01:56:24.691 --> 01:56:29.691
<v Speaker 3>they send out one god after another to </v>
<v Speaker 3>combat time out and they all come back </v>

2256
01:56:30.690 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 3>failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whatever these elder gods are,</v>

2257
01:56:33.481 --> 01:56:38.481
<v Speaker 3>whatever they represent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not whatever it is that can </v>

2258
01:56:38.481 --> 01:56:41.460
<v Speaker 3>confront chaos successfully and prevail </v>
<v Speaker 3>there powers,</v>

2259
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 3>but they're not whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ultimate power.</v>

2260
01:56:44.490 --> 01:56:48.330
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the mesopotamians were </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out who or what is king</v>

2261
01:56:48.331 --> 01:56:53.310
<v Speaker 3>of the gods and king of the gods is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that confront chaos and regenerate</v>

2262
01:56:53.311 --> 01:56:54.720
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2263
01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:00.200
<v Speaker 3>so they keep producing new gods and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>day they produce martin,</v>

2264
01:57:00.650 --> 01:57:05.650
<v Speaker 3>he's bored in martech is a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 3>category of god and every one of the </v>

2265
01:57:05.650 --> 01:57:07.170
<v Speaker 3>gods knows it and he's got some very </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange attributes.</v>

2266
01:57:07.171 --> 01:57:11.520
<v Speaker 3>One of them is he could speak magic </v>
<v Speaker 3>words and so when martin speaks,</v>

2267
01:57:11.521 --> 01:57:14.430
<v Speaker 3>the night sky transforms into the sky </v>
<v Speaker 3>and vice versa.</v>

2268
01:57:14.431 --> 01:57:16.590
<v Speaker 3>So he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the verbal capacity.</v>

2269
01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:21.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive discovery by the </v>

2270
01:57:21.710 --> 01:57:23.370
<v Speaker 3>mesopotamians because it's the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>time we know of that,</v>

2271
01:57:23.371 --> 01:57:28.371
<v Speaker 3>the idea that it's the capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicative speech as the primary </v>

2272
01:57:28.371 --> 01:57:30.450
<v Speaker 3>daddy should be at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy.</v>

2273
01:57:30.630 --> 01:57:33.480
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 3>discoveries of the ages,</v>

2274
01:57:33.810 --> 01:57:35.820
<v Speaker 3>and he also has eyes all the way around </v>
<v Speaker 3>his head.</v>

2275
01:57:36.570 --> 01:57:40.050
<v Speaker 3>So martech is the thing that can speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see,</v>

2276
01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:42.480
<v Speaker 3>and it's the thing that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all the gods think,</v>

2277
01:57:42.481 --> 01:57:44.010
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is a whole new thing,</v>

2278
01:57:44.011 --> 01:57:49.011
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about you go out and combat tie </v>

2279
01:57:49.011 --> 01:57:49.011
<v Speaker 3>matt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2280
01:57:49.011 --> 01:57:53.690
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't sound like much of a picnic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the logical thing for any </v>

2281
01:57:53.690 --> 01:57:53.690
<v Speaker 3>sensible god to say his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about no,</v>

2282
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:55.680
<v Speaker 3>but marta doesn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2283
01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:57.120
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll make you guys a deal.</v>

2284
01:57:58.290 --> 01:58:00.930
<v Speaker 3>You get yourself together in a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2285
01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:06.080
<v Speaker 3>and you have a vote for all intents and </v>
<v Speaker 3>purposes and you vote me king of the </v>

2286
01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:10.170
<v Speaker 3>gods and allow me from here on end to </v>
<v Speaker 3>determine destiny's.</v>

2287
01:58:10.171 --> 01:58:11.760
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what the rest of the team</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

2288
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:15.270
<v Speaker 3>he gets the tablet of destiny and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>now in control of it.</v>

2289
01:58:15.271 --> 01:58:20.271
<v Speaker 3>So the mesopotamians are working out </v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that it's the thing that can </v>

2290
01:58:20.271 --> 01:58:23.751
<v Speaker 3>see and that can talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That should be the thing that guides </v>

2291
01:58:23.751 --> 01:58:24.750
<v Speaker 3>destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if destiny involves having to</v>

2292
01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:29.250
<v Speaker 3>go into combat with chaos itself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>restructure the world,</v>

2293
01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:32.100
<v Speaker 3>and so martin says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the terms,</v>

2294
01:58:32.370 --> 01:58:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm king of the gods and they all </v>

2295
01:58:37.370 --> 01:58:37.370
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well at the fool is going to go up there</v>

2296
01:58:37.370 --> 01:58:38.080
<v Speaker 3>and get killed anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

2297
01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:41.710
<v Speaker 3>what do we have to lose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they agree and so martin goes out</v>

2298
01:58:41.711 --> 01:58:42.370
<v Speaker 3>to combat</v>

2299
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:47.370
<v Speaker 2>time out and he takes a net and a sword </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

2300
01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:50.140
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fills her with a wind,</v>

2301
01:58:50.141 --> 01:58:53.290
<v Speaker 2>which is I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the manifestation of this voice,</v>

2302
01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:56.170
<v Speaker 2>this voice idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fills her with a wind.</v>

2303
01:58:56.290 --> 01:58:59.890
<v Speaker 2>He encapsulates her in a net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now think about what that means.</v>

2304
01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:05.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists even used this word </v>

2305
01:59:05.190 --> 01:59:07.620
<v Speaker 2>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal logical net and a normal logical </v>

2306
01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:11.431
<v Speaker 2>net is this is the network of concepts </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you use to encapsulate something </v>

2307
01:59:11.861 --> 01:59:16.861
<v Speaker 2>new in idiation structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea of putting something in </v>

2308
01:59:16.861 --> 01:59:18.550
<v Speaker 2>a net is to put boundaries around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2309
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:21.730
<v Speaker 2>And to constrain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so some of that's actually,</v>

2310
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:25.240
<v Speaker 2>well you can capture a predator in a net</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then cut it up,</v>

2311
01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:28.560
<v Speaker 2>but there's no difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2312
01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:31.210
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a tight analogy between that and</v>

2313
01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:35.080
<v Speaker 2>encapsulating something novel in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptual network,</v>

2314
01:59:35.230 --> 01:59:37.690
<v Speaker 2>which then enables you to cut it up into</v>
<v Speaker 2>something useful.</v>

2315
01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what happens.</v>

2316
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Martin goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2317
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:45.750
<v Speaker 2>he confronts timeout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he overcomes the monsters and he kills </v>

2318
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:48.340
<v Speaker 2>king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and then he makes,</v>

2319
01:59:48.341 --> 01:59:49.870
<v Speaker 2>he cuts time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit into pieces,</v>

2320
01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:55.020
<v Speaker 2>and he makes the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the world that human beings </v>

2321
01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:59.040
<v Speaker 2>live on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he makes the human beings to serve </v>

2322
01:59:59.040 --> 01:59:59.040
<v Speaker 2>the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2323
01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:01.990
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we also kills king knew and he makes</v>

2324
02:00:01.991 --> 02:00:03.910
<v Speaker 2>human beings out of the blood of king </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew.</v>

2325
02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a hell of a story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2326
02:00:05.921 --> 02:00:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Cause king who was king of the demons </v>
<v Speaker 2>and human beings are the creature that's</v>

2327
02:00:10.481 --> 02:00:12.790
<v Speaker 2>made out of the blood of the king of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>demons.</v>

2328
02:00:12.970 --> 02:00:15.040
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very similar idea to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>

2329
02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:20.280
<v Speaker 2>the later sort of egyptian and judaeo </v>
<v Speaker 2>christian ideas that there's a satanic </v>

2330
02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:23.080
<v Speaker 2>element to being that is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic of human beings.</v>

2331
02:00:23.081 --> 02:00:24.840
<v Speaker 2>And part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2332
02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:28.180
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference between human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings and every other element of being?</v>

2333
02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.390
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings can deceive you,</v>

2334
02:00:32.710 --> 02:00:37.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the only creatures that can do </v>

2335
02:00:37.710 --> 02:00:37.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're capable of deception,</v>

2336
02:00:37.710 --> 02:00:39.700
<v Speaker 2>voluntary deception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're capable of malevolence.</v>

2337
02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:45.270
<v Speaker 2>And so that's echoed as well in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story in genesis because when adam and </v>

2338
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:47.320
<v Speaker 2>eve eat the apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wake up,</v>

2339
02:00:47.321 --> 02:00:52.321
<v Speaker 2>the scales fall from their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They recognize that they're naked and </v>

2340
02:00:52.321 --> 02:00:52.321
<v Speaker 2>they know the difference between good </v>
<v Speaker 2>and evil,</v>

2341
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:55.660
<v Speaker 2>which means they can do evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I took me a long time to figure that</v>

2342
02:00:55.661 --> 02:00:56.080
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2343
02:00:56.081 --> 02:01:01.081
<v Speaker 2>What that meant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine because there is a causal </v>

2344
02:01:01.081 --> 02:01:03.331
<v Speaker 2>sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the snake offers you something that </v>

2345
02:01:03.331 --> 02:01:03.331
<v Speaker 2>you ingest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wakes you up.</v>

2346
02:01:03.331 --> 02:01:08.150
<v Speaker 2>The scales fall from your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you can see the first thing you </v>

2347
02:01:08.150 --> 02:01:09.040
<v Speaker 2>do is you realize that you're naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

2348
02:01:09.370 --> 02:01:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings stand upright.</v>

2349
02:01:11.210 --> 02:01:15.700
<v Speaker 2>They're the most vulnerable part of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>is front and center to be hurt,</v>

2350
02:01:15.701 --> 02:01:18.520
<v Speaker 2>but also to be judged right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be naked is to be.</v>

2351
02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:21.520
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to not die.</v>

2352
02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:26.940
<v Speaker 2>You want to cover yourself up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's the recognition of </v>

2353
02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:26.980
<v Speaker 2>nakedness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you might say,</v>

2354
02:01:26.981 --> 02:01:31.981
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does the knowledge of good and evil </v>

2355
02:01:31.981 --> 02:01:33.601
<v Speaker 2>emerge from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you know you're naked and </v>

2356
02:01:33.601 --> 02:01:33.700
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how to hurt other people.</v>

2357
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:39.390
<v Speaker 2>You're not a predator anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just tear you apart and eat you </v>

2358
02:01:39.390 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 2>like they don't want you to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although they don't care.</v>

2359
02:01:40.330 --> 02:01:42.890
<v Speaker 3>They don't want you to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just want to eat you.</v>

2360
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:48.310
<v Speaker 3>But once I know what hurts me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what hurts you and then I can </v>

2361
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:50.420
<v Speaker 3>turn that into an art and people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>done that,</v>

2362
02:01:50.630 --> 02:01:55.630
<v Speaker 3>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why the knowledge of evil comes </v>

2363
02:01:55.630 --> 02:01:55.630
<v Speaker 3>immediately as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of,</v>

2364
02:01:55.890 --> 02:01:58.880
<v Speaker 3>of nakedness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's associated with the same idea</v>

2365
02:01:59.150 --> 02:02:02.570
<v Speaker 3>that human beings are made out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood of kengo nasty stories,</v>

2366
02:02:02.571 --> 02:02:03.590
<v Speaker 3>but very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2367
02:02:03.591 --> 02:02:08.591
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're messing with the fundamental </v>

2368
02:02:08.591 --> 02:02:08.591
<v Speaker 3>structure reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to get this right.</v>

2369
02:02:08.591 --> 02:02:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one of the cool things about this </v>

2370
02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:13.300
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so okay,</v>

2371
02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:13.300
<v Speaker 3>so that's martin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2372
02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:17.750
<v Speaker 3>here's what's so interesting about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mesopotamians,</v>

2373
02:02:17.751 --> 02:02:22.751
<v Speaker 3>they've got this story about the deities</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how they organized themselves to </v>

2374
02:02:22.751 --> 02:02:25.040
<v Speaker 3>respond to the emergence of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to master you.</v>

2375
02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:30.260
<v Speaker 3>You go after it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You declare yourself the thing at the </v>

2376
02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:31.550
<v Speaker 3>top of the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your eyes and speech.</v>

2377
02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:35.540
<v Speaker 3>You go out there voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you encapsulate the chaos,</v>

2378
02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:38.430
<v Speaker 3>you cut it into pieces and you make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world that makes you talk.</v>

2379
02:02:38.431 --> 02:02:43.431
<v Speaker 3>God brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloody absolutely phenomenally </v>

2380
02:02:43.431 --> 02:02:43.880
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens?</v>

2381
02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:46.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening in the heavenly </v>
<v Speaker 3>domain.</v>

2382
02:02:46.071 --> 02:02:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Let's say what happens in the eaRthly </v>
<v Speaker 3>domain,</v>

2383
02:02:48.670 --> 02:02:51.370
<v Speaker 3>the the emperor of the mesopotamians is </v>
<v Speaker 3>martin.</v>

2384
02:02:51.490 --> 02:02:56.490
<v Speaker 3>He's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the manifestation of martech on </v>

2385
02:02:56.490 --> 02:02:57.380
<v Speaker 3>earth and he has to be a good marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's this because he might say,</v>

2386
02:02:57.381 --> 02:02:58.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should you be king?</v>

2387
02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Answer to that is,</v>

2388
02:03:00.841 --> 02:03:01.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your most powerful.</v>

2389
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.610
<v Speaker 3>Now that's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some other weasels will take you out.</v>

2390
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Why should you be king?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2391
02:03:07.221 --> 02:03:09.800
<v Speaker 3>because you pay attention and you speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly and you keep chaos.</v>

2392
02:03:09.801 --> 02:03:14.801
<v Speaker 3>At bay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you make ingenious things happen as </v>

2393
02:03:14.801 --> 02:03:17.051
<v Speaker 3>a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what the bloody mesopotamians </v>

2394
02:03:17.051 --> 02:03:18.110
<v Speaker 3>were trying to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What should be sovereign and why?</v>

2395
02:03:18.710 --> 02:03:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what did they do in the new year's </v>

2396
02:03:23.710 --> 02:03:24.050
<v Speaker 3>ceremony?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that there are there.</v>

2397
02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:26.240
<v Speaker 3>They're the king is in a walled city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2398
02:03:26.241 --> 02:03:29.180
<v Speaker 3>So that's the kings at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy.</v>

2399
02:03:29.181 --> 02:03:33.080
<v Speaker 3>He's the eye at the top of the pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a walled city with chaos outside.</v>

2400
02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Chaos is outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the domain of tire.</v>

2401
02:03:35.631 --> 02:03:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Matt at the new year's ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old year,</v>

2402
02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:41.150
<v Speaker 3>we know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We still have this idea.</v>

2403
02:03:41.330 --> 02:03:44.630
<v Speaker 3>The old year is an old man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new year's about to be born.</v>

2404
02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:48.080
<v Speaker 3>There's an intermediary period of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's new year's eve,</v>

2405
02:03:48.110 --> 02:03:53.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the intermediate period of chaos </v>

2406
02:03:53.110 --> 02:03:53.110
<v Speaker 3>where all the rules are temporarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspended,</v>

2407
02:03:53.110 --> 02:03:55.670
<v Speaker 3>which is why you can go out and party </v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's no tomorrow,</v>

2408
02:03:55.671 --> 02:03:58.280
<v Speaker 3>new year's eve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and before the new year is born,</v>

2409
02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:03.940
<v Speaker 3>the mesopotamian emperor and all of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>rent knew and the people go outside the </v>

2410
02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:07.220
<v Speaker 3>city on new year's eve and they take </v>
<v Speaker 3>statues that represent the gods and they</v>

2411
02:04:07.221 --> 02:04:09.160
<v Speaker 3>act out the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2412
02:04:09.161 --> 02:04:10.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2413
02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:15.880
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story that I just told you with the </v>

2414
02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:15.880
<v Speaker 3>statues.</v>

2415
02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:18.670
<v Speaker 3>And aS part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the emperor has to take off all his </v>

2416
02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:24.460
<v Speaker 3>garbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his garments that make him king and </v>

2417
02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:24.460
<v Speaker 3>kneel in front of the priest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the priest,</v>

2418
02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:26.030
<v Speaker 3>if I remember cOrrectly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slaps him with a glove.</v>

2419
02:04:26.031 --> 02:04:31.031
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that and tells him </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he has to tell everyone why in the </v>

2420
02:04:31.031 --> 02:04:35.650
<v Speaker 3>last year he wasn't a very good marduk </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how he's going to do better in the </v>

2421
02:04:35.650 --> 02:04:35.650
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is exactly by the way,</v>

2422
02:04:35.650 --> 02:04:36.770
<v Speaker 3>what you do when you make your new </v>
<v Speaker 3>year's.</v>

2423
02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:38.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you call those?</v>

2424
02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:44.600
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones who immediately break the next </v>

2425
02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:44.600
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the same.</v>

2426
02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:47.601
<v Speaker 3>It's this renewal idea and it happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it happens in the depths of </v>

2427
02:04:47.601 --> 02:04:49.560
<v Speaker 3>darkness in the middle of the winter </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the light comes back.</v>

2428
02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's set up that way.</v>

2429
02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:53.460
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>

2430
02:04:53.461 --> 02:04:58.461
<v Speaker 3>and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as long as the emperor is a good </v>

2431
02:04:58.461 --> 02:04:59.310
<v Speaker 3>mark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's why he gets to be emperor.</v>

2432
02:04:59.311 --> 02:05:00.600
<v Speaker 3>and if he's not a good mark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

2433
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:01.920
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else should be emperor.</v>

2434
02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:04.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so thAt's how that works.</v>

2435
02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:12.200
<v Speaker 2>And there's some representations of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

2436
02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:16.700
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a time out there,</v>

2437
02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:20.570
<v Speaker 2>sort of a spirit matter combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Winged dragon,</v>

2438
02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:22.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that we've seen so many times,</v>

2439
02:05:22.610 --> 02:05:24.530
<v Speaker 2>and there's marduk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got angel wings.</v>

2440
02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2441
02:05:25.870 --> 02:05:28.790
<v Speaker 2>why the wings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly why the wings,</v>

2442
02:05:28.791 --> 02:05:32.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's obviously being assimilated </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the idea of a bird.</v>

2443
02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:34.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the idea of</v>

2444
02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:39.700
<v Speaker 3>the far seeing capacity of the bird was </v>
<v Speaker 3>there for the mesopotamians it's highly </v>

2445
02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:44.501
<v Speaker 3>probable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the bird is something that </v>

2446
02:05:44.501 --> 02:05:45.110
<v Speaker 3>flies up above everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that can see for long distances.</v>

2447
02:05:45.111 --> 02:05:47.750
<v Speaker 3>So it's an aerial spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's close to god and all of that.</v>

2448
02:05:47.751 --> 02:05:48.020
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2449
02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:51.560
<v Speaker 2>so there is a very primordial </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the same thing.</v>

2450
02:05:51.770 --> 02:05:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Look how much imagination does it take </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see that that's the story of human </v>

2451
02:05:57.231 --> 02:05:58.850
<v Speaker 2>beings in countering the unknown.</v>

2452
02:06:01.710 --> 02:06:02.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you know the code,</v>

2453
02:06:02.941 --> 02:06:04.590
<v Speaker 2>it just seems self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2454
02:06:04.591 --> 02:06:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Well there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got his bow and arrow,</v>

2455
02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's out there fighting the monsters</v>

2456
02:06:08.881 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 2>of the unknown and that's part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how human beings have survived.</v>

2457
02:06:12.181 --> 02:06:12.980
<v Speaker 2>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2458
02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2459
02:06:14.250 --> 02:06:16.770
<v Speaker 2>And then see here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's writing this great big snake.</v>

2460
02:06:16.771 --> 02:06:20.670
<v Speaker 2>So that's another representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same kind of thing.</v>

2461
02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me just think for a minute and </v>

2462
02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:27.630
<v Speaker 2>figure out what I want to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I want to go somewhere next.</v>

2463
02:06:27.631 --> 02:06:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I'll do right now is I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>just show you some additional pictures.</v>

2464
02:06:31.170 --> 02:06:34.750
<v Speaker 2>So we've laid out the conceptual world </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree right on,</v>

2465
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:37.820
<v Speaker 2>and I mentioned that you can think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it as the,</v>

2466
02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:40.920
<v Speaker 2>the potential itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'S the dragon of chaos.</v>

2467
02:06:40.921 --> 02:06:45.921
<v Speaker 2>And then nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has a positive and a negative </v>

2468
02:06:45.921 --> 02:06:46.620
<v Speaker 2>element creation and destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

2469
02:06:46.621 --> 02:06:49.110
<v Speaker 2>which has a positIve and negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion element.</v>

2470
02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:54.260
<v Speaker 2>They're reversed a because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive element of culture that </v>

2471
02:06:54.260 --> 02:06:57.291
<v Speaker 2>protects you against the negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>element of nature and the negative </v>

2472
02:06:57.291 --> 02:07:00.471
<v Speaker 2>element of our culture can be destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the new coming in from the,</v>

2473
02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:05.840
<v Speaker 2>from the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the will individual positive </v>

2474
02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:05.940
<v Speaker 2>and negative as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>

2475
02:07:06.210 --> 02:07:11.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the entire story roughly speaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I showed you it's manifestations and</v>

2476
02:07:11.041 --> 02:07:16.041
<v Speaker 2>figures like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have this is called the open </v>

2477
02:07:16.041 --> 02:07:19.401
<v Speaker 2>virgin or they're opening virgin because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those two halves can be closed,</v>

2478
02:07:20.431 --> 02:07:25.431
<v Speaker 2>so there's mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking or the mother of god </v>

2479
02:07:25.431 --> 02:07:29.420
<v Speaker 2>and depending on how you look at it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside her nature culture,</v>

2480
02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:34.520
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture supports the suffering </v>

2481
02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:37.611
<v Speaker 2>individual who voluntarily accepts death</v>
<v Speaker 2>and mortality as the price to be paid </v>

2482
02:07:38.471 --> 02:07:40.570
<v Speaker 2>for being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that image represents.</v>

2483
02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:43.300
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely unbelievable.</v>

2484
02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:48.420
<v Speaker 2>And then you see all these people at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>side here are gazing uncontrollably at </v>

2485
02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:52.081
<v Speaker 2>this image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course exactly what's </v>

2486
02:07:52.081 --> 02:07:53.911
<v Speaker 2>happened over the last 2000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part of the world because </v>

2487
02:07:53.911 --> 02:07:53.911
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

2488
02:07:53.911 --> 02:07:57.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a tremendous idea encapsulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside that image and the image.</v>

2489
02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:02.820
<v Speaker 2>The idea is something like the voluntary</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptance of suffering is key to it's </v>

2490
02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:04.250
<v Speaker 2>transcendence and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

2491
02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:07.210
<v Speaker 2>that's a crucial psychotherapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

2492
02:08:07.330 --> 02:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that bother.</v>

2493
02:08:08.891 --> 02:08:11.650
<v Speaker 2>You need to be confronted voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to accept them.</v>

2494
02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:13.090
<v Speaker 2>You have to accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

2495
02:08:13.091 --> 02:08:14.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far does that go?</v>

2496
02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:17.980
<v Speaker 2>While we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works in small things that works with</v>

2497
02:08:17.981 --> 02:08:19.690
<v Speaker 2>phobias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works with traumas.</v>

2498
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Traumas are usually associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>death or disease or malevolence.</v>

2499
02:08:23.710 --> 02:08:28.710
<v Speaker 2>So that's pushing it pretty far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There doesn't seem to be a limit to the </v>

2500
02:08:28.710 --> 02:08:32.431
<v Speaker 2>due to the idea that the voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontation with the things that are </v>

2501
02:08:32.431 --> 02:08:36.871
<v Speaker 2>terrifying is curative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There doesn't seem to be a limit to </v>

2502
02:08:36.871 --> 02:08:39.571
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an example in the story of </v>

2503
02:08:39.571 --> 02:08:39.571
<v Speaker 2>exodus when moses is leading the </v>
<v Speaker 2>israelites through the desert,</v>

2504
02:08:39.571 --> 02:08:44.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fragment because while they're out </v>

2505
02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:44.710
<v Speaker 2>of tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't know what to do.</v>

2506
02:08:44.710 --> 02:08:46.330
<v Speaker 2>It's all chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2507
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:48.040
<v Speaker 2>this moses character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2508
02:08:48.041 --> 02:08:53.041
<v Speaker 2>he got them out of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now they're in the desert and </v>

2509
02:08:53.041 --> 02:08:53.041
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing to eat and like why </v>
<v Speaker 2>should they listen to him?</v>

2510
02:08:53.041 --> 02:08:57.751
<v Speaker 2>And so they start worshiping all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of idols and that's kind of like the </v>

2511
02:08:57.751 --> 02:08:59.170
<v Speaker 2>fragmentation of what holds them </v>
<v Speaker 2>centrally together.</v>

2512
02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:02.560
<v Speaker 2>And so what does god do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is not very happy about that.</v>

2513
02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:06.700
<v Speaker 2>So he sends a bunch of poisonous snakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the desert to bite the ball.</v>

2514
02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Any thanks enough for these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's chaos returning right in the </v>

2515
02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:13.940
<v Speaker 2>form of these poisonous snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

2516
02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:19.020
<v Speaker 2>the israelites are kind of sick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tired of being bitten by a poisonous </v>

2517
02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:19.020
<v Speaker 2>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go back to moses and they say,</v>

2518
02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:19.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2519
02:09:19.890 --> 02:09:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I know we've wandered off the path here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we didn't think you were the </v>

2520
02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:24.890
<v Speaker 2>greatest guy there for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2521
02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:27.340
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could have a little chat with </v>
<v Speaker 2>god and see what he could do about these</v>

2522
02:09:27.341 --> 02:09:28.210
<v Speaker 2>poisonous snakes.</v>

2523
02:09:28.210 --> 02:09:33.210
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so moses in treats god to do something </v>

2524
02:09:33.210 --> 02:09:33.820
<v Speaker 2>about the snakes and what god tells </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to do.</v>

2525
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.380
<v Speaker 2>It's the strangest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

2526
02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:41.670
<v Speaker 2>make a snake in the image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make a broad snake and put it on a post </v>

2527
02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>and have everyone look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone who goes to look at the </v>

2528
02:09:46.890 --> 02:09:47.020
<v Speaker 2>snake won't be bitten by the poisonous </v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes anymore.</v>

2529
02:09:47.550 --> 02:09:48.480
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2530
02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:51.730
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

2531
02:09:51.731 --> 02:09:52.990
<v Speaker 2>That idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2532
02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:58.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll tell you something else else </v>

2533
02:09:58.320 --> 02:09:58.320
<v Speaker 2>that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the,</v>

2534
02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:01.750
<v Speaker 2>in the christian story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>christ assimilates himself to that snake</v>

2535
02:10:01.751 --> 02:10:05.550
<v Speaker 2>that was put on the post in the desert </v>
<v Speaker 2>says exactly the same thing that,</v>

2536
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:10.750
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to be looked at because that's </v>

2537
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:11.260
<v Speaker 2>the pathway to salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking,</v>

2538
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:16.350
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst thing that can possibly </v>

2539
02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:19.771
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you look upon it and meditate upon </v>

2540
02:10:19.771 --> 02:10:19.771
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2541
02:10:19.771 --> 02:10:20.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's the key to transcending it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

2542
02:10:20.891 --> 02:10:23.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's the idea that's encapsulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that image.</v>

2543
02:10:24.010 --> 02:10:25.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2544
02:10:25.391 --> 02:10:30.391
<v Speaker 2>it's no wonder that these ideas had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be expressed in images because they're </v>

2545
02:10:30.391 --> 02:10:33.460
<v Speaker 2>so unbelievably complicated that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost incomprehensible.</v>

2546
02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:38.740
<v Speaker 2>So they'd come out first in the image </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they come out first in the story </v>

2547
02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:38.900
<v Speaker 2>because they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus,</v>

2548
02:10:38.901 --> 02:10:43.901
<v Speaker 2>they're so difficult to believe what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last thing you would think if you are </v>

2549
02:10:43.901 --> 02:10:47.881
<v Speaker 2>being bitten by a poisonous snakes was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should make a bronze image of </v>

2550
02:10:47.881 --> 02:10:49.040
<v Speaker 2>one and put it on a stick so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could go look at it.</v>

2551
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a magical element to that,</v>

2552
02:10:50.631 --> 02:10:54.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's psycho therapeutically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>

2553
02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:58.610
<v Speaker 2>So I had this client and she had a dream</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what she was.</v>

2554
02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:00.650
<v Speaker 2>She was having a really rough time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

2555
02:11:00.710 --> 02:11:05.710
<v Speaker 2>she was a pretty good dreamer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had this dream that she was walking </v>

2556
02:11:05.710 --> 02:11:08.741
<v Speaker 2>down a road by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a ocean on one side and there </v>

2557
02:11:08.741 --> 02:11:09.530
<v Speaker 2>was a sort of sand dunes on the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

2558
02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:15.040
<v Speaker 2>And she looked up and there was this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a huge python that had,</v>

2559
02:11:15.890 --> 02:11:17.990
<v Speaker 2>that had been out there showing it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

2560
02:11:18.350 --> 02:11:23.350
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she took a look and he invited her to </v>

2561
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:24.200
<v Speaker 2>come and take a look at the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she refused and walked on.</v>

2562
02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:27.800
<v Speaker 2>And so she told me that dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was also quIte imaginative.</v>

2563
02:11:27.801 --> 02:11:28.520
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2564
02:11:28.521 --> 02:11:30.140
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try something.</v>

2565
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:34.580
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me about the snake handler.</v>

2566
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.720
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2567
02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:37.820
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of a charlatan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a show off.</v>

2568
02:11:37.821 --> 02:11:39.080
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fake.</v>

2569
02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:44.090
<v Speaker 2>And I'm afraid that if I went up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd and where the snake was,</v>

2570
02:11:44.091 --> 02:11:46.210
<v Speaker 2>that they would force me to touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

2571
02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2572
02:11:47.241 --> 02:11:48.590
<v Speaker 2>so that's why you walked by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2573
02:11:48.591 --> 02:11:49.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's play a game.</v>

2574
02:11:49.641 --> 02:11:53.120
<v Speaker 2>So you sit there and bring that dream </v>
<v Speaker 2>image to mind.</v>

2575
02:11:53.121 --> 02:11:54.890
<v Speaker 2>Close your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring the dream image to mind,</v>

2576
02:11:54.891 --> 02:11:59.891
<v Speaker 2>but let's play with it a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like young technique of active </v>

2577
02:11:59.891 --> 02:11:59.891
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's play with it a little bit.</v>

2578
02:11:59.891 --> 02:12:01.660
<v Speaker 2>So go up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2579
02:12:01.670 --> 02:12:06.670
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you go up there and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of have to do this like you're </v>

2580
02:12:06.670 --> 02:12:06.670
<v Speaker 2>daydreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2581
02:12:06.670 --> 02:12:11.110
<v Speaker 2>you can't force it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to play with it like you would </v>

2582
02:12:11.110 --> 02:12:14.260
<v Speaker 2>when you're daydreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is you're kind of half doing it </v>

2583
02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:14.660
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily and it's half manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

2584
02:12:14.810 --> 02:12:17.720
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a gateway between you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the collective unconscious.</v>

2585
02:12:17.721 --> 02:12:20.720
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anywayS,</v>

2586
02:12:20.721 --> 02:12:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2587
02:12:21.201 --> 02:12:26.201
<v Speaker 2>so go up there and the first thing we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do is figure out what are you </v>

2588
02:12:26.201 --> 02:12:28.520
<v Speaker 2>going to do if the crowd tells you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to touch the snake or get close</v>

2589
02:12:28.521 --> 02:12:33.521
<v Speaker 2>to it because she needed a defense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't up to other people to </v>

2590
02:12:33.521 --> 02:12:33.540
<v Speaker 2>force her to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

2591
02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:35.880
<v Speaker 2>we practiced what she might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2592
02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:37.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm comfortable here.</v>

2593
02:12:37.281 --> 02:12:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to stand in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

2594
02:12:38.810 --> 02:12:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Just didn't look at it and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>accustomed to it.</v>

2595
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't need you to push me forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she felt pretty good about that.</v>

2596
02:12:43.970 --> 02:12:45.800
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of armed her with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense.</v>

2597
02:12:45.801 --> 02:12:48.530
<v Speaker 2>So then she could pretend to go up And </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a look at the snake.</v>

2598
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:48.950
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2599
02:12:48.951 --> 02:12:53.951
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you should do is take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the snake handler and see if </v>

2600
02:12:53.951 --> 02:12:56.090
<v Speaker 2>he's who you think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she did that in her imagination.</v>

2601
02:12:56.091 --> 02:12:56.690
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2602
02:12:56.691 --> 02:12:58.670
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't seem to be sharp at all.</v>

2603
02:12:58.671 --> 02:13:00.850
<v Speaker 2>He's got this snake that is is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2604
02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:05.860
<v Speaker 2>something he takes care of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just has come out here to show </v>

2605
02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:06.830
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let people look at this snake.</v>

2606
02:13:06.831 --> 02:13:08.230
<v Speaker 2>And so she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>

2607
02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:08.690
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2608
02:13:08.691 --> 02:13:13.691
<v Speaker 2>is he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he someone that you can trust or </v>

2609
02:13:13.691 --> 02:13:16.331
<v Speaker 2>someone you shouldn't trust?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to ask both those questions </v>

2610
02:13:16.331 --> 02:13:16.730
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you're leading the </v>
<v Speaker 2>witness,</v>

2611
02:13:16.731 --> 02:13:21.731
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to tell people what to </v>

2612
02:13:21.731 --> 02:13:24.131
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to let them figure it out for </v>

2613
02:13:24.131 --> 02:13:24.131
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2614
02:13:24.131 --> 02:13:24.131
<v Speaker 2>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2615
02:13:24.131 --> 02:13:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I think he's somebody that that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>trusted.</v>

2616
02:13:24.951 --> 02:13:25.520
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2617
02:13:25.521 --> 02:13:30.521
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you think that you could go </v>

2618
02:13:30.521 --> 02:13:30.521
<v Speaker 2>up there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2619
02:13:30.521 --> 02:13:30.521
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2620
02:13:30.521 --> 02:13:31.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe lay your hands on the snake and </v>
<v Speaker 2>touch this.</v>

2621
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:36.350
<v Speaker 2>And she said she wasn't sure about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we went through it and she was able </v>

2622
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:37.590
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's the same.</v>

2623
02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:41.440
<v Speaker 2>So she had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had to make contact.</v>

2624
02:13:41.441 --> 02:13:43.420
<v Speaker 2>She had to voluntarily make contact </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2625
02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:46.600
<v Speaker 2>with the terrible snake that's at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of being.</v>

2626
02:13:46.750 --> 02:13:49.360
<v Speaker 2>that's at the bottom of the tree of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

2627
02:13:49.930 --> 02:13:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the snake is.</v>

2628
02:13:51.161 --> 02:13:52.600
<v Speaker 2>It's wrapped around the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2629
02:13:52.601 --> 02:13:53.320
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2630
02:13:53.321 --> 02:13:58.321
<v Speaker 2>partly because we lived in trees and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the damn snakes were down </v>

2631
02:13:58.321 --> 02:13:59.320
<v Speaker 2>there on the ground where we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2632
02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:02.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the divine tree of being that</v>

2633
02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:04.510
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2634
02:14:04.570 --> 02:14:07.690
<v Speaker 2>you have to get the hell out of the tree</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go confront the snakes.</v>

2635
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:10.060
<v Speaker 2>And then that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way out,</v>

2636
02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:13.000
<v Speaker 2>at least in principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kinda what that means.</v>

2637
02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2638
02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>show you.</v>

2639
02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Here's another image of the same thing.</v>

2640
02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:26.420
<v Speaker 2>What I like about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See the fact that the,</v>

2641
02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:28.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture of the patriarchy,</v>

2642
02:14:28.581 --> 02:14:30.310
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the father will say here is,</v>

2643
02:14:30.330 --> 02:14:34.460
<v Speaker 2>is holding the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the suffering individual in his arms and</v>

2644
02:14:34.461 --> 02:14:36.110
<v Speaker 2>that's encapsulated by nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2645
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:41.350
<v Speaker 2>it's very much like the story in </v>
<v Speaker 2>pinocchio where Japan auto pinocchio </v>

2646
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:46.241
<v Speaker 2>wasn't able to go down into the depths </v>
<v Speaker 2>to confront the terrible monster at the </v>

2647
02:14:46.241 --> 02:14:48.080
<v Speaker 2>bottom of being without having support </v>
<v Speaker 2>from his father.</v>

2648
02:14:48.081 --> 02:14:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Even though his father ended up trapped </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the whale.</v>

2649
02:14:50.271 --> 02:14:52.460
<v Speaker 2>If he wouldn't have been supported to </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin with,</v>

2650
02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:54.620
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have been able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2651
02:14:54.621 --> 02:14:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I've really seen this and I've really </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen this in people.</v>

2652
02:14:57.260 --> 02:15:00.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a hell of a thing not to have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence of your father.</v>

2653
02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:02.450
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard on people.</v>

2654
02:15:02.630 --> 02:15:07.630
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your father is someone who says to </v>

2655
02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:07.630
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do it.</v>

2656
02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll support you in what you're doing.</v>

2657
02:15:09.110 --> 02:15:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that you can sort it out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then alex towards you in that way.</v>

2658
02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:15.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a gift that really almost no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>else can provide you with.</v>

2659
02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Mothers obviously provide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they provide the same kind of </v>

2660
02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:23.471
<v Speaker 2>gift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but earlier you know because the mother </v>

2661
02:15:23.471 --> 02:15:25.661
<v Speaker 2>has to take care of the infant when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>infant is just completely dependent and </v>

2662
02:15:25.661 --> 02:15:29.891
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is erickson's idea to Eric </v>

2663
02:15:29.891 --> 02:15:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Erickson is the mother is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the person who establishes the </v>

2664
02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:34.610
<v Speaker 2>relationship that allows the developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>person to manifest trust.</v>

2665
02:15:34.611 --> 02:15:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Real truck while you're being carried </v>
<v Speaker 2>for crying out loud,</v>

2666
02:15:37.401 --> 02:15:40.760
<v Speaker 2>you know you can be dropped and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother is also the source of food,</v>

2667
02:15:40.970 --> 02:15:42.800
<v Speaker 2>but the father seems to be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the.</v>

2668
02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:48.130
<v Speaker 2>And I'm being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously parsing these things </v>

2669
02:15:48.130 --> 02:15:51.131
<v Speaker 2>farther apart than they can be need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be because the farther can play a </v>

2670
02:15:51.131 --> 02:15:51.890
<v Speaker 2>nurturing role in the mother complained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraging role,</v>

2671
02:15:51.891 --> 02:15:52.710
<v Speaker 2>but we'll.</v>

2672
02:15:52.750 --> 02:15:57.750
<v Speaker 2>We'll keep it simple for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The father seems to be the thing that </v>

2673
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.750
<v Speaker 2>supports and encourages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

2674
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2675
02:15:57.921 --> 02:16:02.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're little and small and all of that </v>

2676
02:16:02.921 --> 02:16:02.921
<v Speaker 2>and you're subject to destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2677
02:16:03.110 --> 02:16:05.510
<v Speaker 2>and bullying and social pressure and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2678
02:16:05.511 --> 02:16:08.750
<v Speaker 2>but I know you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you can do it and there's a force</v>

2679
02:16:08.751 --> 02:16:13.751
<v Speaker 2>in that that's unbelievable and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't have that half a have a hell </v>

2680
02:16:13.751 --> 02:16:17.201
<v Speaker 2>of a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IT's actually one of the things that's </v>

2681
02:16:17.201 --> 02:16:19.331
<v Speaker 2>quite fun about doing psychotherapy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you get people who have damaged </v>

2682
02:16:19.331 --> 02:16:21.720
<v Speaker 2>father figures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's harder with a damaged mother figure</v>

2683
02:16:21.721 --> 02:16:24.140
<v Speaker 2>a because it's so bloody deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2684
02:16:24.141 --> 02:16:29.141
<v Speaker 2>I had a client who I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought she was a remarkable </v>

2685
02:16:29.141 --> 02:16:29.650
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but her relationship with her was really</v>

2686
02:16:29.651 --> 02:16:30.820
<v Speaker 2>disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really,</v>

2687
02:16:30.821 --> 02:16:33.040
<v Speaker 2>really hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She say she would.</v>

2688
02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:38.100
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she told me it was like something had </v>

2689
02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:38.100
<v Speaker 2>been torn out of her at an early age </v>
<v Speaker 2>that couldn't be replaced.</v>

2690
02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:40.330
<v Speaker 2>It's because you just can't be someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>

2691
02:16:40.331 --> 02:16:42.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard.</v>

2692
02:16:42.430 --> 02:16:46.210
<v Speaker 2>You're just Not there enough for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can sort of be someone surrogate</v>

2693
02:16:46.211 --> 02:16:51.211
<v Speaker 2>father that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a role you can play later and </v>

2694
02:16:51.211 --> 02:16:51.520
<v Speaker 2>that's what educators do at least to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree,</v>

2695
02:16:51.521 --> 02:16:56.521
<v Speaker 2>although now they're trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>mothers and providing safe spaces and </v>

2696
02:16:56.521 --> 02:16:56.530
<v Speaker 2>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not really all that appropriate</v>

2697
02:16:57.100 --> 02:17:02.100
<v Speaker 2>so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the father is an encouraging figure </v>

2698
02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:04.981
<v Speaker 2>and allows the Individual at least in </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle to support the catastrophe of </v>

2699
02:17:04.981 --> 02:17:08.780
<v Speaker 2>being voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>

2700
02:17:08.781 --> 02:17:09.430
<v Speaker 2>so those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2701
02:17:09.431 --> 02:17:14.431
<v Speaker 2>those images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just be are brilliant beyond </v>

2702
02:17:14.431 --> 02:17:14.431
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely brilliant.</v>

2703
02:17:14.431 --> 02:17:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2704
02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:17.560
<v Speaker 2>well that's probably a good place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

2705
02:17:18.370 --> 02:17:20.860
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've got through the,</v>

2706
02:17:21.490 --> 02:17:23.590
<v Speaker 2>the to fund these two fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

2707
02:17:23.591 --> 02:17:25.150
<v Speaker 2>remembering the egyptian story.</v>

2708
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:30.750
<v Speaker 2>You have much more development of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure of cyrus who's equivalent to </v>

2709
02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:34.600
<v Speaker 2>absolute and the egyptian sort of walked</v>
<v Speaker 2>through how the state becomes corrupt </v>

2710
02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:39.361
<v Speaker 2>and deteriorates and what the individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do in relationship to the state </v>

2711
02:17:39.361 --> 02:17:42.010
<v Speaker 2>as well as in relationship to the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

2712
02:17:42.250 --> 02:17:45.280
<v Speaker 2>So in the mesopotamian story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mostly ab.</v>

2713
02:17:45.281 --> 02:17:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Sue's dad and marta makes a new society </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the pieces,</v>

2714
02:17:49.481 --> 02:17:52.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty damn implicit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not detailed.</v>

2715
02:17:52.421 --> 02:17:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Whereas by the time the egyptians come </v>
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>

2716
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.610
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2717
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:56.620
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cirrus was great.</v>

2718
02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:59.710
<v Speaker 2>He's corrupted by seth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has an evil brother,</v>

2719
02:17:59.711 --> 02:18:01.780
<v Speaker 2>so that's the tyrannical element of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

2720
02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:06.960
<v Speaker 2>He's overcome by the evil brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the tendency of every </v>

2721
02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:08.830
<v Speaker 2>bureaucratic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>EverywherE things fall apart.</v>

2722
02:18:08.831 --> 02:18:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Chaos comes back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hero is born,</v>

2723
02:18:11.290 --> 02:18:15.070
<v Speaker 2>takes on the corruption of the state and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes into the underworld,</v>

2724
02:18:15.071 --> 02:18:20.071
<v Speaker 2>which is like confronting matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I likE to have the stories in </v>

2725
02:18:20.071 --> 02:18:23.581
<v Speaker 2>parallel because one of them is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontation with absolute unknown </v>

2726
02:18:23.581 --> 02:18:23.581
<v Speaker 2>tire.</v>

2727
02:18:23.581 --> 02:18:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Matt and the other is the revivification</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the state.</v>

2728
02:18:25.301 --> 02:18:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Even though the stories also overlap and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in the egyptian story,</v>

2729
02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:33.690
<v Speaker 2>so just like marduk was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2730
02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:38.700
<v Speaker 2>the mortal for the emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the combination of osiris and horus was </v>

2731
02:18:38.700 --> 02:18:41.980
<v Speaker 2>the model for the feral and then there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was an idea that emerged out of Egypt.</v>

2732
02:18:42.010 --> 02:18:45.100
<v Speaker 2>This was called the democratization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>osiris and it's,</v>

2733
02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I think part of what gave rise to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire judeo christian idea set of ideas</v>

2734
02:18:50.951 --> 02:18:53.950
<v Speaker 2>because the jews hypothetically came out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Egypt,</v>

2735
02:18:53.951 --> 02:18:58.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their thinking is very deeply </v>

2736
02:18:58.951 --> 02:19:01.021
<v Speaker 2>influenced by Egypt and ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pharaoh was the amalgam of osiris </v>

2737
02:19:02.171 --> 02:19:06.550
<v Speaker 2>and horus and they amalgam of osiris and</v>
<v Speaker 2>horus was his immortal soul.</v>

2738
02:19:06.551 --> 02:19:11.551
<v Speaker 2>The pharaohs immortal soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the pharaoh was allowed to use the </v>

2739
02:19:11.551 --> 02:19:12.070
<v Speaker 2>symbolism of the conjunction of osiris </v>
<v Speaker 2>and horus.</v>

2740
02:19:12.370 --> 02:19:14.350
<v Speaker 2>But as the egyptian society is </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed,</v>

2741
02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:17.410
<v Speaker 2>the aristocracy started to get to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>that symbol.</v>

2742
02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:23.040
<v Speaker 2>So it started moving down the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that it wasn't only that the </v>

2743
02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:26.920
<v Speaker 2>pharaoh was osiris and horus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was then it was the aristocracy.</v>

2744
02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:29.000
<v Speaker 2>And then by the time the greeks came </v>
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>

2745
02:19:29.001 --> 02:19:32.300
<v Speaker 2>it was all men who were part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political structure.</v>

2746
02:19:32.810 --> 02:19:35.540
<v Speaker 2>And then by the time the christians came</v>
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>

2747
02:19:35.541 --> 02:19:36.190
<v Speaker 2>it was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2748
02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:37.850
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this applies to everyone,</v>

2749
02:19:38.210 --> 02:19:39.260
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

2750
02:19:39.350 --> 02:19:44.350
<v Speaker 2>and not only male and female alike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also not just star work,</v>

2751
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:48.710
<v Speaker 2>upholders of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but criminals,</v>

2752
02:19:48.711 --> 02:19:50.390
<v Speaker 2>tax collectors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitutes,</v>

2753
02:19:50.391 --> 02:19:52.670
<v Speaker 2>outcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone had this,</v>

2754
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:53.750
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cyrus,</v>

2755
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:56.720
<v Speaker 2>horace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soul inside of them,</v>

2756
02:19:56.930 --> 02:20:01.930
<v Speaker 2>and we're entitled to be treated as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were intrinsically valuable as a </v>

2757
02:20:03.021 --> 02:20:08.021
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the bedrock as far as I'm </v>

2758
02:20:08.021 --> 02:20:11.141
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the bedrock idea upon which </v>

2759
02:20:11.141 --> 02:20:13.331
<v Speaker 2>western civilization is predicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the sovereignty of the individual </v>

2760
02:20:13.610 --> 02:20:15.860
<v Speaker 2>and the individual is sovereign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2761
02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:18.890
<v Speaker 2>The individual is the eye that's up </v>
<v Speaker 2>above the pyraMid.</v>

2762
02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:23.050
<v Speaker 2>The individual is the thing that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominate sets of dominance hierarchies.</v>

2763
02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:25.610
<v Speaker 2>The individual is the thing that plays </v>
<v Speaker 2>the game,</v>

2764
02:20:25.611 --> 02:20:28.000
<v Speaker 2>but the metagame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individuals,</v>

2765
02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:30.350
<v Speaker 2>the thing that revivified the dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

2766
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:35.650
<v Speaker 2>the individual is the thing that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes out to combat chaos and generate </v>

2767
02:20:35.650 --> 02:20:39.080
<v Speaker 2>something valuable as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's sovereign.</v>

2768
02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Invaluable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's the foundation of our legal </v>

2769
02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:44.260
<v Speaker 2>system and our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2770
02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:48.110
<v Speaker 2>so I think about it as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a new emergence,</v>

2771
02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:49.880
<v Speaker 2>as an emergent property of </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment,</v>

2772
02:20:49.881 --> 02:20:53.780
<v Speaker 2>ideals is dangerous because that's 400 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2773
02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Who cares about 400 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is forever and forever is a lot </v>

2774
02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:03.410
<v Speaker 2>more from grounding than 400 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a set of rational ideas.</v>

2775
02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:05.930
<v Speaker 2>It's way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way deeper than that out.</v>

2776
02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:09.020
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2777
02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:13.670
<v Speaker 5>good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll see you in a week.</v>
