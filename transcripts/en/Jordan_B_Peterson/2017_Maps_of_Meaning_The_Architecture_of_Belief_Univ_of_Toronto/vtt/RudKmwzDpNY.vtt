1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.550
<v Speaker 2>now that you've had an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk through a narrative,</v>

3
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.590
<v Speaker 2>then hopefully some of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say that are more technical</v>

4
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:24.670
<v Speaker 2>will make more sense and so what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do today,</v>

5
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to deal with,</v>

6
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 2>to start to deal with conceptualizing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution to the fact that the world is </v>

7
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 2>too complex to properly perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what the problem fundamentally is,</v>

8
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 2>is that there's a lot more of everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else then there is of,</v>

9
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you include in that </v>

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 2>everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the parts of you that you also don't</v>

11
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

12
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to walk you through how I think </v>

13
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.561
<v Speaker 2>we solved that at least in part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we do that by essentially by </v>

14
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 2>simplifying the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think mostly that we simplify.</v>

15
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 2>It has a place in which to act rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than a place in which to perceive </v>

16
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 2>objects.</v>

17
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 2>And I really believe that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical,</v>

18
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 2>critical distinction between those two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

19
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I think that part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a continual,</v>

20
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 2>that there's been continual tension say </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the claims of science and let's </v>

21
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.791
<v Speaker 2>say the claims of religion is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the world as a place of </v>

22
00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:35.221
<v Speaker 2>objects and as a place to act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be considered separately isn't </v>

23
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 2>properly understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

24
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to try to straighten that </v>

25
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.591
<v Speaker 2>up to the degree that that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to talk to you about </v>

26
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:50.530
<v Speaker 2>stories and met a stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the story is this.</v>

27
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's the simplest unit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful information with regards to </v>

28
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 2>action and perception that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>offered at a Meta story is a story about</v>

29
00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:04.441
<v Speaker 2>how a story like that transforms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say we'll concentrate on the</v>

30
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 2>structure of the story and then we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into the structure of the Meta </v>

31
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that'll constitute today's today's </v>

32
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I want to show you,</v>

33
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I know many of you have seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to show it anyways.</v>

34
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 2>For the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was presumed that the longest time </v>

35
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.570
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the 20th century,</v>

36
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 2>it was presumed that we make a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete model of the world and then we </v>

37
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:46.531
<v Speaker 2>act in the world and we compare what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to that model and as long as </v>

38
00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:52.571
<v Speaker 2>it's our model and the world are </v>
<v Speaker 2>matching,</v>

39
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 2>then roughly speaking,</v>

40
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 2>we believe that everything is okay and </v>
<v Speaker 2>our emotions stay under control.</v>

41
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 2>But if that model mismatches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we knew that something's up.</v>

42
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this work was done by Russians,</v>

43
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.410
<v Speaker 2>especially in the early sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

44
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>by two Russian scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vinegar,</v>

45
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Dova and Sokolov who were students of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexander Luria,</v>

46
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 2>who was arguably the greatest neuro </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist of the 20th century.</v>

47
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Larry has spent a lot of time studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers from World War II that had </v>

48
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 2>received head injuries and of various </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts.</v>

49
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:37.861
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could draw inferences about how the </v>

50
00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:40.291
<v Speaker 2>brain worked and some of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to talk about over the upcoming </v>

51
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:44.040
<v Speaker 2>weeks with regards to brain function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much of it is predicated on Lauria's </v>

52
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 2>work and Sokolov and vinegar Dover where</v>
<v Speaker 2>his students and they were interested in</v>

53
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:53.281
<v Speaker 2>this phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were interested in </v>

54
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:53.281
<v Speaker 2>psychophysiological measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

55
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:54.980
<v Speaker 2>So as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a way of inferring brain function.</v>

56
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 2>And so psychophysiological measurement </v>
<v Speaker 2>is measurement of those physiological </v>

57
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.051
<v Speaker 2>parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like pupil widths or or skin </v>

58
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:07.711
<v Speaker 2>conductance or eeg that are in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly reflective of how the brain </v>

59
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

60
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 2>if you measure skin resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin resistance changes with the amount </v>

61
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 2>that you swept and that that can change </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

62
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:23.761
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly and it changes in response </v>
<v Speaker 2>to physiological demands placed on your </v>

63
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

64
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 2>if your body assumes that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to leap into action for some purpose,</v>

65
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 2>that it's going to open up your pores to</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare you to keep yourself cool and </v>

66
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.301
<v Speaker 2>you can measure those transformations </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite accurately by measuring the </v>

67
00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 2>electrical resistance of the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you see,</v>

68
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.160
<v Speaker 2>if you put someone in a lab chair and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you expose themselves to different </v>

69
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 2>stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find that,</v>

70
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:53.671
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you expose them to something that's </v>

71
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:53.671
<v Speaker 2>threatening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

72
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:57.001
<v Speaker 2>like a picture of a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than their skin conductance will </v>

73
00:04:57.001 --> 00:05:00.511
<v Speaker 2>decrease because there or sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their skin conductance will increase </v>

74
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>because they sweat a little bit more.</v>

75
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 2>And it's quite a rapid response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be a very rapid response.</v>

76
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that,</v>

77
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 2>so [inaudible] or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

78
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>that's right noted was that if he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I sat you down,</v>

79
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:22.891
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put some headphones on you and I </v>

80
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:25.321
<v Speaker 2>played a tone to you that repeated </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same tone that repeated at </v>

81
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 2>predictable intervals that the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time you heard the tone,</v>

82
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 2>you'd produce quite a spike and skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>conductance.</v>

83
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 2>And the next time a slightly smaller </v>
<v Speaker 2>spike.</v>

84
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:38.251
<v Speaker 2>And then the next time a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller spike until after maybe you'd </v>

85
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 2>heard it three or four times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would not respond to it at all.</v>

86
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>And that was often regarded as </v>
<v Speaker 2>habituation.</v>

87
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 2>And habituation is the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see in snails.</v>

88
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm using snails as an example </v>

89
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 2>because they have very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very simple nervous systems.</v>

90
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.890
<v Speaker 2>So if you take a snail and you poke it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then like it comes out of its shell and </v>

91
00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.890
<v Speaker 2>you poke</v>

92
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll go back into a shell and then </v>

93
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.931
<v Speaker 3>it'll come out than if you poke it again</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go back into its shell and it will </v>

94
00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 3>come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you keep doing that,</v>

95
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.450
<v Speaker 3>sooner or later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the snail just stopped going in and you </v>

96
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.541
<v Speaker 3>might think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has been conceptualized as the </v>

97
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:15.731
<v Speaker 3>simplest form of learning habituation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the behavior has tended to presume </v>

98
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:22.091
<v Speaker 3>that if a human being manifested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a response that could be modeled by a </v>

99
00:06:22.091 --> 00:06:26.531
<v Speaker 3>simple organism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the human being was using a </v>

100
00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 3>response that was analogous to that of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the simple organism.</v>

101
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes that's true and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

102
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have simple reflexes that you know,</v>

103
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.080
<v Speaker 3>if you put your hand on a hot stove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll jerk back and that's quite a </v>

104
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.021
<v Speaker 3>simple circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You move your hand back before the </v>

105
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:44.261
<v Speaker 3>message gets to your brain because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spinal cord is smart enough to mediate </v>

106
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 3>reflex like that all by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know your brain is actually quite</v>

107
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 3>distributed throughout your body.</v>

108
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 3>It's not just in your head like people </v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to think and so we have conserved </v>

109
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.910
<v Speaker 3>fast acting reflexes at various levels </v>
<v Speaker 3>of our nervous system.</v>

110
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 3>They they aren't capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated response.</v>

111
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty much stimulus response </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it from the behavioral </v>

112
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have as an advantage,</v>

113
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:16.121
<v Speaker 3>incredible speed because there just </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't that many neural connections </v>

114
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:18.881
<v Speaker 3>between the stimulus and the response </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we have layers of response at </v>

115
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:24.160
<v Speaker 3>different timeframes that help us match </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the demands of,</v>

116
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 3>of the external environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Charles Darwin,</v>

117
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:32.261
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to go into the think was museum in </v>

118
00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:32.261
<v Speaker 3>England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the name of it.</v>

119
00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:36.880
<v Speaker 3>They had a snake in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was a cobra and he'd stick </v>

120
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 3>his face up at the glass and the Cobra </v>
<v Speaker 3>would strike Adam and he jerked back and</v>

121
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:43.871
<v Speaker 3>he tried many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times to master that reflexive </v>

122
00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:43.871
<v Speaker 3>response to the snake.</v>

123
00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 3>But there was no way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time that thing struck at him,</v>

124
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he jumped backwards.</v>

125
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can imagine the survival utility and</v>

126
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:52.580
<v Speaker 3>a reflex like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in reflexes in general.</v>

127
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so back to socal off.</v>

128
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he decided,</v>

129
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 3>he thought if you took that tone and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>did anything to it,</v>

130
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:03.380
<v Speaker 3>that was perceptible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

131
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:08.381
<v Speaker 3>Because there are certain gradations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tone that you're not capable of </v>

132
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:12.551
<v Speaker 3>perceiving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's assume you took the tone and </v>

133
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:14.921
<v Speaker 3>you adjusted it enough so that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptibly louder or it was </v>

134
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 3>perceptively a different frequency or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

135
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Or even that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The spaces between the tones,</v>

136
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.330
<v Speaker 3>because I said they were predictably </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaced even though if the spaces between</v>

137
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:27.140
<v Speaker 3>the tones were changed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then when the change occurred,</v>

138
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 3>the orienting reflex would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinstated.</v>

139
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 3>You'd respond to it again and socal have</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to vary the tone on many,</v>

140
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 3>many parameters.</v>

141
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 3>But no matter what parameter he varied </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

142
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 3>as long as you could detect it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptively,</v>

143
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.200
<v Speaker 3>you'd produce an orienting reflects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So socalgas idea was that you must be </v>

144
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 3>producing a complex internal model of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world that's in concurrence with the</v>

145
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:56.381
<v Speaker 3>world and across pretty much every </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptible dimension because if you </v>

146
00:08:56.381 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 3>weren't doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how in the world would you know that the</v>

147
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:03.891
<v Speaker 3>tone had changed from what you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>already learned about it and so for the </v>

148
00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:07.911
<v Speaker 3>longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was also true for people who </v>

149
00:09:07.911 --> 00:09:07.911
<v Speaker 3>are investigating artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

150
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.160
<v Speaker 3>we had this idea that what people did </v>
<v Speaker 3>was make a complex model of the world </v>

151
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 3>and hold it in their in their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

152
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.490
<v Speaker 3>and then they'd act in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they compare what they expected to </v>

153
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 3>happen in the world with the model and </v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as there was a match,</v>

154
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:26.901
<v Speaker 3>then there was no orienting reflects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the orienting reflects turns out to </v>

155
00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:30.231
<v Speaker 3>be quite a complex reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not merely an alteration in skin </v>

156
00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:30.231
<v Speaker 3>conductance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it is in,</v>

157
00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in essence,</v>

158
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:36.051
<v Speaker 3>is the manner in which you start to </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfold your response to the unknown and </v>

159
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 3>the initial stages of that are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very quick.</v>

160
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.050
<v Speaker 3>But it's hard to tell when the orienting</v>
<v Speaker 3>reflex stops and when more complex </v>

161
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 3>learning begins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of shade into one another.</v>

162
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 3>So the initial stages of the orienting </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflects,</v>

163
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 3>are quite reflective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the later stages can be </v>

164
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

165
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

166
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

167
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:08.000
<v Speaker 3>I always think the example of betrayal </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the best one because it,</v>

168
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.980
<v Speaker 3>because it's so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that,</v>

169
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come home and you find evidence </v>

170
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.670
<v Speaker 3>lipstick or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Evidence that the person that you're </v>

171
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.601
<v Speaker 3>with is betraying you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing that's going to happen </v>

172
00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:25.631
<v Speaker 3>is that you're going to orient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a real shock and </v>

173
00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:26.660
<v Speaker 3>that's a reflexive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very much akin to the response that</v>

174
00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:31.661
<v Speaker 3>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would manifest if you saw a </v>

175
00:10:31.661 --> 00:10:31.661
<v Speaker 3>Predator or a snake or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

176
00:10:31.661 --> 00:10:33.470
<v Speaker 3>And so that's very instantaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

177
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that'll prepare you for action.</v>

178
00:10:37.131 --> 00:10:42.131
<v Speaker 3>You'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get ready to do whatever it is </v>

179
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:42.131
<v Speaker 3>that you need to do next would be very </v>
<v Speaker 3>unpleasant thing.</v>

180
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:47.080
<v Speaker 3>But then it might take you even years to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fully manifest the learning that would </v>

181
00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:52.721
<v Speaker 3>be necessary in a situation like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's so many things that you </v>

182
00:10:52.721 --> 00:10:53.450
<v Speaker 3>have to reconsider.</v>

183
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.660
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person might now appear to you as a </v>

184
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.121
<v Speaker 3>threat that's pretty immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a biological physiological </v>

185
00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:02.210
<v Speaker 3>response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First your body reacts first,</v>

186
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:07.570
<v Speaker 3>then you respond emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna take awhile and you know </v>

187
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.901
<v Speaker 3>that emotional response might extend </v>
<v Speaker 3>over days or weeks or months or even </v>

188
00:11:10.901 --> 00:11:12.860
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then as you're doing that as well,</v>

189
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:17.861
<v Speaker 3>you're going to try to start to resort </v>
<v Speaker 3>out your interpretive Schema so that it </v>

190
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:20.570
<v Speaker 3>can adjust to the transformation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

191
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.890
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

192
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.290
<v Speaker 3>this error on your part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

193
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:27.060
<v Speaker 3>or this catastrophe or this betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>

194
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.300
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to adjust to whatever information</v>

195
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.480
<v Speaker 3>that event contains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the orienting reflex can,</v>

196
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.650
<v Speaker 3>can manifest itself over an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily long period of time.</v>

197
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 3>It's best to think about it as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>initial pro part of,</v>

198
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.770
<v Speaker 3>of what can be a very complex learning </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

199
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Now that was standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a standard idea in psychology </v>

200
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.530
<v Speaker 3>for the longest period of time that we.</v>

201
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.760
<v Speaker 3>We created a detailed internal model of </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and we watched how the world was </v>

202
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:59.560
<v Speaker 3>unfolding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We compared the two and the physiology,</v>

203
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.040
<v Speaker 3>the neurophysiology of this was even </v>
<v Speaker 3>understood to some degree even by the </v>

204
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 3>Russians in the early 19 sixties because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically localized.</v>

205
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:12.780
<v Speaker 3>You could use complex eeg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electroencephalogram technology to </v>

206
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.521
<v Speaker 3>localize where the orienting reflex was </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurring in the brain and basically it </v>

207
00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:21.421
<v Speaker 3>appeared to occur roughly speaking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hippocampus and the theory of that </v>

208
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 3>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your cortex,</v>

209
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:28.021
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>produced a very complex model of the </v>

210
00:12:28.021 --> 00:12:28.021
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an internal model and your senses,</v>

211
00:12:28.021 --> 00:12:32.951
<v Speaker 3>and we're producing a model of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>external world and the hippocampus was </v>

212
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:35.770
<v Speaker 3>watching those two things to see if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>matched and if they didn't match,</v>

213
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:40.771
<v Speaker 3>there was a mismatch signal and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be the orientation reflects and </v>

214
00:12:40.771 --> 00:12:43.831
<v Speaker 3>then your body would start to prepare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would prepare itself for whatever that </v>

215
00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 3>mismatch meant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you would engage in exploratory</v>

216
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:49.150
<v Speaker 3>behavior to try to update your model.</v>

217
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.870
<v Speaker 3>That was the standard theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very well accepted theory.</v>

218
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.350
<v Speaker 3>It has elements of cybernetic theory in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

219
00:12:56.351 --> 00:13:01.351
<v Speaker 3>but it was well accepted enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when people first started to experiment </v>

220
00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:06.091
<v Speaker 3>with artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how they tried to make </v>

221
00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:07.570
<v Speaker 3>artificially intelligent systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried to make ones that would model</v>

222
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:12.130
<v Speaker 3>the world and then act and then compare </v>
<v Speaker 3>the changes in the world to that model,</v>

223
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.780
<v Speaker 3>but that didn't go anywhere as it turned</v>
<v Speaker 3>out because it.</v>

224
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.920
<v Speaker 3>It turned out that it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so difficult to see and model the </v>

225
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.210
<v Speaker 3>world that people had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People had no idea how complex that was.</v>

226
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 3>It was impossibly complex as it turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

227
00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:29.260
<v Speaker 3>and so that's part of the reason we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have robots wandering around doing</v>

228
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:34.261
<v Speaker 3>apparently simple things like walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a walking in an environment like </v>

229
00:13:34.261 --> 00:13:34.600
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when we look at the environment,</v>

230
00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 3>we think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

231
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not that much different.</v>

232
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not that hard to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's full of objects and they're just </v>

233
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.881
<v Speaker 3>self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There they are and we can just wander </v>

234
00:13:44.881 --> 00:13:44.881
<v Speaker 3>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

235
00:13:44.881 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 3>and we don't even do that consciously to</v>
<v Speaker 3>any great degree because so much of that</v>

236
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 3>perception is presented to our </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness without effort.</v>

237
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:57.300
<v Speaker 3>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ai guys learned pretty quick </v>

238
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.241
<v Speaker 3>that perceiving the world was way more </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult than anybody had guest and </v>

239
00:14:00.241 --> 00:14:05.011
<v Speaker 3>then this experiment really in some sets</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a phenomenal logical put a </v>

240
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:11.090
<v Speaker 3>phenomenological punch behind that </v>
<v Speaker 3>observation because one of the </v>

241
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.271
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions of the orienting reflex </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory that I just laid out was that you</v>

242
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:20.641
<v Speaker 3>were very good at detecting changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your nervous system would </v>

243
00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 3>automatically detect change anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

244
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Any mismatch between your model and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you expected.</v>

245
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 3>And then while the AI guys I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out first of all that that was a</v>

246
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:34.861
<v Speaker 3>big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the problem of perception was much </v>

247
00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:34.861
<v Speaker 3>more complicated than that.</v>

248
00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:35.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually,</v>

249
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 3>it's out of that same set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>observations in some sense that </v>

250
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.690
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism emerged in literature </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in literary criticism because,</v>

251
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:50.010
<v Speaker 3>well it turns out to be hard enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see a normal object like a chair and </v>

252
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Speaker 3>part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

253
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just do that to the chair,</v>

254
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.600
<v Speaker 3>it's really different than it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

255
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 3>You could imagine how different it would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be if you tried to paint the chair under</v>

256
00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 3>both those conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

257
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 3>And if you were really good at looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at it,</v>

258
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 3>you'd find that even though if I asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>you what color this is,</v>

259
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 3>you'd say white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were actually painting it,</v>

260
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 3>you'd find out that the colors of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chair when it's in that location and the</v>

261
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 3>colors in the chair when it's in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>location,</v>

262
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 3>just because of the difference in </v>
<v Speaker 3>lighting are substantially different.</v>

263
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 3>I think it was monet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think who painted a very large series </v>

264
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.661
<v Speaker 3>of haystacks in the French countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right under in different seasons and </v>

265
00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:29.420
<v Speaker 3>under different conditions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>illumination,</v>

266
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.840
<v Speaker 3>just because he was exploring how </v>
<v Speaker 3>radically different the same object </v>

267
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.591
<v Speaker 3>could be as it moved through contexts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it isn't even obvious why we </v>

268
00:15:38.591 --> 00:15:43.181
<v Speaker 3>think this is the same object when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>move it and the answer is something </v>

269
00:15:43.181 --> 00:15:43.181
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

270
00:15:43.181 --> 00:15:47.201
<v Speaker 3>you can sit on it in both positions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not a description of an object </v>

271
00:15:47.201 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

272
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.960
<v Speaker 3>That's a description of something that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>useful.</v>

273
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Something that's a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that exists in relationship to</v>

274
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 3>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an object.</v>

275
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.380
<v Speaker 3>And so if you think that just looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like a chair is almost </v>

276
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 3>impossibly difficult and subject to </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation,</v>

277
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 3>they'd imagine how difficult it is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceive something like a text,</v>

278
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:13.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a novel because a novel object </v>

279
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.791
<v Speaker 3>obviously is subject to multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretations of the interpretations </v>

280
00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:19.760
<v Speaker 3>are going to depend on who else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in principle on the intent,</v>

281
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 3>conscious and unconscious of the author </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the time,</v>

282
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 3>of the place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the culture,</v>

283
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Speaker 3>of the language.</v>

284
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Then that's just on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>production itself.</v>

285
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:35.201
<v Speaker 3>But then there's the reader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I've read books when I was 16 </v>

286
00:16:35.201 --> 00:16:39.581
<v Speaker 3>and then reread them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say when I was 40 and the book was </v>

287
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:39.581
<v Speaker 3>almost completely different as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was concerned,</v>

288
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:44.650
<v Speaker 3>partly because I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew what was in it the second time </v>

289
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:44.650
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't know what was in it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time.</v>

290
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.840
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the meaning that manifests itself out of</v>

291
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:53.960
<v Speaker 3>a book is a consequence of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity of the book.</v>

292
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Plus all the complexity of the reader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

293
00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.270
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're reading Russian literature for</v>

294
00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:00.980
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've already read 50,</v>

295
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:06.190
<v Speaker 3>50 Russian novels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be in a much more </v>

296
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.521
<v Speaker 3>difficult different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be in a different </v>

297
00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:11.891
<v Speaker 3>interpretive space than you are if say </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russian novel is the first novel </v>

298
00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:16.751
<v Speaker 3>you've ever read and so and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists were grappling with this </v>

299
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:22.870
<v Speaker 3>w as as well as with many other ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think contaminated their thinking</v>

300
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.890
<v Speaker 3>and their conclusion was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

301
00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:28.310
<v Speaker 3>you can't extract out a canonical </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning from a text.</v>

302
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 3>It's so dependent on the situation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that the text has a interpretable</v>

303
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 3>meaning is actually an error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

304
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.740
<v Speaker 3>just because it's difficult to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something doesn't mean it's impossible </v>

305
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.161
<v Speaker 3>and there's massive holes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist view as far as I think </v>

306
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 3>it's an unbelievably pathological view </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>

307
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.690
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is is that there are </v>

308
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.881
<v Speaker 3>reasons why it emerged and the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 3>were analogous to the reasons that the </v>

309
00:17:55.881 --> 00:18:00.651
<v Speaker 3>AI project initially failed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>analogous to the reasons that this </v>

310
00:18:00.651 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 3>experiment turned out the way it did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to show you this.</v>

311
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.610
<v Speaker 3>Many of you have seen this already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as I said,</v>

312
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:06.530
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

313
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the job,</v>

314
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.200
<v Speaker 3>your job here is to count the Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

315
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:15.230
<v Speaker 3>there's a team of three people here </v>
<v Speaker 3>dressed in white and there's a team of </v>

316
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.330
<v Speaker 3>three people here dressed in black and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your job is to count the number of times</v>

317
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:23.331
<v Speaker 3>the white team throws the basketball </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth to the white team </v>

318
00:18:23.331 --> 00:18:23.331
<v Speaker 3>members.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

319
00:18:23.331 --> 00:18:24.450
<v Speaker 3>So we'll just run that.</v>

320
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

321
00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 3>so obviously are perhaps not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So obviously the,</v>

322
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:04.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of times,</v>

323
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 3>I believe that they threw it back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they threw it back and forth with 16,</v>

324
00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:12.561
<v Speaker 3>if I remember this correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course that's not really the </v>

325
00:19:12.561 --> 00:19:15.891
<v Speaker 3>issue because what happens in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the scene is that a guy wearing a </v>

326
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Speaker 3>gorilla suit comes out into the middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the screen and pounds his chest three</v>

327
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:22.220
<v Speaker 3>or four times as credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He comes out quite slowly as,</v>

328
00:19:22.221 --> 00:19:23.400
<v Speaker 3>as you saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of you.</v>

329
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Is there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody here who didn't see the gorilla?</v>

330
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.030
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

331
00:19:27.031 --> 00:19:29.370
<v Speaker 3>you and I presume all of you knew about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this video.</v>

332
00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

333
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Simon who produced this video has </v>

334
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:35.800
<v Speaker 3>got a couple of other ones where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows that,</v>

335
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

336
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:41.241
<v Speaker 3>even if you're smart enough to see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gorilla because you've seen the video </v>

337
00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:41.241
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've heard about it,</v>

338
00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:42.870
<v Speaker 3>if you make other changes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>

339
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:48.370
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll count properly and you'll catch </v>

340
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:48.370
<v Speaker 3>the grill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you'll miss the other changes in the</v>

341
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:48.510
<v Speaker 3>background and they're not trivial </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

342
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.970
<v Speaker 3>And it's really quite remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's produced other,</v>

343
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

344
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 3>short videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

345
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:58.941
<v Speaker 3>where you'll be looking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a field and a road will grow in it,</v>

346
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.310
<v Speaker 3>occupying about a third of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>photograph space.</v>

347
00:20:02.311 --> 00:20:02.970
<v Speaker 3>And you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

348
00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:03.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see that.</v>

349
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

350
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.210
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

351
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.450
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this,</v>

352
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.200
<v Speaker 3>through this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a big spanner into the works,</v>

353
00:20:10.201 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 3>this sort of experimental along with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ai Failures.</v>

354
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:15.330
<v Speaker 3>And we could even say the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 3>dilemma.</v>

355
00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:16.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

356
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.340
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually every psychologist would have </v>

357
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.571
<v Speaker 3>predicted before this series of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiments that there's no damn way </v>

358
00:20:26.571 --> 00:20:29.511
<v Speaker 3>you'd miss that gorilla because your </v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous system was actually attuned to </v>

359
00:20:29.511 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 3>change in the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like that's a big change.</v>

360
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:36.291
<v Speaker 3>And it's also a gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something you would really think </v>

361
00:20:36.291 --> 00:20:37.110
<v Speaker 3>that you couldn't miss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't possibly miss,</v>

362
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.920
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's occupying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>center of the,</v>

363
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.280
<v Speaker 3>of the visual field.</v>

364
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:46.820
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is part of a phenomena called </v>

365
00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.031
<v Speaker 3>changed blindness and it helped </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists who had been studying the </v>

366
00:20:50.031 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 3>visual system for a very long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out,</v>

367
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:57.870
<v Speaker 3>well mostly figure out exactly how blind</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are because we're way </v>

368
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.480
<v Speaker 3>blinder than we think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

369
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.340
<v Speaker 3>and so we actually focused on much less </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world than we think.</v>

370
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:08.341
<v Speaker 3>And we do that partly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not exactly obvious how we do it.</v>

371
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:13.441
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hold a still picture in our </v>

372
00:21:13.441 --> 00:21:15.730
<v Speaker 3>imagination and then fill in the details</v>
<v Speaker 3>by using our central Fulvio Vision,</v>

373
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:20.731
<v Speaker 3>which has always dancing around like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a pinpoint or a laser beam moving </v>

374
00:21:20.731 --> 00:21:25.141
<v Speaker 3>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're assembling those little </v>

375
00:21:25.141 --> 00:21:27.400
<v Speaker 3>snapshots from the phobia into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively coherent picture.</v>

376
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Maybe what happens is that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at you and then I look at you and</v>

377
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:37.411
<v Speaker 3>I've still got the information from </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at you so my brain can sort of </v>

378
00:21:37.411 --> 00:21:38.340
<v Speaker 3>infer that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's remained stable,</v>

379
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 3>but like if I look at you and I and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay it,</v>

380
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.200
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to learn how to do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you could look at something and </v>

381
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 3>then pay attention to the periphery.</v>

382
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.600
<v Speaker 3>It's annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so if I'm looking at you,</v>

383
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:55.230
<v Speaker 3>I really can't make out your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can more or less make out the fact </v>

384
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.230
<v Speaker 3>that you have a head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see that you're an eye,</v>

385
00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.440
<v Speaker 3>especially if you move it and so that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what your periphery sorta like frog </v>

386
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.821
<v Speaker 3>vision or dinosaur vision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much better at picking up movement </v>

387
00:22:05.821 --> 00:22:09.151
<v Speaker 3>than it is at picking up something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's staying still and that makes </v>

388
00:22:09.151 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 3>sense because well if it staying still </v>
<v Speaker 3>then and it hasn't already hurt you,</v>

389
00:22:12.461 --> 00:22:14.500
<v Speaker 3>then it's probably not going to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

390
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:19.501
<v Speaker 3>But if it's moving then you know that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a good thing that you might pay </v>

391
00:22:19.501 --> 00:22:22.771
<v Speaker 3>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if your periphery catches </v>

392
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:22.771
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you'll focus your phobia on it.</v>

393
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:26.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like you go from really low </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution to really high resolution,</v>

394
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 3>so the center of your vision is </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly high resolution,</v>

395
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.160
<v Speaker 3>but then it fades into low resolution as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you move towards the periphery until </v>

396
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.881
<v Speaker 3>it's out here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would say it'd be about 170 </v>

397
00:22:38.881 --> 00:22:38.881
<v Speaker 3>degrees.</v>

398
00:22:38.881 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I concentrate on this hand,</v>

399
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.930
<v Speaker 3>I can tell it's a hand mostly when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>

400
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what color it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one I can't see at all,</v>

401
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:53.190
<v Speaker 3>and then I can probably see my fingers </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and then I can clearly see them if </v>

402
00:22:55.811 --> 00:22:57.460
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I look at them with my phobia,</v>

403
00:22:57.461 --> 00:22:59.890
<v Speaker 3>and so your vision is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

404
00:22:59.891 --> 00:23:04.891
<v Speaker 3>very strange thing and it focusing on </v>
<v Speaker 3>something very specific and so you're </v>

405
00:23:04.891 --> 00:23:09.271
<v Speaker 3>pointing your eyes at something very </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific and that's what you seem to </v>

406
00:23:09.271 --> 00:23:09.271
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

407
00:23:09.271 --> 00:23:13.090
<v Speaker 3>so then that opens up a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe of questions.</v>

408
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:18.091
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you decide what to point your </v>

409
00:23:18.091 --> 00:23:20.581
<v Speaker 3>eyes out that that turns out to be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>insanely complicated problem.</v>

410
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 3>John Burbank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he talks about that all the time as the </v>

411
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:26.830
<v Speaker 3>problem of relevance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the issue is,</v>

412
00:23:26.831 --> 00:23:27.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's many,</v>

413
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:28.780
<v Speaker 3>many things in the world.</v>

414
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 3>There's an infinite number of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

415
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.460
<v Speaker 3>and you're not going to be able to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

416
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:36.400
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if they happen to be changing as it</v>

417
00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:39.790
<v Speaker 3>turns out and so out of this mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

418
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:41.650
<v Speaker 3>how do you pick what to look at and </v>
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>

419
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:43.780
<v Speaker 3>even if you do pick it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you see it?</v>

420
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Because it's so crazily complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the problem that we're going </v>

421
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 3>to try to unpack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

422
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.940
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what seemed to have happened with the </v>

423
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.791
<v Speaker 3>gorilla video is you have to take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>first theory that you make a complete </v>

424
00:23:57.791 --> 00:24:00.710
<v Speaker 3>model of the world and then a complete </v>
<v Speaker 3>model of the world,</v>

425
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.740
<v Speaker 3>which is the objects in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how they're interacting,</v>

426
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.820
<v Speaker 3>and you compare that to the objects in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual world and how they're </v>

427
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:09.820
<v Speaker 3>interacting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to modify that model.</v>

428
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.130
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

429
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:15.131
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're certainly not making a complete </v>

430
00:24:15.131 --> 00:24:15.190
<v Speaker 3>model and people should have known </v>
<v Speaker 3>better anyways,</v>

431
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.980
<v Speaker 3>even subjects to the limits of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptions because there's all sorts of</v>

432
00:24:18.981 --> 00:24:21.020
<v Speaker 3>things in the world that you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly perceive,</v>

433
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.500
<v Speaker 3>but what you're doing instead is it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like you're making a partial </v>

434
00:24:27.051 --> 00:24:32.051
<v Speaker 3>model of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're only making a partial model </v>

435
00:24:32.051 --> 00:24:34.961
<v Speaker 3>of the world that you're currently </v>
<v Speaker 3>operating on that on on with some goal </v>

436
00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:39.281
<v Speaker 3>in mind and you're also comparing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a model of the world as it's </v>

437
00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:39.281
<v Speaker 3>currently unfolding.</v>

438
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Because the other thing that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>implicit in this is really tricky.</v>

439
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 3>This is where you have to watch your </v>
<v Speaker 3>implicit assumptions.</v>

440
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:50.260
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that was implicit in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>original cybernetic theory was that you </v>

441
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:56.171
<v Speaker 3>have a model of the world that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>complete and then what you're watching </v>

442
00:24:56.171 --> 00:24:59.540
<v Speaker 3>is the actual world as it unfolds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not a model.</v>

443
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 3>That's just your perception of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>objects,</v>

444
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:06.761
<v Speaker 3>but that also turns out to be wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>because your perception of the world as </v>

445
00:25:06.761 --> 00:25:11.351
<v Speaker 3>it unfolds is also a model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what's happening is you look at </v>

446
00:25:11.351 --> 00:25:15.461
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world you see as a model and a very </v>

447
00:25:15.461 --> 00:25:19.451
<v Speaker 3>partial model at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you compare it to the model </v>

448
00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:20.810
<v Speaker 3>that you expect or desire more </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurately desire.</v>

449
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Although the initial models were </v>
<v Speaker 3>expectation,</v>

450
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.030
<v Speaker 3>because if you're in the lab listening </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tones,</v>

451
00:25:26.031 --> 00:25:31.031
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you desire anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mostly when you're acting in the </v>

452
00:25:31.031 --> 00:25:32.480
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have desires and so the experimental</v>

453
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:37.750
<v Speaker 3>constraints skewed the data in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense by making people assume that what </v>

454
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:43.451
<v Speaker 3>people were doing when they walked </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the world was expecting instead </v>

455
00:25:43.451 --> 00:25:46.451
<v Speaker 3>of desiring anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a model of the world that's </v>

456
00:25:46.451 --> 00:25:46.451
<v Speaker 3>generated.</v>

457
00:25:46.451 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Speaker 3>As you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have another model of the world </v>

458
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Speaker 3>that's something like the world that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>desire.</v>

459
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Then you compare both of them and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can mismatch and they can miss match in </v>

460
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.890
<v Speaker 3>a way that upsets your current pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the critical issue.</v>

461
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.200
<v Speaker 3>You don't see the anomaly unless it </v>
<v Speaker 3>upsets your current pursuit and you kind</v>

462
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 3>of know that too because when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

463
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.800
<v Speaker 3>while I'm lecturing to you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

464
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:12.810
<v Speaker 3>it was mostly you're sitting still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people are moving their arms and </v>

465
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 3>they're moving their glasses and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting their feet and generally I </v>

466
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.370
<v Speaker 3>don't see any of that because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference does it make,</v>

467
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.270
<v Speaker 3>you know as it's not relevant to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ongoing,</v>

468
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 3>the ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what ongoing contract,</v>

469
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:29.040
<v Speaker 3>the an ongoing series of interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

470
00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:34.041
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as long as you keep your movements </v>

471
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:37.031
<v Speaker 3>bounded within a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within a range that doesn't interfere </v>

472
00:26:37.031 --> 00:26:41.591
<v Speaker 3>with whatever it is that we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm going to be as invisible to me </v>

473
00:26:41.591 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 3>as the gorilla was when you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>counting the balls and the cool thing is</v>

474
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:49.671
<v Speaker 3>about the gorilla experiment or one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them is that the reason you were blind </v>

475
00:26:49.671 --> 00:26:50.520
<v Speaker 3>to the gorilla was because you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>counting the balls.</v>

476
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.300
<v Speaker 3>And so what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so fascinating because what it </v>

477
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.781
<v Speaker 3>shows to a huge degree in unfathomable </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree to to to to an unfathomable </v>

478
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:06.681
<v Speaker 3>degree is that the value structure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you inhabit determines what you </v>

479
00:27:06.681 --> 00:27:11.451
<v Speaker 3>perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't just determine what you </v>

480
00:27:11.451 --> 00:27:13.761
<v Speaker 3>expect or want it bloody well determines</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you see and that that makes the </v>

481
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:16.860
<v Speaker 3>world a completely different place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one really expected that,</v>

482
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.390
<v Speaker 3>and so if you watch the basketballs you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see or the basketball,</v>

483
00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:24.420
<v Speaker 3>you see the basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you stop watching the basketball,</v>

484
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.660
<v Speaker 3>well then you see the gorilla and so the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first question that arises from an </v>

485
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 3>experiment like that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

486
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 3>just exactly what is it that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>see in the world?</v>

487
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:38.040
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see so little.</v>

488
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:43.041
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that tiny amount that's </v>

489
00:27:43.041 --> 00:27:45.801
<v Speaker 3>necessary for you to undertake the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>sequence in your plotted movements.</v>

490
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:51.890
<v Speaker 3>Something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then that becomes very complicated </v>

491
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.011
<v Speaker 3>too because it isn't obvious how you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualize or how you can determine </v>

492
00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:00.590
<v Speaker 3>what your next movement is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not like you just add up movements and </v>

493
00:28:00.961 --> 00:28:04.920
<v Speaker 3>make up your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that simple and it's related to</v>

494
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:09.921
<v Speaker 3>the to the novel problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem of meaning in a in a </v>

495
00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:13.970
<v Speaker 3>literary work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you imagine you're trying to specify </v>

496
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 3>the meaning of a literary work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

497
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.440
<v Speaker 3>there's meaning in the word and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the word is dependent meaning of the</v>

498
00:28:19.441 --> 00:28:22.920
<v Speaker 3>word is dependent on the phrase within </v>
<v Speaker 3>which it's embedded and then the meaning</v>

499
00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:27.921
<v Speaker 3>of the phrase is determined dependent on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sentence that it's embedded in and </v>

500
00:28:27.921 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 3>the sentence in the paragraph and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paragraph in the chapter and the chapter</v>

501
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:35.841
<v Speaker 3>in the book and the book and the Corpus </v>
<v Speaker 3>of books of that sort and then within </v>

502
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:40.380
<v Speaker 3>the culture and then within whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're peculiar personal experiences,</v>

503
00:28:40.381 --> 00:28:44.160
<v Speaker 3>all of those things nested our operative</v>
<v Speaker 3>to some degree.</v>

504
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.100
<v Speaker 3>When you're extracting out the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>at any level of analysis.</v>

505
00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:49.350
<v Speaker 3>They're all operating simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>

506
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:51.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing in this classroom?</v>

507
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer is sitting in a chair,</v>

508
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:01.460
<v Speaker 3>but that's obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very short term and context </v>

509
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.680
<v Speaker 3>independent answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're also attending to what I'm </v>

510
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:11.421
<v Speaker 3>saying hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're attending to some of it and </v>

511
00:29:11.421 --> 00:29:14.271
<v Speaker 3>not other parts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking about some parts of it </v>

512
00:29:14.271 --> 00:29:16.891
<v Speaker 3>and not other parts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're also attending a class and </v>

513
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:21.771
<v Speaker 3>the class as a sequence of lectures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's embedded within your desire to </v>

514
00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:25.881
<v Speaker 3>finish up the semester and then to </v>
<v Speaker 3>finish up the year and then to get your </v>

515
00:29:25.881 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 3>degree and that you nest that inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

516
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:32.870
<v Speaker 3>whatever the reason is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting your degree and then maybe </v>

517
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 3>that's nested inside your career goals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's nested inside your life goals</v>

518
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:37.680
<v Speaker 3>and that's nested inside your ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>values,</v>

519
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.050
<v Speaker 3>which you may or may not even be aware </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

520
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 3>and so I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

521
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:45.820
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting here because it serves </v>
<v Speaker 3>your ultimate values.</v>

522
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

523
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 3>It seems a bit abstract to be useful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

524
00:29:52.301 --> 00:29:57.301
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets so vague out at the out at the </v>

525
00:29:57.301 --> 00:29:58.360
<v Speaker 3>outermost levels that it doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>have much specificity.</v>

526
00:29:58.361 --> 00:30:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it seems to lack information,</v>

527
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:05.101
<v Speaker 3>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I said what you're doing is sitting </v>

528
00:30:05.101 --> 00:30:08.011
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has the same problem of too </v>

529
00:30:08.011 --> 00:30:08.620
<v Speaker 3>restricted meaning because of over </v>
<v Speaker 3>specificity.</v>

530
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.640
<v Speaker 3>And so there's some level in there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would,</v>

531
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 3>that you would interpret as meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God only knows why,</v>

532
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:20.730
<v Speaker 3>and that's the level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a natural level of perception </v>

533
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 3>for that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

534
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when children learn to name an animal,</v>

535
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:26.890
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll name cat,</v>

536
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:32.630
<v Speaker 3>they don't name this species of cat or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sub species of cat and they don't </v>

537
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.810
<v Speaker 3>confuse cats with dogs even though </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both in the category for,</v>

538
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four legged furry mammal.</v>

539
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.790
<v Speaker 3>So why not call a cat and a dog?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Furry mammals.</v>

540
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:44.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>children don't do that.</v>

541
00:30:44.831 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 3>They go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to cat and dog.</v>

542
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:51.721
<v Speaker 3>And people who've who've studied the </v>
<v Speaker 3>acquisition of language have found that </v>

543
00:30:51.721 --> 00:30:54.400
<v Speaker 3>there are basic level categories that </v>
<v Speaker 3>children pick up first.</v>

544
00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:59.401
<v Speaker 3>And they're are often represented with </v>
<v Speaker 3>short words and the words are short </v>

545
00:30:59.401 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 3>because they've been around a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they seem to reflect the natural</v>

546
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:04.660
<v Speaker 3>level at which people perceive the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

547
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.850
<v Speaker 3>But none of that's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

548
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

549
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.130
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

550
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:14.131
<v Speaker 3>you could just lump pull at animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>together for that matter and just call </v>

551
00:31:14.131 --> 00:31:14.260
<v Speaker 3>them animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we do sometimes.</v>

552
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.680
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's very difficult to specify the </v>

553
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.460
<v Speaker 3>meaning level and it's not very easy at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all to figure out how we do it.</v>

554
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.970
<v Speaker 3>And so that's partly what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm trying to unpack.</v>

555
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 3>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's part of the issue.</v>

556
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:32.260
<v Speaker 3>So let's say that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a computer.</v>

557
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a story for this.</v>

558
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.110
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

559
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.380
<v Speaker 3>one time when I was in Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was using my computer,</v>

560
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:47.780
<v Speaker 3>it's in my apartment and I was typing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out an essay and it crashed.</v>

561
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.790
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens when your computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>crashes?</v>

562
00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:52.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

563
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:57.301
<v Speaker 3>usually you have some sort of curse and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that you do that </v>

564
00:31:57.371 --> 00:32:02.371
<v Speaker 3>because the circuit that you use to </v>
<v Speaker 3>curse with is the same circuit that </v>

565
00:32:02.371 --> 00:32:05.710
<v Speaker 3>monkeys used to detect eagles or </v>
<v Speaker 3>leopards or snakes.</v>

566
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:11.310
<v Speaker 3>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's a bunch of monkeys </v>

567
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.310
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

568
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.070
<v Speaker 3>they're not all preyed on by eagles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>leopards and snakes,</v>

569
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:17.071
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's usually a Predator in that </v>

570
00:32:17.071 --> 00:32:17.071
<v Speaker 3>category for every single monkey </v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

571
00:32:17.071 --> 00:32:19.180
<v Speaker 3>And so when the monkeys are watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have an,</v>

572
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:24.570
<v Speaker 3>an emotional adherents that the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous monkey might utter first that </v>

573
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:25.390
<v Speaker 3>basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

574
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.720
<v Speaker 3>hide from the Eagle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out onto thin branch so the cougar </v>

575
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 3>can't eat you and look the hell out for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the snake.</v>

576
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.600
<v Speaker 3>But there's a circuit that's linked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions that produces an instinctive </v>

577
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.171
<v Speaker 3>honor that represents that category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the same circuit that you use</v>

578
00:32:41.241 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 3>when you curse and it's not the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>circuit that used for normal language.</v>

579
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:50.740
<v Speaker 3>And we know that because that circuit is</v>
<v Speaker 3>activated and people who have to Rett </v>

580
00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Syndrome because they preferentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>swear,</v>

581
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

582
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:58.061
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why in the world would you have a </v>

583
00:32:58.061 --> 00:32:58.061
<v Speaker 3>neurological condition that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferentially curse?</v>

584
00:32:58.061 --> 00:33:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the reason why you don't just </v>

585
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.590
<v Speaker 3>have one linguistic circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have one for,</v>

586
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.890
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a predator.</v>

587
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's the one that will get </v>
<v Speaker 3>activated when something happens.</v>

588
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:13.961
<v Speaker 3>Like your computer crashing because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know you're an evolved creature and so </v>

589
00:33:13.961 --> 00:33:17.921
<v Speaker 3>those old circuits that were there say </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 million years ago to deal with </v>

590
00:33:17.921 --> 00:33:21.890
<v Speaker 3>exceptions are the same circuits you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>using now to deal with your computer.</v>

591
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Why else would you want to hit it?</v>

592
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what you want to give it </v>

593
00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.611
<v Speaker 3>a whack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it doesn't behave whap </v>

594
00:33:30.611 --> 00:33:30.611
<v Speaker 3>aggression right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

595
00:33:30.611 --> 00:33:35.291
<v Speaker 3>that's some clue as to the categorize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>categorize category system that you're </v>

596
00:33:35.291 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 3>automatically using to encapsulate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>

597
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fine.</v>

598
00:33:40.401 --> 00:33:41.950
<v Speaker 3>What do you do when your computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>crashes?</v>

599
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first you curse and then you do the </v>

600
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.551
<v Speaker 3>stupid things that idiot primates do </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're trying to deal with </v>

601
00:33:48.551 --> 00:33:50.090
<v Speaker 3>something that's way too complex and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you turn it on and off,</v>

602
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't work.</v>

603
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then I thought,</v>

604
00:33:53.061 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the power bar went.</v>

605
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:56.450
<v Speaker 3>So I checked the power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barred it.</v>

606
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.690
<v Speaker 3>I turned it on and off and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

607
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.410
<v Speaker 3>So I brought a light behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer.</v>

608
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 3>The light wouldn't go on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I thought,</v>

609
00:34:01.851 --> 00:34:04.280
<v Speaker 3>ah Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I must have blown a fuse.</v>

610
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:07.080
<v Speaker 3>So I went to the fuse box and took a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took a look,</v>

611
00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.560
<v Speaker 3>but the fuses were fine and so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

612
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:11.000
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the power's gone out.</v>

613
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.460
<v Speaker 3>So then I went outside and the power was</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

614
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:15.870
<v Speaker 3>None of the street lights were working </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

615
00:34:15.871 --> 00:34:20.871
<v Speaker 3>The power was out everywhere and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously out because this was the time </v>

616
00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 3>that the almost the entire northeast </v>
<v Speaker 3>power grid in,</v>

617
00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:28.650
<v Speaker 3>in Quebec collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason it collapsed is because </v>

618
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:32.351
<v Speaker 3>there was a solar flare that happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonably often and the solar flare </v>

619
00:34:32.351 --> 00:34:34.860
<v Speaker 3>produced a huge electromagnetic pulse </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's basically,</v>

620
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:39.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a billion high million hydrogen </v>

621
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:42.701
<v Speaker 3>bombs going off at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety 3 million miles away produces </v>

622
00:34:42.701 --> 00:34:45.730
<v Speaker 3>this tremendous electromagnetic pulse </v>
<v Speaker 3>passes through the years.</v>

623
00:34:45.731 --> 00:34:50.731
<v Speaker 3>Sat atmosphere produces a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a spike and current in the main power </v>

624
00:34:50.751 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 3>lines and blows the whole system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so just so you know,</v>

625
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:59.510
<v Speaker 3>assist an event like that happens about </v>
<v Speaker 3>every hundred and 50 years.</v>

626
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.170
<v Speaker 3>And if we had what now it would take out</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of our electronics,</v>

627
00:35:03.171 --> 00:35:08.171
<v Speaker 3>like one of the big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a big one back in the late 18 </v>

628
00:35:08.171 --> 00:35:08.171
<v Speaker 3>hundreds.</v>

629
00:35:08.171 --> 00:35:08.171
<v Speaker 3>Everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>satellites,</v>

630
00:35:08.171 --> 00:35:08.171
<v Speaker 3>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars,</v>

631
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:13.360
<v Speaker 3>everything gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's a big problem and no one </v>

632
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.381
<v Speaker 3>knows what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One misdose by about nine minutes I </v>

633
00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:17.381
<v Speaker 3>think two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

634
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:22.810
<v Speaker 3>So that's something else to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're inclined to worry about those </v>

635
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:22.810
<v Speaker 3>sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

636
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.690
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

637
00:35:23.691 --> 00:35:25.370
<v Speaker 3>what did I conclude from that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

638
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.760
<v Speaker 3>the function of my computer was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dependent on the stability of the sun.</v>

639
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not the first thing you check out </v>
<v Speaker 3>when your computer crashes,</v>

640
00:35:35.271 --> 00:35:36.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't run out and go,</v>

641
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:37.110
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

642
00:35:37.111 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 3>the sun still sudden still there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no product.</v>

643
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:45.351
<v Speaker 3>I can cross that off the list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to me it's an extraordinarily </v>

644
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:49.560
<v Speaker 3>interesting example of the invisible </v>
<v Speaker 3>interdependence of things.</v>

645
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when our tendency to fragment,</v>

646
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:57.050
<v Speaker 3>what we seem to do is to look at things </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the simplest level of analysis that </v>

647
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.660
<v Speaker 3>actually functions.</v>

648
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.320
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're interacting with your </v>

649
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.301
<v Speaker 3>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not interacting with your </v>

650
00:36:05.301 --> 00:36:06.090
<v Speaker 3>computer at all really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're interacting with the keyboard,</v>

651
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:11.330
<v Speaker 3>sort of one key at a time and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>interacting with the symbols on the </v>

652
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as long as the computer is working,</v>

653
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:19.820
<v Speaker 3>you don't care about it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't give it a second thought and </v>

654
00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.660
<v Speaker 3>you certainly don't care about the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's dependent on.</v>

655
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the electrical power for example,</v>

656
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:26.070
<v Speaker 3>and the electrical power is dependent </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

657
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many men are out there </v>

658
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.450
<v Speaker 3>right now or we're out there last night </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was freezing rain,</v>

659
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:39.230
<v Speaker 3>fixing power lines and freezing to death</v>
<v Speaker 3>while they're doing it so that your </v>

660
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 3>stupid computer doesn't malfunction </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're watching cat videos.</v>

661
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:46.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's this incredibly dynamic </v>

662
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.400
<v Speaker 3>living system that social and economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and political that has to remain dead </v>

663
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:54.790
<v Speaker 3>stable in order for us to have access to</v>
<v Speaker 3>functional and like pure non fluctuating</v>

664
00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 3>electricity 100 percent of the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he also don't think,</v>

665
00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:05.721
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stability of your computer is </v>

666
00:37:05.721 --> 00:37:05.721
<v Speaker 3>dependent on the stability of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political system.</v>

667
00:37:05.721 --> 00:37:09.560
<v Speaker 3>But of course it is because if the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political system mucks up and the </v>

668
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.041
<v Speaker 3>economic system goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people don't go work to fix things </v>

669
00:37:13.041 --> 00:37:16.431
<v Speaker 3>and things are breaking all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's their normal state is broken,</v>

670
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.760
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not working.</v>

671
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's all in some sense,</v>

672
00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:27.210
<v Speaker 3>fold it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only inside your computer but </v>

673
00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:30.351
<v Speaker 3>actually inside your conceptions of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your tiny conceptions of the computer</v>

674
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:35.691
<v Speaker 3>while you're using it and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get a glimpse of what the computer is </v>

675
00:37:35.691 --> 00:37:35.691
<v Speaker 3>really like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it doesn't work,</v>

676
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.640
<v Speaker 3>then it's when it becomes a complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>object,</v>

677
00:37:38.641 --> 00:37:39.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as it's working,</v>

678
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:45.620
<v Speaker 3>then you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perceptions are are perfectly fine to </v>

679
00:37:45.691 --> 00:37:50.691
<v Speaker 3>get the job done and that's another </v>
<v Speaker 3>indication that what you're using your </v>

680
00:37:50.691 --> 00:37:54.771
<v Speaker 3>perceptions for is to get the job done </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how you specify exactly the level of</v>

681
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:58.320
<v Speaker 3>resolution that you should be operating </v>
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>

682
00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:04.270
<v Speaker 3>I haven't sorted that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's something like you default to </v>

683
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.070
<v Speaker 3>the simplest level that moves you to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next step.</v>

684
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.780
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

685
00:38:06.781 --> 00:38:11.781
<v Speaker 3>and generally that is what you should do</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're having an argument with </v>

686
00:38:11.781 --> 00:38:12.060
<v Speaker 3>someone that you have a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with.</v>

687
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 3>You can start by arguing about what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>little argument is about.</v>

688
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:21.051
<v Speaker 3>Or you can immediately cascade into </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you should have a </v>

689
00:38:21.051 --> 00:38:24.561
<v Speaker 3>relationship with this person at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even into whether or not you should </v>

690
00:38:24.561 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 3>even bother with relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

691
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time there's an argument that </v>

692
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:32.940
<v Speaker 3>question is a reasonable question to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have emerge,</v>

693
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 3>or at least it's in the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential reasonable questions,</v>

694
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:41.130
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't seem useful to jump to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most catastrophic possible </v>

695
00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.750
<v Speaker 3>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time some minor thing goes wrong.</v>

696
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens to people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>an anxiety disorder.</v>

697
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens to people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are depressed,</v>

698
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't bind the informally.</v>

699
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:56.460
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is it tends to </v>
<v Speaker 3>propagate up the entire system until it </v>

700
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 3>takes out their highest order </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualizations,</v>

701
00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.280
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're seriously depressed,</v>

702
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 3>maybe you'll watch a news article about </v>
<v Speaker 3>something stupid and you'll think,</v>

703
00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should I even be alive?</v>

704
00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

705
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.600
<v Speaker 3>and I'm dead serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you score 60 on the beck depression </v>

706
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.701
<v Speaker 3>inventory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which puts you way the hell up and the </v>

707
00:39:14.701 --> 00:39:16.501
<v Speaker 3>depressed range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that happens to you that's </v>

708
00:39:16.501 --> 00:39:18.100
<v Speaker 3>negative will trigger suicidal thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking.</v>

709
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:23.101
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes even positive things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll do it because there are very few </v>

710
00:39:23.101 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 3>positive things that happen that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>carry with them some threat of change or</v>

711
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:30.820
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know one mystery.</v>

712
00:39:30.821 --> 00:39:35.821
<v Speaker 3>It's a big mystery is why don't you fall</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a catastrophic depression every </v>

713
00:39:35.821 --> 00:39:38.920
<v Speaker 3>time something goes wrong because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

714
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.090
<v Speaker 3>That level of analysis is not self </v>
<v Speaker 3>evident and you see this with people who</v>

715
00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:48.091
<v Speaker 3>are high in neuroticism too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know there are trivial fluctuations </v>

716
00:39:51.341 --> 00:39:56.341
<v Speaker 3>at their workplace or in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships or in their health will </v>

717
00:39:56.341 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 3>produce a disproportionate negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional response,</v>

718
00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:03.571
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the range of normal </v>

719
00:40:03.571 --> 00:40:03.571
<v Speaker 3>emotional responses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are very,</v>

720
00:40:03.571 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 3>very high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everything upsets them.</v>

721
00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:10.201
<v Speaker 3>Some people are very low and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole range exists is because </v>

722
00:40:10.201 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you should get upset when some</v>
<v Speaker 3>little thing happens to you because it's</v>

723
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:16.300
<v Speaker 3>an indication that the whole damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment has got dangerous on you and</v>

724
00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you should just brush it off </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know it's,</v>

725
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:24.220
<v Speaker 3>it's net consequence is low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do you calculate that?</v>

726
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult question.</v>

727
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.960
<v Speaker 3>So you know when your computer goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

728
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:35.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to pick the proper level of </v>

729
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:35.230
<v Speaker 3>analysis to fix it and you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

730
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.950
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with the circuit</v>
<v Speaker 3>board and maybe you know,</v>

731
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a crack in one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

732
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:44.410
<v Speaker 3>and one of the US somewhere that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldered and,</v>

733
00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:45.560
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

734
00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:50.580
<v Speaker 3>sometimes now when people are building </v>
<v Speaker 3>microchips,</v>

735
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.950
<v Speaker 3>they've run into a crazy problem.</v>

736
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Intel microchips keep getting smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>and smaller and smaller.</v>

737
00:40:56.861 --> 00:40:58.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the little wires,</v>

738
00:40:58.391 --> 00:41:01.760
<v Speaker 3>now we're down to atomic weight or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

739
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.850
<v Speaker 3>the width of maybe 20 adams or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

740
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:06.340
<v Speaker 3>But really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really they're really getting thin.</v>

741
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 3>And so that produces another problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>which no one would have ever.</v>

742
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

743
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:14.200
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't expect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is,</v>

744
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:16.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that at the quantum level,</v>

745
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.820
<v Speaker 3>there's uncertainty about where </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrons might be normally out.</v>

746
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:25.830
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter the degree of uncertainty</v>
<v Speaker 3>about where your electrons are small </v>

747
00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:27.580
<v Speaker 3>enough at your size so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically irrelevant.</v>

748
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:33.390
<v Speaker 3>But down at the subatomic level where </v>
<v Speaker 3>these microchips are starting to be </v>

749
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.571
<v Speaker 3>produced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes electrons will be outside the </v>

750
00:41:36.571 --> 00:41:37.460
<v Speaker 3>wires and that means that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting so damn small that they'll short</v>

751
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:42.461
<v Speaker 3>circuit by themselves because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrons aren't stable enough to be </v>

752
00:41:42.461 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 3>where they're supposed to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wires.</v>

753
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.030
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the reason I'm pointing that out is</v>

754
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:52.031
<v Speaker 3>because a problem that exists in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system can exist at any of the multiple </v>

755
00:41:52.521 --> 00:41:55.640
<v Speaker 3>levels of that system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't obvious where to start.</v>

756
00:41:55.641 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of political arguments are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are like that,</v>

757
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

758
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 3>well maybe a company goes bankrupt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>its shareholders get,</v>

759
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:07.310
<v Speaker 3>maybe a bank fails and so people can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>withdraw their money.</v>

760
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:12.311
<v Speaker 3>And one response is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that just shows you how rotten the </v>

761
00:42:12.311 --> 00:42:12.311
<v Speaker 3>capitalist system is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

762
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.250
<v Speaker 3>well maybe that is what it shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seems there's,</v>

763
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.930
<v Speaker 3>it seems like that might not be the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate level to start.</v>

764
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.530
<v Speaker 3>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's [inaudible] razor in the scientific</v>

765
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

766
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:30.730
<v Speaker 3>You want to use the simplest explanation</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not that fits the facts </v>

767
00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 3>because you don't organize your </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptions by facts.</v>

768
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.890
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like you want to use the </v>
<v Speaker 3>simplest tool you can possibly manage to</v>

769
00:42:36.891 --> 00:42:38.900
<v Speaker 3>fix the problem so you don't.</v>

770
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.960
<v Speaker 3>When your car has a flat tire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't buy a new car,</v>

771
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fix the flat tire.</v>

772
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:49.511
<v Speaker 3>If you can figure out how to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you go for the thing that will put </v>

773
00:42:49.511 --> 00:42:53.210
<v Speaker 3>the tool back together with a minimum </v>
<v Speaker 3>investment of time and effort.</v>

774
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:58.300
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that and you care </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that because you have limited time</v>

775
00:42:58.521 --> 00:43:03.521
<v Speaker 3>and you have limited resources and so it</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes sense for you to conserve them and</v>

776
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:10.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you that partly for </v>
<v Speaker 3>practical reasons too because this is a </v>

777
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.841
<v Speaker 3>very useful thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're arguing with someone you want </v>

778
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:18.131
<v Speaker 3>to argue about the smallest possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you could argue both that </v>

779
00:43:18.131 --> 00:43:19.550
<v Speaker 3>might fix the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to really specify it.</v>

780
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:24.551
<v Speaker 3>It's like what's going on at a micro </v>
<v Speaker 3>level and what's the minimum that I </v>

781
00:43:24.551 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 3>would require to be satisfied with </v>
<v Speaker 3>outcome.</v>

782
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.800
<v Speaker 3>And if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is especially true in intimate </v>

783
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 3>relationships is like if someone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>bugging you and you want them to change,</v>

784
00:43:34.581 --> 00:43:35.240
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

785
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:40.241
<v Speaker 3>how can I be minimally bothered by this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what's the tiniest amount of change </v>

786
00:43:40.241 --> 00:43:44.321
<v Speaker 3>I could request that might satisfy me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because otherwise the argument will come</v>

787
00:43:45.051 --> 00:43:48.440
<v Speaker 3>unglued and every time you guys try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss a problem,</v>

788
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.560
<v Speaker 3>you'll start talking about whether you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should even be together and then you're </v>

789
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.711
<v Speaker 3>done because you'll never solve a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem and then you won't be together </v>

790
00:43:56.711 --> 00:43:59.090
<v Speaker 3>because you'll never solve a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>

791
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.750
<v Speaker 3>so here's a way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception.</v>

792
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.410
<v Speaker 3>So let's say that this is the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to look at.</v>

793
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.880
<v Speaker 3>I called that the thing in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's a schematic of a thing in </v>

794
00:44:12.981 --> 00:44:17.981
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the thing in itself that's an old </v>

795
00:44:17.981 --> 00:44:19.190
<v Speaker 3>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a concept and I think it came from,</v>

796
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.840
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure about that.</v>

797
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.840
<v Speaker 3>It might be older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing in itself is what you </v>

798
00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.390
<v Speaker 3>could see if you could see everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>about something,</v>

799
00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:31.391
<v Speaker 3>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a hypothetical entity and maybe </v>

800
00:44:31.391 --> 00:44:36.250
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was looking at you like the thing </v>

801
00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:38.571
<v Speaker 3>in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I could see every level of your </v>

802
00:44:38.571 --> 00:44:41.181
<v Speaker 3>being from the subatomic up to the up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this level of perception and then </v>

803
00:44:41.671 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 3>beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see your family relationships.</v>

804
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I could see how they were nested in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>societal relationships,</v>

805
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:49.740
<v Speaker 3>economic relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political relationships,</v>

806
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 3>the ecosystem as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would see all these levels at the</v>

807
00:44:53.701 --> 00:44:57.090
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I don't because I can't.</v>

808
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:02.540
<v Speaker 3>What I see instead is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're radically simplified by my senses</v>

809
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.700
<v Speaker 3>because they're just not acute enough to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say see you at a microscopic level and </v>

810
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.200
<v Speaker 3>they're not comprehensive enough to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>your connections across time.</v>

811
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:15.230
<v Speaker 3>So my sense is filter a bunch of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>from me right away and then I'm also </v>

812
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:19.611
<v Speaker 3>filtered from you by my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by your willingness to act like I want.</v>

813
00:45:21.931 --> 00:45:26.931
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're together because that's because </v>

814
00:45:26.931 --> 00:45:26.931
<v Speaker 3>you could be doing all sorts of strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>things at the moment,</v>

815
00:45:26.931 --> 00:45:31.490
<v Speaker 3>but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're helping me simplify my </v>

816
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:34.200
<v Speaker 3>perceptions of you by agreeing to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same game that I'm playing.</v>

817
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:39.201
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we occupied the same space and that's </v>

818
00:45:39.201 --> 00:45:41.511
<v Speaker 3>basically politeness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the mark of someone who's well </v>

819
00:45:41.511 --> 00:45:41.511
<v Speaker 3>socialized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You walk in somewhere,</v>

820
00:45:41.511 --> 00:45:43.680
<v Speaker 3>you get the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you play the game,</v>

821
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.880
<v Speaker 3>and you don't scare the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody and that's.</v>

822
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:52.120
<v Speaker 3>That's partly how we keep our emotions </v>
<v Speaker 3>stabilized because if you're like a </v>

823
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Friday and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

824
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:59.930
<v Speaker 3>as long as your ego as well constituted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can keep your emotions under </v>

825
00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:01.350
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like yes and no.</v>

826
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Mostly No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the Piagetian idea better,</v>

827
00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:10.170
<v Speaker 3>which is if you're well socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're awake enough to identify the game</v>

828
00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:15.171
<v Speaker 3>that's going on wherever you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you play that game immediately </v>

829
00:46:15.171 --> 00:46:19.280
<v Speaker 3>and so to all the other socialized </v>
<v Speaker 3>primates and so then you can just </v>

830
00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 3>understand the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to understand them.</v>

831
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could just understand the game and </v>

832
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:26.670
<v Speaker 3>as long as the game continues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be nervous because you</v>

833
00:46:26.671 --> 00:46:31.671
<v Speaker 3>know you at least know what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen and maybe you even know how to </v>

834
00:46:31.671 --> 00:46:33.930
<v Speaker 3>get what you want in that game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so.</v>

835
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.260
<v Speaker 3>So that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really we're thinking about,</v>

836
00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:42.261
<v Speaker 3>because we talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about why people want to maintain their </v>

837
00:46:42.261 --> 00:46:46.221
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't just because their culture is </v>

838
00:46:46.221 --> 00:46:48.210
<v Speaker 3>a belief system that helps them orient </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves in the world.</v>

839
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:53.630
<v Speaker 3>It's because I believe system is a game </v>
<v Speaker 3>that everyone who shares that belief </v>

840
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:58.191
<v Speaker 3>system is playing and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's playing means nobody needs </v>

841
00:46:58.191 --> 00:46:58.380
<v Speaker 3>to get upset.</v>

842
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.160
<v Speaker 3>So it isn't like the belief system is </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly inhibiting the emotions.</v>

843
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.900
<v Speaker 3>That isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and,</v>

844
00:47:04.901 --> 00:47:09.901
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the culture is just a </v>

845
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:11.931
<v Speaker 3>belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only secondarily a belief system </v>

846
00:47:11.931 --> 00:47:15.181
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly it's a game that people are </v>

847
00:47:15.181 --> 00:47:15.181
<v Speaker 3>actively engaging in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

848
00:47:15.181 --> 00:47:17.820
<v Speaker 3>It's way more important than the beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 3>that go along with it.</v>

849
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:23.540
<v Speaker 3>You don't even need the damn beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why walls and wolves can live </v>

850
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.500
<v Speaker 3>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what the.</v>

851
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

852
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:32.320
<v Speaker 3>Mostly they have a set of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a game.</v>

853
00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 3>It's the wolf game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

854
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 3>and all the wolves know how to play it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's that.</v>

855
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:40.090
<v Speaker 3>That's how they keep themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>organized in their packs.</v>

856
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.320
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it's externalized and so</v>

857
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:45.900
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>

858
00:47:45.901 --> 00:47:50.280
<v Speaker 3>so the thing in itself out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very complicated thing.</v>

859
00:47:50.281 --> 00:47:53.670
<v Speaker 3>It's got multiple dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple levels,</v>

860
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:57.990
<v Speaker 3>and then it's worse than that because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't only have multiple levels,</v>

861
00:47:57.991 --> 00:48:02.991
<v Speaker 3>but all of those levels move across time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every one of those levels shifts as </v>

862
00:48:03.091 --> 00:48:08.091
<v Speaker 3>it moves across time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I like to think of the thing in </v>

863
00:48:08.091 --> 00:48:10.200
<v Speaker 3>itself like a symphony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good moral.</v>

864
00:48:10.201 --> 00:48:12.120
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why we like music in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact,</v>

865
00:48:12.121 --> 00:48:17.121
<v Speaker 3>because music shows you a multilevel </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality that unfolds and Shay shifts </v>

866
00:48:17.121 --> 00:48:19.200
<v Speaker 3>across time within some parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

867
00:48:19.201 --> 00:48:24.201
<v Speaker 3>Because it's not just chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The music has an element of </v>

868
00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:28.971
<v Speaker 3>predictability and an element of </v>
<v Speaker 3>unpredictability and it has these </v>

869
00:48:28.971 --> 00:48:31.320
<v Speaker 3>multiple levels and that's sort of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>what everything in the world is like.</v>

870
00:48:31.321 --> 00:48:34.350
<v Speaker 3>It's what the world is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is a even.</v>

871
00:48:34.351 --> 00:48:37.170
<v Speaker 3>That is just a conceptual model of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing in itself.</v>

872
00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:42.170
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's only got two dimensions instead </v>

873
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.710
<v Speaker 3>of three because it could be a cube and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it.</v>

874
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:47.850
<v Speaker 3>It has even a cube has three dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of four because if that was a </v>

875
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:49.260
<v Speaker 3>cube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adding the third dimension,</v>

876
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:55.070
<v Speaker 3>then it would also be a cube that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>transform and shift as it moved across </v>

877
00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.850
<v Speaker 3>time and that's what the thing in itself</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

878
00:48:56.851 --> 00:49:01.080
<v Speaker 3>but that's too damn complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the question is when you look at</v>

879
00:49:01.081 --> 00:49:01.980
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you see?</v>

880
00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:05.910
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is to some degree it </v>
<v Speaker 3>depends on what you want to use it for.</v>

881
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:07.980
<v Speaker 3>And so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well here,</v>

882
00:49:07.981 --> 00:49:09.750
<v Speaker 3>look at the different ways you can look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at this.</v>

883
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:11.190
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

884
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:16.400
<v Speaker 3>And somebody could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's a rectangle and would you say </v>

885
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:16.530
<v Speaker 3>that's correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

886
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.130
<v Speaker 3>well</v>

887
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:23.310
<v Speaker 3>it's not correct because there's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>one to one correspondence,</v>

888
00:49:23.311 --> 00:49:26.220
<v Speaker 3>but it might be a useful </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualization.</v>

889
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:31.250
<v Speaker 3>If you think about that as a box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could contain that and if you were </v>

890
00:49:31.351 --> 00:49:36.351
<v Speaker 3>carrying the box you'd only have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned about the box and so that </v>

891
00:49:36.351 --> 00:49:37.110
<v Speaker 3>would be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good functional simplification.</v>

892
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.810
<v Speaker 3>That ones a little higher resolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it says,</v>

893
00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:40.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

894
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.710
<v Speaker 3>it's actually four rectangles and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one says,</v>

895
00:49:43.711 --> 00:49:48.711
<v Speaker 3>well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about that as an orchard that </v>

896
00:49:48.711 --> 00:49:51.081
<v Speaker 3>someone's looking at from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to figure out how walk from </v>

897
00:49:51.081 --> 00:49:51.360
<v Speaker 3>south to north.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

898
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:56.460
<v Speaker 3>you got a little map there because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can think of those as bars instead of </v>

899
00:49:56.461 --> 00:50:01.461
<v Speaker 3>collections of dots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Piaget showed that children will </v>

900
00:50:01.461 --> 00:50:01.770
<v Speaker 3>automatically do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>

901
00:50:01.771 --> 00:50:06.771
<v Speaker 3>if you take six dots and put them in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>row and you take the same six dots and </v>

902
00:50:08.161 --> 00:50:13.161
<v Speaker 3>you stretch them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the rows this much longer and then </v>

903
00:50:13.161 --> 00:50:13.161
<v Speaker 3>you ask the child where there are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>dots.</v>

904
00:50:13.161 --> 00:50:17.960
<v Speaker 3>The child will say that there are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>dots where it's longer because they're </v>

905
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:22.191
<v Speaker 3>flipping in some sense between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception of the individual dots and </v>

906
00:50:22.191 --> 00:50:26.331
<v Speaker 3>the perception of the shape that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>array of dots makes and so the shape is </v>

907
00:50:26.331 --> 00:50:31.131
<v Speaker 3>longer because you could see it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rectangle and so they think well longer </v>

908
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:31.131
<v Speaker 3>is bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>

909
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:32.960
<v Speaker 3>It's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's got to be more dots so.</v>

910
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:39.130
<v Speaker 3>Well what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's this one which is sort of </v>

911
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 3>an amalgam of this one and this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then not one.</v>

912
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 3>There's that one and that's the highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution model of that.</v>

913
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 3>That still a simplification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

914
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.380
<v Speaker 3>what I like about this diagram is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

915
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

916
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:58.330
<v Speaker 3>the facts are the facts and what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreeing about is your opinion about </v>

917
00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:58.330
<v Speaker 3>the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

918
00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:59.570
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

919
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:05.260
<v Speaker 3>you have an opinion about the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the world is so horrible lead </v>

920
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.770
<v Speaker 3>complex that you can actually disagree </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the facts themselves.</v>

921
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 3>And I think an etiology does that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people very,</v>

922
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:14.740
<v Speaker 3>very commonly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I saw this movie once that Naomi </v>

923
00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Klein made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I tell you the same story,</v>

924
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.190
<v Speaker 3>tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

925
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 3>because I don't want to tell you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same story,</v>

926
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:22.631
<v Speaker 3>but I might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she went down to Argentina after a </v>

927
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:25.880
<v Speaker 3>bunch of money had gone out of Argentina</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of financial collapse.</v>

928
00:51:25.881 --> 00:51:30.881
<v Speaker 3>And she went to a factory that had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>padlocked and it was heavy machinery </v>

929
00:51:30.881 --> 00:51:33.680
<v Speaker 3>factory and the workers had decided they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were gonna,</v>

930
00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.310
<v Speaker 3>undo the padlocks and go build machines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

931
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.620
<v Speaker 3>tail with the owner who shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she went down and made this movie</v>

932
00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:47.621
<v Speaker 3>and follow these workers around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed how catastrophic their lives had </v>

933
00:51:47.621 --> 00:51:49.280
<v Speaker 3>been because they'd lost their </v>
<v Speaker 3>livelihood in this big financial crash.</v>

934
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:54.730
<v Speaker 3>And so that was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then she went and interviewed the </v>

935
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Guy who owned the factory and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>treated him like he was like a cipher in</v>

936
00:51:56.661 --> 00:51:57.380
<v Speaker 3>some sense.</v>

937
00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Instead of asking him how he got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>factory,</v>

938
00:52:00.861 --> 00:52:03.560
<v Speaker 3>what he wanted to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it fit in with his life plans,</v>

939
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:08.770
<v Speaker 3>why he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why he shut it down instead of </v>

940
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:08.770
<v Speaker 3>continuing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

941
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:09.260
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't get the backstory on him.</v>

942
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:14.500
<v Speaker 3>She just left him in the evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalists box and went on with the </v>

943
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:14.660
<v Speaker 3>film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

944
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:18.320
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like what she did wasn't true,</v>

945
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:24.190
<v Speaker 3>but it was only half true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was half true because she could </v>

946
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:25.820
<v Speaker 3>perceive the complexity of the workers </v>
<v Speaker 3>having sympathy for them,</v>

947
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.360
<v Speaker 3>but as far as she was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the enemy,</v>

948
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:34.361
<v Speaker 3>the owner had no complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just bad capitalist and that's </v>

949
00:52:34.361 --> 00:52:38.681
<v Speaker 3>how it was left in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found it profoundly unsatisfying </v>

950
00:52:38.681 --> 00:52:38.681
<v Speaker 3>because I wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

951
00:52:38.681 --> 00:52:40.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like you know that these workers </v>
<v Speaker 3>are suffering.</v>

952
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not self evident that you want your</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn factory closed.</v>

953
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:46.970
<v Speaker 3>You'd think you'd want it open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could be building things.</v>

954
00:52:46.971 --> 00:52:48.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are you?</v>

955
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:50.300
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is this justifiable?</v>

956
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Have a question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

957
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:58.990
<v Speaker 3>you can take this infinite set of facts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you subject it to your filters </v>

958
00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 3>and you let some of the facts through </v>
<v Speaker 3>and their fact.</v>

959
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.440
<v Speaker 3>But what about all the facts that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't let through?</v>

960
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:12.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the gorilla video shows </v>

961
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:12.250
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

962
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:12.250
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

963
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 3>you got the basketball account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

964
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:15.440
<v Speaker 3>But you miss the big primate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>

965
00:53:15.441 --> 00:53:20.441
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your priorities were a bit skewed in </v>

966
00:53:20.441 --> 00:53:22.361
<v Speaker 3>that circumstance because you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>rearranging the deck chairs as the </v>

967
00:53:22.361 --> 00:53:22.490
<v Speaker 3>titanic sank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

968
00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:24.230
<v Speaker 3>as the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the old joke goes,</v>

969
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 3>and so it's very much useful to to think</v>
<v Speaker 3>always while you're.</v>

970
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.530
<v Speaker 3>It isn't just your damn opinion that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>biased,</v>

971
00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:35.220
<v Speaker 3>although it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your perceptions that are biased</v>

972
00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:36.500
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

973
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:41.840
<v Speaker 3>well in with your words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's even more so.</v>

974
00:53:41.841 --> 00:53:42.530
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

975
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.230
<v Speaker 3>you can't see the thing in itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's too complex,</v>

976
00:53:45.231 --> 00:53:50.231
<v Speaker 3>so you perceive it simpler than it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of that perceptual </v>

977
00:53:50.391 --> 00:53:52.970
<v Speaker 3>simplification is dependent on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>aims.</v>

978
00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.170
<v Speaker 3>So that's a vicious one because it pulls</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

979
00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:59.240
<v Speaker 3>the value structure that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>ensconced within,</v>

980
00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:04.270
<v Speaker 3>into your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It pulls it into the realm of facts </v>

981
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.730
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you do another.</v>

982
00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:10.330
<v Speaker 3>I think about this as a compression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

983
00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:14.510
<v Speaker 3>you can compress a photograph by getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>rid of redundant information.</v>

984
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:19.250
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of what you're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're like one of these squares,</v>

985
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:24.370
<v Speaker 3>little black squares here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black rectangles compresses all of </v>

986
00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:28.241
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're going to treat those as </v>

987
00:54:28.241 --> 00:54:29.090
<v Speaker 3>if they're a grayish black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing happens here,</v>

988
00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 3>so we're blurring across them so we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a much less hire,</v>

989
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:38.330
<v Speaker 3>much less high resolution image here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you take the thing in itself,</v>

990
00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:43.350
<v Speaker 3>if you perceive it as a low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations and then you take that </v>

991
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:46.880
<v Speaker 3>low resolution representations and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>replace that with a word and so the word</v>

992
00:54:46.881 --> 00:54:51.881
<v Speaker 3>is a twofold compression and then when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone tosses you the word,</v>

993
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:58.640
<v Speaker 3>you unpack it into the low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception and then maybe into the world</v>

994
00:54:58.641 --> 00:54:59.030
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

995
00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:00.770
<v Speaker 3>If you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not.</v>

996
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.080
<v Speaker 3>So that's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're taking the complex world,</v>

997
00:55:03.081 --> 00:55:06.410
<v Speaker 3>we fold it into a simple perception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We fold that into a word,</v>

998
00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:11.740
<v Speaker 3>we throw the word to someone else and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they unpack it and the only way you can </v>

999
00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.041
<v Speaker 3>unpack it of course is if you've had </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough similar experience so that you </v>

1000
00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:16.670
<v Speaker 3>have the reference for the word already </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your experience.</v>

1001
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:20.270
<v Speaker 3>So which is why you have to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>simplified language with children,</v>

1002
00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:25.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's no point in tossing a </v>

1003
00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:25.300
<v Speaker 3>child a concept that he or she can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>unpack.</v>

1004
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:26.670
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1005
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:35.270
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we compress a very complex reality and </v>

1006
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:36.850
<v Speaker 3>to have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very small keyhole that's basically,</v>

1007
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:39.430
<v Speaker 3>that's basically our cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>processing.</v>

1008
00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then here's the next kind of </v>

1009
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.250
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This goes along with the science </v>

1010
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.500
<v Speaker 3>religion argument that I was making </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>

1011
00:55:48.501 --> 00:55:50.120
<v Speaker 3>which I want to unpack a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

1012
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I think that fundamentalists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheistic scientists have the same </v>

1013
00:55:59.571 --> 00:56:02.600
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fundamentalists.</v>

1014
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:07.690
<v Speaker 3>So we could say the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalists in the US make the </v>

1015
00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:11.500
<v Speaker 3>proposition that biblical stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll call them mythological stories,</v>

1016
00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.110
<v Speaker 3>are literal representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>

1017
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:19.070
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that might be true depending on what</v>

1018
00:56:19.071 --> 00:56:24.071
<v Speaker 3>you mean by literal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they mean by literal or what </v>

1019
00:56:24.071 --> 00:56:27.461
<v Speaker 3>they attempt make literal mean is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in the same category of </v>

1020
00:56:27.461 --> 00:56:30.491
<v Speaker 3>scientific facts because they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that there are different ways </v>

1021
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:36.010
<v Speaker 3>of approaching truth and the truth's can</v>
<v Speaker 3>serve different purposes.</v>

1022
00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:41.011
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a sense that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>definition of truth is actually </v>

1023
00:56:41.011 --> 00:56:44.521
<v Speaker 3>something like a tool rather than an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ontological statement about the reality </v>

1024
00:56:44.521 --> 00:56:48.631
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the fundamentalists basically </v>

1025
00:56:48.631 --> 00:56:51.670
<v Speaker 3>make the proposition that the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>God created the world in six days,</v>

1026
00:56:51.671 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago is literally true and they get</v>

1027
00:56:55.451 --> 00:56:57.970
<v Speaker 3>the 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>year estimate by the way,</v>

1028
00:56:57.971 --> 00:57:02.971
<v Speaker 3>by going through the genealogies in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Old Testament and adding up the </v>

1029
00:57:02.971 --> 00:57:06.391
<v Speaker 3>hypothetical ages and figuring out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how long before Moses Adam </v>

1030
00:57:06.391 --> 00:57:08.580
<v Speaker 3>lived and some bishop did that back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1031
00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in the mid 18 hundreds.</v>

1032
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was somewhere back about that </v>

1033
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:18.520
<v Speaker 3>time and more or less that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>accepted as canonical fact ever since.</v>

1034
00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.890
<v Speaker 3>And then the scientists say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

1035
00:57:20.891 --> 00:57:23.050
<v Speaker 3>those are imperial truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just wrong.</v>

1036
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:28.530
<v Speaker 3>And that's the only difference there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the fundamentalists and the </v>

1037
00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:31.141
<v Speaker 3>atheist scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fundamental say those are </v>

1038
00:57:31.141 --> 00:57:31.180
<v Speaker 3>fundamental scientific truths and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're right.</v>

1039
00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:33.310
<v Speaker 3>And the scientists say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while their scientific truths,</v>

1040
00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 3>they just happened to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1041
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.130
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a stupid argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally.</v>

1042
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:44.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean for a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that the people who wrote the the</v>

1043
00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:49.411
<v Speaker 3>ancient stories that we have access to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in no way shape or form </v>

1044
00:57:49.451 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1045
00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:56.460
<v Speaker 3>modern people tend to think that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think like a scientist and people have </v>

1046
00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:56.460
<v Speaker 3>always thought that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1047
00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:01.260
<v Speaker 3>you do not think like a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even scientists hardly even think like </v>

1048
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:01.260
<v Speaker 3>scientists.</v>

1049
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.590
<v Speaker 3>But if you're not scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained,</v>

1050
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:07.860
<v Speaker 3>you don't think like a scientist at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things for example that </v>

1051
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 3>characterizes your thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 3>confirmation bias.</v>

1052
00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:14.761
<v Speaker 3>And so if you have a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do is wander around in the </v>

1053
00:58:14.761 --> 00:58:17.761
<v Speaker 3>world looking for reasons why it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the scientists does exactly the </v>

1054
00:58:17.761 --> 00:58:21.901
<v Speaker 3>opposite of that in the little tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>narrow domain where he or she is </v>

1055
00:58:21.901 --> 00:58:25.651
<v Speaker 3>actually capable of being a scientist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what they have is a theory and look </v>

1056
00:58:25.651 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 3>for a way to prove it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But believe me,</v>

1057
00:58:27.071 --> 00:58:29.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't run around doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

1058
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.930
<v Speaker 3>you can train yourself so now and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do that.</v>

1059
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.580
<v Speaker 3>You know when you can learn to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1060
00:58:33.581 --> 00:58:38.581
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the off chance that you might be </v>

1061
00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:38.581
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is by no means a natural way of</v>

1062
00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:42.800
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course the the,</v>

1063
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:48.250
<v Speaker 3>the fundamental philosophical axioms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the scientific method weren't developed </v>

1064
00:58:48.611 --> 00:58:51.280
<v Speaker 3>until descartes and Bacon and who else?</v>

1065
00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Descartes Bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one more.</v>

1066
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the name escapes me at the moment,</v>

1067
00:58:56.981 --> 00:58:59.530
<v Speaker 3>but you can argue about when science </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerged,</v>

1068
00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.770
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1069
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:06.280
<v Speaker 3>it certainly emerged in it's articulated</v>
<v Speaker 3>form within the last thousand years.</v>

1070
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:09.910
<v Speaker 3>I think you could say even more </v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically that it emerged in the last</v>

1071
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:12.820
<v Speaker 3>500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might argue with that and say,</v>

1072
00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:17.821
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about the Greeks and other people </v>

1073
00:59:17.821 --> 00:59:19.381
<v Speaker 3>who were fairly technologically </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated or who invented geometry </v>

1074
00:59:19.381 --> 00:59:20.470
<v Speaker 3>or that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1075
00:59:20.471 --> 00:59:24.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear precursors to the idea of empirical</v>

1076
00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:25.790
<v Speaker 3>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aristotle,</v>

1077
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:30.791
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was writing down his knowledge </v>

1078
00:59:30.791 --> 00:59:33.551
<v Speaker 3>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it never occurred to him to actually go </v>

1079
00:59:33.551 --> 00:59:34.370
<v Speaker 3>out in the world and look at it to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>if what he assumed about it was true and</v>

1080
00:59:34.371 --> 00:59:39.371
<v Speaker 3>it certainly never occurred to Aristotle</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get 20 people to go look at the same </v>

1081
00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:44.711
<v Speaker 3>thing independently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write down exactly how they went about </v>

1082
00:59:44.711 --> 00:59:45.560
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compare the records,</v>

1083
00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:50.561
<v Speaker 3>and then extract out what was common and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a that seems self evident to us </v>

1084
00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:53.090
<v Speaker 3>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1085
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:58.780
<v Speaker 3>it was by no means self evident to </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone 500 years ago and people still </v>

1086
00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.860
<v Speaker 3>don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not even.</v>

1087
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:06.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know anything about the history </v>

1088
01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:09.020
<v Speaker 3>of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not plausible to posit that stories</v>

1089
01:00:09.021 --> 01:00:14.021
<v Speaker 3>about the nature of reality that existed</v>
<v Speaker 3>before 500 years ago were scientific in </v>

1090
01:00:14.091 --> 01:00:19.091
<v Speaker 3>any but the most cursory of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why we have that argument continually</v>

1091
01:00:19.291 --> 01:00:22.700
<v Speaker 3>is somewhat beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of the reason is though,</v>

1092
01:00:22.701 --> 01:00:27.701
<v Speaker 3>that everyone fundamentalists included </v>
<v Speaker 3>really believe in scientific facts.</v>

1093
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Even though they hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll use computers,</v>

1094
01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:33.440
<v Speaker 3>they'll fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Computers won't work,</v>

1095
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't work unless quantum mechanics </v>
<v Speaker 3>were correct,</v>

1096
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.680
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that you use a high tech </v>
<v Speaker 3>device indicates through your action </v>

1097
01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:45.350
<v Speaker 3>that you actually accept the theories </v>
<v Speaker 3>upon which is predicated,</v>

1098
01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same as flying.</v>

1099
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Same as anything you do in it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Complex technological society.</v>

1100
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:52.640
<v Speaker 3>You're stuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're reading by the lights.</v>

1101
01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:53.630
<v Speaker 3>Do they work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1102
01:00:53.631 --> 01:00:58.631
<v Speaker 3>they work well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's really hard for people who are </v>

1103
01:00:58.631 --> 01:01:02.561
<v Speaker 3>trying to hold onto a way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world that appears to contradict the</v>

1104
01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:07.841
<v Speaker 3>scientific claims when everything they </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is predicated on their acceptance of </v>

1105
01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:09.680
<v Speaker 3>the validity of the scientific claims.</v>

1106
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:13.850
<v Speaker 3>It's really problematic for people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's problematic in a real way,</v>

1107
01:01:13.851 --> 01:01:18.851
<v Speaker 3>I think because one of the problems with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scientific viewpoint is it doesn't </v>

1108
01:01:18.851 --> 01:01:20.240
<v Speaker 3>tell you anything about what you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with your life.</v>

1109
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.720
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it solve the problem of value at </v>

1110
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:25.720
<v Speaker 3>all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1111
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.311
<v Speaker 3>it might make it more difficult because </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the fundamental scientific </v>

1112
01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:30.590
<v Speaker 3>claims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

1113
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:33.230
<v Speaker 3>is that every fact is of an equal </v>
<v Speaker 3>utility,</v>

1114
01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.820
<v Speaker 3>at least from a scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1115
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.110
<v Speaker 3>There's no hierarchy of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not exactly.</v>

1116
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.200
<v Speaker 3>It's not exactly true because you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of one theory is more true than </v>

1117
01:01:44.271 --> 01:01:49.271
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that boils down to saying that it's </v>

1118
01:01:49.271 --> 01:01:52.121
<v Speaker 3>more useful than another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think that that's a really </v>

1119
01:01:52.121 --> 01:01:52.121
<v Speaker 3>good exception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1120
01:01:52.121 --> 01:01:55.120
<v Speaker 3>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got the scientific atheist,</v>

1121
01:01:55.121 --> 01:02:00.121
<v Speaker 3>so on one end and you got the religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalists on the other and what </v>

1122
01:02:00.121 --> 01:02:00.170
<v Speaker 3>they both agree on whether they like it </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>

1123
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.940
<v Speaker 3>is that there's so much power in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific method that it's difficult to</v>

1124
01:02:04.941 --> 01:02:09.941
<v Speaker 3>dispute the validity of scientific facts</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they seem to exist in contradiction </v>

1125
01:02:09.941 --> 01:02:12.770
<v Speaker 3>to the older archaic stories.</v>

1126
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.490
<v Speaker 3>If you also accept them as fast fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>based accounts,</v>

1127
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.010
<v Speaker 3>so what do we do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1128
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:21.300
<v Speaker 3>your own scientific atheist end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1129
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.230
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1130
01:02:22.231 --> 01:02:24.420
<v Speaker 3>those old stories or just superstitious </v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

1131
01:02:24.421 --> 01:02:28.230
<v Speaker 3>second grade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barbaric archaic forms of science,</v>

1132
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:33.231
<v Speaker 3>you just dispense with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're nothing but trouble and if </v>

1133
01:02:33.231 --> 01:02:33.231
<v Speaker 3>they're on their fundamental aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1134
01:02:33.231 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll try to shoe horn science into this</v>

1135
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.160
<v Speaker 3>framework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and really that doesn't work very well.</v>

1136
01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:40.140
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work very well with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>claims of evolution.</v>

1137
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:41.180
<v Speaker 3>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fact,</v>

1138
01:02:41.181 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 3>it works very badly and that's a problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>because evolutionary theory is like,</v>

1139
01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.690
<v Speaker 3>it's a killer theory and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1140
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.250
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

1141
01:02:50.251 --> 01:02:55.251
<v Speaker 3>really hard and like it's not a complete</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory and there's lots of things we </v>

1142
01:02:55.251 --> 01:02:55.251
<v Speaker 3>don't know about evolution,</v>

1143
01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.440
<v Speaker 3>trying to hand wave that away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1145
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:04.940
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna work without dispensing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with most of biology.</v>

1146
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:07.760
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a big problem.</v>

1147
01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.760
<v Speaker 3>So here's another way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1148
01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:14.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't just need one way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the world.</v>

1149
01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you need two ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and I'm not exactly sure how </v>

1150
01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.161
<v Speaker 3>they should be related to one another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which should take precedence under which</v>

1151
01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:28.370
<v Speaker 3>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one problem is what's the world made</v>

1152
01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:30.020
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1153
01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.680
<v Speaker 3>what's the world conceptualized as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective place made of.</v>

1154
01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.850
<v Speaker 3>And the other is how should you conduct </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself while you're alive?</v>

1155
01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:43.810
<v Speaker 3>And there's no reason to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 3>those questions can be answered using </v>

1156
01:03:44.301 --> 01:03:45.350
<v Speaker 3>the same approach.</v>

1157
01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1158
01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:54.040
<v Speaker 3>physics has its methods and chemistry </v>
<v Speaker 3>has its methods and biology has its </v>

1159
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.401
<v Speaker 3>methods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a method for obtaining the truth can </v>

1160
01:03:57.401 --> 01:04:02.231
<v Speaker 3>be bound to a domain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why would we necessarily assume that </v>

1161
01:04:02.231 --> 01:04:06.281
<v Speaker 3>you could use the same set of tools to </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent the world as a place of </v>

1162
01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:09.890
<v Speaker 3>objects and to represent it as a place </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which a biological creature would act</v>

1163
01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.570
<v Speaker 3>in anyways?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm suggesting that we,</v>

1164
01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:19.280
<v Speaker 3>that we don't view it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have two different viewpoints.</v>

1165
01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they can be brought together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it's not obvious how,</v>

1166
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:28.690
<v Speaker 3>but that it's not a tenable solution to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of one in favor of the other,</v>

1167
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.130
<v Speaker 3>and I think the reason for that is</v>

1168
01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:36.640
<v Speaker 3>you need to know how to conduct yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

1169
01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:41.880
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a value system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even look at the damn world </v>

1170
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.240
<v Speaker 3>without a value system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not possible.</v>

1171
01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Your emotional health is dependent on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>value system.</v>

1172
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:49.300
<v Speaker 3>The way you interact with other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>is dependent on a value system.</v>

1173
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.510
<v Speaker 3>There is no getting away from it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll say,</v>

1174
01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:57.511
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no justification for any value </v>

1175
01:04:57.511 --> 01:04:57.511
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From a scientific perspective.</v>

1176
01:04:57.511 --> 01:04:59.980
<v Speaker 3>You're going to draw that conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 3>that no value system is valid.</v>

1177
01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Where the hell does that leave you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no down.</v>

1178
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 3>There's no APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no rationale for moving in any </v>

1179
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:11.281
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not even really any rationale </v>

1180
01:05:11.281 --> 01:05:11.281
<v Speaker 3>for living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so people say things like that,</v>

1181
01:05:11.281 --> 01:05:11.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1182
01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:13.630
<v Speaker 3>Why the hell should I care what happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a million years?</v>

1183
01:05:13.631 --> 01:05:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to know the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1184
01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1185
01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.940
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid but true.</v>

1186
01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.570
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I think it's stupid is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's just a game,</v>

1187
01:05:22.571 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can take anything of any sort and find</v>

1188
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:29.630
<v Speaker 3>a context in which it's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a rational games like</v>

1189
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:33.760
<v Speaker 3>who cares if a 100 children freeze to </v>
<v Speaker 3>death in a blizzard who,</v>

1190
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:35.740
<v Speaker 3>what differences is going to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>billion years?</v>

1191
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you say to someone who says that</v>

1192
01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:38.320
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1193
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.450
<v Speaker 3>seems like the wrong frame of Reference </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bucko that's what it looks like to me.</v>

1194
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:48.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because at some point you question the </v>

1195
01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.180
<v Speaker 3>dam frame of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not what you derive from it.</v>

1196
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:54.990
<v Speaker 3>And it certainly seems to me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations like that don't allow you to </v>

1197
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:58.180
<v Speaker 3>use that kind of frame of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something in humane about it and</v>

1198
01:05:58.181 --> 01:06:01.000
<v Speaker 3>that trumps the logic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least it should.</v>

1199
01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:06.450
<v Speaker 3>And if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all hell breaks loose and that </v>

1200
01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:06.450
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem to be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1201
01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:08.650
<v Speaker 3>so I have this quote from Shakespeare </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1202
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:14.250
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the world's a stage and all the men </v>

1203
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:14.250
<v Speaker 3>and women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>merely players,</v>

1204
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:17.251
<v Speaker 3>they have their exits and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>entrances and one man in his time plays </v>

1205
01:06:17.251 --> 01:06:17.251
<v Speaker 3>many parts.</v>

1206
01:06:17.251 --> 01:06:20.740
<v Speaker 3>While it's the sort of thing that you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>expect to dramatists to pant,</v>

1207
01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:26.010
<v Speaker 3>but that's how we looked at the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we still watch Shakespeare's plays </v>

1208
01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:30.060
<v Speaker 3>some hundreds of years later because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there seems to be something essential </v>

1209
01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.440
<v Speaker 3>captured in something about how people </v>
<v Speaker 3>do act.</v>

1210
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:37.470
<v Speaker 3>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think how people should and shouldn't </v>

1211
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:40.291
<v Speaker 3>act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because what fund is it going to a play </v>

1212
01:06:40.291 --> 01:06:42.610
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't outlined how someone should</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how someone shouldn't act.</v>

1213
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:46.330
<v Speaker 3>You want a good guy or a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they can be complex,</v>

1214
01:06:46.331 --> 01:06:48.340
<v Speaker 3>intermingling of good and bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1215
01:06:48.341 --> 01:06:52.660
<v Speaker 3>that makes it more sophisticated and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want a bad guy or a bad.</v>

1216
01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:58.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always want to see that contrast in </v>

1217
01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.290
<v Speaker 3>either within a character or between </v>
<v Speaker 3>characters.</v>

1218
01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:04.530
<v Speaker 3>And it's because you want to know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>live properly now it's how to be a good </v>

1219
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:05.410
<v Speaker 3>person and you want to know how to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>in properly,</v>

1220
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:10.860
<v Speaker 3>how to be a bad person so you can watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>out for people like that are so you can </v>

1221
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.230
<v Speaker 3>figure out what that means for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's compelling.</v>

1222
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:16.780
<v Speaker 3>And that's another thing that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about.</v>

1223
01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.480
<v Speaker 3>Why is it compelling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's compelling everyone.</v>

1224
01:07:23.481 --> 01:07:28.481
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that's so cool is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there aren't that many phenomena that </v>

1225
01:07:28.481 --> 01:07:29.060
<v Speaker 3>you can point to that are compelling to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>

1226
01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Music is close is a very rare person who</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't like at least some genre of </v>

1227
01:07:34.491 --> 01:07:35.960
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how narrow.</v>

1228
01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.860
<v Speaker 3>But the other one is stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hard pressed to find someone,</v>

1229
01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.980
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're younger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't like stories.</v>

1230
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Why is a waste of time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is there something going on?</v>

1231
01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1232
01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.380
<v Speaker 3>I think it's not only not a waste of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1233
01:07:54.381 --> 01:07:59.381
<v Speaker 3>it's actually the most fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 3>important thing you can possibly do </v>

1234
01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:02.231
<v Speaker 3>because there's no difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding stories and figuring out </v>

1235
01:08:02.231 --> 01:08:04.010
<v Speaker 3>how to get along in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1236
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:09.910
<v Speaker 3>And there's a tight relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story that you inhabit that </v>

1237
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:14.351
<v Speaker 3>structures your behavior and the games </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Piaget talked about that organize </v>

1238
01:08:14.351 --> 01:08:14.930
<v Speaker 3>people's behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1239
01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:19.940
<v Speaker 3>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that we can all sit in this </v>

1240
01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:23.171
<v Speaker 3>room together like this is because a </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge chunk of the value system that </v>

1241
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:29.411
<v Speaker 3>guides our behavior is shared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I am lecturing and you're sitting in </v>

1242
01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:32.870
<v Speaker 3>the classroom and that distinguishes us </v>
<v Speaker 3>to some degree,</v>

1243
01:08:32.871 --> 01:08:37.871
<v Speaker 3>but you know that that's partly merely a</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the difference in our </v>

1244
01:08:37.871 --> 01:08:41.860
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same trajectory we just </v>

1245
01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.561
<v Speaker 3>happened to occupy different positions </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a value hierarchy that we both </v>

1246
01:08:44.561 --> 01:08:47.531
<v Speaker 3>accept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so as long as you feel that that's </v>

1247
01:08:47.531 --> 01:08:47.810
<v Speaker 3>fair and just then you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>object to it.</v>

1248
01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:52.810
<v Speaker 3>But I'm here in the classroom for many </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the same reasons that you're here in </v>

1249
01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:53.660
<v Speaker 3>the classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the higher order parts of</v>

1250
01:08:53.661 --> 01:08:56.540
<v Speaker 3>the value structure and maybe right out </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of that,</v>

1251
01:08:56.690 --> 01:09:01.690
<v Speaker 3>because I've tried to figure out if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>push why you're doing what you're doing </v>

1252
01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:05.951
<v Speaker 3>right now to its ultimate limit so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get a story that superordinate to </v>

1253
01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:07.970
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like,</v>

1254
01:09:07.971 --> 01:09:12.971
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe that the investigation of </v>

1255
01:09:12.971 --> 01:09:12.971
<v Speaker 3>the world to acquire knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile.</v>

1256
01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are you here for?</v>

1257
01:09:15.021 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 3>And even if you know 80 percent of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation is to get a good stable job,</v>

1258
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:24.970
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still something outside of that </v>

1259
01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:24.970
<v Speaker 3>because the whole culture says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1260
01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:29.531
<v Speaker 3>you're more likely to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>function properly in a good stable job </v>

1261
01:09:29.531 --> 01:09:33.190
<v Speaker 3>if you're the sort of person who knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to go out in the world and forage </v>

1262
01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:33.190
<v Speaker 3>for information usefully.</v>

1263
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.260
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's very much analogous </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the hero's story.</v>

1264
01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:40.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like you'd go out and you search </v>
<v Speaker 3>the unknown to find something of value,</v>

1265
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:44.780
<v Speaker 3>and so fundamentally that's what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing in the classroom and the reason we</v>

1266
01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:49.781
<v Speaker 3>can all organize our behaviors because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we accept that framework consciously </v>

1267
01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:55.270
<v Speaker 3>consciously would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know how to articulate it </v>

1268
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.270
<v Speaker 3>unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1269
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

1270
01:09:55.641 --> 01:10:00.641
<v Speaker 3>We know how to act out the patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether we know that can say the rules </v>

1271
01:10:00.641 --> 01:10:00.641
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter.</v>

1272
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Same as a wolf pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know the dam,</v>

1273
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:08.560
<v Speaker 3>we know the procedures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could describe them with an </v>

1274
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.470
<v Speaker 3>articulated value structure.</v>

1275
01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Let's take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1276
01:10:16.941 --> 01:10:19.370
<v Speaker 3>so let's go back to the complexity </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1277
01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.590
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually think it's the.</v>

1278
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:27.010
<v Speaker 3>In some sense it's the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem when when you read about the </v>

1279
01:10:27.531 --> 01:10:32.300
<v Speaker 3>terror management theorists types and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they think that death is the fundamental</v>

1280
01:10:32.301 --> 01:10:37.301
<v Speaker 3>problem and that's a good argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's definitely a fundamental </v>

1281
01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:41.201
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's a subset of the </v>

1282
01:10:41.201 --> 01:10:41.201
<v Speaker 3>complexity problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1283
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:47.110
<v Speaker 3>and the reason I think that is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people's lives become so </v>

1284
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.410
<v Speaker 3>complex that they'd rather be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1285
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:54.370
<v Speaker 3>And the reason they seek death through </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide is to make the complexity go </v>

1286
01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:55.430
<v Speaker 3>away because complexity causes </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

1287
01:10:55.431 --> 01:10:57.400
<v Speaker 3>If it's an controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1288
01:10:57.410 --> 01:11:00.980
<v Speaker 3>things beyond your control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that can happen.</v>

1289
01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're hit by three or four </v>

1290
01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:06.180
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1291
01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.280
<v Speaker 3>maybe you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1292
01:11:07.281 --> 01:11:09.950
<v Speaker 3>the political system collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's hyperinflation,</v>

1293
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>you lose your job and you have someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you love or two</v>

1294
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.850
<v Speaker 2>people die and maybe you get cancer or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1295
01:11:16.851 --> 01:11:21.851
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things happen to people and they </v>

1296
01:11:21.851 --> 01:11:21.851
<v Speaker 2>just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1297
01:11:21.851 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 2>there's no getting out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just too much.</v>

1298
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's very </v>

1299
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:30.171
<v Speaker 2>interesting about being a psychologist </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what you learn if you're going </v>

1300
01:11:30.171 --> 01:11:34.191
<v Speaker 2>to be a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that people come to you with mental </v>

1301
01:11:34.191 --> 01:11:34.191
<v Speaker 2>illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's almost never true.</v>

1302
01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 2>People come to you because their lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so damn complicated,</v>

1303
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:42.651
<v Speaker 2>they cannot stay on top of them in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that doesn't make it look like </v>

1304
01:11:42.651 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to get more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

1305
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:45.690
<v Speaker 2>And so then that causes the symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1306
01:11:45.691 --> 01:11:50.691
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's this old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of a metaphor for genetic </v>

1307
01:11:50.691 --> 01:11:53.130
<v Speaker 2>susceptibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take a balloon and blow it up until it's</v>

1308
01:11:53.131 --> 01:11:54.120
<v Speaker 2>beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tolerance,</v>

1309
01:11:54.121 --> 01:11:55.710
<v Speaker 2>it's going to blow out at the weakest </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1310
01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of what a genetic </v>

1311
01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.451
<v Speaker 2>susceptibility is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I just keep adding complexity on top </v>

1312
01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:05.631
<v Speaker 2>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point you'll blow out at your </v>

1313
01:12:05.631 --> 01:12:05.631
<v Speaker 2>weakest point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1314
01:12:05.631 --> 01:12:07.290
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll get physiologically ill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it'll start drinking,</v>

1315
01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:09.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe we'll develop an anxiety disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'll get ocd,</v>

1316
01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:11.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll get depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1317
01:12:11.581 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 2>There'll be something about you that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the weakest point and if I just push,</v>

1318
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.600
<v Speaker 2>that's where you'll blow out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a mental illness,</v>

1319
01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:21.930
<v Speaker 2>but those things are almost never just </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen sometimes,</v>

1320
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:26.931
<v Speaker 2>but not very often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually people have just been hammered </v>

1321
01:12:26.931 --> 01:12:29.691
<v Speaker 2>like two or three different ways and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they collapse in the direction of </v>

1322
01:12:29.691 --> 01:12:32.790
<v Speaker 2>their biological weakness and then maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put them back together,</v>

1323
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:37.791
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost always a complexity </v>
<v Speaker 2>related phenomena rather than a mental </v>

1324
01:12:37.791 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 2>illness related phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not always,</v>

1325
01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:41.520
<v Speaker 2>but almost always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

1326
01:12:41.521 --> 01:12:45.870
<v Speaker 2>so now you've got this complexity </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and you think,</v>

1327
01:12:45.871 --> 01:12:50.871
<v Speaker 2>well you deal with it conceptually and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of akin to the idea that it's </v>

1328
01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:54.930
<v Speaker 2>belief systems that protect you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>death anxiety.</v>

1329
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 2>The ideas are roughly comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again that's,</v>

1330
01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:03.380
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the sort of thing only a </v>

1331
01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.421
<v Speaker 2>psychologist could think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God because psychologists think </v>

1332
01:13:05.421 --> 01:13:05.421
<v Speaker 2>that everything about you happens inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>your head,</v>

1333
01:13:05.421 --> 01:13:06.270
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your psyche.</v>

1334
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:11.271
<v Speaker 2>But that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge chunk of you that's </v>

1335
01:13:11.271 --> 01:13:13.140
<v Speaker 2>outside of you completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is a really good example.</v>

1336
01:13:13.141 --> 01:13:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
01:13:13.531 --> 01:13:16.380
<v Speaker 2>we know the oldest cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a medieval city in France,</v>

1338
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:21.950
<v Speaker 2>beautiful old city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All cities were walled and the reason </v>

1339
01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:27.411
<v Speaker 2>for that was because they were places of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth and if you didn't put walls </v>

1340
01:13:27.411 --> 01:13:31.620
<v Speaker 2>around them then other people would come</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and steal everything and kill you.</v>

1341
01:13:31.621 --> 01:13:33.840
<v Speaker 2>So like having some walls was a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

1342
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Like the same as having walls in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house is a good idea.</v>

1343
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Walls between your rooms are a good idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>or borders between categories are a good</v>

1344
01:13:42.511 --> 01:13:42.900
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

1345
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:47.220
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the way you simplify the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is by building walls,</v>

1346
01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:51.090
<v Speaker 2>walls around your space because then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of things can come in and so</v>

1347
01:13:51.091 --> 01:13:53.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to think about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not conceptual,</v>

1348
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:55.830
<v Speaker 2>it's practical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1349
01:13:56.190 --> 01:14:01.190
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I think I figured out </v>

1350
01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 2>recently is the fundamental political </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between people.</v>

1351
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:06.360
<v Speaker 2>And it looks to me like the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>political differences.</v>

1352
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:09.090
<v Speaker 2>How many walls should there be around </v>
<v Speaker 2>your stuff?</v>

1353
01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:15.020
<v Speaker 2>And the ultimate liberal answer is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the ultimate conservative answer is </v>

1354
01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:17.530
<v Speaker 2>bring on those walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1355
01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.860
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting about both those </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspectives,</v>

1356
01:14:20.861 --> 01:14:25.861
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's temperamental </v>

1357
01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:25.861
<v Speaker 2>contributions to them and second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're both valid.</v>

1358
01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:30.510
<v Speaker 2>So one of the mysteries I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>permeates psychometric psychology right </v>

1359
01:14:32.981 --> 01:14:37.981
<v Speaker 2>now is why the temperamental factors </v>
<v Speaker 2>that influence politics are those </v>

1360
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:40.390
<v Speaker 2>particular temperamental factors.</v>

1361
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 2>So there's five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1362
01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:42.340
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this classic,</v>

1363
01:14:42.341 --> 01:14:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Big Five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extroversion,</v>

1364
01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:44.650
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness,</v>

1365
01:14:44.651 --> 01:14:47.080
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1366
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:49.660
<v Speaker 2>the biggest predictors of political </v>
<v Speaker 2>allegiance,</v>

1367
01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:52.000
<v Speaker 2>forget about the politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>types for a minute,</v>

1368
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:57.390
<v Speaker 2>but on the liberal to conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>access is that the liberals are low in </v>

1369
01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:01.021
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and high in openness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the conservatives are high in </v>

1370
01:15:01.021 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and low in openness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then you think,</v>

1371
01:15:02.141 --> 01:15:05.650
<v Speaker 2>well why those two traits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first question and the second</v>

1372
01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:07.960
<v Speaker 2>question is why those two traits </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

1373
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:10.120
<v Speaker 2>given that they're not very highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlated,</v>

1374
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really quite independent,</v>

1375
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:17.490
<v Speaker 2>so why do they co-vary along the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political oxys and I think this is the </v>

1376
01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:21.001
<v Speaker 2>reason I think it's exactly that is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>open people like to live on the </v>

1377
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:26.851
<v Speaker 2>periphery of boundaries and they like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>break boundaries between things because </v>

1378
01:15:26.851 --> 01:15:29.050
<v Speaker 2>interesting things happen when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think a different way,</v>

1379
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.240
<v Speaker 2>when you think outside of the box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

1380
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:34.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what opened people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always think outside of the box,</v>

1381
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:36.360
<v Speaker 2>no matter what box you put them in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1382
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:41.370
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes you meet people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>so open that they're completely </v>

1383
01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:44.461
<v Speaker 2>disorganized there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their thought process is almost </v>

1384
01:15:44.461 --> 01:15:47.221
<v Speaker 2>completely association like a dreamer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just jumped from one thing to </v>

1385
01:15:47.221 --> 01:15:47.950
<v Speaker 2>another and they're very interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to.</v>

1386
01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:53.190
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard for those people to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives together because they're </v>

1387
01:15:53.190 --> 01:15:55.621
<v Speaker 2>interested in absolutely everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their attention just flips all over the </v>

1388
01:15:55.621 --> 01:15:59.401
<v Speaker 2>place and so they're open and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually does go along with higher </v>

1389
01:15:59.401 --> 01:16:02.791
<v Speaker 2>intelligence generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and then if they're low in </v>

1390
01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:06.451
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't see any utility in order and </v>

1391
01:16:06.451 --> 01:16:09.721
<v Speaker 2>order like orderly people because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of conscientiousness and the </v>

1392
01:16:09.721 --> 01:16:11.560
<v Speaker 2>biggest determiner of political belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the conscientious domain.</v>

1393
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:16.800
<v Speaker 2>The orderly people like to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in its separate place and </v>

1394
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.260
<v Speaker 2>properly structured and so you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>their world is box inside a box,</v>

1395
01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:25.290
<v Speaker 2>inside a shelf of boxes and then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shelf of boxes inside another box and </v>

1396
01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:26.920
<v Speaker 2>all those boxes are nice and neat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tight.</v>

1397
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Nothing inside the ms dot touching and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in every box is the same </v>

1398
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.190
<v Speaker 2>thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that,</v>

1399
01:16:32.191 --> 01:16:36.850
<v Speaker 2>that you can see the utility in that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that as far as we'd been able to tell,</v>

1400
01:16:36.851 --> 01:16:41.460
<v Speaker 2>is also associated with disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity and disgust sent.</v>

1401
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.630
<v Speaker 2>People are disgusted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

1402
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:48.810
<v Speaker 2>when things that shouldn't be touching </v>
<v Speaker 2>are touching like something horrible </v>

1403
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:49.240
<v Speaker 2>stuck to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1404
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:54.570
<v Speaker 2>that that produces a very visceral sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of disgust and it's a boundary violation</v>

1405
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:59.910
<v Speaker 2>because that's what disgust is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's indic in index is a boundary </v>

1406
01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:03.181
<v Speaker 2>violation and you can you how separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>people should be from one another as </v>

1407
01:17:04.481 --> 01:17:09.481
<v Speaker 2>individuals or in groups is an entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>debatable issue because there's huge </v>

1408
01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:14.801
<v Speaker 2>advantages when people mingle and mix </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's huge dangers when people </v>

1409
01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:17.510
<v Speaker 2>mingle and mix and so at some point you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1410
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:19.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dangers are overwhelming.</v>

1411
01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:21.020
<v Speaker 2>The positives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then another point you say,</v>

1412
01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the positives are overwhelming,</v>

1413
01:17:22.611 --> 01:17:27.611
<v Speaker 2>the dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have a continual argument about </v>

1414
01:17:27.611 --> 01:17:30.131
<v Speaker 2>that with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly with people have </v>

1415
01:17:30.131 --> 01:17:32.891
<v Speaker 2>different temperament than you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the terrible temptation is to </v>

1416
01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:38.051
<v Speaker 2>assume that only those people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>your temperament are correct and that's </v>

1417
01:17:38.051 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 2>just those other temperaments wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist if that was true.</v>

1418
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it from,</v>

1419
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.530
<v Speaker 2>just say if you look at it from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>strictly biological perspective,</v>

1420
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:51.100
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we do to simplify the </v>

1421
01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 2>world is to frame it physically and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at this,</v>

1422
01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:55.190
<v Speaker 2>you've got wall number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have wall number two,</v>

1423
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:58.640
<v Speaker 2>but then inside the walls you have walls</v>
<v Speaker 2>around everything.</v>

1424
01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:02.540
<v Speaker 2>All these houses are walls and inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>the houses there are walls as well,</v>

1425
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:07.870
<v Speaker 2>and so everything is and what you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you put walls around things as you </v>

1426
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 2>make part of the world simpler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1427
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the reason you have houses so that </v>

1428
01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:15.710
<v Speaker 2>every buddy and his dog isn't in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

1429
01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:20.860
<v Speaker 2>You just want those few people that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can barely tolerate in your house and </v>

1430
01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:22.490
<v Speaker 2>not all those other strangers and God </v>
<v Speaker 2>only knows what they're gonna do.</v>

1431
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:26.720
<v Speaker 2>You'll still invite people in now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then because maybe you're sick and tired</v>

1432
01:18:26.721 --> 01:18:31.721
<v Speaker 2>and bored of the people that are in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>house and so you want a little bit of </v>

1433
01:18:31.721 --> 01:18:34.601
<v Speaker 2>new information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want those barriers to be there </v>

1434
01:18:34.601 --> 01:18:36.860
<v Speaker 2>so that you can voluntarily modulate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information flow.</v>

1435
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the first thing you do and you</v>

1436
01:18:39.461 --> 01:18:44.461
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you set up rules with everybody </v>

1437
01:18:44.461 --> 01:18:44.461
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1438
01:18:44.461 --> 01:18:44.540
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to have some walls so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't come in,</v>

1439
01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:49.541
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm going to do is pay you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that privilege by letting you have some </v>

1440
01:18:49.541 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 2>walls where people can't come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that's analogous.</v>

1441
01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:58.180
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination in relationship to sex </v>

1442
01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:03.220
<v Speaker 2>because I've been thinking a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination lately because everybody </v>

1443
01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:06.071
<v Speaker 2>thinks discrimination is a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very stupid proposition </v>

1444
01:19:06.071 --> 01:19:09.791
<v Speaker 2>because you're discriminating all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and the most fundamental form of </v>

1445
01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:11.600
<v Speaker 2>discrimination is choice of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner.</v>

1446
01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:14.480
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why should that even be allowed?</v>

1447
01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Because it is the most fundamental form </v>
<v Speaker 2>of discrimination.</v>

1448
01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:22.511
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost everyone is racially prejudice </v>

1449
01:19:22.511 --> 01:19:22.700
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to sexual partners.</v>

1450
01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:23.720
<v Speaker 2>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1451
01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:24.590
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1452
01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:25.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about,</v>

1453
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>

1454
01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.660
<v Speaker 2>do you use age as an exclusionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>criteria?</v>

1455
01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Probably do use physical attractiveness </v>
<v Speaker 2>only in so far as you're able,</v>

1456
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You use it completely.</v>

1457
01:19:36.891 --> 01:19:38.870
<v Speaker 2>If you could get away with it roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

1458
01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:43.871
<v Speaker 2>but you can't because the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractive people aren't going to be </v>

1459
01:19:43.871 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 2>anywhere near you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can't do it,</v>

1460
01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:45.800
<v Speaker 2>but you'd like to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Health.</v>

1461
01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strength.</v>

1462
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wealth.</v>

1463
01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Education,</v>

1464
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:54.020
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's unbelievably discriminatory.</v>

1465
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:57.080
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why is that justifiable?</v>

1466
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1467
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:06.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to say no to me if I get to say </v>

1468
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.550
<v Speaker 2>no to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

1469
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:10.930
<v Speaker 2>We've agreed that everybody gets to </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminate on that basis and because </v>

1470
01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:13.950
<v Speaker 2>everybody can do it then it's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that,</v>

1471
01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's very much we're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1472
01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:22.101
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in Huxley's brave new world where </v>

1473
01:20:22.101 --> 01:20:25.791
<v Speaker 2>the family had been completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>demolished rate in children were </v>

1474
01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:29.010
<v Speaker 2>conceived in bottles and given an </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced in factories.</v>

1475
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:33.360
<v Speaker 2>So the whole idea of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between sex and procreation had become a</v>

1476
01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:37.800
<v Speaker 2>taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the Mantras,</v>

1477
01:20:37.801 --> 01:20:42.801
<v Speaker 2>the slogans of the society was everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>belongs to everyone else and so it was </v>

1478
01:20:42.901 --> 01:20:45.030
<v Speaker 2>actually a social photo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul,</v>

1479
01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:50.450
<v Speaker 2>to refuse to sleep with someone just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a social for Paul to have any </v>

1480
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:55.161
<v Speaker 2>exclusionary relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because another thing you might notice </v>

1481
01:20:55.161 --> 01:20:56.880
<v Speaker 2>is that there's nothing more </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminatory than falling in love with</v>

1482
01:20:56.881 --> 01:21:01.881
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're special and all the </v>

1483
01:21:01.881 --> 01:21:04.440
<v Speaker 2>rest of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's the ultimate exclusionary act.</v>

1484
01:21:04.441 --> 01:21:09.441
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet we presume that that's an </v>

1485
01:21:09.441 --> 01:21:09.441
<v Speaker 2>acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only acceptable.</v>

1486
01:21:09.441 --> 01:21:11.400
<v Speaker 2>We demand that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a right.</v>

1487
01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:16.170
<v Speaker 2>And while that's where thinking about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot anyways,</v>

1488
01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:19.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you're doing is by,</v>

1489
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.350
<v Speaker 2>by agreeing to this segregation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing,</v>

1490
01:21:22.351 --> 01:21:25.860
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is carving off little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bits of the world that are simple enough</v>

1491
01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:30.980
<v Speaker 2>so that someone like you can live for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some amount of time there without too </v>

1492
01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.310
<v Speaker 2>much danger and everyone agrees to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1493
01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking because everybody needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>to engage in that process of </v>

1494
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:39.890
<v Speaker 2>simplification and safety provision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1495
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.830
<v Speaker 2>so we have towns and the towns are </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but boxes but inside bolt inside</v>

1496
01:21:43.831 --> 01:21:46.680
<v Speaker 2>boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a good,</v>

1497
01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:52.140
<v Speaker 2>a good schematic of a little little </v>
<v Speaker 2>house and you can see that even inside </v>

1498
01:21:52.891 --> 01:21:57.891
<v Speaker 2>the same place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we segregate off rooms for different </v>

1499
01:21:57.891 --> 01:22:00.051
<v Speaker 2>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what's interesting too is that </v>

1500
01:22:00.051 --> 01:22:00.960
<v Speaker 2>we set up those rooms as a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic spaces,</v>

1501
01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you furnish them and you furnish them</v>

1502
01:22:03.631 --> 01:22:05.580
<v Speaker 2>with things that tell you how to behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that room.</v>

1503
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:11.300
<v Speaker 2>So table and chairs tells you that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're going to eat and that's </v>

1504
01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:11.910
<v Speaker 2>where people are going to sit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're roughly going to.</v>

1505
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:17.030
<v Speaker 2>They're going to sit facing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has certain implications because </v>

1506
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:20.211
<v Speaker 2>the chairs don't face the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they face each other and you have a </v>

1507
01:22:20.211 --> 01:22:20.930
<v Speaker 2>living room where it's comfortable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fire and you know,</v>

1508
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.190
<v Speaker 2>you're setting up little stages </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

1509
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 2>So that just like kids do when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend,</v>

1510
01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:30.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all assign each other roles and </v>

1511
01:22:30.810 --> 01:22:33.531
<v Speaker 2>then they lay out a little drama and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you do when you invite </v>

1512
01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:33.531
<v Speaker 2>someone over for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's sit in the living room.</v>

1513
01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably get a drink if you sit </v>

1514
01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.521
<v Speaker 2>in the living room and hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have some conversation </v>

1515
01:22:40.521 --> 01:22:44.030
<v Speaker 2>and so it's a bounded place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are rules that apply and then you </v>

1516
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:47.511
<v Speaker 2>get to have a little exploration inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>that set of bounded rules and if you're </v>

1517
01:22:47.511 --> 01:22:52.071
<v Speaker 2>open and you're going to discuss all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things and if you're </v>

1518
01:22:52.071 --> 01:22:53.250
<v Speaker 2>conservative and closed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to discuss a very,</v>

1519
01:22:53.251 --> 01:22:56.640
<v Speaker 2>very small subset of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and so,</v>

1520
01:22:56.641 --> 01:23:00.380
<v Speaker 2>hopefully everyone will agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one form of,</v>

1521
01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:03.180
<v Speaker 2>of binding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then another is while we,</v>

1522
01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:06.640
<v Speaker 2>we put boxes around each other when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to groups.</v>

1523
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:09.280
<v Speaker 2>And so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a picture from the,</v>

1524
01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:14.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Democratic convention when </v>

1525
01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Obama was elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

1526
01:23:17.190 --> 01:23:22.190
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that people segregate </v>

1527
01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:23.260
<v Speaker 2>themselves into little micro groups like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats and Republicans,</v>

1528
01:23:23.261 --> 01:23:25.770
<v Speaker 2>and they basically do that on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperamental grounds,</v>

1529
01:23:25.771 --> 01:23:27.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>

1530
01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:30.000
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they produce these,</v>

1531
01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:33.600
<v Speaker 2>these games that everyone knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

1532
01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's another form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplification.</v>

1533
01:23:36.961 --> 01:23:40.710
<v Speaker 2>So when you bring all these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>together at a,</v>

1534
01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:45.800
<v Speaker 2>at a political convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they all have the same </v>

1535
01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:48.621
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't and it could degenerate into </v>

1536
01:23:48.621 --> 01:23:51.741
<v Speaker 2>chaos and sometimes that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get big demonstrations at these </v>

1537
01:23:51.741 --> 01:23:52.470
<v Speaker 2>places and sometimes people throw tear </v>
<v Speaker 2>gas and all of that,</v>

1538
01:23:52.471 --> 01:23:57.471
<v Speaker 2>but mostly speaking it's pretty peaceful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that there's </v>

1539
01:23:57.471 --> 01:24:01.910
<v Speaker 2>a set of procedures in place that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some historical justification that are </v>

1540
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:06.651
<v Speaker 2>embedded within the shared cultural and </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief system and everybody goes there </v>

1541
01:24:06.651 --> 01:24:08.910
<v Speaker 2>and agrees to play by the rules roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

1542
01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:12.030
<v Speaker 2>and so then they can elect a candidate.</v>

1543
01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:15.060
<v Speaker 2>It can kind of flip it down to a binary </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice for the election,</v>

1544
01:24:15.061 --> 01:24:16.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes or no,</v>

1545
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:20.250
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nobody gets killed usually.</v>

1546
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:25.310
<v Speaker 2>So Hooray for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hell of a thing to pull off to </v>

1547
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:26.580
<v Speaker 2>be able to generate out of 300 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1548
01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:29.160
<v Speaker 2>two people to run for the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

1549
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Then let everyone play a game to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine who they're going to be and </v>

1550
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:35.790
<v Speaker 2>then to have the bloody thing function </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable.</v>

1551
01:24:35.791 --> 01:24:38.580
<v Speaker 2>He through power transitions like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>never happens.</v>

1552
01:24:38.581 --> 01:24:43.581
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a complete bloody miracle and </v>

1553
01:24:43.581 --> 01:24:46.101
<v Speaker 2>hardly any societies have ever pulled it</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the power transition being the </v>

1554
01:24:46.101 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 2>really important thing because a tyrant </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be stable for awhile,</v>

1555
01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:51.270
<v Speaker 2>but usually what happens is he dies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all hell breaks loose.</v>

1556
01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.840
<v Speaker 2>So I think George Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was George Washington that </v>

1557
01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:01.100
<v Speaker 2>said or had said about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that he was a great leader </v>

1558
01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:04.581
<v Speaker 2>wasn't because he was president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because he stopped being president </v>

1559
01:25:04.581 --> 01:25:08.930
<v Speaker 2>and that's really worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the next thing that sort of </v>

1560
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:12.570
<v Speaker 2>simplifies your world is actually your </v>
<v Speaker 2>physiological structure,</v>

1561
01:25:12.630 --> 01:25:14.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we talked about that a little bit.</v>

1562
01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only see things there in front </v>

1563
01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.101
<v Speaker 2>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not things that are to decide or behind </v>

1564
01:25:22.101 --> 01:25:22.101
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1565
01:25:22.101 --> 01:25:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you can only see a very narrow.</v>

1566
01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:31.380
<v Speaker 2>You can only see a very narrow chunk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the electromagnetic spectrum,</v>

1567
01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:35.700
<v Speaker 2>roughly that chunk that enables you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see by sunlight and to detect ripe fruit</v>

1568
01:25:35.701 --> 01:25:40.701
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very evolutionarily determined </v>

1569
01:25:40.701 --> 01:25:40.701
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1570
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:46.990
<v Speaker 2>you see things of a certain size quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily because they're handy,</v>

1571
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:52.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So objects manifest themselves to you as</v>

1572
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:57.510
<v Speaker 2>things because they have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to your capacity to use </v>

1573
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:59.290
<v Speaker 2>them as tools and that's dependent on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your size.</v>

1574
01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:02.560
<v Speaker 2>You have a certain strength and not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different strength.</v>

1575
01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:05.210
<v Speaker 2>You have a certain degree of </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulation.</v>

1576
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:07.250
<v Speaker 2>There's some things you can represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

1577
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:11.390
<v Speaker 2>So you have limitations that screen out </v>
<v Speaker 2>from your consideration.</v>

1578
01:26:11.391 --> 01:26:15.560
<v Speaker 2>All sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's bad because for example,</v>

1579
01:26:15.561 --> 01:26:20.561
<v Speaker 2>before people discovered germs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of them zipping about </v>

1580
01:26:20.561 --> 01:26:23.801
<v Speaker 2>killing people and the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't see them wasn't such a good </v>

1581
01:26:23.801 --> 01:26:23.801
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>

1582
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:29.770
<v Speaker 2>we're also not as overwhelmed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity as we might be if we could </v>

1583
01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:29.850
<v Speaker 2>detect everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1584
01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:34.880
<v Speaker 2>one of the problems with being connected</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much is that it's easy to drown in </v>

1585
01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:39.491
<v Speaker 2>information and that's rough information</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Jersey can't stay off your damn </v>

1586
01:26:39.591 --> 01:26:41.720
<v Speaker 2>computer because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1587
01:26:41.721 --> 01:26:45.380
<v Speaker 2>it opens up your senses far beyond their</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal limitations.</v>

1588
01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.110
<v Speaker 2>And so where should you stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1589
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.160
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1590
01:26:49.161 --> 01:26:54.161
<v Speaker 2>you're on the damn thing like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a pensioner on a slot machine and </v>

1591
01:26:54.161 --> 01:26:58.751
<v Speaker 2>for many of the same reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your body also filters out the world </v>

1592
01:26:58.751 --> 01:27:03.701
<v Speaker 2>for you and provides you with access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some information and not access to </v>

1593
01:27:03.701 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the same thing as the case with</v>

1594
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:08.330
<v Speaker 2>your nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do read.</v>

1595
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:13.390
<v Speaker 2>I put the first picture there of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the central nervous system that </v>

1596
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:15.530
<v Speaker 2>controls voluntary movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1597
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I put it there because people like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that their brain is in their head,</v>

1598
01:27:20.721 --> 01:27:25.721
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid way of thinking about it as </v>

1599
01:27:25.721 --> 01:27:27.941
<v Speaker 2>far as I'm concerned because you have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>awful lot of neurological tissue </v>

1600
01:27:27.941 --> 01:27:29.900
<v Speaker 2>distributed through your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your autonomic nervous system,</v>

1601
01:27:29.901 --> 01:27:32.300
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is mostly distributed through your</v>

1602
01:27:32.301 --> 01:27:34.790
<v Speaker 2>body has more neurons in it than your </v>
<v Speaker 2>central nervous system.</v>

1603
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:38.060
<v Speaker 2>And so you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You aren't a brain and a in a body.</v>

1604
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:39.140
<v Speaker 2>You know your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1605
01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:44.340
<v Speaker 2>your brain is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really distributed through your whole </v>

1606
01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.111
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the idea that you have a </v>

1607
01:27:47.111 --> 01:27:50.741
<v Speaker 2>brain in a body is kind of a holdover </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the idea that you have a soul in a </v>

1608
01:27:50.741 --> 01:27:53.090
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not that I'm necessarily criticizing</v>

1609
01:27:53.091 --> 01:27:58.091
<v Speaker 2>that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think they kinda got grafted onto </v>

1610
01:27:58.091 --> 01:28:00.341
<v Speaker 2>one another and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that is that it,</v>

1611
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:05.150
<v Speaker 2>and this is the so it's the soul body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

1612
01:28:05.151 --> 01:28:06.350
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

1613
01:28:06.351 --> 01:28:09.410
<v Speaker 2>body dichotomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is the same dichotomy.</v>

1614
01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:15.160
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with that is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to think of thought as something </v>

1615
01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.121
<v Speaker 2>that's abstracted away from the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that was an enlightenment </v>

1616
01:28:19.121 --> 01:28:19.121
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that,</v>

1617
01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.280
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just like the sole shouldn't be </v>

1618
01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.520
<v Speaker 2>contaminated by the demands of the body.</v>

1619
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.680
<v Speaker 2>If you were going to be pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritually,</v>

1620
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:32.950
<v Speaker 2>so your thought shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminated by your subjectivity and </v>

1621
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:34.640
<v Speaker 2>your emotions and your motivations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

1622
01:28:34.641 --> 01:28:39.641
<v Speaker 2>It should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your abstractions should be independent </v>

1623
01:28:39.641 --> 01:28:42.611
<v Speaker 2>of your subjectivity and rationality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion are,</v>

1624
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:47.840
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are construed in that manner as enemies.</v>

1625
01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:52.700
<v Speaker 2>You know that the purpose of rationality</v>
<v Speaker 2>as to dispense with the irrationality of</v>

1626
01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:55.640
<v Speaker 2>emotion and motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's Freud.</v>

1627
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Freud's idea of the property functioning</v>
<v Speaker 2>ego is something like that too,</v>

1628
01:28:59.151 --> 01:29:04.151
<v Speaker 2>because the Ed is this place of </v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsion and and drive and the ego has</v>

1629
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:08.940
<v Speaker 2>to basically suppress that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>service of the Super Ego.</v>

1630
01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:12.870
<v Speaker 2>There's no idea of integration really in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud now.</v>

1631
01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be rough on Freud and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think part of the reason that he thought</v>

1632
01:29:16.591 --> 01:29:21.591
<v Speaker 2>that way is because the patients he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>were precisely those who weren't very </v>

1633
01:29:23.281 --> 01:29:28.281
<v Speaker 2>well integrated because of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological past and so they didn't </v>

1634
01:29:28.281 --> 01:29:32.091
<v Speaker 2>know how to get those subsystems up into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overarching game and so their only </v>

1635
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:37.290
<v Speaker 2>alternative was something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppression or repression.</v>

1636
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:38.990
<v Speaker 2>Because if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1637
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:42.930
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know how to be aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sophisticated way,</v>

1638
01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:47.400
<v Speaker 2>you're still going to be aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to have to inhibit it.</v>

1639
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Control yourself because you cannot just</v>
<v Speaker 2>be aggressive around people.</v>

1640
01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:57.291
<v Speaker 2>It just won't go well for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if you can't do it in a </v>

1641
01:29:57.291 --> 01:30:00.021
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to repress it or you're or </v>

1642
01:30:00.021 --> 01:30:00.021
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the options,</v>

1643
01:30:00.210 --> 01:30:05.210
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you start thinking about the </v>

1644
01:30:05.210 --> 01:30:08.811
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nervous system as part of the body </v>

1645
01:30:08.811 --> 01:30:12.200
<v Speaker 2>as an inseparable part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then then the function of thinking </v>

1646
01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.041
<v Speaker 2>starts to become something different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so much the object of abstract </v>

1647
01:30:16.041 --> 01:30:17.910
<v Speaker 2>representation of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of what you're pursuing if</v>

1648
01:30:17.911 --> 01:30:22.911
<v Speaker 2>you're a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like it's more like </v>

1649
01:30:24.551 --> 01:30:29.551
<v Speaker 2>conceptualization of and practice the </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice of the proper way of being in </v>

1650
01:30:30.131 --> 01:30:34.520
<v Speaker 2>the world and I think that's what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>more interested in any ways.</v>

1651
01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how you can't be since </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living thing and you're.</v>

1652
01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:45.250
<v Speaker 2>You're overwhelmingly motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too</v>

1653
01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:53.150
<v Speaker 2>successfully manifest those actions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are living thing has to manifest in </v>

1654
01:30:53.731 --> 01:30:58.731
<v Speaker 2>order to continue and it's complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can boil it down to survival </v>

1655
01:30:58.741 --> 01:31:03.741
<v Speaker 2>and reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good overarching simplification,</v>

1656
01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:09.150
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing simple about </v>
<v Speaker 2>survival and reproduction.</v>

1657
01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean all sorts of complex monsters </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge out of that even simple </v>

1658
01:31:14.230 --> 01:31:17.400
<v Speaker 2>conceptualization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not unreasonable to assume that</v>

1659
01:31:17.401 --> 01:31:22.401
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that people generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do is to continue living in as </v>

1660
01:31:22.401 --> 01:31:23.950
<v Speaker 2>pain free manner as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

1661
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.530
<v Speaker 2>That's a simplification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the reason I'm,</v>

1662
01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:33.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm making that case is because the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a body and yet the fact </v>

1663
01:31:34.051 --> 01:31:39.051
<v Speaker 2>that you have a nervous system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>another set of limitations on how it is </v>

1664
01:31:39.051 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to interact with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1665
01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we've got the nervous system.</v>

1666
01:31:41.941 --> 01:31:43.950
<v Speaker 2>We can go to higher resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

1667
01:31:43.951 --> 01:31:46.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a brain and the brain,</v>

1668
01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:47.910
<v Speaker 2>see if I can.</v>

1669
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's the prefrontal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the frontal cortex there.</v>

1670
01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:55.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's the temporal cortex there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the pridal cortex there.</v>

1671
01:31:55.891 --> 01:31:58.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's the sensory cortex there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these were,</v>

1672
01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:03.860
<v Speaker 2>if I remember properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these were divisions that I think we're </v>

1673
01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.830
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while they were first thought through in</v>

1674
01:32:05.831 --> 01:32:08.530
<v Speaker 2>the late 19th and early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 20th century,</v>

1675
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:11.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're slightly specialized.</v>

1676
01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:16.620
<v Speaker 2>So this cortex back heres is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does a lot of the elaboration of vision </v>

1677
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:22.440
<v Speaker 2>and that one there helps you with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of embodiment and your knowledge </v>

1678
01:32:22.541 --> 01:32:24.820
<v Speaker 2>about where your body actually happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be localized.</v>

1679
01:32:24.821 --> 01:32:28.510
<v Speaker 2>And then that one helps for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1680
01:32:28.511 --> 01:32:33.511
<v Speaker 2>in some elements of language output.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the frontal cortex,</v>

1681
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:36.130
<v Speaker 2>especially the prefrontal part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is up here,</v>

1682
01:32:36.670 --> 01:32:41.670
<v Speaker 2>is concerned with the organization and </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement the Organization of motor </v>

1683
01:32:42.101 --> 01:32:47.101
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a good way of thinking about </v>

1684
01:32:47.101 --> 01:32:49.741
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got part of your brain that deals </v>

1685
01:32:49.741 --> 01:32:50.740
<v Speaker 2>with the sensory world and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>integration of the century world,</v>

1686
01:32:50.741 --> 01:32:55.741
<v Speaker 2>which seems to happen about there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>these places meet and the prefrontal </v>

1687
01:32:56.591 --> 01:32:59.260
<v Speaker 2>cortex grew out of the motor cortex.</v>

1688
01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Motor cortex helps you plan and plan out</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary auctions.</v>

1689
01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 2>The prefrontal cortex grew out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the course of evolution.</v>

1690
01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.090
<v Speaker 2>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1691
01:33:10.091 --> 01:33:14.890
<v Speaker 2>the there's reflex auctions and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen when something happens to you,</v>

1692
01:33:14.891 --> 01:33:19.891
<v Speaker 2>you respond and then that elaborates up </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the motor system and that enables </v>

1693
01:33:20.081 --> 01:33:25.081
<v Speaker 2>you to act voluntarily in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then not elaborates up into the </v>

1694
01:33:25.081 --> 01:33:28.441
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal motor system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which helps you plan how you might act </v>

1695
01:33:28.441 --> 01:33:28.930
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1696
01:33:28.931 --> 01:33:31.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's the prefrontal cortex that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>home of,</v>

1697
01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.770
<v Speaker 2>let's call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's complex,</v>

1698
01:33:32.771 --> 01:33:34.660
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary thought,</v>

1699
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.140
<v Speaker 2>which you could think about as a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>representing the world,</v>

1700
01:33:38.141 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 2>but which is more accurately a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>generating avatars of yourself.</v>

1701
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:48.030
<v Speaker 2>In hypothetical worlds to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would survive if you did implement </v>

1702
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:51.280
<v Speaker 2>them into action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that's why.</v>

1703
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:56.950
<v Speaker 2>So one of the weird things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>discover psychometrically is that </v>

1704
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:59.500
<v Speaker 2>there's no correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and intelligence.</v>

1705
01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:01.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1706
01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:05.980
<v Speaker 2>because people think about intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>as planning and forward thinking and all</v>

1707
01:34:05.981 --> 01:34:10.981
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's also how they think about </v>

1708
01:34:10.981 --> 01:34:10.981
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness as planful behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1709
01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:16.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the consideration of future </v>

1710
01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:19.290
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But intelligence and conscientiousness </v>

1711
01:34:19.290 --> 01:34:20.440
<v Speaker 2>have zero correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you think,</v>

1712
01:34:20.441 --> 01:34:21.850
<v Speaker 2>well why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1713
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I guess it has to be that way because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't think abstractly if you are</v>

1714
01:34:25.901 --> 01:34:29.440
<v Speaker 2>prone to act out what you thought you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>just go and act it out.</v>

1715
01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:32.590
<v Speaker 2>And that like when I mentioned this to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you before,</v>

1716
01:34:32.591 --> 01:34:37.591
<v Speaker 2>when you dream you're paralyzed and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can take that little part of the brain </v>

1717
01:34:37.591 --> 01:34:40.810
<v Speaker 2>that produces that perilous paralysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a cat or out of person.</v>

1718
01:34:40.811 --> 01:34:43.150
<v Speaker 2>But we haven't done it with people out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a cat.</v>

1719
01:34:43.630 --> 01:34:45.880
<v Speaker 2>And then when the cat falls asleep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hits Rem Sleep,</v>

1720
01:34:45.881 --> 01:34:48.460
<v Speaker 2>it'll run around until it runs into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and then it'll wake up.</v>

1721
01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the dream thinking is so tightly </v>

1722
01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:55.990
<v Speaker 2>aligned with action that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>separation between them.</v>

1723
01:34:55.991 --> 01:35:00.350
<v Speaker 2>So there's no real abstraction there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you couldn't abstract,</v>

1724
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:03.830
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that you can obstruct means</v>

1725
01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:06.110
<v Speaker 2>that you can separate your thinking from</v>
<v Speaker 2>your auction.</v>

1726
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:11.410
<v Speaker 2>So that's why as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's very little correlation between </v>

1727
01:35:11.410 --> 01:35:15.041
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it has to be that way because </v>

1728
01:35:15.041 --> 01:35:18.821
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you wouldn't do if you're </v>

1729
01:35:18.821 --> 01:35:21.341
<v Speaker 2>going to think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in generally we think of people who </v>

1730
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:26.150
<v Speaker 2>act as soon as they think as impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1731
01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:28.530
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1732
01:35:28.531 --> 01:35:33.531
<v Speaker 2>so there's a huge part of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's devoted to sensory processing and</v>

1733
01:35:34.351 --> 01:35:39.351
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge part of the brain that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>devoted to planning and the whole </v>

1734
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:39.900
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal part of the brain is devoted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to planning.</v>

1735
01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:45.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that indicates is that in large </v>

1736
01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:49.011
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as your evolved body is </v>

1737
01:35:49.011 --> 01:35:52.911
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason is that you think is so that </v>

1738
01:35:52.911 --> 01:35:56.181
<v Speaker 2>you can act better and of course that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense and you can think about </v>

1739
01:35:56.181 --> 01:35:59.970
<v Speaker 2>memory from that perspective too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you think scientifically,</v>

1740
01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:03.510
<v Speaker 2>you think that your memory of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>is something like an objective record of</v>

1741
01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.010
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of objective events,</v>

1742
01:36:05.011 --> 01:36:07.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's really not very much like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

1743
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:09.600
<v Speaker 2>And besides who cares?</v>

1744
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:16.470
<v Speaker 2>You don't need an accurate </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of all the facts about </v>

1745
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.470
<v Speaker 2>this room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1746
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:19.300
<v Speaker 2>all it would do is weigh you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who cares what color the walls are,</v>

1747
01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.910
<v Speaker 2>what kind of the ceiling is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what color the paint is.</v>

1748
01:36:21.911 --> 01:36:26.911
<v Speaker 2>All of that's not worth remembering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because it has no relationship </v>

1749
01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:31.150
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever to what you need to do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to continue to act.</v>

1750
01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:34.750
<v Speaker 2>And so what you're doing when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember as far as I can tell,</v>

1751
01:36:34.751 --> 01:36:39.751
<v Speaker 2>is that you're mining your experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>for information that you can bring </v>

1752
01:36:39.751 --> 01:36:43.081
<v Speaker 2>forward into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's purely pragmatic and so you know,</v>

1753
01:36:44.190 --> 01:36:49.190
<v Speaker 2>my team treat people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic disorder or symptoms of </v>

1754
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:53.430
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic disorder and so let's say </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got posttraumatic stress disorder </v>

1755
01:36:54.551 --> 01:36:59.551
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because their relationship collapsed on </v>

1756
01:36:59.551 --> 01:36:59.551
<v Speaker 2>them suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite common.</v>

1757
01:36:59.551 --> 01:37:01.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get betrayed or someone leaves them</v>

1758
01:37:01.301 --> 01:37:06.301
<v Speaker 2>suddenly and then they don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do because especially if they're </v>

1759
01:37:06.301 --> 01:37:10.981
<v Speaker 2>conscientious because then they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>tear themselves into pieces trying to </v>

1760
01:37:10.981 --> 01:37:14.131
<v Speaker 2>figure out what they did wrong to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that event and the reason they're </v>

1761
01:37:14.131 --> 01:37:18.811
<v Speaker 2>doing that is because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>retool their perceptions and their </v>

1762
01:37:18.811 --> 01:37:22.231
<v Speaker 2>actions so that the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have the same experience again </v>

1763
01:37:22.231 --> 01:37:24.700
<v Speaker 2>is minimized and their mind won't leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>them alone until they do it.</v>

1764
01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.290
<v Speaker 2>And no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1765
01:37:26.291 --> 01:37:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Because if you fall into a big pit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get really hurt,</v>

1766
01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:35.020
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you should figure out is</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to not fall into big pits anymore.</v>

1767
01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.050
<v Speaker 2>And your mind is set up exactly for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1768
01:37:38.051 --> 01:37:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And so what you do with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>having problems like that.</v>

1769
01:37:41.441 --> 01:37:46.441
<v Speaker 2>So maybe they're waking up at the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the night or obsessing about what </v>

1770
01:37:46.441 --> 01:37:49.381
<v Speaker 2>went wrong is you walk them through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do a situational analysis first </v>

1771
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:53.950
<v Speaker 2>because one of the oversimplifications </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people make,</v>

1772
01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 2>and this is especially for conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1773
01:37:56.311 --> 01:38:01.200
<v Speaker 2>is if something bad happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must've done something to deserve it.</v>

1774
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a pretty functional idea</v>

1775
01:38:03.991 --> 01:38:08.991
<v Speaker 2>because it suggests that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>things about your behavior that you </v>

1776
01:38:08.991 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 2>could change that would make the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1777
01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:16.130
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is is that say if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the collapse of a relationship and </v>

1778
01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 2>you've been with that person for eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>years or longer,</v>

1779
01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:24.440
<v Speaker 2>well you did so many things with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the idea that you did something </v>

1780
01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:27.030
<v Speaker 2>wrong pretty much extends to every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single thing you ever did with them.</v>

1781
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:30.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's how are you going to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1782
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.670
<v Speaker 2>And so that's part of the trauma </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1783
01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 2>that the trauma is $80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million snakes all at the same time.</v>

1784
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:38.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1785
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:44.390
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have time to go through all </v>

1786
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:47.601
<v Speaker 2>that material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so partly what you do is with </v>

1787
01:38:47.601 --> 01:38:50.661
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what you should do with </v>

1788
01:38:50.661 --> 01:38:50.661
<v Speaker 2>yourself too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you do a situational analysis.</v>

1789
01:38:50.661 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like don't be assuming necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the thing that happened to you only</v>

1790
01:38:54.001 --> 01:38:56.250
<v Speaker 2>happen to you because of what you did or</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do.</v>

1791
01:38:56.670 --> 01:39:00.960
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of factors at play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that sometimes I do</v>

1792
01:39:00.961 --> 01:39:05.961
<v Speaker 2>with clients as if they were in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and I can get some </v>

1793
01:39:05.961 --> 01:39:07.080
<v Speaker 2>reasonable personality information about</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them,</v>

1794
01:39:07.081 --> 01:39:10.770
<v Speaker 2>I can point out where they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperamentally incompatible.</v>

1795
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a highly conscientious </v>

1796
01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:16.400
<v Speaker 2>person and your partner is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very low in conscientiousness,</v>

1797
01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well good luck to you too.</v>

1798
01:39:18.570 --> 01:39:23.570
<v Speaker 2>How the hell are you ever gonna work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out because you want everything to </v>

1799
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:26.781
<v Speaker 2>be exactly where it's supposed to be and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're working all the time and your </v>

1800
01:39:26.781 --> 01:39:30.231
<v Speaker 2>partner could care less whether things </v>
<v Speaker 2>were were they supposed to be and </v>

1801
01:39:30.231 --> 01:39:33.621
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can butt heads about that </v>

1802
01:39:33.621 --> 01:39:37.431
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The probability that you're going to </v>

1803
01:39:37.431 --> 01:39:37.431
<v Speaker 2>shift it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1804
01:39:37.431 --> 01:39:38.250
<v Speaker 2>except to some minor degree is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very low.</v>

1805
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:43.890
<v Speaker 2>And so sometimes you end up with someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>with whom you get along very well on one</v>

1806
01:39:43.891 --> 01:39:48.891
<v Speaker 2>temperamental dimension and you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute catastrophe on the other four </v>

1807
01:39:48.891 --> 01:39:52.820
<v Speaker 2>and the probability that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to mediate a huge temperamental </v>

1808
01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:56.811
<v Speaker 2>differences extremely low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't expect yourself to mediate </v>

1809
01:39:56.811 --> 01:39:58.500
<v Speaker 2>a huge intellectual difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1810
01:39:58.501 --> 01:40:03.501
<v Speaker 2>You're going to make the other person is</v>
<v Speaker 2>smarter or maybe you smarter depending </v>

1811
01:40:03.501 --> 01:40:03.570
<v Speaker 2>on who you're with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like no,</v>

1812
01:40:03.571 --> 01:40:05.520
<v Speaker 2>probably not bit maybe.</v>

1813
01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:11.480
<v Speaker 2>So you do a situational analysis and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're trying to do is to extract </v>

1814
01:40:12.181 --> 01:40:17.181
<v Speaker 2>out information from your past and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>present that will enable you to conduct </v>

1815
01:40:17.181 --> 01:40:21.051
<v Speaker 2>yourself properly into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's another example of the </v>

1816
01:40:21.051 --> 01:40:22.470
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic element of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thought.</v>

1817
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Well then within the brain itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from the major subdivisions which </v>

1818
01:40:28.741 --> 01:40:30.300
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we just described,</v>

1819
01:40:30.301 --> 01:40:33.840
<v Speaker 2>there are minor subdivisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's a bunch of them listed,</v>

1820
01:40:33.841 --> 01:40:36.060
<v Speaker 2>the caudate nucleus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cerebral cortex,</v>

1821
01:40:36.061 --> 01:40:39.900
<v Speaker 2>the huge newest part of the brain that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a square meter.</v>

1822
01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:45.230
<v Speaker 2>If you unfold it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all folded up and most of the </v>

1823
01:40:45.230 --> 01:40:46.530
<v Speaker 2>processing occurs right on the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea.</v>

1824
01:40:46.531 --> 01:40:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Thalamus,</v>

1825
01:40:48.031 --> 01:40:53.031
<v Speaker 2>that's a place where a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation in the brain appears to be </v>

1826
01:40:53.031 --> 01:40:55.971
<v Speaker 2>integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the cerebellum helps you with </v>

1827
01:40:55.971 --> 01:40:56.950
<v Speaker 2>balance and the sequencing of complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>motor activities,</v>

1828
01:40:56.951 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 2>the hippocampus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one we talked about before.</v>

1829
01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:04.650
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that the hippocampus </v>
<v Speaker 2>does seems to do is compare your model </v>

1830
01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:08.311
<v Speaker 2>of the world as it's unfolding with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>model that that you desire to be </v>

1831
01:41:08.471 --> 01:41:13.030
<v Speaker 2>occurring and then keep track of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mismatches and if it detects a mismatch,</v>

1832
01:41:13.031 --> 01:41:18.031
<v Speaker 2>then it disinhibit other emotional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational centers and that's the </v>

1833
01:41:18.031 --> 01:41:19.060
<v Speaker 2>beginning of your response to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>

1834
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:20.560
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1835
01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:27.520
<v Speaker 2>one of them is the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to concentrate on it for a </v>

1836
01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:30.191
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little tiny part of the brain </v>

1837
01:41:30.191 --> 01:41:30.191
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty much it at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spinal cord.</v>

1838
01:41:30.191 --> 01:41:34.061
<v Speaker 2>C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really small compared to the rest </v>

1839
01:41:34.061 --> 01:41:35.200
<v Speaker 2>of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it turns out that if,</v>

1840
01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:39.280
<v Speaker 2>imagine this is a cat brain for a minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you take off the whole cat brain,</v>

1841
01:41:40.770 --> 01:41:42.420
<v Speaker 2>except for the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1842
01:41:42.570 --> 01:41:45.150
<v Speaker 2>which people do you take off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole cortex for example.</v>

1843
01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the cat still live.</v>

1844
01:41:49.261 --> 01:41:54.261
<v Speaker 2>If you do it carefully but it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have much of a brain and so you might </v>

1845
01:41:54.261 --> 01:41:57.501
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that cat would just do nothing but </v>

1846
01:41:57.501 --> 01:41:57.750
<v Speaker 2>cats actually pretty functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's reduced,</v>

1847
01:41:57.751 --> 01:42:02.751
<v Speaker 2>just do it's hypothalamus and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the hypothalamus is an </v>

1848
01:42:02.751 --> 01:42:06.231
<v Speaker 2>incredibly important part of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it provides what I would say </v>

1849
01:42:06.231 --> 01:42:10.370
<v Speaker 2>constitute the major frames,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the major psychological frames and so so</v>

1850
01:42:11.081 --> 01:42:16.081
<v Speaker 2>I like a decorticate cat can still eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and drink and regulate his body </v>

1851
01:42:16.711 --> 01:42:21.711
<v Speaker 2>temperature and engage in defensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression and if it's female it can </v>

1852
01:42:21.711 --> 01:42:25.791
<v Speaker 2>still meet male can't because the male </v>
<v Speaker 2>mating behavior is more complicated and </v>

1853
01:42:25.791 --> 01:42:27.720
<v Speaker 2>as long as you keep it in a bounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

1854
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:32.870
<v Speaker 2>it can function reasonably well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hyper curious though,</v>

1855
01:42:34.290 --> 01:42:37.320
<v Speaker 2>which is very weird because you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>expect a cab with no brain to be curious</v>

1856
01:42:37.321 --> 01:42:42.321
<v Speaker 2>about anything but a cat with no brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>is curious about everything and that </v>

1857
01:42:42.321 --> 01:42:46.011
<v Speaker 2>seems to be because part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you aren't curious about something </v>

1858
01:42:46.011 --> 01:42:49.851
<v Speaker 2>anymore is because you've investigated </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you've built a representation of </v>

1859
01:42:49.851 --> 01:42:53.490
<v Speaker 2>it that's functional and that functional</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation then stands for the thing</v>

1860
01:42:53.491 --> 01:42:57.570
<v Speaker 2>itself and then you can ignore it and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn to ignore things there.</v>

1861
01:42:57.580 --> 01:42:59.970
<v Speaker 2>They're interesting to begin with and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you learn to ignore them.</v>

1862
01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:03.360
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>artists do,</v>

1863
01:43:03.361 --> 01:43:08.361
<v Speaker 2>if they're great artists is remind you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's more to things that you see</v>

1864
01:43:08.490 --> 01:43:13.490
<v Speaker 2>now that you've learned to ignore them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get a kind of a hallucinogenic </v>

1865
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:17.010
<v Speaker 2>painting of flowers like Van Gogh might </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce like his famous irises,</v>

1866
01:43:17.011 --> 01:43:20.550
<v Speaker 2>which I think sold for $220,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something outrageous.</v>

1867
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:25.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like what Van Gogh is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show you is what those flowers looked </v>

1868
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:28.300
<v Speaker 2>like before you thought you could see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because now you flower and you walk</v>

1869
01:43:28.301 --> 01:43:29.070
<v Speaker 2>by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1870
01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:34.280
<v Speaker 2>you don't see it at all because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>off to get a peanut butter sandwich or </v>

1871
01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:37.851
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have time to glory and the </v>

1872
01:43:37.851 --> 01:43:39.981
<v Speaker 2>wonder of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you've got something practical </v>

1873
01:43:39.981 --> 01:43:39.981
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1874
01:43:39.981 --> 01:43:44.790
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to zoom in on the </v>

1875
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:46.191
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus here and what you see of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course when you zoom in on the </v>

1876
01:43:48.071 --> 01:43:53.071
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus is that it's not a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole bunch of things and then </v>

1877
01:43:53.071 --> 01:43:56.570
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those horrible whole bunches</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things that are made out of even more</v>

1878
01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:59.270
<v Speaker 2>bunches of things and they're made out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of more bunches of things.</v>

1879
01:43:59.271 --> 01:44:04.271
<v Speaker 2>And what's really interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>going down the body from an analytic </v>

1880
01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:08.951
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to get less complex as </v>

1881
01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:08.951
<v Speaker 2>you go farther down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1882
01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:11.840
<v Speaker 2>like some of the should actually show </v>
<v Speaker 2>you that</v>

1883
01:44:13.210 --> 01:44:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I haven't showed you that little video </v>
<v Speaker 2>of DNA fixing itself a Oh,</v>

1884
01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I better show you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so cool.</v>

1885
01:44:20.850 --> 01:44:23.110
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculously cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you definitely need to see it.</v>

1886
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:30.310
<v Speaker 4>Until I encountered the artworks of </v>
<v Speaker 4>David goodfellow and it was a molecular </v>

1887
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:33.020
<v Speaker 4>biologist at the scripts institute and </v>
<v Speaker 4>his pictures are old.</v>

1888
01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:36.590
<v Speaker 4>Everything's accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At all to scale and his work illuminated</v>

1889
01:44:36.591 --> 01:44:39.860
<v Speaker 4>for me what the molecular world inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>us is like,</v>

1890
01:44:40.130 --> 01:44:45.130
<v Speaker 4>so this is a transection through blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the top left hand corner you've got </v>

1891
01:44:45.130 --> 01:44:45.130
<v Speaker 4>this yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>green area.</v>

1892
01:44:45.130 --> 01:44:46.940
<v Speaker 4>The yellow green area is the fluids of </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood,</v>

1893
01:44:46.941 --> 01:44:48.890
<v Speaker 4>which is mostly water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also antibodies,</v>

1894
01:44:48.891 --> 01:44:50.570
<v Speaker 4>sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hormones,</v>

1895
01:44:50.571 --> 01:44:55.571
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the red region is a slice and a red </v>

1896
01:44:55.571 --> 01:44:55.571
<v Speaker 4>blood cell and those red molecules or </v>
<v Speaker 4>hemoglobin,</v>

1897
01:44:55.571 --> 01:45:00.401
<v Speaker 4>they are actually red.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what gives blood its color and </v>

1898
01:45:00.401 --> 01:45:03.490
<v Speaker 4>hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to</v>
<v Speaker 4>soak up the oxygen in your lungs and </v>

1899
01:45:03.490 --> 01:45:06.971
<v Speaker 4>then carried to other parts of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was very much inspired by this image </v>

1900
01:45:06.971 --> 01:45:10.100
<v Speaker 4>many years ago and I wondered whether we</v>
<v Speaker 4>could use computer graphics to represent</v>

1901
01:45:10.101 --> 01:45:10.760
<v Speaker 4>the molecular world.</v>

1902
01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.820
<v Speaker 4>What would it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how I really began.</v>

1903
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:19.270
<v Speaker 4>So let's begin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is DNA and it's classic double </v>

1904
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.580
<v Speaker 4>helix form and it's from x Ray </v>
<v Speaker 4>crystallography.</v>

1905
01:45:19.581 --> 01:45:24.581
<v Speaker 4>So it's an accurate model of DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we unwind the double helix and </v>

1906
01:45:24.581 --> 01:45:28.571
<v Speaker 4>unzipped the two strands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think see these things that look </v>

1907
01:45:28.571 --> 01:45:28.571
<v Speaker 4>like teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are the letters of genetic code.</v>

1908
01:45:28.571 --> 01:45:30.470
<v Speaker 4>The 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>genes you've got written in your DNA.</v>

1909
01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:33.260
<v Speaker 4>This is what they typically talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the genetic code.</v>

1910
01:45:33.261 --> 01:45:38.261
<v Speaker 4>This is what they're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I want to talk about different </v>

1911
01:45:38.261 --> 01:45:40.841
<v Speaker 4>aspect of DNA science and that is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the physical nature of Dna and it's </v>

1912
01:45:40.841 --> 01:45:44.920
<v Speaker 4>these two strands that run in opposite </v>
<v Speaker 4>directions for reasons I can't go into </v>

1913
01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:49.421
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they physically run in opposite </v>

1914
01:45:49.421 --> 01:45:51.671
<v Speaker 4>directions which creates a number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>complications for your living cells as </v>

1915
01:45:51.671 --> 01:45:53.840
<v Speaker 4>you're about to see most particularly </v>
<v Speaker 4>when DNA is being copied.</v>

1916
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:59.590
<v Speaker 4>And so what I'm about to show you is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>accurate representation of the actual </v>

1917
01:45:59.590 --> 01:46:02.240
<v Speaker 4>DNA replication machine that's occurring</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now inside your body.</v>

1918
01:46:02.241 --> 01:46:07.241
<v Speaker 4>At least 2002 a biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So DNA is entering the production line </v>

1919
01:46:07.241 --> 01:46:09.440
<v Speaker 4>from the left hand side and it hits this</v>
<v Speaker 4>collection,</v>

1920
01:46:09.441 --> 01:46:14.441
<v Speaker 4>this miniature biochemical machines that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are pulling apart the DNA strand and </v>

1921
01:46:14.441 --> 01:46:17.951
<v Speaker 4>making an exact copy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So DNA comes in and hits this blue </v>

1922
01:46:17.951 --> 01:46:20.000
<v Speaker 4>doughnut shape structure and it's ripped</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart into its two strands.</v>

1923
01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:23.660
<v Speaker 4>One strand can be copied directly and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's conceivably seen spooling off,</v>

1924
01:46:23.661 --> 01:46:26.420
<v Speaker 4>down to the bottom there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but things aren't so simple as the other</v>

1925
01:46:26.421 --> 01:46:28.670
<v Speaker 4>strand because it must be copied </v>
<v Speaker 4>backwards.</v>

1926
01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:32.600
<v Speaker 4>So it's thrown out repeatedly in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>loops and copied one section at a time,</v>

1927
01:46:33.050 --> 01:46:38.050
<v Speaker 4>creating two new DNA molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you have billions of this machine </v>

1928
01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:43.900
<v Speaker 4>right now worrying and right way inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>you copying your DNA with exquisite </v>

1929
01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.920
<v Speaker 4>fidelity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an accurate representation and it's</v>

1930
01:46:45.921 --> 01:46:48.620
<v Speaker 4>pretty much at the correct speed for </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it's occurring inside you.</v>

1931
01:46:48.710 --> 01:46:50.730
<v Speaker 4>But I've out error correction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of other things.</v>

1932
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:55.500
<v Speaker 4>This was work from a number of years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>

1933
01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:55.950
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1934
01:46:58.450 --> 01:46:59.620
<v Speaker 4>This is where from a number of years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

1935
01:46:59.621 --> 01:47:01.900
<v Speaker 4>but when I show you next is updated </v>
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>

1936
01:47:01.901 --> 01:47:03.790
<v Speaker 4>It's updated technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

1937
01:47:03.791 --> 01:47:06.070
<v Speaker 4>we begin with DNA and it's jiggly and </v>
<v Speaker 4>wiggling their.</v>

1938
01:47:06.071 --> 01:47:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Because of the surrounding soup of </v>
<v Speaker 4>molecules which are stripped away.</v>

1939
01:47:08.591 --> 01:47:12.040
<v Speaker 4>So you can see something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>DNA is about two nanometers across,</v>

1940
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:15.430
<v Speaker 4>which is really quite tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in each one of your cells,</v>

1941
01:47:15.490 --> 01:47:19.150
<v Speaker 4>each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million nanometers long,</v>

1942
01:47:19.690 --> 01:47:23.470
<v Speaker 4>so to keep the DNA organized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regulate access to the genetic code.</v>

1943
01:47:23.650 --> 01:47:26.560
<v Speaker 4>It's wrapped around these purple </v>
<v Speaker 4>proteins I've labeled in purple here.</v>

1944
01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:29.770
<v Speaker 4>It's packaged up in bundles up all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this field of view.</v>

1945
01:47:29.771 --> 01:47:34.771
<v Speaker 4>It's a single strand of DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This huge package of DNA is called a </v>

1946
01:47:34.771 --> 01:47:36.700
<v Speaker 4>chromosome and we'll come back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>chromosomes in a minute.</v>

1947
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:42.870
<v Speaker 4>We're pulling out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were zooming out out through a nuclear </v>

1948
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:46.351
<v Speaker 4>pore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is sort of the gateway to this </v>

1949
01:47:46.351 --> 01:47:46.351
<v Speaker 4>compartment that holds all the Dean I </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the nucleus.</v>

1950
01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:51.820
<v Speaker 4>All of this field of view is about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>semester's worth of biology and I've got</v>

1951
01:47:51.821 --> 01:47:56.821
<v Speaker 4>seven minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're not gonna be able to that </v>

1952
01:47:56.821 --> 01:47:56.821
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1953
01:47:56.821 --> 01:47:56.821
<v Speaker 4>I'm being told,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1954
01:47:57.850 --> 01:48:02.850
<v Speaker 4>this is the way a living cell looks down</v>
<v Speaker 4>a light microscope and it's been filmed </v>

1955
01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:02.980
<v Speaker 4>under time latches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1956
01:48:02.981 --> 01:48:07.981
<v Speaker 4>You can see it moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The nuclear envelope breaks down these </v>

1957
01:48:07.981 --> 01:48:08.560
<v Speaker 4>sausage shape things are the chromosomes</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll focus on them.</v>

1958
01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:13.980
<v Speaker 4>They go through this very striking </v>
<v Speaker 4>motion that is focused on these little </v>

1959
01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:16.480
<v Speaker 4>red spots within the field cell fields.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ready to go.</v>

1960
01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:20.710
<v Speaker 4>It rips apart the chromosome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One set of DNA goes to one side,</v>

1961
01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.600
<v Speaker 4>the other side gets the other set of </v>
<v Speaker 4>DNA,</v>

1962
01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:26.290
<v Speaker 4>identical copies of DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the cell splits down the middle</v>

1963
01:48:26.410 --> 01:48:31.410
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have billions of cells undergoing </v>

1964
01:48:31.410 --> 01:48:33.250
<v Speaker 4>this process right now inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we're going to rewind and just focus</v>

1965
01:48:33.251 --> 01:48:36.520
<v Speaker 4>on the chromosomes and look at its </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure and describe it.</v>

1966
01:48:37.330 --> 01:48:39.280
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we are at that equator moment,</v>

1967
01:48:40.810 --> 01:48:43.780
<v Speaker 4>the chromosomes line up and if we </v>
<v Speaker 4>isolate just one chromosome,</v>

1968
01:48:43.781 --> 01:48:45.730
<v Speaker 4>we're going to pull it out and have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at its structure.</v>

1969
01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:50.880
<v Speaker 4>So this is one of the biggest molecular </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures that you have in Lisa as far </v>

1970
01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:55.381
<v Speaker 4>as we've discovered so far inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is a single chromosome and you </v>

1971
01:48:56.111 --> 01:48:58.060
<v Speaker 4>have two strands of DNA in each </v>
<v Speaker 4>chromosome.</v>

1972
01:48:58.090 --> 01:49:03.090
<v Speaker 4>One is bundled up into one sausage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other strand is bundled up to the </v>

1973
01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:06.751
<v Speaker 4>other sausage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These things that looked like whiskers </v>

1974
01:49:06.751 --> 01:49:06.790
<v Speaker 4>that are sticking out from either side </v>
<v Speaker 4>are the dynamic scaffolding,</v>

1975
01:49:06.791 --> 01:49:11.791
<v Speaker 4>the cell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're called microtubules but means </v>

1976
01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:11.791
<v Speaker 4>not so important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're going to focus on it.</v>

1977
01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:15.751
<v Speaker 4>This red region,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've labeled it right here and it's the </v>

1978
01:49:15.751 --> 01:49:17.080
<v Speaker 4>interface between the dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 4>scaffolding and the chromosomes.</v>

1979
01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:20.710
<v Speaker 4>It is obviously central to the movement </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the chromosomes.</v>

1980
01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:24.160
<v Speaker 4>We have no idea really as to how it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>achieving that movement.</v>

1981
01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:29.250
<v Speaker 4>We've been studying this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They called the Kinetic Corp for over </v>

1982
01:49:29.250 --> 01:49:31.621
<v Speaker 4>100 years of intense study and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>still just beginning to discover what </v>

1983
01:49:31.621 --> 01:49:35.341
<v Speaker 4>it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is made up of about 200 different </v>

1984
01:49:35.341 --> 01:49:36.100
<v Speaker 4>types of proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of proteins in total.</v>

1985
01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:42.180
<v Speaker 4>It is a signal broadcasting system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It broadcasts through chemical signals </v>

1986
01:49:42.190 --> 01:49:44.770
<v Speaker 4>telling the rest of the cell when it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ready,</v>

1987
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:48.830
<v Speaker 4>when it feels that everything is aligned</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to go for the separation,</v>

1988
01:49:48.850 --> 01:49:53.850
<v Speaker 4>the chromosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is able to couple onto the growing </v>

1989
01:49:53.850 --> 01:49:53.980
<v Speaker 4>and shrinking microtubules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's transiently,</v>

1990
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:59.030
<v Speaker 4>it's involved with the growing of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>microtubules and it's able to translate </v>

1991
01:49:59.030 --> 01:50:01.390
<v Speaker 4>couple onto them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also attention sensing systems able</v>

1992
01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:06.391
<v Speaker 4>to feel when the cell is ready,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the chromosome is correctly </v>

1993
01:50:06.391 --> 01:50:07.360
<v Speaker 4>positioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's turning green here because it feels</v>

1994
01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:12.361
<v Speaker 4>that everything is just right and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>see there's this one little last bit </v>

1995
01:50:12.361 --> 01:50:15.670
<v Speaker 4>that's still remaining red and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>walked away down the microtubules.</v>

1996
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:22.310
<v Speaker 4>That is the signal broadcasting system </v>
<v Speaker 4>and sending out that stop signal and </v>

1997
01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.620
<v Speaker 4>it's walked away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's that mechanical.</v>

1998
01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:28.220
<v Speaker 4>It's molecular clockwork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how you work at the molecular </v>

1999
01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:31.851
<v Speaker 4>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so with a little bit of Molecular </v>

2000
01:50:31.851 --> 01:50:32.460
<v Speaker 4>Icandy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got kinases,</v>

2001
01:50:32.461 --> 01:50:37.461
<v Speaker 4>which are the orange ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're a little molecular Korea </v>

2002
01:50:37.461 --> 01:50:37.461
<v Speaker 4>molecules working one way and here are </v>
<v Speaker 4>the dining.</v>

2003
01:50:37.461 --> 01:50:42.231
<v Speaker 4>They're carrying that bray broadcasting </v>
<v Speaker 4>system and they've got their long legs </v>

2004
01:50:42.231 --> 01:50:42.231
<v Speaker 4>so they can step around obstacles and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

2005
01:50:42.231 --> 01:50:46.940
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all derived accurately from the </v>

2006
01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:50.601
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is we can't show it to you </v>

2007
01:50:50.601 --> 01:50:52.521
<v Speaker 4>any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exploring at the frontier of science at </v>

2008
01:50:52.521 --> 01:50:54.360
<v Speaker 4>the frontier of human understanding is </v>
<v Speaker 4>mindblowing.</v>

2009
01:50:56.170 --> 01:51:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Discovering this stuff is certainly a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pleasurable incentive to work in </v>

2010
01:51:01.170 --> 01:51:03.310
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most medical researchers,</v>

2011
01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:09.090
<v Speaker 4>this is just discovering this stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 4>simply steps along the path to the big </v>

2012
01:51:09.090 --> 01:51:12.780
<v Speaker 4>goals which are to eradicate disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to eliminate the suffering and the and </v>

2013
01:51:13.001 --> 01:51:16.150
<v Speaker 4>the misery that disease causes and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lift people out of poverty.</v>

2014
01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:16.930
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2015
01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:22.500
<v Speaker 2>So like that's just so ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindblowing.</v>

2016
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:28.510
<v Speaker 2>It's almost unbearable to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as clockwork even as pretty strange</v>

2017
01:51:28.921 --> 01:51:33.060
<v Speaker 2>idea because all those little things </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk over obstacles.</v>

2018
01:51:33.061 --> 01:51:35.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like how the hell does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just molecules.</v>

2019
01:51:36.090 --> 01:51:39.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's so cool because when you go down</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd think simple,</v>

2020
01:51:39.151 --> 01:51:41.910
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2021
01:51:41.911 --> 01:51:44.790
<v Speaker 2>he said at the beginning when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the little machines,</v>

2022
01:51:44.791 --> 01:51:48.090
<v Speaker 2>we're taking that DNA apart that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't show the error correcting.</v>

2023
01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:53.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these other little machines </v>

2024
01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:53.120
<v Speaker 2>that go along and see if everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay and if it isn't,</v>

2025
01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:53.460
<v Speaker 2>they cut it out and put it right pcn.</v>

2026
01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:54.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2027
01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:58.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things we don't understand.</v>

2028
01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:59.930
<v Speaker 2>There's no shortage of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

2029
01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what I'm doing in some senses walking</v>

2030
01:52:04.581 --> 01:52:09.581
<v Speaker 2>you through a psychophysiological or </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of Piaget's developmental</v>

2031
01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.840
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

2032
01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I wanted to zero in on a hypothalamus</v>

2033
01:52:15.861 --> 01:52:20.861
<v Speaker 2>because it seems to me the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sets the most basic frames and so we'll </v>

2034
01:52:20.861 --> 01:52:22.250
<v Speaker 2>go head with that.</v>

2035
01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:30.600
<v Speaker 2>So you see that it's made up of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these little parts and so it's called </v>

2036
01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:34.120
<v Speaker 2>the hypothalamus more for convenience </v>
<v Speaker 2>than.</v>

2037
01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a homogenous set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures because it's not a homogenous</v>

2038
01:52:37.181 --> 01:52:42.181
<v Speaker 2>set of structures and this is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>to consider very carefully when you're </v>

2039
01:52:42.181 --> 01:52:45.540
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the terminology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists use or that you might use </v>

2040
01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:47.330
<v Speaker 2>to describe your own behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know you can roughly.</v>

2041
01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:52.560
<v Speaker 2>There is a psychology of motivation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the psychology of the emotion </v>

2042
01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:52.610
<v Speaker 2>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2043
01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:55.610
<v Speaker 2>emotion and motivation are categorically</v>
<v Speaker 2>different entities,</v>

2044
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:58.400
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2045
01:52:58.401 --> 01:53:02.030
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as a uniform set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of motivations and there's no such thing</v>

2046
01:53:02.031 --> 01:53:06.290
<v Speaker 2>as a uniform set of emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the distinction between a motivation</v>

2047
01:53:06.291 --> 01:53:08.990
<v Speaker 2>out an emotion is unclear to say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>

2048
01:53:08.991 --> 01:53:13.991
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physiological substructures that subsume</v>

2049
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:19.330
<v Speaker 2>what we call motivations and what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>call emotions and it's not like there's </v>

2050
01:53:19.330 --> 01:53:19.800
<v Speaker 2>a motivation center that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2051
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:22.340
<v Speaker 2>that's a margin is the closest is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus,</v>

2052
01:53:22.341 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's made of structures that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualitatively different.</v>

2053
01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:30.700
<v Speaker 2>And then the emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have to use that descriptive </v>

2054
01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:32.090
<v Speaker 2>terminology because we have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate about it somehow.</v>

2055
01:53:32.630 --> 01:53:37.630
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures in the brain that contribute </v>

2056
01:53:37.630 --> 01:53:38.600
<v Speaker 2>to emotional expression and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the same place,</v>

2057
01:53:38.601 --> 01:53:43.601
<v Speaker 2>much less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much less composed of identical </v>

2058
01:53:43.601 --> 01:53:45.140
<v Speaker 2>structure or function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2059
01:53:45.141 --> 01:53:47.870
<v Speaker 2>we have these shorthands that we use to </v>
<v Speaker 2>divide up the world,</v>

2060
01:53:47.871 --> 01:53:52.871
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're awkward and untenable as the </v>

2061
01:53:52.871 --> 01:53:54.380
<v Speaker 2>level of resolution increases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

2062
01:53:54.381 --> 01:53:59.381
<v Speaker 2>I'm still going to go with motivation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and emotion because it's a useful </v>

2063
01:53:59.381 --> 01:54:02.891
<v Speaker 2>simplification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can see with the hypothalamus </v>

2064
01:54:02.891 --> 01:54:03.630
<v Speaker 2>that there's all these complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>little subsystems in there.</v>

2065
01:54:03.631 --> 01:54:07.400
<v Speaker 2>And then I showed you that video to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just how complicated this subsystems</v>

2066
01:54:07.401 --> 01:54:11.000
<v Speaker 2>are all the way down to the relate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the molecular level.</v>

2067
01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:15.110
<v Speaker 2>How those little machines manage what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do is completely beyond me.</v>

2068
01:54:15.110 --> 01:54:20.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to call it clockwork when those little </v>

2069
01:54:20.110 --> 01:54:20.110
<v Speaker 2>things that walk and walk over </v>
<v Speaker 2>obstacles,</v>

2070
01:54:20.110 --> 01:54:22.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like clockwork does one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2071
01:54:22.670 --> 01:54:24.100
<v Speaker 2>only click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

2072
01:54:24.130 --> 01:54:24.650
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click.</v>

2073
01:54:24.651 --> 01:54:26.990
<v Speaker 2>That's all it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No exceptions.</v>

2074
01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:29.840
<v Speaker 2>This thing walks over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obstacles to get where it's going.</v>

2075
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:32.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like who knows what's going on down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2076
01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.170
<v Speaker 2>but it works well enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here we are,</v>

2077
01:54:36.230 --> 01:54:41.230
<v Speaker 2>weirdly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So motivation seems to me to be the </v>

2078
01:54:41.230 --> 01:54:45.821
<v Speaker 2>initial framing process and you come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come into the world with the </v>

2079
01:54:45.821 --> 01:54:47.630
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems roughly ready to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

2080
01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:49.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>babies are hungry,</v>

2081
01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:52.130
<v Speaker 2>babies get cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>babies want something to drink,</v>

2082
01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:53.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

2083
01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:58.660
<v Speaker 2>So the world already comes in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come into the world with </v>

2084
01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:03.190
<v Speaker 2>prepackaged categories for existence and</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the categories that are going </v>

2085
01:55:03.190 --> 01:55:04.550
<v Speaker 2>to aid their survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2086
01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:06.680
<v Speaker 2>they're not simple either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so simple.</v>

2087
01:55:06.681 --> 01:55:08.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirst,</v>

2088
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:10.220
<v Speaker 2>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>

2089
01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:12.050
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2090
01:55:12.051 --> 01:55:14.330
<v Speaker 2>the classic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the classic emotion,</v>

2091
01:55:14.331 --> 01:55:16.640
<v Speaker 2>sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joy and so forth.</v>

2092
01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Those systems are already there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but babies or have more complicated </v>

2093
01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:24.881
<v Speaker 2>systems too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the system for exploration has </v>

2094
01:55:24.881 --> 01:55:25.700
<v Speaker 2>already in place in the system for play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really complicated.</v>

2095
01:55:25.701 --> 01:55:29.140
<v Speaker 2>It's already in place and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come into the world with a,</v>

2096
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:34.430
<v Speaker 2>with a human nature and the nature seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be distributed across these </v>

2097
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:35.010
<v Speaker 2>subsystems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2098
01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:40.040
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also useful to think about the </v>

2099
01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:43.691
<v Speaker 2>operation of those subsystems as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like you could think about </v>

2100
01:55:43.691 --> 01:55:46.170
<v Speaker 2>them as games with a with an aim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think about them as stories.</v>

2101
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.810
<v Speaker 2>You can think about them as frames of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference.</v>

2102
01:55:48.811 --> 01:55:50.700
<v Speaker 2>You can think about them as action </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns,</v>

2103
01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:56.570
<v Speaker 2>all of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can think about them as </v>

2104
01:55:56.570 --> 01:55:56.570
<v Speaker 2>subpersonalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I actually think is maybe the best</v>

2105
01:55:56.570 --> 01:55:58.890
<v Speaker 2>way to think about them because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hungry,</v>

2106
01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:04.340
<v Speaker 2>it's not a deterministic drive fits the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sub personality that has a goal and then</v>

2107
01:56:04.921 --> 01:56:09.921
<v Speaker 2>it has a bunch of action patterns that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to work in reference to that </v>

2108
01:56:09.921 --> 01:56:09.921
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>

2109
01:56:09.921 --> 01:56:13.670
<v Speaker 2>It has a bunch of perceptions that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>suit that goal and it organizes your </v>

2110
01:56:13.670 --> 01:56:18.381
<v Speaker 2>emotional responses around that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to think about it as a </v>

2111
01:56:18.381 --> 01:56:20.490
<v Speaker 2>personality is a much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a much more intelligent way to look</v>

2112
01:56:20.491 --> 01:56:22.980
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the thing about skinner's rats,</v>

2113
01:56:22.981 --> 01:56:27.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skinner could get rats to do almost </v>

2114
01:56:27.981 --> 01:56:29.010
<v Speaker 2>everything and he would reward them with</v>
<v Speaker 2>food and so he had a simple rat model,</v>

2115
01:56:29.011 --> 01:56:32.520
<v Speaker 2>but his rats were starved down to 75 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of their normal body weight.</v>

2116
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:35.910
<v Speaker 2>So not only were they know it's social </v>
<v Speaker 2>gregarious,</v>

2117
01:56:35.911 --> 01:56:38.010
<v Speaker 2>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rats are because they were isolated,</v>

2118
01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.910
<v Speaker 2>they were genetically altered from wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>rats,</v>

2119
01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:47.270
<v Speaker 2>but they also weren't as complex as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real route because they were starving </v>

2120
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.270
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2121
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:52.161
<v Speaker 2>a starving rat is a pretty good model of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rat and a rat is a pretty good model </v>

2122
01:56:52.161 --> 01:56:52.161
<v Speaker 2>of a person.</v>

2123
01:56:52.161 --> 01:56:55.830
<v Speaker 2>But are a lot of our models have simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior learning were based on starving</v>

2124
01:56:55.831 --> 01:56:58.860
<v Speaker 2>isolated rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

2125
01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:05.780
<v Speaker 2>how to think about motivation will think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it from the hypothalamic </v>

2126
01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:08.811
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could say one thing that </v>

2127
01:57:08.811 --> 01:57:10.611
<v Speaker 2>motivation does is set goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could say that emotions track </v>

2128
01:57:10.611 --> 01:57:12.630
<v Speaker 2>progress towards goals and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use that scheme.</v>

2129
01:57:12.631 --> 01:57:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I even though it's not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>

2130
01:57:14.791 --> 01:57:16.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation determines where you're going</v>

2131
01:57:16.951 --> 01:57:18.180
<v Speaker 2>to aim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're hungry,</v>

2132
01:57:18.181 --> 01:57:23.181
<v Speaker 2>you're going to aim at something to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that will organize your </v>

2133
01:57:23.181 --> 01:57:26.901
<v Speaker 2>perceptions so that you zero out </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that isn't relevant to that </v>

2134
01:57:26.901 --> 01:57:30.321
<v Speaker 2>task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is almost everything you </v>

2135
01:57:30.321 --> 01:57:32.751
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on those few things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to facilitate your movement </v>

2136
01:57:32.751 --> 01:57:35.811
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you encounter those things that </v>

2137
01:57:35.811 --> 01:57:38.001
<v Speaker 2>produces positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you move through the world towards </v>

2138
01:57:38.001 --> 01:57:41.391
<v Speaker 2>your goal and you see that things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>laying themselves out that facilitate </v>

2139
01:57:41.391 --> 01:57:43.920
<v Speaker 2>your movement forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things caused positive emotion and</v>

2140
01:57:43.921 --> 01:57:45.870
<v Speaker 2>if you encounter anything that gets in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

2141
01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:50.220
<v Speaker 2>then that produces negative emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be like threat because you're not</v>

2142
01:57:50.221 --> 01:57:52.080
<v Speaker 2>supposed to encounter something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets in the way.</v>

2143
01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:54.060
<v Speaker 2>It can be anger so that you move it </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

2144
01:57:54.061 --> 01:57:56.220
<v Speaker 2>It can be frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>

2145
01:57:56.221 --> 01:57:57.510
<v Speaker 2>grief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those would,</v>

2146
01:57:57.870 --> 01:58:00.630
<v Speaker 2>if you had a response that serious to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>obstacle,</v>

2147
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:04.470
<v Speaker 2>it would probably punish the little </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated frame right out of existence.</v>

2148
01:58:04.730 --> 01:58:09.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you walked downstairs and I don't </v>

2149
01:58:09.730 --> 01:58:12.101
<v Speaker 2>know the contracting company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of wrecking ball through your </v>

2150
01:58:12.101 --> 01:58:15.441
<v Speaker 2>kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's going to be </v>

2151
01:58:15.441 --> 01:58:17.331
<v Speaker 2>disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to keep eating the </v>

2152
01:58:17.331 --> 01:58:19.461
<v Speaker 2>peanut butter sandwich and the rubble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little frame is going to get </v>

2153
01:58:19.461 --> 01:58:22.461
<v Speaker 2>punished out of existence and some new </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal is going to pop up and it's dead </v>

2154
01:58:22.461 --> 01:58:26.900
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we're going to try to </v>

2155
01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:27.960
<v Speaker 2>sort out is how do you decide when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've encountered an obstacle that's so</v>

2156
01:58:27.961 --> 01:58:32.961
<v Speaker 2>big that you should just quit and go do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else because that's not </v>

2157
01:58:32.961 --> 01:58:32.961
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2158
01:58:32.961 --> 01:58:37.830
<v Speaker 2>and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get into counter productive </v>

2159
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:41.091
<v Speaker 2>persistence pretty easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't know how people solve that </v>

2160
01:58:41.091 --> 01:58:41.091
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really complicated one.</v>

2161
01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're</v>

2162
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:46.980
<v Speaker 3>going to work on that scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your hypothalamus pops up micro goals </v>

2163
01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:51.841
<v Speaker 3>that are directly relevant to biological</v>
<v Speaker 3>survival that produces a frame of </v>

2164
01:58:51.841 --> 01:58:53.470
<v Speaker 3>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a goal,</v>

2165
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:56.650
<v Speaker 3>it's not a drive and it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>collection of behaviors.</v>

2166
01:58:56.710 --> 01:59:00.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a little personality and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality has a viewpoint.</v>

2167
01:59:00.161 --> 01:59:03.940
<v Speaker 3>It has thoughts that go along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has perceptions,</v>

2168
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.100
<v Speaker 3>it has action tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

2169
01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:09.490
<v Speaker 3>You can see this in addiction most </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly.</v>

2170
01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:15.420
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that you find often</v>
<v Speaker 3>with people who are alcoholic is they </v>

2171
01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:17.560
<v Speaker 3>lie all the time and that's because when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

2172
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:22.750
<v Speaker 3>They built a little alcohol dependent </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality inside of themselves or a </v>

2173
01:59:22.750 --> 01:59:26.911
<v Speaker 3>big one might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's 90 percent of their </v>

2174
01:59:26.911 --> 01:59:29.221
<v Speaker 3>personality and one of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that consists of is </v>

2175
01:59:29.471 --> 01:59:34.471
<v Speaker 3>all the rationalizations that they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>used over the years to justify their </v>

2176
01:59:34.471 --> 01:59:35.470
<v Speaker 3>addiction to themselves and to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2177
01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:39.520
<v Speaker 3>And so the addiction has a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2178
01:59:39.521 --> 01:59:44.521
<v Speaker 3>and so when the person is off or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're addicted to meth or something </v>

2179
01:59:44.521 --> 01:59:44.860
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we know the addiction is more.</v>

2180
01:59:45.860 --> 01:59:49.330
<v Speaker 3>It's more short term powerful than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>

2181
01:59:49.331 --> 01:59:52.760
<v Speaker 3>than an alcohol addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll say anything and the.</v>

2182
01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:57.850
<v Speaker 3>The words are just tools used to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the goal and if they happen to </v>

2183
01:59:57.850 --> 01:59:58.510
<v Speaker 3>be deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2184
01:59:58.511 --> 02:00:03.511
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just practical tools to get </v>

2185
02:00:03.511 --> 02:00:05.791
<v Speaker 3>towards the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you get towards the goal </v>

2186
02:00:05.791 --> 02:00:05.791
<v Speaker 3>and you take a nice shot of meth or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

2187
02:00:06.130 --> 02:00:09.460
<v Speaker 3>you reinforce all those rationales that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you use to get the drug.</v>

2188
02:00:09.461 --> 02:00:12.550
<v Speaker 3>And then the next time you're even a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better deceiver and liar.</v>

2189
02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:18.360
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to say motivations one </v>

2190
02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:20.911
<v Speaker 3>way of thinking about as they set goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the right way of thinking </v>

2191
02:00:20.911 --> 02:00:20.911
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2192
02:00:20.911 --> 02:00:21.820
<v Speaker 3>They produce a whole framework of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation.</v>

2193
02:00:22.090 --> 02:00:24.610
<v Speaker 3>And so we're going to think about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>framework of interpretation.</v>

2194
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:28.650
<v Speaker 3>And then emotions emerge inside of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's it.</v>

2195
02:00:28.690 --> 02:00:30.640
<v Speaker 3>So the world is framed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motivations,</v>

2196
02:00:30.641 --> 02:00:35.641
<v Speaker 3>set goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say the world has to be </v>

2197
02:00:35.641 --> 02:00:35.641
<v Speaker 3>framed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So motivation sets that frame,</v>

2198
02:00:35.641 --> 02:00:36.550
<v Speaker 3>cruise goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions,</v>

2199
02:00:36.551 --> 02:00:39.430
<v Speaker 3>perceptions and actions and inactions </v>
<v Speaker 3>track progress.</v>

2200
02:00:39.431 --> 02:00:44.170
<v Speaker 3>So positive emotion says you're moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward properly towards your goal.</v>

2201
02:00:44.830 --> 02:00:46.720
<v Speaker 3>And if you encounter something you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>expect,</v>

2202
02:00:46.721 --> 02:00:48.460
<v Speaker 3>you stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's anxiety.</v>

2203
02:00:48.490 --> 02:00:49.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2204
02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:52.120
<v Speaker 3>we're not where we thought we were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we don't know what to do,</v>

2205
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:54.610
<v Speaker 3>so we should stop because we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we are,</v>

2206
02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:56.410
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop frozen.</v>

2207
02:00:57.190 --> 02:01:02.190
<v Speaker 3>And then the more powerful negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions like pain they might make you </v>

2208
02:01:02.190 --> 02:01:05.140
<v Speaker 3>get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So emotions forward,</v>

2209
02:01:05.141 --> 02:01:06.550
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reverse.</v>

2210
02:01:06.730 --> 02:01:09.340
<v Speaker 3>That's your emotions within that </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivated frame.</v>

2211
02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:15.020
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's another example of how your </v>

2212
02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.170
<v Speaker 3>mind is embedded in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your emotions are in like their,</v>

2213
02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.680
<v Speaker 3>their offshoots of action tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2214
02:01:18.681 --> 02:01:23.681
<v Speaker 3>that's the right way to think about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because action is everything </v>

2215
02:01:23.681 --> 02:01:26.110
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are some basic motivations?</v>

2216
02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of these are regulated by the </v>

2217
02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2218
02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:31.660
<v Speaker 3>that that tells you just how important </v>
<v Speaker 3>the control system it is.</v>

2219
02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:36.900
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that's useful to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the hypothalamus is that it has </v>

2220
02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:39.631
<v Speaker 3>projections going up from it that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like tree trunks and inhibitory </v>

2221
02:01:39.631 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>projections</v>

2222
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.290
<v Speaker 2>coming down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like grape vines.</v>

2223
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:47.860
<v Speaker 2>So you can kind of control your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus as long as it's not on too </v>

2224
02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:47.860
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's on,</v>

2225
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:50.310
<v Speaker 2>in any serious way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it,</v>

2226
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:55.510
<v Speaker 2>it winds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So partly what you do to stop yourself </v>

2227
02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:57.950
<v Speaker 2>from falling under the dominion of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus is to never,</v>

2228
02:01:57.951 --> 02:02:00.770
<v Speaker 2>ever be anywhere where it's action is </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary,</v>

2229
02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:06.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go into a biker bar </v>

2230
02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>because you might find yourself in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where panicked.</v>

2231
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Defensive aggression is immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

2232
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:13.040
<v Speaker 2>You probably don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to panic,</v>

2233
02:02:13.041 --> 02:02:16.070
<v Speaker 2>you don't want the terror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want the frenzied fight,</v>

2234
02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:21.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't want any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to have to run away in </v>

2235
02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:21.100
<v Speaker 2>absolute panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you just don't go there,</v>

2236
02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:26.380
<v Speaker 2>and then a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge part of how we regulate our </v>

2237
02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:29.981
<v Speaker 2>emotions is just by never going anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we have to experience them and so </v>

2238
02:02:29.981 --> 02:02:34.691
<v Speaker 2>that has very little to do with internal</v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibitory control and everything to do </v>

2239
02:02:34.691 --> 02:02:35.630
<v Speaker 2>with staying where you belong.</v>

2240
02:02:36.170 --> 02:02:40.580
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so basic motivations,</v>

2241
02:02:40.581 --> 02:02:41.300
<v Speaker 2>hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirst,</v>

2242
02:02:41.301 --> 02:02:46.301
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain is not regulated by the </v>

2243
02:02:46.301 --> 02:02:46.301
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different circuit.</v>

2244
02:02:46.301 --> 02:02:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Anger slash aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thermoregulation,</v>

2245
02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:51.350
<v Speaker 2>panic and escape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affiliation and care,</v>

2246
02:02:51.410 --> 02:02:53.630
<v Speaker 2>sexual desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration play,</v>

2247
02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:58.080
<v Speaker 2>and you can kind of break those in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of break those into a,</v>

2248
02:02:59.230 --> 02:03:01.730
<v Speaker 2>the classic Darwinian categories to and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2249
02:03:01.731 --> 02:03:06.731
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a set of motivations that go </v>

2250
02:03:06.731 --> 02:03:06.731
<v Speaker 2>along with self maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be your survival,</v>

2251
02:03:06.731 --> 02:03:08.360
<v Speaker 2>ingestive and defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2252
02:03:08.370 --> 02:03:13.370
<v Speaker 2>I've sort of coded them there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the self maintenance,</v>

2253
02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:20.820
<v Speaker 2>there's an adjustive set of basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations that go with self </v>

2254
02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:20.820
<v Speaker 2>maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say that's hunger,</v>

2255
02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:23.050
<v Speaker 2>thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a set of defensive motivations,</v>

2256
02:03:23.110 --> 02:03:23.920
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>

2257
02:03:23.921 --> 02:03:27.250
<v Speaker 2>thermoregulation paddock and escape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's,</v>

2258
02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:30.010
<v Speaker 2>there's motivations that are associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with reproduction,</v>

2259
02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:35.280
<v Speaker 2>affiliation care and sexual desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I put exploration in place sort</v>

2260
02:03:35.471 --> 02:03:37.150
<v Speaker 2>of outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2261
02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I would say because those two things </v>
<v Speaker 2>serve both of these approximately </v>

2262
02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:47.371
<v Speaker 2>equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I tried to do is take the basic </v>

2263
02:03:47.371 --> 02:03:50.751
<v Speaker 2>motivations and then nest them inside up</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental Darwinian framework so that </v>

2264
02:03:50.751 --> 02:03:54.651
<v Speaker 2>you could see how the biological process</v>
<v Speaker 2>of evolution has manifested itself and </v>

2265
02:03:54.651 --> 02:03:59.601
<v Speaker 2>then sort of differentiated into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals fundamental biological </v>

2266
02:03:59.601 --> 02:04:00.120
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2267
02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a rat brain flat map.</v>

2268
02:04:05.230 --> 02:04:10.230
<v Speaker 2>And so it's basically what you would see</v>
<v Speaker 2>other routes brain if you flattened it </v>

2269
02:04:10.230 --> 02:04:10.230
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unrolled it,</v>

2270
02:04:10.230 --> 02:04:15.101
<v Speaker 2>flattened it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then made it to dimension when you </v>

2271
02:04:15.101 --> 02:04:17.471
<v Speaker 2>can see here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the hypothalamus and you can </v>

2272
02:04:19.571 --> 02:04:21.400
<v Speaker 2>see that it's made out of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different nuclei.</v>

2273
02:04:21.401 --> 02:04:26.401
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they started correspond to those </v>

2274
02:04:26.401 --> 02:04:26.401
<v Speaker 2>shapes that I showed you in the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus earlier.</v>

2275
02:04:26.401 --> 02:04:28.150
<v Speaker 2>And you see that there's different </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

2276
02:04:28.151 --> 02:04:33.151
<v Speaker 2>There's the system for eating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking is outlined in green and the </v>

2277
02:04:33.151 --> 02:04:35.800
<v Speaker 2>reproductive system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two of them and they're outlined</v>

2278
02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:37.860
<v Speaker 2>in in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's red.</v>

2279
02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2280
02:04:41.701 --> 02:04:46.701
<v Speaker 2>Reproductive is red in the defensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones are in Magenta and so those are </v>

2281
02:04:46.701 --> 02:04:50.871
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think about those as the three </v>

2282
02:04:50.871 --> 02:04:52.731
<v Speaker 2>fundamental value systems of living </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures with complex nervous systems </v>

2283
02:04:53.071 --> 02:04:56.730
<v Speaker 2>as far as the hypothalamus is concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then given what I told you about the</v>

2284
02:04:56.731 --> 02:04:57.840
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus switches,</v>

2285
02:05:00.090 --> 02:05:02.040
<v Speaker 2>you hardly need the rest of your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

2286
02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:07.700
<v Speaker 2>As long as you have the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth thinking that those are very </v>

2287
02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:11.520
<v Speaker 2>fundamental to value per se.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might think if you only need the</v>

2288
02:05:11.521 --> 02:05:13.920
<v Speaker 2>damn hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why bother with the rest of the brain at</v>

2289
02:05:13.921 --> 02:05:15.540
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>

2290
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:20.790
<v Speaker 2>That's a very useful question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because most creatures don't </v>

2291
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:22.740
<v Speaker 2>have much of a brain so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to be something like,</v>

2292
02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:28.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've gotten your eating and drinking </v>

2293
02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:30.291
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your reproductive system and your </v>

2294
02:05:30.291 --> 02:05:30.291
<v Speaker 2>defensive system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is,</v>

2295
02:05:30.291 --> 02:05:31.320
<v Speaker 2>is that those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2296
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:33.360
<v Speaker 2>can conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2297
02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:35.520
<v Speaker 2>are you too hungry to sleep or to sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eat,</v>

2298
02:05:35.521 --> 02:05:40.521
<v Speaker 2>eat is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty simple kind of </v>

2299
02:05:40.521 --> 02:05:40.521
<v Speaker 2>contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2300
02:05:40.521 --> 02:05:44.420
<v Speaker 2>are you more angry at your partner or do</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want sexual relations more so </v>

2301
02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:46.320
<v Speaker 2>there's an so they can conflict in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>

2302
02:05:47.190 --> 02:05:51.030
<v Speaker 2>but then they can conflict with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people doing the same thing and they can</v>

2303
02:05:51.031 --> 02:05:56.031
<v Speaker 2>conflict across time and so partly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that you need the rest of your </v>

2304
02:05:56.031 --> 02:05:59.991
<v Speaker 2>brain is to solve the problems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge from the solutions that the </v>

2305
02:05:59.991 --> 02:06:03.711
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus offers and so because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to just eat and drink and </v>

2306
02:06:03.711 --> 02:06:06.270
<v Speaker 2>reproduce and and and defend yourself.</v>

2307
02:06:06.450 --> 02:06:09.690
<v Speaker 2>You want to eat now later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow,</v>

2308
02:06:09.691 --> 02:06:14.691
<v Speaker 2>next week and next month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you're able to engage in </v>

2309
02:06:14.691 --> 02:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>reproductive activity and defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself in multiple contexts with a </v>

2310
02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.520
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of people for as long as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can possibly manage it.</v>

2311
02:06:20.970 --> 02:06:23.280
<v Speaker 2>And so you need the rest of your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>to calculate that.</v>

2312
02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:26.910
<v Speaker 2>And so what the rest of your brain has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do roughly speaking,</v>

2313
02:06:26.911 --> 02:06:31.911
<v Speaker 2>is regulate these and also elaborate </v>
<v Speaker 2>them up into like,</v>

2314
02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:37.500
<v Speaker 2>like into something that's integrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside you which might roughly be your </v>

2315
02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:41.451
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so that that personality is </v>

2316
02:06:41.451 --> 02:06:41.451
<v Speaker 2>integrated with the personality of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2317
02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:43.890
<v Speaker 2>And so you can think about it as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergent process.</v>

2318
02:06:43.891 --> 02:06:45.990
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things I really like </v>
<v Speaker 2>about piaget.</v>

2319
02:06:46.230 --> 02:06:51.230
<v Speaker 2>He's so damn smart because piaget is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>only thinker I know really who really </v>

2320
02:06:52.321 --> 02:06:55.440
<v Speaker 2>addressed the problem of the evolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>of value systems.</v>

2321
02:06:55.620 --> 02:07:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never nailed it down to the </v>

2322
02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:03.021
<v Speaker 2>physiology because there wasn't enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>known about physiology when he did his </v>

2323
02:07:03.021 --> 02:07:05.931
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it maps very nicely onto the </v>

2324
02:07:05.931 --> 02:07:05.931
<v Speaker 2>physiology.</v>

2325
02:07:05.931 --> 02:07:05.931
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2326
02:07:05.931 --> 02:07:07.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got it right.</v>

2327
02:07:07.411 --> 02:07:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2328
02:07:08.071 --> 02:07:13.071
<v Speaker 2>you come into the world with a handful </v>
<v Speaker 2>of of a preestablished reflexes.</v>

2329
02:07:13.470 --> 02:07:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to complicate that up a bit.</v>

2330
02:07:15.330 --> 02:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come into the world with a handful </v>

2331
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:22.670
<v Speaker 2>of micro personalities that are centered</v>
<v Speaker 2>around these fundamental motivational </v>

2332
02:07:22.741 --> 02:07:23.910
<v Speaker 2>axes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2333
02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:29.600
<v Speaker 2>And then that gets you started and is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has motor output as well as </v>

2334
02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:31.260
<v Speaker 2>perceptions and all of that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with it.</v>

2335
02:07:31.530 --> 02:07:35.130
<v Speaker 2>And then as you interact initially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say with your mother,</v>

2336
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:40.830
<v Speaker 2>you start to learn how to integrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things in some sort of social </v>

2337
02:07:40.830 --> 02:07:43.891
<v Speaker 2>context because you form a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your mother right off the bat and </v>

2338
02:07:43.891 --> 02:07:48.511
<v Speaker 2>so you're starting to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>to to produce patterned and stable </v>

2339
02:07:49.691 --> 02:07:53.170
<v Speaker 2>interactions between those motivational </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems on a day to day,</v>

2340
02:07:53.171 --> 02:07:54.940
<v Speaker 2>week to week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>month to month basis.</v>

2341
02:07:55.150 --> 02:08:00.150
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things you do with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really important to do this with </v>

2342
02:08:00.150 --> 02:08:00.340
<v Speaker 2>kids is you want to get them onto some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort,</v>

2343
02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:05.370
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what the routine is actually is </v>

2344
02:08:05.370 --> 02:08:09.211
<v Speaker 2>the beginnings of the system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrates all of these underlying </v>

2345
02:08:09.211 --> 02:08:11.700
<v Speaker 2>biological systems into some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unity because they have to sleep in,</v>

2346
02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:15.100
<v Speaker 2>they have to sleep and wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to get nailed that down.</v>

2347
02:08:15.101 --> 02:08:17.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2348
02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:22.080
<v Speaker 2>they have to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to stay warm and they need to </v>

2349
02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:23.080
<v Speaker 2>do that in a manner that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's stable.</v>

2350
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:28.350
<v Speaker 2>And so it's to your great benefit as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>parent that you get islands of stability</v>

2351
02:08:29.650 --> 02:08:34.650
<v Speaker 2>planted in the life of your kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that some of this gets simplified so </v>

2352
02:08:34.691 --> 02:08:39.691
<v Speaker 2>that the kid isn't constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>preoccupied with domination by these </v>

2353
02:08:39.691 --> 02:08:43.111
<v Speaker 2>different motivational systems and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a useful thing to know because you </v>

2354
02:08:43.111 --> 02:08:43.111
<v Speaker 2>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2355
02:08:43.111 --> 02:08:44.590
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to impose any structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>on your baby.</v>

2356
02:08:44.590 --> 02:08:45.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

2357
02:08:46.630 --> 02:08:51.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be a tyrant about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no difference between that </v>

2358
02:08:51.630 --> 02:08:55.060
<v Speaker 2>structure and the emergence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>child's adaptation to the world.</v>

2359
02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:00.360
<v Speaker 2>And to some degree what you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is free them up from arbitrary </v>

2360
02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:02.050
<v Speaker 2>domination by these underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems.</v>

2361
02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:04.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if the baby gets too tired,</v>

2362
02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:09.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a horrible little thing to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>scream at you nonstop and it's not happy</v>

2363
02:09:09.821 --> 02:09:14.821
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not good for anyone for </v>

2364
02:09:14.821 --> 02:09:17.041
<v Speaker 2>that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the faster you have to do it in </v>

2365
02:09:17.041 --> 02:09:20.521
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if some will sleep right away in a </v>

2366
02:09:20.521 --> 02:09:24.090
<v Speaker 2>schedule almost immediately and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are harder to to to get their </v>

2367
02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:29.460
<v Speaker 2>circadian rhythms regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to attend to the individual </v>

2368
02:09:29.460 --> 02:09:33.721
<v Speaker 2>differences that characterize the child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're still trying to establish </v>

2369
02:09:33.721 --> 02:09:37.471
<v Speaker 2>some stable harmony out of this mishmash</v>
<v Speaker 2>of initial of initial systems.</v>

2370
02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:39.010
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2371
02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:43.220
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2372
02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:46.030
<v Speaker 2>so that's sort of a physiological look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at that.</v>

2373
02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:50.990
<v Speaker 2>This is more of a conceptual look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said that each of these systems you</v>

2374
02:09:50.991 --> 02:09:52.790
<v Speaker 2>can think about in a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

2375
02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:55.640
<v Speaker 2>You can think about our best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that sets a goal.</v>

2376
02:09:56.780 --> 02:10:01.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hungry and I don't want to be </v>

2377
02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:01.780
<v Speaker 2>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Point a point b.</v>

2378
02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:05.030
<v Speaker 2>So the hunger and the vision of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>satiation,</v>

2379
02:10:05.031 --> 02:10:07.010
<v Speaker 2>of the hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all part of the same frame.</v>

2380
02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:10.520
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go into the kitchen,</v>

2381
02:10:11.150 --> 02:10:13.340
<v Speaker 2>you know that already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of your</v>

2382
02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:19.150
<v Speaker 2>procedural knowledge about how the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>works and then what you're going to look</v>

2383
02:10:19.151 --> 02:10:24.151
<v Speaker 2>for are only those things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant to what you're trying to do in </v>

2384
02:10:24.151 --> 02:10:24.610
<v Speaker 2>the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else is zeroed out.</v>

2385
02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:26.680
<v Speaker 2>You won't even really see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why would you?</v>

2386
02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:32.020
<v Speaker 2>You want to see the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant to the task at hand and so that</v>

2387
02:10:32.350 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so cool,</v>

2388
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I think because what it means is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the things that are relevant to </v>

2389
02:10:39.250 --> 02:10:40.400
<v Speaker 2>the task at hand and so here's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think about.</v>

2390
02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that you see a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in the world that you don't want </v>

2391
02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:47.420
<v Speaker 2>to see know that make you constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable and unhappy.</v>

2392
02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:52.720
<v Speaker 2>One thing you might ask yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sure that your goals are proper </v>

2393
02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:55.640
<v Speaker 2>because your goals determine what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see now,</v>

2394
02:10:55.641 --> 02:11:00.641
<v Speaker 2>not 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you can be thinking about the </v>

2395
02:11:00.641 --> 02:11:02.780
<v Speaker 2>homework you're going to do and step off</v>
<v Speaker 2>a curb and be hit by a van.</v>

2396
02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:07.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're going to get hit by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>van regardless of how you've oriented </v>

2397
02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:08.810
<v Speaker 2>your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely in all likelihood.</v>

2398
02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:11.930
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not trying to argue for pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>solipsism,</v>

2399
02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:16.960
<v Speaker 2>but it is very interesting to consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>that since you see in relationship to </v>

2400
02:11:17.541 --> 02:11:20.450
<v Speaker 2>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a very large amount of what you see</v>

2401
02:11:20.451 --> 02:11:25.451
<v Speaker 2>is dependent on what you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one issue is if your life is </v>

2402
02:11:25.451 --> 02:11:30.251
<v Speaker 2>wretched and miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing to think about is whether or </v>

2403
02:11:30.251 --> 02:11:30.410
<v Speaker 2>not what you're aiming at is the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to be aiming at,</v>

2404
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:34.820
<v Speaker 2>and so it's and nothing is exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong answer to that.</v>

2405
02:11:34.821 --> 02:11:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm aiming at nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>

2406
02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:40.130
<v Speaker 2>you're going to experience a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of misery and not very much joy.</v>

2407
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:42.530
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got this little frame.</v>

2408
02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:48.580
<v Speaker 2>You're somewhere and it's not good </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough and you're going somewhere else </v>

2409
02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:48.580
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be better.</v>

2410
02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>And what better depends upon is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of these underlying biological </v>

2411
02:11:54.651 --> 02:11:59.651
<v Speaker 2>systems and then more complex Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as those biological systems get </v>

2412
02:11:59.651 --> 02:12:01.490
<v Speaker 2>integrated into a personality and into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social world,</v>

2413
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:07.030
<v Speaker 2>then the frame and the goal is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be dependent on that more complex </v>

2414
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:11.891
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not in here because you're </v>

2415
02:12:11.891 --> 02:12:14.621
<v Speaker 2>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in here because if you get a </v>

2416
02:12:14.621 --> 02:12:14.621
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't ever have to be hungry.</v>

2417
02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:19.880
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the hunger is properly incorporated </v>

2418
02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:21.140
<v Speaker 2>into your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be cold.</v>

2419
02:12:21.141 --> 02:12:22.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to freeze to death in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter.</v>

2420
02:12:22.251 --> 02:12:23.990
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2421
02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:29.020
<v Speaker 2>so your higher order goals are longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially negotiated solutions to the </v>

2422
02:12:31.341 --> 02:12:34.760
<v Speaker 2>problems that are implicit in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

2423
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Not that might be one way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

2424
02:12:36.501 --> 02:12:38.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2425
02:12:38.890 --> 02:12:41.930
<v Speaker 2>and the micro elements of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say I'm hungry.</v>

2426
02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:44.210
<v Speaker 2>That's a physiological state and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception.</v>

2427
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:46.820
<v Speaker 2>I have a vision of how I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve that,</v>

2428
02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:49.280
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are,</v>

2429
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:53.710
<v Speaker 2>that's an abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you do to transform point a and</v>

2430
02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:56.600
<v Speaker 2>point b is not an abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Act,</v>

2431
02:12:57.140 --> 02:12:58.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're hungry,</v>

2432
02:12:58.101 --> 02:13:03.101
<v Speaker 2>you actually move your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say down from the second floor into the </v>

2433
02:13:03.101 --> 02:13:07.130
<v Speaker 2>kitchen and you arrange things so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's transformations in the world and</v>

2434
02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:12.460
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way of thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the mind and the </v>

2435
02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:15.191
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your hypothetical solution to your </v>

2436
02:13:15.191 --> 02:13:15.191
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the mind.</v>

2437
02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:18.590
<v Speaker 2>But the manner in which you incarnate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that solution,</v>

2438
02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:21.680
<v Speaker 2>that's no longer abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2439
02:13:21.681 --> 02:13:25.460
<v Speaker 2>people are always trying to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind body problem and that's as far as I</v>

2440
02:13:25.461 --> 02:13:30.461
<v Speaker 2>can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you solve it is you have </v>

2441
02:13:30.461 --> 02:13:32.231
<v Speaker 2>abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not abstractions that are </v>

2442
02:13:32.231 --> 02:13:32.231
<v Speaker 2>representations of the world.</v>

2443
02:13:32.231 --> 02:13:36.500
<v Speaker 2>There are abstractions that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of action patterns and </v>

2444
02:13:36.601 --> 02:13:41.601
<v Speaker 2>the way those are implemented in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is that you act them and so it's </v>

2445
02:13:41.601 --> 02:13:43.770
<v Speaker 2>strange because you've got this weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of control,</v>

2446
02:13:43.771 --> 02:13:48.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can move my arm and I seem to be able </v>

2447
02:13:48.771 --> 02:13:51.081
<v Speaker 2>to do that voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really have no idea how I'm doing </v>

2448
02:13:51.081 --> 02:13:54.471
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't have conscious access </v>

2449
02:13:54.471 --> 02:13:57.420
<v Speaker 2>exactly to the musculature except </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically and I certainly have no idea</v>

2450
02:13:57.421 --> 02:14:01.020
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing chemically to make those </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles muscles transform,</v>

2451
02:14:01.410 --> 02:14:03.540
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my soul,</v>

2452
02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:08.900
<v Speaker 2>my abstractions ground out in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement and I can observe the movement </v>

2453
02:14:09.670 --> 02:14:14.670
<v Speaker 2>and and modern and modify it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have no conscious access </v>

2454
02:14:14.670 --> 02:14:17.370
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever to the microprocessors that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are making that possible.</v>

2455
02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably because I'm not smart enough.</v>

2456
02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:24.840
<v Speaker 2>That would be my guess right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is you're only going to.</v>

2457
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Evolution is only going to allow your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind to control those elements of your </v>

2458
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:34.071
<v Speaker 2>being that you're smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and so you don't get voluntary </v>

2459
02:14:34.071 --> 02:14:34.470
<v Speaker 2>control over your heartbeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2460
02:14:34.471 --> 02:14:39.471
<v Speaker 2>because you just forget and then you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be wandering around and then you'd </v>

2461
02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:42.150
<v Speaker 2>forget to beat your heart bag and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be dead so you don't get to do that.</v>

2462
02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:47.960
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all these different classified,</v>

2463
02:14:49.171 --> 02:14:54.171
<v Speaker 2>these again is self propagation and self</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintenance motivations and so if you're</v>

2464
02:14:54.421 --> 02:14:57.030
<v Speaker 2>too hot while you want to go somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooler and if you're too cool,</v>

2465
02:14:57.031 --> 02:15:02.031
<v Speaker 2>you want to go somewhere hotter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same if you're thirsty and hungry and </v>

2466
02:15:02.031 --> 02:15:05.750
<v Speaker 2>for self propagation while you're get </v>
<v Speaker 2>lonesome and maybe you know you have </v>

2467
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:09.291
<v Speaker 2>some sexual desire and and each of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>different systems competes for access to</v>

2468
02:15:10.321 --> 02:15:15.321
<v Speaker 2>this central frame and that's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the contents of your consciousness </v>

2469
02:15:15.321 --> 02:15:15.321
<v Speaker 2>at any given time.</v>

2470
02:15:15.690 --> 02:15:20.690
<v Speaker 2>So up pops a desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's wrong way of thinking about it </v>

2471
02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:23.790
<v Speaker 2>because a desire sounds like something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pushing you forward,</v>

2472
02:15:23.791 --> 02:15:25.740
<v Speaker 2>but the desire is goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>framework,</v>

2473
02:15:25.741 --> 02:15:28.230
<v Speaker 2>emotion perception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>action pattern,</v>

2474
02:15:28.290 --> 02:15:33.290
<v Speaker 2>all at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little personality or it's a </v>

2475
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:36.081
<v Speaker 2>little story actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you describe the operation of one </v>

2476
02:15:36.081 --> 02:15:36.750
<v Speaker 2>of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you're telling a story,</v>

2477
02:15:37.890 --> 02:15:42.120
<v Speaker 2>so I was somewhere I needed something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went and got it.</v>

2478
02:15:42.210 --> 02:15:45.810
<v Speaker 2>It's boring little story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the basic unit of a story,</v>

2479
02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:48.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't care to hear what you're</v>

2480
02:15:48.931 --> 02:15:50.430
<v Speaker 2>doing unless you had a reason for doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2481
02:15:50.730 --> 02:15:55.730
<v Speaker 2>I just say what's the point of the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the point of the story is the point.</v>

2482
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:58.110
<v Speaker 2>It's directional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2483
02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went from here to there.</v>

2484
02:16:00.601 --> 02:16:02.460
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's how I did it.</v>

2485
02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:07.520
<v Speaker 2>That's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're interested in that because </v>

2486
02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:09.411
<v Speaker 2>maybe you want to know how to do it too </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you won't have to struggle through </v>

2487
02:16:09.411 --> 02:16:09.411
<v Speaker 2>it like I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just listen,</v>

2488
02:16:09.570 --> 02:16:14.570
<v Speaker 2>and so we're always throwing these </v>
<v Speaker 2>little units of information back and </v>

2489
02:16:14.570 --> 02:16:14.620
<v Speaker 2>forth to each other and for good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2490
02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what your point is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because better I learned it from you.</v>

2491
02:16:19.231 --> 02:16:24.231
<v Speaker 2>Then make all the mistakes that you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make when you were learning it and </v>

2492
02:16:24.231 --> 02:16:24.600
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got that figured out.</v>

2493
02:16:24.601 --> 02:16:29.601
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

2494
02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

2495
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:33.070
<v Speaker 3>going to just explain this and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll stop.</v>

2496
02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:38.680
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're in one of those frames now and </v>

2497
02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:43.290
<v Speaker 3>we're going from point a to point b and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so the question is how does the world </v>

2498
02:16:43.290 --> 02:16:44.380
<v Speaker 3>lay itself out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2499
02:16:44.381 --> 02:16:49.381
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is partly the reason I showed </v>

2500
02:16:49.381 --> 02:16:51.340
<v Speaker 3>you the gorilla video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the first thing a frame does for</v>

2501
02:16:51.341 --> 02:16:56.341
<v Speaker 3>you is make almost everything irrelevant</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's so great because that's what </v>

2502
02:16:56.341 --> 02:17:00.031
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want almost everything to be </v>

2503
02:17:00.031 --> 02:17:02.011
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant because otherwise you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be so flooded with information </v>

2504
02:17:02.011 --> 02:17:02.950
<v Speaker 3>that you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what hallucinogens do,</v>

2505
02:17:03.610 --> 02:17:08.610
<v Speaker 3>at least in their initial stages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is they take away that filter and make </v>

2506
02:17:08.610 --> 02:17:13.051
<v Speaker 3>everything relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can read about that in Huxley's </v>

2507
02:17:13.051 --> 02:17:17.670
<v Speaker 3>doors of perception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does a great job of describing that </v>

2508
02:17:17.670 --> 02:17:20.491
<v Speaker 3>initial stages of a masculine experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what happens is that all of the </v>

2509
02:17:20.491 --> 02:17:24.930
<v Speaker 3>memory in some sense that regulates is </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptions is stripped off and so he </v>

2510
02:17:24.930 --> 02:17:27.700
<v Speaker 3>sees everything glowing and alive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>magical like,</v>

2511
02:17:27.970 --> 02:17:29.800
<v Speaker 3>like he'd never encountered it before.</v>

2512
02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Which is exactly how you would see </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2513
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:36.750
<v Speaker 3>If all your memory about it was gone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he sees things as way more complex </v>

2514
02:17:36.750 --> 02:17:37.720
<v Speaker 3>and interesting than he normally sees </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2515
02:17:38.170 --> 02:17:40.390
<v Speaker 3>while that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're like that all the time,</v>

2516
02:17:40.391 --> 02:17:45.391
<v Speaker 3>then you end up in a ditch starving to </v>
<v Speaker 3>death or something like it's not </v>

2517
02:17:45.391 --> 02:17:47.230
<v Speaker 3>commensurate with normal life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like,</v>

2518
02:17:47.530 --> 02:17:52.530
<v Speaker 3>and so your perceptions or just shrunk </v>
<v Speaker 3>and restricted to the bare minimum </v>

2519
02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:54.550
<v Speaker 3>necessary to keep you moving in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction that you're moving.</v>

2520
02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:56.500
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the first thing you want to do is you</v>

2521
02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:59.890
<v Speaker 3>want to make things irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2522
02:18:00.310 --> 02:18:03.590
<v Speaker 3>if you're with someone in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>

2523
02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:09.900
<v Speaker 3>partly what you want them to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help you continue making most of their </v>

2524
02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:14.551
<v Speaker 3>possibility irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's polite because one of the things </v>

2525
02:18:14.551 --> 02:18:15.310
<v Speaker 3>you so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you say,</v>

2526
02:18:15.311 --> 02:18:16.840
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a friendship.</v>

2527
02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's say we have a friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2528
02:18:18.670 --> 02:18:23.670
<v Speaker 3>so that means you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've agreed to act in a friendly </v>

2529
02:18:23.670 --> 02:18:26.731
<v Speaker 3>manner towards me and to support me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of other ways you </v>

2530
02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:28.870
<v Speaker 3>could act like a myriad of them and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do the same for you.</v>

2531
02:18:28.871 --> 02:18:33.250
<v Speaker 3>So were simpler to each other than we </v>
<v Speaker 3>would normally be and then you go and do</v>

2532
02:18:33.251 --> 02:18:35.290
<v Speaker 3>something that betrays me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like bang,</v>

2533
02:18:35.470 --> 02:18:40.470
<v Speaker 3>that whole simplification has gone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all those parts of you that were </v>

2534
02:18:40.470 --> 02:18:42.370
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be irrelevant because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were playing the same game,</v>

2535
02:18:42.730 --> 02:18:45.310
<v Speaker 3>they're dead relevant and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>who the hell you are.</v>

2536
02:18:45.730 --> 02:18:48.460
<v Speaker 3>And so that's really rough and people do</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like that.</v>

2537
02:18:48.461 --> 02:18:53.461
<v Speaker 3>It's this emergent mismatch between </v>
<v Speaker 3>their desires and the way the world is </v>

2538
02:18:53.461 --> 02:18:57.331
<v Speaker 3>manifesting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the issues of complexity is </v>

2539
02:18:57.331 --> 02:19:01.291
<v Speaker 3>that when you hit an obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that you have agreed with </v>

2540
02:19:01.361 --> 02:19:05.080
<v Speaker 3>other people to make irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant.</v>

2541
02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:09.070
<v Speaker 3>And that's generally a disconcerting </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2542
02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Now you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2543
02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:14.450
<v Speaker 3>you might want a toy a little bit with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that interrelationship,</v>

2544
02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe you encourage your partner to </v>

2545
02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:22.111
<v Speaker 3>dress differently or you go do different</v>
<v Speaker 3>things or something because you don't </v>

2546
02:19:22.111 --> 02:19:22.360
<v Speaker 3>want to be stuck in exactly the same old</v>
<v Speaker 3>rut.</v>

2547
02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:27.160
<v Speaker 3>And so what you'll agree is how you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>both deviate and interesting amount,</v>

2548
02:19:27.710 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 3>but that's</v>

2549
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:30.830
<v Speaker 2>voluntary and controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same at all.</v>

2550
02:19:30.831 --> 02:19:35.831
<v Speaker 2>It's having that little massive 80 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million snakes pop up right in front of </v>

2551
02:19:35.831 --> 02:19:37.610
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the last thing you want to have</v>

2552
02:19:37.611 --> 02:19:42.611
<v Speaker 2>happen and so it's so weird because one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that we're striving to do </v>

2553
02:19:42.621 --> 02:19:47.621
<v Speaker 2>constantly is to keep most of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant and our cultural systems are </v>

2554
02:19:48.621 --> 02:19:53.621
<v Speaker 2>designed precisely for that purpose and </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of what you do when you disrupt </v>

2555
02:19:53.621 --> 02:19:57.581
<v Speaker 2>them is you force people to consider a </v>
<v Speaker 2>far more range of relevance than they </v>

2556
02:19:57.581 --> 02:20:02.261
<v Speaker 2>are even vaguely comfortable or vaguely </v>
<v Speaker 2>competent to manage and it just burns </v>

2557
02:20:03.051 --> 02:20:06.200
<v Speaker 2>them to a Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what your body does is if all of</v>

2558
02:20:06.201 --> 02:20:07.970
<v Speaker 2>a sudden everything around you is </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>

2559
02:20:08.330 --> 02:20:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I could say you're stripped naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take you to helicopter jumped,</v>

2560
02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:14.210
<v Speaker 2>drop you right into the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>jungle at midnight.</v>

2561
02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:18.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not bored standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2562
02:20:19.250 --> 02:20:20.690
<v Speaker 2>frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paralyzed.</v>

2563
02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Everything is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well too bad for you because to </v>

2564
02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:27.620
<v Speaker 2>interesting is very little different </v>
<v Speaker 2>from terrifying.</v>

2565
02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:33.040
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your heart rate's going to be at one </v>

2566
02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:34.250
<v Speaker 2>slash 60 for like two days and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>something will eat you and your problems</v>

2567
02:20:34.251 --> 02:20:35.660
<v Speaker 2>will be over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2568
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this diagram basically suggest this </v>

2569
02:20:40.990 --> 02:20:44.141
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how you break up the world when </v>

2570
02:20:44.141 --> 02:20:44.141
<v Speaker 2>you're going from point a to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read,</v>

2571
02:20:44.141 --> 02:20:45.440
<v Speaker 2>it renders almost everything we </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant,</v>

2572
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:49.550
<v Speaker 2>hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens is the rest of the</v>

2573
02:20:49.551 --> 02:20:54.551
<v Speaker 2>world is broken up into obstacles that </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in your way and tools that </v>

2574
02:20:54.551 --> 02:20:59.501
<v Speaker 2>facilitate your movement forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually what you see when </v>

2575
02:20:59.501 --> 02:20:59.960
<v Speaker 2>you come into a place like when you come</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this room.</v>

2576
02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:05.800
<v Speaker 2>These are obstacles in so far as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't walk through them and those are </v>

2577
02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:06.820
<v Speaker 2>tools in so far as you can sit on them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and watch the class.</v>

2578
02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:12.160
<v Speaker 2>This is a tool and these are tools and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a tool and I'm a tool for,</v>

2579
02:21:13.430 --> 02:21:15.440
<v Speaker 2>although I'd never admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>

2580
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:20.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a tool of because you need to take </v>

2581
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:21.550
<v Speaker 2>this class in order to advance towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2582
02:21:22.370 --> 02:21:27.370
<v Speaker 2>towards your degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so basically what you see in the </v>

2583
02:21:27.370 --> 02:21:29.540
<v Speaker 2>world or entities that functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance and those are not objects,</v>

2584
02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:31.910
<v Speaker 2>they are not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2585
02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:37.020
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very much worth considering </v>

2586
02:21:37.020 --> 02:21:37.280
<v Speaker 2>because see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to build up a case,</v>

2587
02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:42.340
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for analyzing the nature of the </v>

2588
02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:46.090
<v Speaker 2>structures within which you organize </v>
<v Speaker 2>your perceptions and we tend to think </v>

2589
02:21:46.090 --> 02:21:47.420
<v Speaker 2>that those are predicated on object </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception.</v>

2590
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:50.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>

2591
02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.780
<v Speaker 2>They're predicated on relevance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conception.</v>

2592
02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Does it help you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it get in your way or is it </v>

2593
02:21:59.200 --> 02:21:59.200
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you want to know.</v>

2594
02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:00.650
<v Speaker 2>If it helps you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're happy about it.</v>

2595
02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:02.100
<v Speaker 2>If it gets in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2596
02:22:02.530 --> 02:22:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you're negatively predisposed towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2597
02:22:04.401 --> 02:22:06.530
<v Speaker 2>If it's irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's invisible.</v>

2598
02:22:07.430 --> 02:22:11.450
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your little scheme is functional,</v>

2599
02:22:11.451 --> 02:22:16.451
<v Speaker 2>your little frame is functional than </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the things that you encounter </v>

2600
02:22:16.451 --> 02:22:19.721
<v Speaker 2>are mildly positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you know that you know </v>

2601
02:22:19.721 --> 02:22:22.391
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you validate the entire </v>

2602
02:22:22.391 --> 02:22:22.391
<v Speaker 2>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2603
02:22:22.391 --> 02:22:23.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
