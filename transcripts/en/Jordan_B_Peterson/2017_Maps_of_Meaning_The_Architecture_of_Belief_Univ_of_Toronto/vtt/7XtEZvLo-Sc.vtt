1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 2>I told you at the beginning of the class</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I started working on this material </v>

3
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 2>partly because I was interested in why </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were so inclined to to go to any </v>

4
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:38.951
<v Speaker 2>lengths to protect their belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to understand and I knew that </v>

5
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:40.160
<v Speaker 2>those were systems of value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:45.161
<v Speaker 2>That that belief system is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that enables you to ascribe value to </v>

7
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:49.541
<v Speaker 2>things so that so that you can act in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world towards things in a way from </v>

8
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:55.961
<v Speaker 2>things roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've already made a case to you that</v>

9
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 2>belief systems regulate people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions but not</v>

10
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 2>not as a consequence of decreasing their</v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

11
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:12.361
<v Speaker 2>anxiety or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even directly decreasing their their </v>

12
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:18.691
<v Speaker 2>threat sensitivity or uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more specifically by helping them </v>

13
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:24.151
<v Speaker 2>orient themselves in the world so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do matches what they want in </v>

14
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:29.701
<v Speaker 2>the social environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an important set of </v>

15
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:33.421
<v Speaker 2>distinctions because the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>control that belief systems allow is </v>

16
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 2>mediated by success in the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

17
00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:39.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the crucial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

18
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as if you're holding a belief </v>

19
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 2>system and that's directly inhibiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow your emotional responsivity.</v>

20
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 2>It's more that you share,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a motive,</v>

21
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 2>orienting yourself in the world so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people can understand what you're </v>

22
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.181
<v Speaker 2>up to so that you can cooperate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compete with them without conflict and </v>

23
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:08.941
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you can do that without </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict and maybe even with </v>

24
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 2>cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what regulates your emotion,</v>

25
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 2>so it's not only the fact of the beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 2>belief system,</v>

26
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:17.581
<v Speaker 2>it's the fact that it's shared with </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else and so people are willing </v>

27
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:24.991
<v Speaker 2>to defend their belief systems because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're defending the territorial </v>

28
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:30.931
<v Speaker 2>structure that enables them to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of the world and then to act out </v>

29
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 2>making sense of the world with everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else around them.</v>

30
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the question arises,</v>

31
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 2>what if two different groups of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have different belief systems?</v>

32
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 2>What do you do in a situation like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one answer is you capitulate.</v>

33
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Another answer is that you fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another answer might be that you come to</v>

34
00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:01.411
<v Speaker 2>some consensus about how the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those different belief systems might be </v>

35
00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:05.941
<v Speaker 2>mediated so that you can inhabit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same territory without subordination or </v>

36
00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:10.711
<v Speaker 2>without conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're going to come together in </v>

37
00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:17.291
<v Speaker 2>an agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that simply by abandoning </v>

38
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>the belief system because the belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is what orients you in the world.</v>

39
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 2>And so the negotiation is very tricky </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of that,</v>

40
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 2>it often ends up in subordination or </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

41
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Another question that might arise out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rat's nest of questions is if you </v>

42
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 2>have belief system a and you have belief</v>
<v Speaker 2>system B and they're in conflict,</v>

43
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.400
<v Speaker 2>is there any principles that you can use</v>
<v Speaker 2>or any guidelines you can use to take </v>

44
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.991
<v Speaker 2>the belief systems apart to under to try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand what might be of central </v>

45
00:03:55.091 --> 00:04:00.091
<v Speaker 2>value in either of them or both so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do bring them together or even if</v>

46
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 2>one supersedes the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is some evidence that they're</v>

47
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 2>predicated on principles that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually viable.</v>

48
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.640
<v Speaker 2>And of course that brings up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question of what constitutes viable </v>

49
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.161
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got interested in that more </v>

50
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 2>particular question because when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cold War was raging,</v>

51
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 2>there were two ideological systems set </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the world.</v>

52
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were of course more,</v>

53
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:30.331
<v Speaker 2>but we can simplify it for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument down to two and one was </v>

54
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 2>predicated on the communitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles that were put forward by Marx</v>

55
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 2>and the other was a consequence of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

56
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:44.641
<v Speaker 2>western,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individualistic free market capitalist </v>

57
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:44.641
<v Speaker 2>democracies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

58
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 2>and then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

59
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 2>were those only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that only a difference of opinion?</v>

60
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the central question.</v>

61
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.630
<v Speaker 2>It was just a difference of opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If what's underneath it is arbitrary </v>

62
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.791
<v Speaker 2>then a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter which system wins </v>

63
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:02.610
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no right and wrong in the </v>

64
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 2>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

65
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:08.581
<v Speaker 2>It's that that would be something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be more akin to a postmodern </v>

66
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:12.031
<v Speaker 2>claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just group a puts forward their </v>

67
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:14.581
<v Speaker 2>claims to power and Group B puts form </v>
<v Speaker 2>their claims power and they're both </v>

68
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:17.641
<v Speaker 2>equally valid and while have add are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally because there's no way of </v>

69
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 2>solving the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it struck me that,</v>

70
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:26.521
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't think that we should leap </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that conclusion so rapidly and so I </v>

71
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:32.041
<v Speaker 2>started to investigate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I started to investigate the </v>

72
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:36.721
<v Speaker 2>substructure of Western thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not so much communist thought because I </v>

73
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 2>thought of communism as an interloper on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scene.</v>

74
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.210
<v Speaker 2>It was a system that wasn't devised and </v>
<v Speaker 2>formalized until the late 1900,</v>

75
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.470
<v Speaker 2>late 18 hundreds and I didn't see it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of what you might describe as </v>

76
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 2>organic development.</v>

77
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 2>There's no mythologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

78
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>at the basis of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the communist perspective.</v>

79
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is that although those ideas</v>

80
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 2>were roundly defeated by the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century,</v>

81
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 2>they're making a comeback so rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's almost unbelievable.</v>

82
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Know I got an email from a medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>student yesterday at the University of </v>

83
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Toronto and now their courses that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to take the mandatory.</v>

84
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:17.981
<v Speaker 2>These are social justice courses include</v>
<v Speaker 2>modules on equity and equity as equality</v>

85
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:23.411
<v Speaker 2>of outcome that they're pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are having the equality of </v>

86
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:26.711
<v Speaker 2>outcome notion pushed on them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandatory training and universities </v>

87
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

88
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 2>and equity isn't equality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>

89
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.150
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

90
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 2>that was the central dictum of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Communist states in the 20th century.</v>

91
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

92
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 2>How did we get back to that again </v>
<v Speaker 2>already so.</v>

93
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.750
<v Speaker 2>And the idea being is if there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute equality of outcome within an </v>

94
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.021
<v Speaker 2>organization that the thing is corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it needs to be restructured from the </v>

95
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:50.021
<v Speaker 2>bottom up.</v>

96
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:54.430
<v Speaker 2>And then the question of course is who </v>
<v Speaker 2>decides that outcomes are equal by what </v>

97
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 2>means and with what groups?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you can,</v>

98
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 2>you can produce an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups of people with equally validly in</v>

99
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:06.371
<v Speaker 2>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're never going to get equality </v>

100
00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:08.621
<v Speaker 2>of outcome across the infinite number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that you can parse up society into </v>

101
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:13.901
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even technically possible </v>

102
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 2>unless everyone has nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

103
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:21.010
<v Speaker 2>these are obviously very powerful ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mere fact that they killed 100 </v>

104
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.240
<v Speaker 2>million people already are more in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century wasn't enough to put them </v>

105
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.020
<v Speaker 2>to rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

106
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 2>So back to the main theme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there something.</v>

107
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 2>This is the main question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there something,</v>

108
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.020
<v Speaker 2>is there a set of ideas that Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization is predicated on that are </v>

109
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 2>more than just bloody opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>

110
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Because if there isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then what do you.</v>

111
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 2>What do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's arbitrary.</v>

112
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 2>He was just holding it for no reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

113
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 2>It could be a different system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to stick with it.</v>

114
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.810
<v Speaker 2>All of those things like it takes the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes the core out of it.</v>

115
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:01.250
<v Speaker 2>When that was neat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just claim right.</v>

116
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:06.251
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take the core metaphysical </v>

117
00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:09.521
<v Speaker 2>presupposition out from underneath </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western civilization or any civilization</v>

118
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 2>for that matter and the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>loosens chickens,</v>

119
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.030
<v Speaker 2>shakes and crumbles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well for nature.</v>

120
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 2>The metaphysical presupposition was God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then the question of course,</v>

121
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what even does that mean?</v>

122
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:28.601
<v Speaker 2>And it on one hand it means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose adherence to a dogmatic set of</v>

123
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 2>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you might ask yourself,</v>

124
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there something else that it means?</v>

125
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:38.120
<v Speaker 2>It means at least the hypothesis of some</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent value.</v>

126
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 2>It means at least that.</v>

127
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.780
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nisha announced the death of God and so </v>

128
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.891
<v Speaker 2>one of the consequences of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky was working on exactly the </v>

129
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 2>same set of ideas and in crime and </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment in particular,</v>

130
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 2>which is a book I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a necessary book.</v>

131
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing is there's a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>books that were written in the last </v>

132
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:03.790
<v Speaker 2>hundred and 20 years that you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to read.</v>

133
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Crime and punishment is one of them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Gulag archipelago is another</v>

134
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 2>and probably beyond good and evil is </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

135
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 2>but Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche were writing in parallel.</v>

136
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:18.111
<v Speaker 2>It's remarkable how much their their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives intertwined and Nisha knew more </v>

137
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 2>about Dostoevsky than than is generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

138
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 2>There's been some recent scholarship </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicating that,</v>

139
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 2>but Dostoyevsky's book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime and punishment,</v>

140
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 2>he has his main character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Riscal Nichol decides that he's going to</v>

141
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:37.701
<v Speaker 2>commit a murder and he has very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>justification for the murder and </v>

142
00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky is very good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

143
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.070
<v Speaker 2>he puts his characters into very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult moral situations and </v>

144
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 2>gives them full justification for </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuing the,</v>

145
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.230
<v Speaker 2>for pursuing the pathway that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuing.</v>

147
00:10:00.231 --> 00:10:03.920
<v Speaker 2>And so ruskell Nikolov,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's broke and starving.</v>

148
00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:07.010
<v Speaker 2>He wants to go to law school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His sister's about to prostitute herself</v>

149
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:12.011
<v Speaker 2>rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking by marrying a guy that </v>

150
00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:12.011
<v Speaker 2>hates her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she hates and that,</v>

151
00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.790
<v Speaker 2>and he has contempt for her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least acts in that manner.</v>

152
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.710
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to rescue his mother as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

153
00:10:15.711 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 2>who's also in dire financial straits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

154
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.400
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

155
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.430
<v Speaker 2>he goes to a pawnbroker to pawn his </v>
<v Speaker 2>meager position so that he can continue </v>

156
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.811
<v Speaker 2>to scrape by and she has this nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's her niece that's not very</v>

157
00:10:29.811 --> 00:10:34.811
<v Speaker 2>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who she basically treats as as a slave </v>

158
00:10:34.811 --> 00:10:35.090
<v Speaker 2>and his horrible too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the care,</v>

159
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.230
<v Speaker 2>the pawnbroker has this money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ruskell Niqab is in dire need.</v>

160
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.760
<v Speaker 2>He thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

161
00:10:40.761 --> 00:10:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll just killer because why the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>not?</v>

162
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll take her money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not doing any good with it.</v>

163
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll free your niece who's just working </v>

164
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:52.610
<v Speaker 2>as a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got all these other people tangled</v>

165
00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:57.611
<v Speaker 2>up in her pawnbroker schemes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that will happen is the world will </v>

166
00:10:57.611 --> 00:11:00.620
<v Speaker 2>be a better place and the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's holding me back is conventional.</v>

167
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Moral cowardice and Dostoevsky has his </v>
<v Speaker 2>character in crime and punishment go </v>

168
00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:08.780
<v Speaker 2>through days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

169
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.810
<v Speaker 2>hours and days and weeks of intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination about this rationalization,</v>

170
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:17.750
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to justify himself,</v>

171
00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:21.920
<v Speaker 2>placing a metal outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>placing him self outside the law so that</v>

172
00:11:21.921 --> 00:11:26.921
<v Speaker 2>he can perpetrate this act and telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>him self with all the best nihilistic </v>

173
00:11:26.921 --> 00:11:30.410
<v Speaker 2>arguments that the only possible thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be holding them back is an an</v>

174
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:35.300
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary sense of indoctrinated </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality and so dusty Esky explores that</v>

175
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:40.301
<v Speaker 2>he does commit the murder and then of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course all hell breaks loose because </v>

176
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:40.460
<v Speaker 2>things don't necessarily turn out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that you want.</v>

177
00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:41.270
<v Speaker 2>He gets away with it.</v>

178
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:46.270
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he gets away with a technically </v>

179
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.641
<v Speaker 2>because no one knows he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't get away with it in </v>

180
00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:51.641
<v Speaker 2>relationship to his own conscience and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that the rest of the book explores </v>

181
00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:51.920
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

182
00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:56.921
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was in crime and </v>

183
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:56.921
<v Speaker 2>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although he makes the same point in many</v>

184
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 2>of his books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He makes a very fundamental point,</v>

185
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:04.351
<v Speaker 2>and this is the kind of point that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that people who haven't </v>

186
00:12:04.351 --> 00:12:08.461
<v Speaker 2>investigated these matters down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this particularly particular literary </v>

187
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 2>and philosophical pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never grappled with Dostoevsky,</v>

188
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 2>said straightforwardly if there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

189
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 2>so if there is no higher value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say if there's no transcendent </v>

190
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.711
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can do whatever you want and </v>

191
00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:24.010
<v Speaker 2>that's the question that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigating and you see,</v>

192
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 2>this is why I have such frustration say </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people like Sam Harris,</v>

193
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:33.001
<v Speaker 2>this sort of radical atheists because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem to think that once human </v>

194
00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 2>beings abandoned their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their grounding in the transcendent,</v>

195
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plausible way forward is with a kind</v>

196
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:44.161
<v Speaker 2>of purist rationality that automatically</v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes to other people equivalent </v>

197
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>

198
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:49.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like I just don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe that that's the rational </v>

199
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.821
<v Speaker 2>pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell is irrational about me </v>

200
00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:56.431
<v Speaker 2>getting exactly what I want from every </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of you whenever I wanted at every </v>

201
00:12:56.431 --> 00:13:00.451
<v Speaker 2>possible second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that are irrational and how </v>

202
00:13:00.451 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 2>possibly is that more irrational than us</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperating?</v>

203
00:13:03.881 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 2>So we can both have a good time of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>

204
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as if the psychopathic tendency is </v>

205
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 2>irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing irrational about it.</v>

206
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.040
<v Speaker 2>It's pure naked self interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that irrational?</v>

207
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where?</v>

208
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Where's the pathway from rationality to </v>
<v Speaker 2>to an egalitarian virtue.</v>

209
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Why the hell not every man for himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the devil take the hindmost?</v>

210
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfectly coherent philosophy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually one that you can institute</v>

211
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:39.331
<v Speaker 2>in the world with a fair bit of material</v>
<v Speaker 2>success if you want to do it so I don't </v>

212
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

213
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.820
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that the universe that </v>

214
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.761
<v Speaker 2>people like Dorkins and Harris inhabit </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so intensely conditioned by </v>

215
00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 2>mythological presuppositions that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>take for granted.</v>

216
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.600
<v Speaker 2>The ethic that emerges out of that as if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a given,</v>

217
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 2>a rational given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this of course precisely niches,</v>

218
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:04.780
<v Speaker 2>observation as well as Dostoevsky's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's snitches observation.</v>

219
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ethic that you think is normative is</v>

220
00:14:09.071 --> 00:14:14.071
<v Speaker 2>a consequence of its of its of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>nesting inside this tremendously lengthy</v>

221
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:19.381
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of which was expressed in </v>

222
00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:19.840
<v Speaker 2>mythological formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wipe that out.</v>

223
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.870
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to keep all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions and just assume that </v>

224
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.711
<v Speaker 2>they're rationally axiomatic there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rational to make a rational </v>

225
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:33.721
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to start within an initial </v>

226
00:14:33.721 --> 00:14:36.240
<v Speaker 2>proposition while the proposition that </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlies western culture is that </v>

227
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.221
<v Speaker 2>there's a transcendent morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say that's a transcendent </v>

228
00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:42.700
<v Speaker 2>morality instantiated in the figure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

229
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.790
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could even call that a </v>

230
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.790
<v Speaker 2>personification of the morality if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>

231
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want to move into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical space.</v>

232
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not arguing for the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

233
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:57.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm arguing that the ethic that drives </v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture is predicated on the idea of</v>

234
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:05.240
<v Speaker 2>God and that you can't just take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea away and expect the thing to remain</v>

235
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>intact midair without any foundational </v>
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>

236
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Now you don't have to buy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're interested in the idea,</v>

237
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:16.541
<v Speaker 2>then you can read Nicha because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was trying to sort out and it </v>

238
00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 2>wasn't only nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came to that conclusion.</v>

239
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.970
<v Speaker 2>It was many people have come to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion,</v>

240
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:24.971
<v Speaker 2>but I think the two who've outlined it </v>
<v Speaker 2>most spectacularly were Nietzsche and </v>

241
00:15:24.971 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche is an unbelievably influential</v>

242
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:30.260
<v Speaker 2>philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

243
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there was anyone that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>more influential</v>

244
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.540
<v Speaker 2>during the entire course of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century accepting a very,</v>

245
00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:42.990
<v Speaker 2>very tiny handful of other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepting the scientists.</v>

246
00:15:42.991 --> 00:15:44.970
<v Speaker 2>We won't bother with their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their discussion.</v>

247
00:15:44.971 --> 00:15:49.971
<v Speaker 2>You could put marks in that category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could put Freud in that category </v>

248
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:53.421
<v Speaker 2>partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after that the list starts to get a </v>

249
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:53.421
<v Speaker 2>lot thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:57.780
<v Speaker 2>so maybe there's 10 people up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now level and Dostoevsky of course.</v>

251
00:15:57.781 --> 00:16:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever,</v>

252
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 2>if anybody ever prepares a list of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top 10 greatest literary figures in the </v>

253
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.890
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would be in the top 10 list and now I</v>

254
00:16:07.891 --> 00:16:12.891
<v Speaker 2>think he's perhaps second to Shakespeare</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe above Shakespeare in my </v>

255
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:17.181
<v Speaker 2>estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these aren't trivial people we're </v>

256
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:18.090
<v Speaker 2>talking about and they weren't dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with trivial issues.</v>

257
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then the question might be what's at </v>

258
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.420
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the idea of a transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 2>value?</v>

259
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.330
<v Speaker 2>And I want to want to approach that</v>

260
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.620
<v Speaker 2>staying out of the metaphysical domain </v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as possible because you can </v>

261
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.301
<v Speaker 2>claim anything you want from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical perspective and that's a </v>

262
00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:42.310
<v Speaker 2>big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people will say,</v>

263
00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:44.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why come up with a hypothesis of God?</v>

264
00:16:44.681 --> 00:16:46.630
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God can be anything.</v>

265
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:49.900
<v Speaker 2>There's a satire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Flying Spaghetti Monster,</v>

266
00:16:49.901 --> 00:16:54.901
<v Speaker 2>right is classic satirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of a deity that the </v>

267
00:16:54.901 --> 00:16:57.310
<v Speaker 2>atheist types used to buttress their </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments and fair enough,</v>

268
00:16:57.311 --> 00:16:59.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a satirical idea,</v>

269
00:16:59.021 --> 00:17:04.021
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty damn funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's things about this that </v>

270
00:17:04.021 --> 00:17:07.261
<v Speaker 2>aren't the least bit of music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's not amusing as </v>

271
00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:07.540
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if anything,</v>

272
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.330
<v Speaker 2>is our culture predicated on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

273
00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:11.530
<v Speaker 2>so what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

274
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche and Dostoevsky put this forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this set of propositions and out of </v>

275
00:17:16.901 --> 00:17:21.901
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky's line of thinking to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree grew Solzhenitsyn soldier units </v>

276
00:17:21.901 --> 00:17:26.440
<v Speaker 2>and documented the absolute horrors of </v>
<v Speaker 2>equity predicated Soviet society.</v>

277
00:17:26.441 --> 00:17:27.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't teach,</v>

278
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.720
<v Speaker 2>we don't learn about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Write this I don't understand,</v>

279
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.200
<v Speaker 2>is that what happened in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century on the radical left end of the </v>

280
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.130
<v Speaker 2>spectrum is not well documented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Students don't learn about it.</v>

281
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Why the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We learned about World War Two.</v>

282
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.660
<v Speaker 2>We learned about what happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust.</v>

283
00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:45.430
<v Speaker 2>And Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we absolutely should,</v>

284
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.850
<v Speaker 2>but nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mystery to everyone.</v>

285
00:17:48.851 --> 00:17:51.420
<v Speaker 2>When I talk about what happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union,</v>

286
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:56.421
<v Speaker 2>and that's absolutely appalling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's to say nothing about what </v>

287
00:17:56.421 --> 00:17:56.850
<v Speaker 2>happened in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was equally horrible.</v>

288
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.150
<v Speaker 2>The system didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was predicated on the wrong values.</v>

289
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Unless you think that that sort of thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>means worked,</v>

290
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to define that as well,</v>

291
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.360
<v Speaker 2>but it collapsed under its own weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>after it killed tens of millions of </v>

292
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:16.360
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't really end.</v>

293
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Still Rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like Russia has recovered.</v>

294
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to me like that's a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>good definition of worked.</v>

295
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Now whatever we're doing in the West </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to work for all of its flaws and </v>

296
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.250
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we just deceiving ourselves?</v>

297
00:18:28.251 --> 00:18:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Is it just arbitrary power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and opinion,</v>

298
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:32.660
<v Speaker 2>or is there something at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

299
00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.930
<v Speaker 2>So when Solzhenitsyn wrote the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 2>archipelago,</v>

300
00:18:40.931 --> 00:18:45.931
<v Speaker 2>he believed that the Russians would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to return to Orthodox Christianity to </v>

301
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:49.051
<v Speaker 2>find their pathway forward and that's of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course has made him into a reactionary </v>

302
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:51.520
<v Speaker 2>in the eyes of many of his critics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is perhaps what is happening in</v>

303
00:18:51.521 --> 00:18:56.521
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it's very difficult to tell </v>

304
00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:58.261
<v Speaker 2>because Putin also seems to be using his</v>
<v Speaker 2>affiliation with the Orthodox Christian </v>

305
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Church as as it means to consolidate </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

306
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:05.670
<v Speaker 2>so the situation in Russia is unclear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a religious revival if that's </v>

307
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.000
<v Speaker 2>happening in Russia and perhaps it </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>

308
00:19:07.001 --> 00:19:12.001
<v Speaker 2>but if it is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something that unfolds over decades </v>

309
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:14.671
<v Speaker 2>and even centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not an easy thing to evaluate </v>

310
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:14.671
<v Speaker 2>when it first starts to happen,</v>

311
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.470
<v Speaker 2>but Solzhenitsyn drew the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions that dos Dsq did </v>

312
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:22.110
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not not in exactly the same way,</v>

313
00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 2>but very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very close.</v>

314
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believed as far as I could tell,</v>

315
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:30.141
<v Speaker 2>that unless people were willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adhere to some sort of transcendent </v>

316
00:19:30.141 --> 00:19:34.211
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had no protection against </v>

317
00:19:34.211 --> 00:19:36.800
<v Speaker 2>pathological ideologies and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>protection against the murderous </v>

318
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.951
<v Speaker 2>impulses that came along with them and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>found his work at unbelievably.</v>

319
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I found his right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible,</v>

320
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.500
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>

321
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you can read that book </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not draw that kind of conclusion.</v>

322
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.340
<v Speaker 2>I think people who criticized soldier </v>
<v Speaker 2>nets and have never read the damn book </v>

323
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.001
<v Speaker 2>because that book is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like going into the ring with </v>

324
00:19:56.001 --> 00:19:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed Ali and being pummeled to death</v>
<v Speaker 2>for half an hour,</v>

325
00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't recover from it that easily.</v>

326
00:19:59.250 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

327
00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.810
<v Speaker 2>then young branched off of nature and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>niches.</v>

328
00:20:07.811 --> 00:20:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Idea was that people would have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create their own values roughly speaking</v>

329
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's where niches is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We is his weakest because it isn't </v>

330
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.971
<v Speaker 2>obvious to me that people can create </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own values and I think he fell </v>

331
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:25.411
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a casual critic of </v>

332
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:27.460
<v Speaker 2>nature because that's always dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>given that he probably had an Iq of 260.</v>

333
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

334
00:20:28.421 --> 00:20:30.380
<v Speaker 2>he was way the hell out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stratosphere.</v>

335
00:20:30.381 --> 00:20:32.020
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think you've understood what he</v>

336
00:20:32.021 --> 00:20:37.021
<v Speaker 2>was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be bloody well sure that you </v>

337
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:37.021
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does seem to me.</v>

338
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:39.100
<v Speaker 2>And he was running out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died young and he was trying to solve</v>

339
00:20:39.101 --> 00:20:44.101
<v Speaker 2>this problem in a rush I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he hypothesized that people would </v>

340
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:48.601
<v Speaker 2>have to become Superman overmanned </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly in order to deal with the death </v>

341
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 2>of God.</v>

342
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.360
<v Speaker 2>And that idea sort of branched off into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi propaganda because that's in some </v>

343
00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.591
<v Speaker 2>sense with the Nazis were trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their promotion of the of the </v>

344
00:20:58.591 --> 00:20:59.210
<v Speaker 2>perfect area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a mist,</v>

345
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a misappropriation of nature in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimation.</v>

346
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 2>And it was partly because his sister who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a perverse creature,</v>

347
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say,</v>

348
00:21:09.881 --> 00:21:14.881
<v Speaker 2>doctored his work in such a way so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more easily appropriated by the </v>

349
00:21:14.881 --> 00:21:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is some danger in what he said</v>

350
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:19.390
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the question is,</v>

351
00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:24.391
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to transform yourself </v>

352
00:21:24.391 --> 00:21:24.391
<v Speaker 2>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the giver of values,</v>

353
00:21:24.391 --> 00:21:28.860
<v Speaker 2>what stops you from inflating yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>into something like a demigod and just </v>

354
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 2>pronouncing what the values are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

355
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:36.510
<v Speaker 2>So that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what you're going to replace </v>

356
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:41.550
<v Speaker 2>tradition with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

357
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.460
<v Speaker 2>there's dangers in that because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to keep you humble.</v>

358
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.620
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most appropriate objection.</v>

359
00:21:48.621 --> 00:21:53.621
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to keep you humble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those things can spiral out of </v>

360
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:54.900
<v Speaker 2>control very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did say in the case of Hitler,</v>

361
00:21:54.901 --> 00:21:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's easy to blame what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Germany on Hitler,</v>

362
00:21:57.591 --> 00:22:02.591
<v Speaker 2>but that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big mistake because it was a </v>

363
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:02.591
<v Speaker 2>dialogue between Hitler and the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

364
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler didn't create himself.</v>

365
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.100
<v Speaker 2>It was cocreation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said things.</v>

366
00:22:07.101 --> 00:22:09.620
<v Speaker 2>People listened and told him back what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

367
00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:14.621
<v Speaker 2>and then he said them and they listened </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they told them back what to say and </v>

368
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:17.810
<v Speaker 2>it looped until he was the mouthpiece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their darkest desires.</v>

369
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a game he was willing to play,</v>

370
00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:25.520
<v Speaker 2>but you can't think about that as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't like Hitler created Nazi Germany,</v>

371
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Hitler and the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocreated,</v>

372
00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

373
00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:34.781
<v Speaker 2>when a leader gives our articulation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the imagination of the population,</v>

374
00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.900
<v Speaker 2>that's what a leader does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know you could say that,</v>

375
00:22:38.901 --> 00:22:39.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler,</v>

376
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.860
<v Speaker 2>maybe Hitler filtered what the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 2>were telling him through a particular </v>

377
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.060
<v Speaker 2>lens because he had no shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment and desire for revenge in his</v>

378
00:22:47.061 --> 00:22:48.200
<v Speaker 2>own heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

379
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.560
<v Speaker 2>it's not like his life was a spectacular</v>
<v Speaker 2>success be before he became a political </v>

380
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.540
<v Speaker 2>activist and he was brutalized very </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly in world war one and he didn't get</v>

381
00:22:58.541 --> 00:23:03.541
<v Speaker 2>to pursue his primary dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was to be an art student in </v>

382
00:23:03.541 --> 00:23:07.561
<v Speaker 2>Vienna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had applied three times and got </v>

383
00:23:07.561 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 2>rejected all three times and so it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter about that.</v>

384
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.660
<v Speaker 2>He was basically living on the streets </v>
<v Speaker 2>after World War One.</v>

385
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.040
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the world's happiest person </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure he carried a fair bit of </v>

386
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.501
<v Speaker 2>resentment in his heart when he was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trenches in world war war one at in </v>

387
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.540
<v Speaker 2>one experience that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of his friends were killed by a </v>

388
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 2>mortar when he had wandered off to go do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

389
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.870
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to even imagine what something</v>

390
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:33.871
<v Speaker 2>like that would do to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you when you're the only </v>

391
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:36.691
<v Speaker 2>survivor out of 20 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also going to give you an </v>

392
00:23:36.691 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 2>enhanced sense of your own specialness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the alternative is just to think</v>

393
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:42.640
<v Speaker 2>about how God damn arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe really is so,</v>

394
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

395
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Studied nature in in great detail and he</v>

396
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:54.581
<v Speaker 2>was particularly interested because </v>
<v Speaker 2>young had his finger on the central </v>

397
00:23:54.581 --> 00:23:55.950
<v Speaker 2>problems all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

398
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Because he was a great psychologist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was listening to what people said and</v>

399
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.660
<v Speaker 2>he was an a staggering genius as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so like Nietzsche or Dostoevsky or </v>

400
00:24:04.731 --> 00:24:07.820
<v Speaker 2>social nets and he was that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>prophetic type I would say,</v>

401
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.390
<v Speaker 2>and he understood as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps what was wrong with niches </v>

402
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:18.731
<v Speaker 2>formulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that people could only create </v>

403
00:24:18.731 --> 00:24:21.341
<v Speaker 2>their new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own values and that's what would </v>

404
00:24:21.341 --> 00:24:24.040
<v Speaker 2>replace the lacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Found the foundation that was now </v>

405
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.830
<v Speaker 2>lacking under Western civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

406
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:30.610
<v Speaker 2>And he came to his conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say through Freud because Freud </v>

407
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.830
<v Speaker 2>started analyzing parts of the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive process and content that </v>

408
00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:41.180
<v Speaker 2>people hadn't attended to before in any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any great detail.</v>

409
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.950
<v Speaker 2>And that was primarily dreams.</v>

410
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:48.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of dream analysis I suppose is </v>

411
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.831
<v Speaker 2>one of Freud's perhaps Freud's major </v>
<v Speaker 2>contribution to modern western thought.</v>

412
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:56.590
<v Speaker 2>The idea was there was something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams and I suppose what I did is said,</v>

413
00:24:56.721 --> 00:24:57.200
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

414
00:24:57.201 --> 00:25:02.201
<v Speaker 2>isn't it strange we have this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>other form of thought that we engage in </v>

415
00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:07.000
<v Speaker 2>at night and it speaks in the language </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we don't really understand and so </v>

416
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.550
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>

417
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:15.551
<v Speaker 2>and many modern people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams are of no significance or even </v>

418
00:25:15.551 --> 00:25:17.120
<v Speaker 2>that they're random processes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an absurd proposition obviously</v>

419
00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:19.310
<v Speaker 2>because they're by Terrell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are,</v>

420
00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:21.860
<v Speaker 2>they're obviously not random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

421
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:27.740
<v Speaker 2>So Freud's idea was that there was some </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in dreams that was </v>

422
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 2>informative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's his.</v>

423
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Now he had a method for describe for </v>
<v Speaker 2>extracting out from the dream what the </v>

424
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:39.570
<v Speaker 2>dream purported to represent and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>outlined that great deal of detail in </v>

425
00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:43.580
<v Speaker 2>the interpretation of dreams and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to read one book by Freud,</v>

426
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I would highly recommend that one.</v>

427
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a very long book and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed,</v>

428
00:25:46.791 --> 00:25:51.791
<v Speaker 2>but Freud does it extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive analysis of the way that </v>

429
00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:55.601
<v Speaker 2>dreams work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he made the because because he had </v>

430
00:25:55.601 --> 00:25:59.321
<v Speaker 2>brought a theoretical framework to bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>even on his investigation into dream </v>

431
00:25:59.321 --> 00:26:04.211
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He concluded that dreams were </v>

432
00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:06.821
<v Speaker 2>essentially wish fulfillments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where young and Freud </v>

433
00:26:06.821 --> 00:26:11.350
<v Speaker 2>disagreed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also believed that the primary </v>

434
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.230
<v Speaker 2>motivating factor of human beings with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual,</v>

435
00:26:12.231 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Speaker 2>and now that's a tougher one to toss </v>
<v Speaker 2>aside because even if you're a Darwinian</v>

436
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.660
<v Speaker 2>rather than a Freud Ian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to obviously support the </v>

437
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.711
<v Speaker 2>proposition that sexual motivation among</v>
<v Speaker 2>any living creature is going to be one </v>

438
00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:31.511
<v Speaker 2>of the highest order motivations because</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise creatures don't reproduce and </v>

439
00:26:31.511 --> 00:26:33.620
<v Speaker 2>prevail over the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

440
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>is that is that the ultimate source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation?</v>

441
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:39.410
<v Speaker 2>And in some sense the answer to that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be yes.</v>

442
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud wanted to make that in some ways </v>

443
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:44.920
<v Speaker 2>the sole source motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm oversimplifying,</v>

444
00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I hate to do that in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud because he was not as simple </v>

445
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.540
<v Speaker 2>minded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Character young had a dream once,</v>

446
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:56.541
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Freud and jung were excavating a </v>

447
00:26:56.851 --> 00:27:01.851
<v Speaker 2>basement and so freud had outlined in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud had already discovered the </v>

448
00:27:01.851 --> 00:27:01.851
<v Speaker 2>basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

449
00:27:01.851 --> 00:27:06.801
<v Speaker 2>So that would be the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of the psyche and young broke </v>

450
00:27:06.801 --> 00:27:08.880
<v Speaker 2>through into another basement that was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>multi chambered place.</v>

451
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 2>So many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

452
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:14.901
<v Speaker 2>many rooms and I suppose what drove </v>
<v Speaker 2>young and freud apart was the </v>

453
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 2>proposition that there was a hell of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot more going down,</v>

454
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:23.060
<v Speaker 2>going on down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then had already met the eye and they </v>

455
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 2>broke on the idea that the sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulse was primary.</v>

456
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they broke when you wrote a book called </v>

457
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.110
<v Speaker 2>symbols of transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually.</v>

458
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.440
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's three books that I know of that </v>

459
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 2>are sort of like maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is symbols of transformation.</v>

460
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 2>One is a book by Eric Norman called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>origins and history of consciousness</v>

461
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.570
<v Speaker 2>and the third and the third one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while his maps of meaning,</v>

462
00:27:44.571 --> 00:27:46.550
<v Speaker 2>they're the same book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just like,</v>

463
00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:49.550
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to solve the same problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>from three different directions.</v>

464
00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.160
<v Speaker 2>They're all attempts to address the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

465
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.760
<v Speaker 2>And so symbols of transformation was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book that you wrote about the fantasies </v>

466
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.470
<v Speaker 2>of a schizophrenia American woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was.</v>

467
00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:05.270
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to relate her fantasies to</v>
<v Speaker 2>these old mythological ideas and young's</v>

468
00:28:05.271 --> 00:28:10.271
<v Speaker 2>idea essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is an idea that was shared by </v>

469
00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:11.320
<v Speaker 2>people like piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were not going to say that you and</v>

470
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:15.830
<v Speaker 2>I just pulled this idea out of the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that the,</v>

471
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:21.190
<v Speaker 2>the birthplace of mythic mythology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature for that matter was the dream</v>

472
00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.600
<v Speaker 2>that they share structural that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>share,</v>

473
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:32.690
<v Speaker 2>they share,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they share what mode of information </v>

474
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:37.600
<v Speaker 2>presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a relatively radical </v>

475
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:37.600
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

476
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:47.880
<v Speaker 2>but given that they both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they both represent</v>

477
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:49.730
<v Speaker 3>hm</v>

478
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 2>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams and mythological representations </v>

479
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.561
<v Speaker 2>share and essentially narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and they use their literary </v>

480
00:28:58.561 --> 00:28:58.561
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

481
00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not so unreasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice that a dream at night is like the</v>

482
00:29:02.141 --> 00:29:07.141
<v Speaker 2>movie that you play in your head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not unreasonable to note as well </v>

483
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:11.461
<v Speaker 2>that the dreams that you have at night </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear a relationship to the daydreams </v>

484
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:12.790
<v Speaker 2>that you have during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a form of cognition.</v>

485
00:29:12.791 --> 00:29:15.130
<v Speaker 2>It seems like an involuntary form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognition.</v>

486
00:29:15.131 --> 00:29:16.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a very strange thing.</v>

487
00:29:16.511 --> 00:29:18.880
<v Speaker 2>So young thought about the dream as </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

488
00:29:18.881 --> 00:29:21.760
<v Speaker 2>speaking of its own accord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

489
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.440
<v Speaker 2>And so his idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

490
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.180
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you sleep,</v>

491
00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:27.160
<v Speaker 2>you dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the dream happens to you.</v>

492
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that you create the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that you don't even think about </v>

493
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:32.520
<v Speaker 2>creating it because I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

494
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.970
<v Speaker 2>what are you thinking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll say,</v>

495
00:29:33.971 --> 00:29:38.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about whatever it is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll take credit in some sense for </v>

496
00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:40.720
<v Speaker 2>thinking that because it seems like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary activity,</v>

497
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.970
<v Speaker 2>but what happens at night is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

498
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:47.971
<v Speaker 2>but you think in voluntarily and so what</v>
<v Speaker 2>would say is that means that something </v>

499
00:29:47.971 --> 00:29:52.201
<v Speaker 2>is thinking in you and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly reasonable way of looking at </v>

500
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:56.350
<v Speaker 2>it and this is one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncanny about the cycle analysts as they</v>

501
00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>were willing to take their observations </v>
<v Speaker 2>to their logical conclusion.</v>

502
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.180
<v Speaker 2>There are things that think in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are those things and what are they </v>

503
00:30:06.791 --> 00:30:10.720
<v Speaker 2>thinking and why are they thinking it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

504
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 2>if you do dream analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a tricky thing because who's</v>

505
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:18.010
<v Speaker 2>to say if your damn analysis is correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

506
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:20.340
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>

507
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:25.370
<v Speaker 2>If you do dream analysis with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you generally have them lay out their </v>

508
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.910
<v Speaker 2>dream and then you ask them when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going through their dream a second time,</v>

509
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.030
<v Speaker 2>they lay out their dream and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of get a picture of it,</v>

510
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.750
<v Speaker 2>and then they lay out their dream a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second time and as they go through it,</v>

511
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.450
<v Speaker 2>every time they mentioned a detail or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

512
00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:42.451
<v Speaker 2>you ask them what that reminds them of </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the hypothesis is that the dream is </v>

513
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:48.241
<v Speaker 2>presenting an image or an idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with a network of ideas and </v>

514
00:30:48.241 --> 00:30:51.220
<v Speaker 2>then if you can expand on the network of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas as you go through the dream,</v>

515
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.990
<v Speaker 2>you can elaborate on the dream.</v>

516
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.400
<v Speaker 2>You can expand it upwards and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to see what it might be attempting</v>

517
00:30:57.401 --> 00:30:59.500
<v Speaker 2>to put forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

518
00:30:59.501 --> 00:31:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Freud's idea was that the dream knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was doing,</v>

519
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:07.590
<v Speaker 2>but that its content was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppressed and oppressed by an internal </v>

520
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.100
<v Speaker 2>sensor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the dream had to be sneaky about what</v>

521
00:31:09.101 --> 00:31:13.060
<v Speaker 2>it was saying because it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver a message that the person didn't</v>

522
00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:18.061
<v Speaker 2>want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that was tied up with his idea of </v>

523
00:31:18.061 --> 00:31:19.360
<v Speaker 2>repression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not young's idea.</v>

524
00:31:19.361 --> 00:31:20.920
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young's idea was different.</v>

525
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:21.970
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

526
00:31:21.971 --> 00:31:26.971
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dream is trying to tell you what </v>

527
00:31:26.971 --> 00:31:26.971
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to tell you as clear as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

528
00:31:26.971 --> 00:31:31.120
<v Speaker 2>That's just the best it can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you could think of the dream,</v>

529
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.640
<v Speaker 2>and this is I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right way to think about it.</v>

530
00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:38.641
<v Speaker 2>The dream is the birthplace of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same way that artists are the </v>

531
00:31:38.641 --> 00:31:38.641
<v Speaker 2>birthplace of culture.</v>

532
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.860
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that your mind is groping outward </v>

533
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.030
<v Speaker 2>to try to comprehend what it has not yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehended and it does that first by </v>

534
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:52.920
<v Speaker 2>trying to map it on to image and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that in the dream and it's </v>

535
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.690
<v Speaker 2>somewhat incoherent and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>

536
00:31:55.691 --> 00:31:59.350
<v Speaker 2>let's stick within coherent because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not yet a full fledge thought.</v>

537
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It's the birthplace of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fantasy about what might be,</v>

538
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:09.130
<v Speaker 2>and then if you can grip the fantasy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>share it with other people,</v>

539
00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:14.131
<v Speaker 2>then maybe they can elaborate upon it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bring it into being with more </v>

540
00:32:14.131 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 2>clarity than it would be if it merely </v>
<v Speaker 2>existed.</v>

541
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:20.690
<v Speaker 2>As the precursor of a thought in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination now cause you anxiety,</v>

542
00:32:20.691 --> 00:32:23.860
<v Speaker 2>idea two was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you think in words,</v>

543
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.920
<v Speaker 2>where the hell do those thoughts come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from while they just spring into my </v>

544
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 2>head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While that's not much of an answer,</v>

545
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.180
<v Speaker 2>they just what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pop out of the void.</v>

546
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Is there some sort of precursor to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of the ideas?</v>

547
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Is there a developmental pathway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's an image.</v>

548
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:38.770
<v Speaker 2>This is the Buddha.</v>

549
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.040
<v Speaker 4>There's calm water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lotus.</v>

550
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.560
<v Speaker 4>The roots go all the way down to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom of the lake.</v>

551
00:32:45.561 --> 00:32:50.561
<v Speaker 4>It's dark down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The roots are embedded in the dark </v>

552
00:32:50.561 --> 00:32:54.041
<v Speaker 4>substrata at the bottom of the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The plant moves upwards towards the </v>

553
00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 4>light that the water gets lighter and </v>
<v Speaker 4>lighter.</v>

554
00:32:55.611 --> 00:33:00.611
<v Speaker 4>As you move upward with the root,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the flower manifests itself on the </v>

555
00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:03.200
<v Speaker 4>surface and the Buddha sits in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle.</v>

556
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 4>That's an image about how ideas develop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They come out from the bottom of reality</v>

557
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:13.031
<v Speaker 4>and they push themselves up towards the </v>
<v Speaker 4>light and they blast forward and </v>

558
00:33:13.031 --> 00:33:16.190
<v Speaker 4>something emerges as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what that image means and it's an</v>

559
00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:21.191
<v Speaker 4>image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Golden Buddha that's sitting in the </v>

560
00:33:21.191 --> 00:33:21.191
<v Speaker 4>middle of the Lotus is an image of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect person.</v>

561
00:33:21.191 --> 00:33:25.871
<v Speaker 4>You could think about the gold Buddha </v>
<v Speaker 4>who sits in a triangle as exactly the </v>

562
00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:26.870
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the eye on the top of the pyramid</v>

563
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:32.110
<v Speaker 4>is they're all the same ideas and what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that's trying to burst forward </v>

564
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.650
<v Speaker 4>how to be in the world?</v>

565
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:38.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what other idea would burst forward </v>

566
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.950
<v Speaker 4>because it's the only problem that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>really have,</v>

567
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:43.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How should you manifest yourself </v>

568
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.270
<v Speaker 4>properly in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's everyone's question.</v>

569
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.280
<v Speaker 4>It's the ultimate question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been the ultimate question since </v>

570
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.500
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of time and we'd been </v>
<v Speaker 4>working out that idea forever,</v>

571
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:56.530
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>merely by acting it out and then by </v>

572
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.561
<v Speaker 4>representing the actions and then by </v>
<v Speaker 4>representing the representations and </v>

573
00:33:59.561 --> 00:34:04.000
<v Speaker 4>spiraling all that together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I started looking developmentally.</v>

574
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.150
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

575
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:10.390
<v Speaker 4>maybe these idea have roots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this was partly predicated on the </v>

576
00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:14.651
<v Speaker 4>observation from Dostoevsky and niches </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so forth that there did seem to be a</v>

577
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:18.620
<v Speaker 4>necessary pattern in moral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in morality.</v>

578
00:34:18.621 --> 00:34:21.800
<v Speaker 4>Did it seem to be unnecessary pattern?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't arbitrary.</v>

579
00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:26.801
<v Speaker 4>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a representation of the specific </v>

580
00:34:26.801 --> 00:34:30.161
<v Speaker 4>mode of human beings and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's just imposed on you by </v>

581
00:34:30.161 --> 00:34:31.250
<v Speaker 4>your culture's not something that's just</v>
<v Speaker 4>learned,</v>

582
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:36.550
<v Speaker 4>it's intrinsic in you and it's manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the culture at the same time and </v>

583
00:34:36.561 --> 00:34:40.250
<v Speaker 4>there's a dial and and and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dialogue between those two things.</v>

584
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.060
<v Speaker 4>Culture and nature were both with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas embedded,</v>

585
00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:45.410
<v Speaker 4>trying to make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make,</v>

586
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:50.750
<v Speaker 4>make the proper articulation of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>spring forward in each individual,</v>

587
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.960
<v Speaker 4>and that's only to say these aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these aren't radical propositions.</v>

588
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.430
<v Speaker 4>Your nature strive so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest yourself properly in the world.</v>

589
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.580
<v Speaker 4>Culture strives to aid you in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>endeavor.</v>

590
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there something about that?</v>

591
00:35:06.921 --> 00:35:07.660
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

592
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.970
<v Speaker 4>that's dubious validity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What else would it be doing?</v>

593
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 4>Working for your death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hardly working for your destruction.</v>

594
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.260
<v Speaker 4>While you could see that maybe when </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture becomes pathologized,</v>

595
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:23.280
<v Speaker 4>but to the degree that it's able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>maintain itself across long periods of </v>

596
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.160
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it obviously has to be striving in some </v>

597
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.771
<v Speaker 4>way for the man of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for your individual manifestation so </v>

598
00:35:29.771 --> 00:35:31.040
<v Speaker 4>that you can survive and flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a,</v>

599
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.100
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a co creation of the human being</v>

600
00:35:34.101 --> 00:35:39.101
<v Speaker 4>going on through nature and through </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture and while and then perhaps with </v>

601
00:35:39.101 --> 00:35:43.881
<v Speaker 4>your own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with your own voluntary will </v>

602
00:35:43.881 --> 00:35:45.730
<v Speaker 4>participating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the hell that is,</v>

603
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:50.790
<v Speaker 4>something we don't understand at all and</v>
<v Speaker 4>are and are prone to dismiss because of </v>

604
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.860
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

605
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:59.050
<v Speaker 4>So then I learned about piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Piaget had some very interesting ideas </v>

606
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.560
<v Speaker 4>and I think I've told you already what </v>
<v Speaker 4>piaget was up to.</v>

607
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:06.100
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't a developmental psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't even regard himself as a </v>

608
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.071
<v Speaker 4>psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to reconcile science and </v>

609
00:36:09.071 --> 00:36:12.761
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he was doing through his </v>

610
00:36:12.761 --> 00:36:14.651
<v Speaker 4>entire bloody life because it drove him </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy when he was an adolescent and he </v>

611
00:36:14.811 --> 00:36:19.811
<v Speaker 4>didn't think that he would be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>survive unless he could bring those two </v>

612
00:36:19.811 --> 00:36:20.900
<v Speaker 4>things together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's working on the same problem.</v>

613
00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:26.000
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things that piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was very prone to observation,</v>

614
00:36:26.001 --> 00:36:30.320
<v Speaker 4>he was an ecologist of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

615
00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:35.321
<v Speaker 4>And ecologist as a scientist who studies</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals by watching their behavior </v>

616
00:36:35.321 --> 00:36:36.650
<v Speaker 4>rather than studying them under </v>
<v Speaker 4>laboratory conditions.</v>

617
00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.750
<v Speaker 4>And he got very interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>spontaneous emergence of morality in the</v>

618
00:36:41.751 --> 00:36:44.210
<v Speaker 4>play of children that was so smart.</v>

619
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.260
<v Speaker 4>They're so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That idea that you know when kids come </v>

620
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.690
<v Speaker 4>together and unify themselves towards a </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular goal,</v>

621
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:55.340
<v Speaker 4>so in play that are morality emerges out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that and that that morality,</v>

622
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 4>and I've mentioned this before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a morality in game one there.</v>

623
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.270
<v Speaker 4>There's a morality in game two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a morality in game three.</v>

624
00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.870
<v Speaker 4>What's common across all those </v>
<v Speaker 4>morality's as a matter of morality.</v>

625
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:11.410
<v Speaker 4>And so the matter morality emerges from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the particular morality's that are </v>

626
00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.010
<v Speaker 4>embedded in particular cooperative </v>
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>

627
00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.530
<v Speaker 4>We could say cooperative and competitive</v>
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>

628
00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:20.830
<v Speaker 4>You can expand that out to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can expand that out biologically to </v>

629
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:21.740
<v Speaker 4>some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the idea of the dominance hierarchy,</v>

630
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:27.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every social animal and even many </v>

631
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.760
<v Speaker 4>animals who aren't social are embedded </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a dominance hierarchy.</v>

632
00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:34.180
<v Speaker 4>The dominant Turkey has a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We couldn't call it a dominance </v>

633
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:34.180
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dominance hierarchy,</v>

634
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:34.850
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>b,</v>

635
00:37:34.851 --> 00:37:35.810
<v Speaker 4>c,</v>
<v Speaker 4>d,</v>

636
00:37:35.811 --> 00:37:40.811
<v Speaker 4>e,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of them across thousands of </v>

637
00:37:40.811 --> 00:37:43.600
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You extract out from all of them what </v>

638
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.170
<v Speaker 4>central to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the pyramid of value.</v>

639
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.580
<v Speaker 4>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the question?</v>

640
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.640
<v Speaker 4>What question do you need answered about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Pyramid of value?</v>

641
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.290
<v Speaker 4>What's at the top</v>

642
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:53.300
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the ideal.</v>

643
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the top of the pyramid are the Golden</v>

644
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the Lotus,</v>

645
00:37:57.651 --> 00:38:00.350
<v Speaker 4>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing as the crucifix,</v>

646
00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.200
<v Speaker 4>paradoxically enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that has to do.</v>

647
00:38:03.201 --> 00:38:08.201
<v Speaker 4>It has to do with something like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>voluntary acceptance and therefore </v>

648
00:38:08.201 --> 00:38:10.280
<v Speaker 4>transcendence of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>

649
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.630
<v Speaker 4>These are not arbitrary ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're deeply.</v>

650
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:16.940
<v Speaker 4>That's my case anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're deeply,</v>

651
00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:20.750
<v Speaker 4>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply rooted in biology and culture.</v>

652
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:26.130
<v Speaker 4>They're there as deeply rooted in </v>
<v Speaker 4>biology as the dominance hierarchy is </v>

653
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.590
<v Speaker 4>rooted in biology and we already know </v>
<v Speaker 4>the answer to that.</v>

654
00:38:27.591 --> 00:38:31.610
<v Speaker 4>The dominance hierarchy is been around </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 350 million years.</v>

655
00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 4>It's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to just brush off and say,</v>

656
00:38:36.551 --> 00:38:37.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>morality,</v>

657
00:38:37.241 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 4>some sort of second order cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

658
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:41.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

659
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:43.120
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>

660
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you something about its </v>
<v Speaker 4>instantiation in your nervous system.</v>

661
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:51.810
<v Speaker 4>You have a counter at the bottom of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain that keeps track of where you are </v>

662
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:56.280
<v Speaker 4>in terms of your status and it bloody </v>
<v Speaker 4>well regulates the sensitivity of your </v>

663
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:56.280
<v Speaker 4>emotions.</v>

664
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.030
<v Speaker 4>So if you're at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy,</v>

665
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:03.031
<v Speaker 4>barely clinging onto the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything overwhelms you and that's </v>

666
00:39:03.031 --> 00:39:05.710
<v Speaker 4>because you're damn near dead and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything should overwhelm you.</v>

667
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 4>You've got no extra resources anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Threat,</v>

668
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:13.890
<v Speaker 4>you're sunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you become extremely sensitive to </v>

669
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.251
<v Speaker 4>negative emotion and maybe also </v>
<v Speaker 4>impulsive so that you grab well the </v>

670
00:39:17.251 --> 00:39:20.990
<v Speaker 4>grabbing is good and if you're near the </v>
<v Speaker 4>top in the dominance hierarchy and your </v>

671
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.140
<v Speaker 4>counter tells you that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your serotonin levels go up.</v>

672
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.530
<v Speaker 4>Your less sensitive to negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're less impulsive.</v>

673
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.890
<v Speaker 4>You live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everything works in your favor.</v>

674
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:34.891
<v Speaker 4>Your immune system functions better and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're oriented at least to some degree </v>

675
00:39:34.891 --> 00:39:38.521
<v Speaker 4>towards the medium and longterm future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can afford that because all hell</v>

676
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 4>is breaking loose around you all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

677
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.800
<v Speaker 4>And so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a way of being that increases </v>

678
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.760
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>move up dominance hierarchies?</v>

679
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:54.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't seem to be particularly </v>

680
00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.341
<v Speaker 4>provocative proposition unless you think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's completely arbitrary and </v>

681
00:39:56.341 --> 00:40:00.811
<v Speaker 4>random and that you can think that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want,</v>

682
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:03.160
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think there's any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that whatsoever.</v>

683
00:40:03.161 --> 00:40:04.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we certainly have,</v>

684
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.810
<v Speaker 4>even for sexual selection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we impose criteria.</v>

685
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 4>They're not ram random and arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

686
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.140
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so back to young.</v>

687
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.050
<v Speaker 4>So what was young trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

688
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:23.550
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see young believer that once we had </v>

689
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:26.080
<v Speaker 4>stopped populating the cosmos with gods </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they went inside.</v>

690
00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.300
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

691
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:29.620
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it this way.</v>

692
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:34.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>archaic person looks at the sky and uses</v>

693
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.230
<v Speaker 4>his imagination to populate the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's The sky?</v>

694
00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the constellations.</v>

695
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:44.890
<v Speaker 4>It's the domain of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

696
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:45.610
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

697
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 4>because the gods are what are be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are out there beyond your understanding.</v>

698
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:51.520
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what you see when you look </v>
<v Speaker 4>up at the sky.</v>

699
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.660
<v Speaker 4>So you populate the night sky with </v>
<v Speaker 4>figures of your imagination.</v>

700
00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:01.020
<v Speaker 4>So the gods are the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>broadcast out of your imagination and </v>

701
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.921
<v Speaker 4>see spread over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the contents of your </v>

702
00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:08.791
<v Speaker 4>unconscious are manifesting themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you encounter the unknown exactly </v>

703
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:10.120
<v Speaker 4>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly how.</v>

704
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 4>How else could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

705
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:15.970
<v Speaker 4>You're projecting your fantasy onto what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand.</v>

706
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.670
<v Speaker 4>That's how you start to cope with what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand.</v>

707
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.150
<v Speaker 4>You populate the unknown with Daddy's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where did they come from?</v>

708
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 4>They came from your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

709
00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:26.590
<v Speaker 4>what happens when you take them out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world?</v>

710
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.570
<v Speaker 4>Do they disappear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

711
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.960
<v Speaker 4>they just go back into your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's where you dug down to find </v>

712
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:38.651
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the same motif as rescuing your </v>

713
00:41:38.651 --> 00:41:40.490
<v Speaker 4>dead father from the from or rescuing </v>
<v Speaker 4>your father from the belly of the whale.</v>

714
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:45.610
<v Speaker 4>It's the same idea is that the corpses </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the gods inhabit your imagination.</v>

715
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 4>So where do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you need to revivify them,</v>

716
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.280
<v Speaker 4>you go into your imagination and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what you did and this is no </v>

717
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.670
<v Speaker 4>secret.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you read Young,</v>

718
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:58.880
<v Speaker 4>he tells you that's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He tells you that's why he did it.</v>

719
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 4>It's not an interpretation on my part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then then the question is,</v>

720
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:09.131
<v Speaker 4>what's down there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it just massive catastrophe or is </v>

721
00:42:09.131 --> 00:42:13.391
<v Speaker 4>there something in it that's patterned </v>
<v Speaker 4>while young's proposition was that you </v>

722
00:42:14.211 --> 00:42:19.211
<v Speaker 4>read?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you really discover the great </v>

723
00:42:19.211 --> 00:42:21.310
<v Speaker 4>archetypes that guide human being by </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigating the structure of your </v>

724
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:25.781
<v Speaker 4>imagination?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you thought about the imagination </v>

725
00:42:25.781 --> 00:42:28.451
<v Speaker 4>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in part as a manifestation of </v>

726
00:42:28.451 --> 00:42:28.451
<v Speaker 4>your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of your biology?</v>

727
00:42:28.451 --> 00:42:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

728
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.220
<v Speaker 4>What else would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

729
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.140
<v Speaker 4>when I told you that story about my </v>
<v Speaker 4>nephew,</v>

730
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:38.141
<v Speaker 4>I believe right about him running around</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a night and then going off to have a </v>

731
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 4>combat with the doors and the dragons.</v>

732
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well where did that come from?</v>

733
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly it came from his culture,</v>

734
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:48.290
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he was at night and so obviously</v>

735
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:51.560
<v Speaker 4>that's a cultural construct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is is that his imagination</v>

736
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:56.150
<v Speaker 4>is this structure that's looking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>things to fill it self with.</v>

737
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.360
<v Speaker 4>Just like your predisposition to </v>
<v Speaker 4>language,</v>

738
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 4>you have a predisposition to language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that we don't know.</v>

739
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.800
<v Speaker 4>What does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks for things in the world to fill</v>

740
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 4>itself with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

741
00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 4>And if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you.</v>

742
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:12.710
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you start to learn how to speak,</v>

743
00:43:12.711 --> 00:43:14.490
<v Speaker 4>you babble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every phoneme did.</v>

744
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.920
<v Speaker 4>Did you know that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot,</v>

745
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:21.010
<v Speaker 4>there's a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was learning to speak an Asian </v>

746
00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.741
<v Speaker 4>language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There would be full names I couldn't </v>

747
00:43:23.741 --> 00:43:23.741
<v Speaker 4>pronounce and vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an infant,</v>

748
00:43:23.741 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 4>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They babble all the phonemes and then as</v>

749
00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:30.461
<v Speaker 4>they start to learn the language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they lose the ability to say a bunch of </v>

750
00:43:30.461 --> 00:43:32.030
<v Speaker 4>them and only retain the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>relevant to that language.</v>

751
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 4>So a baby babbles all laying all </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible languages.</v>

752
00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.170
<v Speaker 4>That's a way of thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then loses the ability.</v>

753
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.020
<v Speaker 4>So that's a manifest that's you can see </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

754
00:43:42.021 --> 00:43:42.890
<v Speaker 4>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

755
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 4>you manifest the potential to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>possessed by all the set of all possible</v>

756
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:50.270
<v Speaker 4>archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's built into your biology.</v>

757
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.050
<v Speaker 4>And then as you're enculturated in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>own culture,</v>

758
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:59.230
<v Speaker 4>the set of archetypes that manifest its </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits themselves in that culture are </v>

759
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:00.860
<v Speaker 4>the ones that you pull in for your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>use.</v>

760
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 4>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my nephews running around like a night.</v>

761
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

762
00:44:04.971 --> 00:44:07.040
<v Speaker 4>if he would have been born in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the Amazon,</v>

763
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.880
<v Speaker 4>he would have been running around with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bow and know a poisoned Arrow in a bowl.</v>

764
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.030
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same idea.</v>

765
00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:19.031
<v Speaker 4>It's just trapped out in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in different cultural dress and he,</v>

766
00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:24.840
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his little imagination was trying to </v>

767
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:24.840
<v Speaker 4>solve the problem.</v>

768
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:24.840
<v Speaker 4>How do you deal with the unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

769
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:29.711
<v Speaker 4>what's the unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's these little devils that keep </v>

770
00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:32.440
<v Speaker 4>biting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jumping up on you and biting you and </v>

771
00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.390
<v Speaker 4>they come out without.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just killing them.</v>

772
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like cutting the head off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hydro,</v>

773
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven more grow.</v>

774
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:42.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell good is it to solve one </v>

775
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:45.621
<v Speaker 4>problem when there's just a bunch more </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems that are come gonna come after </v>

776
00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's everyone's question.</v>

777
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:48.720
<v Speaker 4>That's the ultimate question of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nihilism,</v>

778
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:54.020
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why bother solving a problem if all </v>

779
00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 4>that's going to happen is that 20 more </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems are going to come your way.</v>

780
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.080
<v Speaker 4>Why not just give up and die while,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

781
00:44:58.081 --> 00:44:59.820
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

782
00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.290
<v Speaker 4>it's a good question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

783
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:06.530
<v Speaker 4>Is the suffering so intense that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole game should just be brought to it </v>

784
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:10.191
<v Speaker 4>and that's another fundamental question </v>
<v Speaker 4>of existence and people who've become </v>

785
00:45:10.191 --> 00:45:14.310
<v Speaker 4>truly malevolent answer that question in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the affirmative,</v>

786
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too much.</v>

787
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 4>We should destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

788
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say they're precisely doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>it only for humanitarian reasons,</v>

789
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:26.460
<v Speaker 4>but you have to understand and </v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciate the logic.</v>

790
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.040
<v Speaker 4>It's not irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing.</v>

791
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:32.610
<v Speaker 4>It's not irrational to work for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction of being.</v>

792
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 4>It's not irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

793
00:45:36.181 --> 00:45:38.850
<v Speaker 4>it might be the most rational thing you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could come up with.</v>

794
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
<v Speaker 4>It depends on your initial initial set </v>
<v Speaker 4>of presuppositions so young down into </v>

795
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 4>the belly of the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>

796
00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:48.560
<v Speaker 4>to to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

797
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:53.810
<v Speaker 4>to to see what lurks in the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sees the birthplace of archetipal </v>

798
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:55.460
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

799
00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:59.200
<v Speaker 4>what are archetipal ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are patterns of a.</v>

800
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:04.430
<v Speaker 4>You could think about them as as </v>
<v Speaker 4>representations of patterns of adaptive </v>

801
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:05.730
<v Speaker 4>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so then you might ask,</v>

802
00:46:05.731 --> 00:46:06.990
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where did they come from?</v>

803
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of what I've been trying to </v>

804
00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:13.320
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to teach you about.</v>

805
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.160
<v Speaker 4>They evolved as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

806
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.160
<v Speaker 4>They evolved collectively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that our society,</v>

807
00:46:20.161 --> 00:46:22.050
<v Speaker 4>and this is the dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea,</v>

808
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.080
<v Speaker 4>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy set themselves up as a matter </v>

809
00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.121
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're the standard way that animals </v>

810
00:46:29.121 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 4>organized themselves into territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

811
00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:35.271
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings are watching those </v>

812
00:46:35.271 --> 00:46:35.280
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchies since we became </v>
<v Speaker 4>self aware thinking,</v>

813
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.250
<v Speaker 4>what the hell are we up to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell are we up to?</v>

814
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:41.130
<v Speaker 4>What's and and there's a question that </v>
<v Speaker 4>lurks in there.</v>

815
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:46.310
<v Speaker 4>What constitutes acceptable power?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What constitutes acceptable sovereignty?</v>

816
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.590
<v Speaker 4>Who should lead?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who should rule?</v>

817
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.260
<v Speaker 4>What should be at the top?</v>
<v Speaker 4>While we talked about that,</v>

818
00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:55.470
<v Speaker 4>the Mesopotamians figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Speech and vision,</v>

819
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 4>that's Marduk speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vision,</v>

820
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.930
<v Speaker 4>and the willingness to confront the </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible unknown.</v>

821
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:06.050
<v Speaker 4>That's what should rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While what's that an arbitrary idea or </v>

822
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:07.680
<v Speaker 4>is that a great idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could it be any other way?</v>

823
00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:13.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what human beings are like and I </v>

824
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.171
<v Speaker 4>don't think that you can read the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mesopotamian story and understand the </v>

825
00:47:15.271 --> 00:47:20.271
<v Speaker 4>reference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which isn't an easy thing to do and </v>

826
00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:20.271
<v Speaker 4>failed to draw that conclusion.</v>

827
00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:21.810
<v Speaker 4>Marta has eyes all the way around his </v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

828
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:24.480
<v Speaker 4>He speaks magic words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes off to fight,</v>

829
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:27.120
<v Speaker 4>tie amat the dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

830
00:47:27.121 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 4>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the Reptilian Predator that lurks</v>

831
00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:32.930
<v Speaker 4>in the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While it is any of that it.</v>

832
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:38.230
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything about any of that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stands in opposition to what you were pr</v>

833
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:43.620
<v Speaker 4>would presume if you were just analyzing</v>
<v Speaker 4>our situation from a purely biological </v>

834
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're prey animals.</v>

835
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:49.960
<v Speaker 4>We're predators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd be threatened by reptiles forever.</v>

836
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't we use the Predator that </v>
<v Speaker 4>lurks in the dark forest or the water as</v>

837
00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:59.761
<v Speaker 4>a representative of the unknown?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't we harness that circuitry?</v>

838
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.280
<v Speaker 4>We already have it at hand and even more</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the point,</v>

839
00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:07.300
<v Speaker 4>how could we do anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's it makes perfect sense.</v>

840
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then you might say,</v>

841
00:48:09.401 --> 00:48:11.170
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you want to be king?</v>

842
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.560
<v Speaker 4>You could say king of the world are king</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your own soul.</v>

843
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.840
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to subordinate yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>to?</v>

844
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:22.320
<v Speaker 4>How bout your heroic willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter the unknown and articulate it </v>

845
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.670
<v Speaker 4>and share that with people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no nobler vision than that and </v>

846
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's merely arbitrary and so,</v>

847
00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:35.490
<v Speaker 4>and it's not merely arbitrary too </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you do that to the degree </v>

848
00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:39.220
<v Speaker 4>that you do that assuming your society </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't entirely corrupt,</v>

849
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 4>you will be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will actually aid you practically.</v>

850
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.320
<v Speaker 4>You'll rise up above men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be selected by women,</v>

851
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:52.500
<v Speaker 4>you'll be admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be valued and and you know that </v>

852
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 4>because if you look at the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you admire and value,</v>

853
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:59.700
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you've taken a detour into dark </v>

854
00:48:59.700 --> 00:48:59.700
<v Speaker 4>places and are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

855
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.910
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

856
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:06.180
<v Speaker 4>are possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with admiration for people who are </v>

857
00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:06.880
<v Speaker 4>working for malevolent purposes and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>

858
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:12.120
<v Speaker 4>You just have to watch the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you admire and try to figure out what's </v>

859
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.601
<v Speaker 4>common across them and draw your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>conclusions and you can ask yourself to </v>

860
00:49:15.601 --> 00:49:19.090
<v Speaker 4>when you're torturing yourself with your</v>
<v Speaker 4>conscience because you're not doing what</v>

861
00:49:19.091 --> 00:49:20.590
<v Speaker 4>you should be and you know it.</v>

862
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.070
<v Speaker 4>What is it that you're torturing </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself in relationship to?</v>

863
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:28.240
<v Speaker 4>You have a vision of your own ideal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you torment yourself.</v>

864
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:30.670
<v Speaker 4>If you're not matching it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the ideal?</v>

865
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know,</v>

866
00:49:32.111 --> 00:49:37.111
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of incoherent and and poorly </v>

867
00:49:37.111 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 4>articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean it isn't trying to</v>

868
00:49:37.421 --> 00:49:40.930
<v Speaker 4>manifest itself and make itself known to</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

869
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:46.350
<v Speaker 4>It's really the purpose of religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>education is to make that ideal </v>

870
00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 4>articulated well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've lost that.</v>

871
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.450
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

872
00:49:52.451 --> 00:49:57.451
<v Speaker 4>so I talked to you about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mesopotamian story and I talked to you </v>

873
00:49:57.451 --> 00:50:00.661
<v Speaker 4>about the Egyptian story and what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought it meant and it's a bit of an </v>

874
00:50:00.661 --> 00:50:00.700
<v Speaker 4>elaboration on the same theme because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

875
00:50:00.701 --> 00:50:03.120
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hero isn't only the.</v>

876
00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.650
<v Speaker 4>The Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the transcendent pattern,</v>

877
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:08.020
<v Speaker 4>let's say that goes out into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown,</v>

878
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:13.110
<v Speaker 4>cuts it into pieces and makes the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not good enough because it only </v>

879
00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:14.680
<v Speaker 4>deals with the terrible mother.</v>

880
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.860
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a terrible father to.</v>

881
00:50:17.861 --> 00:50:22.861
<v Speaker 4>Once culture gets instantiated in large </v>
<v Speaker 4>scale and the Egyptians had that </v>

882
00:50:22.901 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two problems,</v>

883
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 4>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Second problem,</v>

884
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.240
<v Speaker 4>pathological order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

885
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 4>structures tend towards pathological </v>
<v Speaker 4>order.</v>

886
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 4>The Egyptians laid out why that set </v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

887
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:40.391
<v Speaker 4>Seth is the evil advisor of the king </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's lurking in the background all the </v>

888
00:50:40.391 --> 00:50:44.381
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to tear the structure down for </v>

889
00:50:44.381 --> 00:50:46.721
<v Speaker 4>his own malevolent purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now and then that overcomes the </v>

890
00:50:46.721 --> 00:50:51.521
<v Speaker 4>structure and destroys the and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>rigidified and makes malevolent the </v>

891
00:50:51.521 --> 00:50:54.120
<v Speaker 4>entire social structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a degenerate into safe,</v>

892
00:50:54.121 --> 00:50:56.690
<v Speaker 4>fascist totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

893
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.710
<v Speaker 4>and especially being a threat since </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've had highly organized societies.</v>

894
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:06.970
<v Speaker 4>Then the hero ends up in the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 4>and has to come back and do direct </v>

895
00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:10.910
<v Speaker 4>combat without malevolent force at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>price of his own consciousness.</v>

896
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the horse gets one of his eyes </v>

897
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:15.940
<v Speaker 4>destroyed.</v>

898
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.070
<v Speaker 4>It's no bloody joke to face the forces </v>
<v Speaker 4>that make a culture rigid and </v>

899
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:23.711
<v Speaker 4>malevolent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's an addition to the hero </v>

900
00:51:23.711 --> 00:51:23.711
<v Speaker 4>archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two things happen.</v>

901
00:51:23.711 --> 00:51:25.670
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go out and you conquer chaos and you</v>

902
00:51:25.671 --> 00:51:30.671
<v Speaker 4>make order out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the second is you take pathological </v>

903
00:51:30.671 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 4>order,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recasted into chaos and then allow it to</v>

904
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:36.080
<v Speaker 4>reemerge and you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not In some arbitrary sense,</v>

905
00:51:36.081 --> 00:51:39.960
<v Speaker 4>but in tandem with your rescued father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's I guess in part what niche to</v>

906
00:51:39.961 --> 00:51:43.190
<v Speaker 4>MC missed as far as I can tell is he </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't.</v>

907
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.440
<v Speaker 4>He knew that he knew of the death of </v>
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

908
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps he didn't know that it had </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

909
00:51:47.931 --> 00:51:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Many Times Murcia Eylea documented that </v>
<v Speaker 4>across many cultures,</v>

910
00:51:51.771 --> 00:51:56.771
<v Speaker 4>but what you didn't seem to lay out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in his vision of the superman </v>

911
00:51:56.771 --> 00:52:01.630
<v Speaker 4>or the Overman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that it was a responsibility of the </v>

912
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:04.160
<v Speaker 4>person who wants to reverify the culture</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go down and rescue the damn culture,</v>

913
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:09.430
<v Speaker 4>which is what you're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing in university because your father </v>

914
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:10.310
<v Speaker 4>is lying dead in the libraries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

915
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:15.610
<v Speaker 4>So you're supposed to be going in there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and taking that spirit out of the books </v>

916
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:19.400
<v Speaker 4>and manifesting it in your own being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the universities were four,</v>

917
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.220
<v Speaker 4>although I don't think that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're for anymore.</v>

918
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:30.580
<v Speaker 4>So we talked about the Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 4>story and we talked about the Egyptian </v>

919
00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:34.421
<v Speaker 4>story and other people have documented </v>
<v Speaker 4>the emergence of hero mythology in </v>

920
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.850
<v Speaker 4>culture is far more diverse than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ones that I'm exposing you to.</v>

921
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.820
<v Speaker 4>That was done most popularly by Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 4>Campbell,</v>

922
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.630
<v Speaker 4>but Campbell's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think Campbell had a single idea</v>

923
00:52:44.631 --> 00:52:47.390
<v Speaker 4>that he didn't derive from young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying that in a.</v>

924
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:51.380
<v Speaker 4>In a critical manner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Campbell was good at standing as</v>

925
00:52:51.381 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 4>a mediator between young and in a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>general population.</v>

926
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:58.790
<v Speaker 4>He did and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a nontrivial accomplishment.</v>

927
00:52:58.791 --> 00:52:59.810
<v Speaker 4>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

928
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:05.160
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but young is still the source of those </v>

929
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.280
<v Speaker 4>ideas and if you're serious about them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the person that you have to go to</v>

930
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:12.490
<v Speaker 4>for that kind of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I wanted to tell you some other </v>

931
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:15.110
<v Speaker 4>stories that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are in some sense closer to western</v>

932
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:15.470
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

933
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:18.380
<v Speaker 4>They're the stories upon which Western </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture is actually predicated.</v>

934
00:53:18.381 --> 00:53:20.300
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

935
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:25.301
<v Speaker 4>I'm not only Western story today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you a couple of </v>

936
00:53:25.301 --> 00:53:27.800
<v Speaker 4>stories from genesis and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you about the story of the Buddha.</v>

937
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:32.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do that at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the story of the Buddha is </v>

938
00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 4>almost a perfect parallel structurally </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking to the story of Adam and eve.</v>

939
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
<v Speaker 4>And so I want to show you that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can decide for yourself if I'm </v>

940
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.510
<v Speaker 4>imposing a pattern on it because God </v>
<v Speaker 4>only knows,</v>

941
00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:44.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or whether or not.</v>

942
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:47.340
<v Speaker 4>Once you have the key to understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>the stories,</v>

943
00:53:47.341 --> 00:53:49.300
<v Speaker 4>which I hope I provided you with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>

944
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:54.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of the dragon of chaos and the </v>

945
00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:54.730
<v Speaker 4>great mother in the great father in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual,</v>

946
00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:59.631
<v Speaker 4>it gives you a Schema that you can use </v>
<v Speaker 4>to understand the characterizations of </v>

947
00:54:00.241 --> 00:54:05.241
<v Speaker 4>great stories and as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it works pretty much universally across </v>

948
00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:05.800
<v Speaker 4>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

949
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:07.530
<v Speaker 4>so I want to read.</v>

950
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:11.520
<v Speaker 4>I want to walk you through those </v>
<v Speaker 4>foundational stories and I would say one</v>

951
00:54:11.521 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 4>of the things to know about the way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bible is structured,</v>

952
00:54:13.981 --> 00:54:16.920
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of things you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>know about it is that it was authored by</v>

953
00:54:16.921 --> 00:54:21.921
<v Speaker 4>multiple people across extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>vast spans of time and then aggregated </v>

954
00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:27.981
<v Speaker 4>by other people and sorted into </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that seemed to make sense and </v>

955
00:54:27.981 --> 00:54:32.010
<v Speaker 4>so you can really think about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bible is a library.</v>

956
00:54:32.011 --> 00:54:33.780
<v Speaker 4>It's a library of books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a book.</v>

957
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.950
<v Speaker 4>The library is organized a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes a kind of sense,</v>

958
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's not exactly as if anyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided what that sense would be.</v>

959
00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:47.040
<v Speaker 4>It's the collaborative work of hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 4>and thousands of people across thousands</v>

960
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:53.570
<v Speaker 4>of years attempting to organize our </v>
<v Speaker 4>collective story into something that </v>

961
00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:55.800
<v Speaker 4>something out of which the sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>emerges.</v>

962
00:54:56.490 --> 00:55:00.780
<v Speaker 4>It's like human beings acted and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they dram,</v>

963
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:05.840
<v Speaker 4>dreamed about how they acted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they wrote down what they </v>

964
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.180
<v Speaker 4>dreamed about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they acted,</v>

965
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:10.560
<v Speaker 4>and then they organized what they wrote </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how they dreamed they acted,</v>

966
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:15.860
<v Speaker 4>and that's how that book came into being</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the information that's within it </v>

967
00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.130
<v Speaker 4>emerged from the behavioral level </v>
<v Speaker 4>upward,</v>

968
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:17.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

969
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Rather than being imposed top down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a.</v>

970
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.780
<v Speaker 4>there's a feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

971
00:55:21.781 --> 00:55:26.781
<v Speaker 4>Because if you understand how you act </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that changes how you act and so you </v>

972
00:55:26.781 --> 00:55:29.520
<v Speaker 4>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't avoid the top down feedback,</v>

973
00:55:29.521 --> 00:55:34.521
<v Speaker 4>but a tremendous amount of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>information in there and this is why </v>

974
00:55:34.521 --> 00:55:37.851
<v Speaker 4>it's revelatory information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know it's in there because how </v>

975
00:55:37.951 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 4>we act as informative and then if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>represent how we act,</v>

976
00:55:41.011 --> 00:55:45.030
<v Speaker 4>that's informative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the information came from how we act</v>

977
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.780
<v Speaker 4>from the representation of how we act </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you might think,</v>

978
00:55:48.781 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did we learn how to act?</v>

979
00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:56.181
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been trying to figure out how to </v>

980
00:55:56.181 --> 00:55:59.151
<v Speaker 4>do that for three point 5 billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of information encoded in </v>

981
00:55:59.821 --> 00:56:04.821
<v Speaker 4>our actions and in our social </v>
<v Speaker 4>interactions way more than we </v>

982
00:56:04.821 --> 00:56:06.150
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're acting something out.</v>

983
00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:11.180
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're doing our best to pull that </v>

984
00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:11.400
<v Speaker 4>information upward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly by dreaming about it.</v>

985
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:16.790
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're doing at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to figure out what the </v>

986
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.790
<v Speaker 4>hell you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

987
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:18.780
<v Speaker 4>you don't know because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself in totality.</v>

988
00:56:18.781 --> 00:56:23.710
<v Speaker 4>How could you possibly know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Best you can do is dream yourself up and</v>

989
00:56:23.711 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 4>then speak yourself into some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>articulated existence.</v>

990
00:56:26.981 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 4>It's just an approximation because you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you is,</v>

991
00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:36.310
<v Speaker 4>whatever you are rapidly supersedes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever you think you are.</v>

992
00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:39.370
<v Speaker 4>That's why people constantly shocked </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

993
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:44.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were only what you thought of </v>

994
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.171
<v Speaker 4>yourself or wouldn't life be simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd know exactly what you were doing </v>

995
00:56:46.171 --> 00:56:47.320
<v Speaker 4>all the time and you could even control </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own behavior.</v>

996
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:48.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck with that.</v>

997
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.030
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that for yourself much less</v>
<v Speaker 4>for other people.</v>

998
00:56:55.250 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 4>So let's go through these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're sequenced,</v>

999
00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:04.300
<v Speaker 4>people are trying to make sense out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1000
00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.220
<v Speaker 4>They're aggregating these stories from </v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of different places,</v>

1001
00:57:07.221 --> 00:57:12.221
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of different tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of different times and then </v>

1002
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:15.941
<v Speaker 4>trying to make them coherent without </v>
<v Speaker 4>losing the content and without doing </v>

1003
00:57:15.941 --> 00:57:18.410
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary editing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so part of the reason that the Bible</v>

1004
00:57:18.411 --> 00:57:21.920
<v Speaker 4>is full of internal contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's for the same reason that a dream is</v>

1005
00:57:21.921 --> 00:57:25.940
<v Speaker 4>full of internal contradictions is if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you impose too much coherence on it,</v>

1006
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:31.390
<v Speaker 4>you start losing the look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine you have an imagined that you </v>

1007
00:57:33.501 --> 00:57:38.501
<v Speaker 4>have a impressionist painting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's messy and,</v>

1008
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.340
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

1009
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:42.140
<v Speaker 4>the image emerges and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1010
00:57:42.141 --> 00:57:47.141
<v Speaker 4>we could replace that with a nice clean </v>
<v Speaker 4>line drawing or even a sequence of stick</v>

1011
00:57:47.691 --> 00:57:50.750
<v Speaker 4>figures and get the basic point across.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1012
00:57:50.751 --> 00:57:51.350
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>

1013
00:57:51.351 --> 00:57:53.930
<v Speaker 4>but you'd lose the richness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1014
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:59.010
<v Speaker 4>an articulable richness would be lost in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the premature attempt to bring logical </v>

1015
00:57:59.991 --> 00:58:03.560
<v Speaker 4>closure to the phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in fact,</v>

1016
00:58:03.561 --> 00:58:08.561
<v Speaker 4>we know already that that's maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between dreams and waking </v>

1017
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:09.430
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So waking thoughts,</v>

1018
00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:12.920
<v Speaker 4>sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completeness for coherence,</v>

1019
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whereas dream thought sacrifices </v>

1020
00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.090
<v Speaker 4>coherence for completeness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

1021
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:25.110
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not something I'm saying </v>

1022
00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:26.561
<v Speaker 4>arbitrarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is something that has been thought </v>

1023
00:58:26.561 --> 00:58:28.511
<v Speaker 4>through by people who've been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of thing through for a long </v>

1024
00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:29.000
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Precise thought</v>

1025
00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:36.660
<v Speaker 4>excludes too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An imprecise thought is not sufficiently</v>

1026
00:58:36.971 --> 00:58:41.971
<v Speaker 4>coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we do both precise thought left </v>

1027
00:58:41.971 --> 00:58:42.670
<v Speaker 4>hemisphere linguistically mediated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sequential,</v>

1028
00:58:42.671 --> 00:58:43.300
<v Speaker 4>logical,</v>

1029
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:50.540
<v Speaker 4>incoherent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but complete thought imagistic emotion </v>

1030
00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:50.540
<v Speaker 4>based,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right hemisphere.</v>

1031
00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:51.870
<v Speaker 4>The right hemisphere even has a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>diffuse structure.</v>

1032
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:54.540
<v Speaker 4>It's like the right hemisphere is trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get a picture of everything.</v>

1033
00:58:55.530 --> 00:59:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Now it's not going to be a very detailed</v>
<v Speaker 4>picture because it's a picture of </v>

1034
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:04.011
<v Speaker 4>everything full of contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least it's a picture of </v>

1035
00:59:04.011 --> 00:59:04.440
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the left says that's not good enough</v>

1036
00:59:04.441 --> 00:59:08.160
<v Speaker 4>for precise action and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'll narrow that to precision,</v>

1037
00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.980
<v Speaker 4>but we lose the richness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you need both.</v>

1038
00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:13.290
<v Speaker 4>So there's an interplay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1039
00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:18.830
<v Speaker 4>the documents that the Bible is composed</v>
<v Speaker 4>of our half dream and half articulated </v>

1040
00:59:20.701 --> 00:59:25.701
<v Speaker 4>thought and they have the advantages of </v>
<v Speaker 4>articulated thought and the advantages </v>

1041
00:59:25.701 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 4>of the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also the disadvantages of both.</v>

1042
00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 4>So to the degree that it's articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in a dogmatic box to the degree </v>

1043
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:35.000
<v Speaker 4>that it's a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still incoherent,</v>

1044
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:40.510
<v Speaker 4>but it's the problem is you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to move through the entire </v>

1045
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.080
<v Speaker 4>world even though you don't know it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>detail.</v>

1046
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 4>So you need detailed knowledge were </v>
<v Speaker 4>detailed,</v>

1047
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:50.261
<v Speaker 4>knowledge is necessary and you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>vague but complete knowledge where </v>

1048
00:59:50.261 --> 00:59:50.261
<v Speaker 4>that's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an.</v>

1049
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:55.300
<v Speaker 4>It's a very uncomfortable balance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we have to face everything even </v>

1050
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.260
<v Speaker 4>though we don't understand anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely.</v>

1051
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.200
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genesis,</v>

1052
01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:06.290
<v Speaker 4>the first stories in genesis are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you say on identifiably?</v>

1053
01:00:10.261 --> 01:00:10.860
<v Speaker 4>Ancient.</v>

1054
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:16.220
<v Speaker 4>God only knows how old they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The story of Noah.</v>

1055
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.670
<v Speaker 4>Here's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know this guy who's a.</v>

1056
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:25.240
<v Speaker 4>he's a Kwakwaka'wakw tribal member and </v>
<v Speaker 4>an artist who lives on the tip of </v>

1057
01:00:26.121 --> 01:00:31.121
<v Speaker 4>northern Vancouver Island and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture he comes from is about 14,000</v>

1058
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 4>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

1059
01:00:32.901 --> 01:00:35.000
<v Speaker 4>and maybe it's odd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>been unbroken for 14,000</v>

1060
01:00:35.001 --> 01:00:36.740
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very long period of time.</v>

1061
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.170
<v Speaker 4>And He.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not literate.</v>

1062
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:42.150
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although he's very intelligent,</v>

1063
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.090
<v Speaker 4>has a great memory and is also a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>artist.</v>

1064
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:49.300
<v Speaker 4>And He's told me some of the stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have come down through the </v>

1065
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.961
<v Speaker 4>Kwakwaka'wakw tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was educated by his grandparents </v>

1066
01:00:52.961 --> 01:00:55.130
<v Speaker 4>who were original language speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's an original language speakers.</v>

1067
01:00:55.131 --> 01:01:00.131
<v Speaker 4>There are many people like that left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's only 3000 in his </v>

1068
01:01:00.131 --> 01:01:02.300
<v Speaker 4>particular tribal group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a story that's the flood story</v>

1069
01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:06.110
<v Speaker 4>that this except it's canoes and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't a dove.</v>

1070
01:01:06.111 --> 01:01:08.930
<v Speaker 4>It's a cro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the damn story is exactly the same.</v>

1071
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1072
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

1073
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:12.680
<v Speaker 4>at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a canoe.</v>

1074
01:01:12.681 --> 01:01:17.681
<v Speaker 4>It's a bunch of canoes that are tied </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and at the end the canoes all </v>

1075
01:01:17.681 --> 01:01:18.770
<v Speaker 4>break apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why there are people all over</v>

1076
01:01:18.771 --> 01:01:23.771
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the story of the Tower of </v>

1077
01:01:23.771 --> 01:01:26.410
<v Speaker 4>Babel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I'm going to talk to you about </v>

1078
01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:26.410
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1079
01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:34.370
<v Speaker 4>the reason I'm telling you that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the stories at the beginning of </v>

1080
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.911
<v Speaker 4>genesis are extraordinarily old now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe he tells the same story that we</v>

1081
01:01:38.191 --> 01:01:40.140
<v Speaker 4>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1082
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.100
<v Speaker 4>making the presumption that we are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are,</v>

1083
01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:46.170
<v Speaker 4>who are part of this Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 4>tradition.</v>

1084
01:01:46.171 --> 01:01:48.030
<v Speaker 4>And I know that that's not the case for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone</v>

1085
01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's telling the same damn story and it </v>

1086
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:57.660
<v Speaker 4>emerged from a central point so long ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's 20,000</v>

1087
01:01:57.661 --> 01:02:00.090
<v Speaker 4>years or 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years or maybe 50,000</v>

1088
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.340
<v Speaker 4>years since we moved out of Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

1089
01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:07.490
<v Speaker 4>And the story has survived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is certainly possible because </v>

1090
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.490
<v Speaker 4>oral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

1091
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.830
<v Speaker 4>can an oral tradition survive that long?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the wrong question.</v>

1092
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Oral traditions always survived that </v>
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

1093
01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.660
<v Speaker 4>What's radical is that they disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were the radicals.</v>

1094
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:24.080
<v Speaker 4>The oral tradition is something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stays the same generation after </v>

1095
01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.251
<v Speaker 4>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how much innovation do you think </v>

1096
01:02:28.251 --> 01:02:28.320
<v Speaker 4>there is in a small tribal group?</v>
<v Speaker 4>None.</v>

1097
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:31.080
<v Speaker 4>That's why they don't have advanced </v>
<v Speaker 4>technologies.</v>

1098
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 4>They stay the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stories stay the same.</v>

1099
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.560
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that they can be transmitted</v>
<v Speaker 4>unchanged over thousands and tens of </v>

1100
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.880
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years is really not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>debatable proposition.</v>

1101
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:46.881
<v Speaker 4>It's the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So either the stories emerged from a </v>

1102
01:02:46.881 --> 01:02:50.931
<v Speaker 4>central source and have never been lost </v>
<v Speaker 4>so that you can pick them up everywhere </v>

1103
01:02:50.931 --> 01:02:54.620
<v Speaker 4>or there's something about the stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>that automatically regenerates </v>

1104
01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:54.620
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

1105
01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.390
<v Speaker 4>And I suppose it's a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>column a and a little bit of column B.</v>

1106
01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my nephew,</v>

1107
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:03.420
<v Speaker 4>when he perceived himself as a dragon </v>
<v Speaker 4>slaying night,</v>

1108
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:04.170
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1109
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:09.770
<v Speaker 4>was that the continuation of an oral </v>
<v Speaker 4>tradition or was it something that he </v>

1110
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.460
<v Speaker 4>spontaneously come up with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is both.</v>

1111
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pattern was there.</v>

1112
01:03:13.711 --> 01:03:18.711
<v Speaker 4>He just had to see it and he saw it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>synthesize it and pr and encapsulated it</v>

1113
01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:21.240
<v Speaker 4>in his own imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1114
01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:24.240
<v Speaker 4>that's not much different than the oral </v>
<v Speaker 4>tradition being unbroken.</v>

1115
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.020
<v Speaker 4>It's just a variant of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1116
01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 4>if you lose a story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everyone acts it out,</v>

1117
01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:32.340
<v Speaker 4>you can reconstruct the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1118
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:37.910
<v Speaker 4>And if everyone doesn't act it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the culture dies because there's </v>

1119
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:39.810
<v Speaker 4>some things about the story that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to act out if your culture is going</v>

1120
01:03:39.811 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 4>to survive.</v>

1121
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.630
<v Speaker 4>That's the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that would be.</v>

1122
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Well that would be where you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>search for ultimate values,</v>

1123
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:51.830
<v Speaker 4>the stories that enable you as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual to flourish in such a manner </v>

1124
01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:55.350
<v Speaker 4>that your culture flourishes in a way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>enhance your flourishing.</v>

1125
01:03:55.351 --> 01:04:00.351
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the right way that you want to </v>

1126
01:04:00.351 --> 01:04:01.821
<v Speaker 4>organize things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that's what you do inside a </v>

1127
01:04:01.821 --> 01:04:01.821
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's functioning well,</v>

1128
01:04:01.821 --> 01:04:06.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The family function so that every </v>

1129
01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.400
<v Speaker 4>individual benefits from being in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>family and that strengthens the family.</v>

1130
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.220
<v Speaker 4>That's what piaget called and </v>
<v Speaker 4>equilibrated solution.</v>

1131
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:16.550
<v Speaker 4>Technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was looking for the origin of </v>

1132
01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:19.581
<v Speaker 4>moral ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he came up with the idea of a </v>

1133
01:04:19.581 --> 01:04:20.670
<v Speaker 4>celebrated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>celebrated state,</v>

1134
01:04:20.671 --> 01:04:23.480
<v Speaker 4>and then it calibrated state is one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The three of you are in iniquity,</v>

1135
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:28.490
<v Speaker 4>abraded state if you all want to be in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that state and while you're in that </v>

1136
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:32.931
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that you're doing together </v>

1137
01:04:32.931 --> 01:04:33.540
<v Speaker 4>work better and they facilitate each of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your development,</v>

1138
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:34.500
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1139
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.400
<v Speaker 4>So it's the stacking of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1140
01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.520
<v Speaker 4>of an ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have a set of ethical propositions so </v>

1141
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.040
<v Speaker 4>that the individual benefits at the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>time as the group and you can.</v>

1142
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:46.110
<v Speaker 4>You can increase that stacking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could say,</v>

1143
01:04:46.111 --> 01:04:51.111
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not only that you want to organize </v>

1144
01:04:51.111 --> 01:04:53.811
<v Speaker 4>yourself so that all three of you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you want better than you would if </v>

1145
01:04:53.811 --> 01:04:54.630
<v Speaker 4>you were alone and so that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy.</v>

1146
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 4>And so the stacking also occurs all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way down the physiological chain.</v>

1147
01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:04.550
<v Speaker 4>You want to be manifesting yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world so that you remain is </v>

1148
01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:05.130
<v Speaker 4>physiologically healthy as you possibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>

1149
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 4>so your stress responses are properly </v>
<v Speaker 4>balanced and all of that.</v>

1150
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:13.550
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe your equilla braided </v>
<v Speaker 4>state as well enough developed so it </v>

1151
01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:16.371
<v Speaker 4>doesn't just include the three of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it extends outward beyond you into the </v>

1152
01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:18.640
<v Speaker 4>greater community and things stacked </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1153
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.840
<v Speaker 4>And that's if they get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they all get stacked up,</v>

1154
01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:24.640
<v Speaker 4>every level is stacked on top of each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other properly.</v>

1155
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:29.910
<v Speaker 4>You have an equilibrated state and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't think that that's any different </v>

1156
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:31.810
<v Speaker 4>than a vision of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think those are the same thing.</v>

1157
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.450
<v Speaker 4>So now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1158
01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:38.530
<v Speaker 4>can that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole different story.</v>

1159
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:44.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happens in your own life at those </v>

1160
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:44.400
<v Speaker 4>times where everything comes together </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>

1161
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's chaotic and then everything snaps </v>

1162
01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:49.060
<v Speaker 4>together and you think that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1163
01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:51.060
<v Speaker 4>And it's unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't maintain it.</v>

1164
01:05:51.061 --> 01:05:52.960
<v Speaker 4>It fragments again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what you're.</v>

1165
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:55.900
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're working towards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have any sense,</v>

1166
01:05:55.901 --> 01:06:00.901
<v Speaker 4>you're working towards that constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what music </v>

1167
01:06:00.901 --> 01:06:03.901
<v Speaker 4>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the stacking of harmonious </v>

1168
01:06:03.901 --> 01:06:03.901
<v Speaker 4>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1169
01:06:03.901 --> 01:06:04.700
<v Speaker 4>that are playing themselves out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

1170
01:06:04.701 --> 01:06:06.850
<v Speaker 4>And you watch how people respond to </v>
<v Speaker 4>music.</v>

1171
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:13.260
<v Speaker 4>The Orchestra is led by the leader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every different individual plays his or </v>

1172
01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:18.181
<v Speaker 4>her part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're organized into string sections </v>

1173
01:06:18.181 --> 01:06:18.181
<v Speaker 4>and horn sections and so on.</v>

1174
01:06:18.181 --> 01:06:20.410
<v Speaker 4>So you get individual subgroup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>group,</v>

1175
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:22.150
<v Speaker 4>orchestra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>leader.</v>

1176
01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.640
<v Speaker 4>Then maybe you have people dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1177
01:06:24.641 --> 01:06:29.641
<v Speaker 4>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe it's men and women dancing in </v>

1178
01:06:29.641 --> 01:06:29.641
<v Speaker 4>front of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a Viennese waltz.</v>

1179
01:06:29.641 --> 01:06:31.930
<v Speaker 4>So it's the harmonious stacking of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern.</v>

1180
01:06:31.931 --> 01:06:36.931
<v Speaker 4>Being in the background led by someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who is making sure that the time is in </v>

1181
01:06:36.931 --> 01:06:39.640
<v Speaker 4>order and men and women arranging </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves according to the patterns.</v>

1182
01:06:39.641 --> 01:06:44.641
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everyone has a wonderful time when </v>

1183
01:06:44.641 --> 01:06:46.621
<v Speaker 4>that's happening and it's acting out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>acting out the proposition that all of </v>

1184
01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:51.631
<v Speaker 4>these levels of being can be stacked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmoniously at the same time and </v>

1185
01:06:51.631 --> 01:06:52.990
<v Speaker 4>everybody has a tremendously fun time </v>
<v Speaker 4>while they're doing it.</v>

1186
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's how you find a mate at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dance and for exactly the same reason,</v>

1187
01:06:57.010 --> 01:07:02.010
<v Speaker 4>it's an optimal place to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see if there's someone that you can </v>

1188
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:05.260
<v Speaker 4>be with with whom you can mutually act </v>
<v Speaker 4>out the patterns of being well,</v>

1189
01:07:05.261 --> 01:07:06.880
<v Speaker 4>we're all acting that out at a dance.</v>

1190
01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.070
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're having a good time.</v>

1191
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:10.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1192
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:13.840
<v Speaker 4>that's a little glimpse of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what that good time is.</v>

1193
01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:17.380
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Bible stories before what happened,</v>

1194
01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:22.381
<v Speaker 4>what seems to happen is that you can see</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two cataclysmic events at the </v>

1195
01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 4>first part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the end of the first part of Genesis,</v>

1196
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:31.210
<v Speaker 4>there's the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the prehistoric world is wiped out by</v>

1197
01:07:31.211 --> 01:07:36.211
<v Speaker 4>the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the idea there in some sense </v>

1198
01:07:36.211 --> 01:07:39.570
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of them is there's a place in </v>

1199
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:42.220
<v Speaker 4>history past which we cannot look and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's absolutely true.</v>

1200
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:47.250
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that's very strange </v>
<v Speaker 4>about human beings is that are written </v>

1201
01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:51.841
<v Speaker 4>civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ones we have records of all seem to </v>

1202
01:07:51.841 --> 01:07:51.940
<v Speaker 4>have popped up somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood of five to 6,000</v>

1203
01:07:51.941 --> 01:07:53.740
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter where you look.</v>

1204
01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.330
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Central America,</v>

1205
01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.710
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>
<v Speaker 4>India,</v>

1206
01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Egypt,</v>

1207
01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:00.460
<v Speaker 4>well it's all the same.</v>

1208
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.920
<v Speaker 4>Six thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>post.</v>

1209
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.820
<v Speaker 4>There we were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1210
01:08:03.821 --> 01:08:05.410
<v Speaker 4>what happened before that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1211
01:08:05.411 --> 01:08:10.411
<v Speaker 4>the answer is we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is obscured by the chaos of </v>

1212
01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:12.850
<v Speaker 4>history before that point and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>emerged out of it,</v>

1213
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are these incredibly ancient stories and</v>

1214
01:08:16.131 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 4>so we're going to walk through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient stories and see what we can pull</v>

1215
01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:20.930
<v Speaker 4>out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've already done that with several,</v>

1216
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:24.200
<v Speaker 4>so there are some representations of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>garden of Eden.</v>

1217
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:29.230
<v Speaker 4>So this is by Hieronymus Bosch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know who hieronymus </v>

1218
01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:33.821
<v Speaker 4>Bosch is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's definitely worth looking up </v>

1219
01:08:33.821 --> 01:08:33.821
<v Speaker 4>because he was one strange character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

1220
01:08:33.821 --> 01:08:36.770
<v Speaker 4>I think he painted in the 15th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly.</v>

1221
01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:40.010
<v Speaker 4>He was like this 15th century version of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Salvador Dali.</v>

1222
01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:45.011
<v Speaker 4>His paintings are so uncanny that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're still shocking to the mortar </v>

1223
01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:50.291
<v Speaker 4>nih,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really something because it's </v>

1224
01:08:50.291 --> 01:08:50.291
<v Speaker 4>not easy to shock a modern person with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>visual image,</v>

1225
01:08:50.291 --> 01:08:51.680
<v Speaker 4>but Hieronymus Bosch will definitely do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1226
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:54.980
<v Speaker 4>And that's his representation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>paradise.</v>

1227
01:08:54.981 --> 01:08:59.981
<v Speaker 4>There's some central structure in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle that's partly phallic and partly </v>

1228
01:08:59.981 --> 01:09:03.430
<v Speaker 4>chambered so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's Adam and Eve united,</v>

1229
01:09:03.431 --> 01:09:05.210
<v Speaker 4>united by God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1230
01:09:05.211 --> 01:09:10.211
<v Speaker 4>And there's one by Peter Paul Rubens and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sorted the primordial lush landscape </v>

1231
01:09:10.211 --> 01:09:13.430
<v Speaker 4>that you might think about as the what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ancestral human home.</v>

1232
01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>

1233
01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.910
<v Speaker 4>A treat landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1234
01:09:18.911 --> 01:09:20.590
<v Speaker 4>why trees?</v>
<v Speaker 4>While we liked fruit,</v>

1235
01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:23.470
<v Speaker 4>we lived in trees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why not trees?</v>

1236
01:09:23.471 --> 01:09:28.471
<v Speaker 4>I mean even modern people have a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful tendency to think about trees </v>

1237
01:09:28.471 --> 01:09:30.250
<v Speaker 4>is sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't get environmentalists tying</v>

1238
01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:32.470
<v Speaker 4>themselves to great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1239
01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.490
<v Speaker 4>Douglas firs and protecting them if </v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't some deep felt sense within</v>

1240
01:09:36.491 --> 01:09:38.860
<v Speaker 4>us that they're sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever that means.</v>

1241
01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trees are our home.</v>

1242
01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.800
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's as close to sacred as you're </v>

1243
01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:46.800
<v Speaker 4>going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1244
01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.320
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to read you something from </v>

1245
01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:54.320
<v Speaker 2>the book of Job and this is God </v>
<v Speaker 2>harassing job.</v>

1246
01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:56.070
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if you know the story of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1247
01:09:56.071 --> 01:10:01.071
<v Speaker 2>but it's very interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically what happens with job is </v>

1248
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:04.161
<v Speaker 2>that God and the devil have a bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems a little unreasonable side</v>

1249
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:09.440
<v Speaker 2>for God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he gets to do whatever he wants.</v>

1250
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:14.000
<v Speaker 2>So he has a bet with Satan roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking and says,</v>

1251
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.670
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well job.</v>

1252
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:21.790
<v Speaker 2>He tells Satan that job is a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that he's faithful to God and Satan </v>

1253
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:21.790
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1254
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:25.490
<v Speaker 2>let me let me out and for awhile I bet </v>
<v Speaker 2>you we can do something about that.</v>

1255
01:10:25.491 --> 01:10:27.050
<v Speaker 2>And God says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

1256
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:29.540
<v Speaker 2>no are you could torture her all you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

1257
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:32.540
<v Speaker 2>He's going to stay faithful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Satan says,</v>

1258
01:10:32.541 --> 01:10:34.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a baton out and soul,</v>

1259
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:36.890
<v Speaker 2>God hands them over and what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>job?</v>

1260
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything terrible that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could imagine then happens to job,</v>

1261
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:41.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

1262
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:43.430
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1263
01:10:43.431 --> 01:10:47.630
<v Speaker 2>his family dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All his possessions are destroyed.</v>

1264
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:53.290
<v Speaker 2>He gets a horrible skin disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then he's sitting there by the </v>

1265
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:56.411
<v Speaker 2>fire sort of scraping himself with bits </v>
<v Speaker 2>of broken pots and all his friends come </v>

1266
01:10:56.411 --> 01:11:00.671
<v Speaker 2>around and tell them that the reason all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this happened to him was because he </v>

1267
01:11:00.671 --> 01:11:01.220
<v Speaker 2>deserved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's perfect,</v>

1268
01:11:01.221 --> 01:11:01.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1269
01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:06.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like an ultimate suffering story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a precursor to the idea of the </v>

1270
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.670
<v Speaker 2>crucifix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

1271
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:12.940
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Joel has a chat with God and asks </v>

1272
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 2>him like Cain did roughly</v>

1273
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.740
<v Speaker 4>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and God attempts to.</v>

1274
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 4>He's irritated that job would even dare </v>
<v Speaker 4>to question him.</v>

1275
01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:22.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like he's God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gets to do whatever he wants.</v>

1276
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a very strange book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

1277
01:11:24.421 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the things that God says </v>
<v Speaker 4>to job well,</v>

1278
01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:31.380
<v Speaker 4>God is trying to justify himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say to job,</v>

1279
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.440
<v Speaker 4>and the reason I'm telling you this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see is because so imagine that </v>

1280
01:11:37.201 --> 01:11:39.450
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to analyze a literary </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

1281
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:40.170
<v Speaker 4>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1282
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:41.910
<v Speaker 4>where's the meaning in the literary </v>
<v Speaker 4>work?</v>

1283
01:11:41.911 --> 01:11:45.330
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is in the words</v>

1284
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 4>word by word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in the phrases,</v>

1285
01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:54.650
<v Speaker 4>it's in the sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in the relationship of the </v>

1286
01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:57.531
<v Speaker 4>sentences to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in the relationship of the </v>

1287
01:11:57.531 --> 01:12:00.501
<v Speaker 4>sentences within paragraphs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in the relationship of the </v>

1288
01:12:00.501 --> 01:12:03.111
<v Speaker 4>paragraphs within the contexts of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chapters and it's in the relationship </v>

1289
01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:07.050
<v Speaker 4>between the chapters and the whole book </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the book in the whole culture.</v>

1290
01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.560
<v Speaker 4>So you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy to localize the meaning.</v>

1291
01:12:10.561 --> 01:12:12.680
<v Speaker 4>It exists at all those levels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>symbol [inaudible],</v>

1292
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:15.600
<v Speaker 4>and they all inform one another and what</v>
<v Speaker 4>that means,</v>

1293
01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:17.400
<v Speaker 4>and it's even worse than a book like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bible.</v>

1294
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.070
<v Speaker 4>I want to show you a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an amazing picture.</v>

1295
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:27.500
<v Speaker 4>So let me tell you what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the Bible is the world's first </v>

1296
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.250
<v Speaker 4>hyperlinked document.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

1297
01:12:29.251 --> 01:12:32.580
<v Speaker 4>So what you have here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what you see at the bottom,</v>

1298
01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:38.040
<v Speaker 4>there's a line along the bottom and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's small lines coming down from it.</v>

1299
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each of those,</v>

1300
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 4>the line has dots on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each job is a is a verse,</v>

1301
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:50.230
<v Speaker 4>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a line associated with </v>

1302
01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:51.350
<v Speaker 4>the verse that's a varying length and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the length corresponds to how many times</v>

1303
01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:54.950
<v Speaker 4>that verse is cross referenced somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>else in the document.</v>

1304
01:12:55.790 --> 01:13:00.140
<v Speaker 4>And then these rainbow colored lines are</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cross references.</v>

1305
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:03.680
<v Speaker 4>So now that's really worth thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1306
01:13:03.681 --> 01:13:05.720
<v Speaker 4>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that book is deep.</v>

1307
01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.120
<v Speaker 4>Well why is it deep?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1308
01:13:08.121 --> 01:13:13.121
<v Speaker 4>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because every single thing in it refers </v>

1309
01:13:13.121 --> 01:13:13.121
<v Speaker 4>to every other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's connected.</v>

1310
01:13:13.121 --> 01:13:14.480
<v Speaker 4>Like your brain is connected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's not a linear document.</v>

1311
01:13:14.481 --> 01:13:17.030
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is a book is a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange thing,</v>

1312
01:13:17.031 --> 01:13:19.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when you or or even a story,</v>

1313
01:13:19.371 --> 01:13:22.280
<v Speaker 4>because when you lay out the story in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sense,</v>

1314
01:13:22.281 --> 01:13:23.210
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1315
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.360
<v Speaker 4>you're outside of the space and time of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the story and so you can adjust the end </v>

1316
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:33.071
<v Speaker 4>to make the beginning different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know how if you watch a movie and </v>

1317
01:13:33.071 --> 01:13:33.620
<v Speaker 4>then it's got a surprise ending,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it changes the beginning.</v>

1318
01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.480
<v Speaker 4>You thought the beginning was one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't.</v>

1319
01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:36.890
<v Speaker 4>It's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1320
01:13:36.891 --> 01:13:41.891
<v Speaker 4>when you lay out a story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can fiddle with the story anywhere </v>

1321
01:13:41.891 --> 01:13:44.981
<v Speaker 4>in the story and so and you can also </v>
<v Speaker 4>make something that happens before </v>

1322
01:13:45.381 --> 01:13:47.630
<v Speaker 4>dependent on something that happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>after,</v>

1323
01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:52.780
<v Speaker 4>which is very strange and that's what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened with the Bible because people </v>

1324
01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:52.780
<v Speaker 4>have worked on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked on it,</v>

1325
01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:53.480
<v Speaker 4>worked on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked on it,</v>

1326
01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.140
<v Speaker 4>trying to synthesize it and make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>coherent and make it make sense.</v>

1327
01:13:57.290 --> 01:14:02.290
<v Speaker 4>And so they're continually connecting </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that's inside of it to </v>

1328
01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:05.561
<v Speaker 4>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you end up with a document map </v>

1329
01:14:05.561 --> 01:14:06.080
<v Speaker 4>that looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now,</v>

1330
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:08.900
<v Speaker 4>so you think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is connected to everything in</v>

1331
01:14:08.901 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 4>that document.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not chaotically meaningfully.</v>

1332
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:14.170
<v Speaker 4>Just like your brain is connected in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful way,</v>

1333
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:19.171
<v Speaker 4>it's not everything is connected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything is connected in a meaningful </v>

1334
01:14:19.171 --> 01:14:19.171
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you think,</v>

1335
01:14:19.171 --> 01:14:20.630
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where?</v>

1336
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 4>What do the stories mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the answer is,</v>

1337
01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:28.260
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a hard question because all of </v>

1338
01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.391
<v Speaker 4>them are connected with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's all these different </v>

1339
01:14:30.391 --> 01:14:33.331
<v Speaker 4>levels of analysis and so you can pull </v>
<v Speaker 4>out meanings at one level of analysis </v>

1340
01:14:33.331 --> 01:14:35.140
<v Speaker 4>that aren't self evident at another </v>
<v Speaker 4>level of analysis.</v>

1341
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 4>Just like if you're listening to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>complex piece of symphonic music,</v>

1342
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:42.100
<v Speaker 4>you can follow a baseline or you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>follow the strings or you can follow the</v>

1343
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:45.310
<v Speaker 4>horns and they're all harmoniously </v>
<v Speaker 4>interrelated,</v>

1344
01:14:45.311 --> 01:14:46.990
<v Speaker 4>but they're also separable.</v>

1345
01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there is an image that lurks in the </v>

1346
01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:53.140
<v Speaker 4>Old Testament and the images,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same image.</v>

1347
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:58.240
<v Speaker 4>It's roughly the same image as the image</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Marduk confronting tie a mat.</v>

1348
01:14:58.241 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the,</v>

1349
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.840
<v Speaker 4>at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God makes.</v>

1350
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's how the beginning goes.</v>

1351
01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:10.030
<v Speaker 4>In the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God created the heaven and the earth and</v>

1352
01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:15.031
<v Speaker 4>the earth was without form and void and </v>
<v Speaker 4>darkness was upon the face of the deep </v>

1353
01:15:15.031 --> 01:15:17.050
<v Speaker 4>and the spirit of God moved upon the </v>
<v Speaker 4>face of the waters and God said,</v>

1354
01:15:17.051 --> 01:15:19.120
<v Speaker 4>let there be light and there was light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1355
01:15:19.121 --> 01:15:21.340
<v Speaker 4>so we got to look at the first few lines</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1356
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:24.730
<v Speaker 4>So this is God justifying himself to </v>
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>

1357
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:29.940
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you pull in Leviathan with a fish </v>

1358
01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:32.931
<v Speaker 4>hook or tie down its tongue with a rope?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you put a cord through its nose or </v>

1359
01:15:32.931 --> 01:15:35.980
<v Speaker 4>Pearson jaw with a hook?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will it keep you begging for mercy?</v>

1360
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:41.010
<v Speaker 4>Will it speak to you with gentle words?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will it make an agreement with you for </v>

1361
01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:45.031
<v Speaker 4>you to take it as your slave for life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you make a pet of it like a bird or </v>

1362
01:15:45.431 --> 01:15:48.610
<v Speaker 4>put it on a leash?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the young women in your house,</v>

1363
01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:53.850
<v Speaker 4>will traders barter for it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will they divided up among the </v>

1364
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:57.001
<v Speaker 4>merchants?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you fill it's hide with harpoons or </v>

1365
01:15:57.001 --> 01:15:57.001
<v Speaker 4>its head with fishing spirits?</v>

1366
01:15:57.650 --> 01:16:01.550
<v Speaker 4>If you lay a hand on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will remember the struggle and never</v>

1367
01:16:01.551 --> 01:16:06.150
<v Speaker 4>do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any hope of subduing,</v>

1368
01:16:06.151 --> 01:16:09.740
<v Speaker 4>it is false.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The mere sight of it is over powering.</v>

1369
01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:16.430
<v Speaker 4>No one is fierce enough to rouse it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who is then able to stand against me?</v>

1370
01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.400
<v Speaker 4>Who has a claim against me that I must </v>
<v Speaker 4>pay?</v>

1371
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Everything under heaven belongs to me.</v>

1372
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1373
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:27.730
<v Speaker 4>more computer trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1374
01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:28.240
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>

1375
01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:34.690
<v Speaker 4>I will not fail to speak of Leviathan's </v>
<v Speaker 4>limbs.</v>

1376
01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:38.440
<v Speaker 4>It strengthen it's graceful form who can</v>
<v Speaker 4>strip off its outer coat,</v>

1377
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:43.650
<v Speaker 4>who can penetrate it's double coat of </v>
<v Speaker 4>armor who dares opened the doors of its </v>

1378
01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:45.670
<v Speaker 4>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ringing about with fearsome teeth.</v>

1379
01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:51.150
<v Speaker 4>It's back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has rows of shields tightly sealed </v>

1380
01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:52.630
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each is so close to the next that no air</v>

1381
01:16:52.631 --> 01:16:55.720
<v Speaker 4>can pass between.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are joined fast to one another.</v>

1382
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:57.940
<v Speaker 4>They claimed together and cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 4>parted.</v>

1383
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.700
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Snorting throws out flashes of light.</v>

1384
01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.110
<v Speaker 4>It's eyes are like the rays of dawn's </v>
<v Speaker 4>flame stream from its mouth,</v>

1385
01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:10.290
<v Speaker 4>sparks of fire shoot out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smoke pours from its nostrils from a </v>

1386
01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:10.290
<v Speaker 4>boiling</v>

1387
01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 2>pot overboard burning reads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's breadth sets,</v>

1388
01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.850
<v Speaker 2>coles ablaze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and flames dart from its mouth.</v>

1389
01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Strength resides in its neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismay goes before it.</v>

1390
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.990
<v Speaker 2>The folds of its flesh are tightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>joined.</v>

1391
01:17:23.991 --> 01:17:27.140
<v Speaker 2>They are firm and immovable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chest is as hard as rock.</v>

1392
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Hard is a lower millstone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it rises up,</v>

1393
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:33.320
<v Speaker 2>the mighty are terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They retreat before it's thrashing.</v>

1394
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.400
<v Speaker 2>The sword that reaches it has no effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor does the spear or the dart or the </v>

1395
01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.361
<v Speaker 2>javelin earned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It treats like Straw and bronze like a </v>

1396
01:17:43.361 --> 01:17:46.541
<v Speaker 2>rotten wood arrows do not make it flee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sling stones are like chaff to it.</v>

1397
01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:50.390
<v Speaker 2>A club seems to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a piece of Straw.</v>

1398
01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:55.780
<v Speaker 2>It laughs at the rattling of the Lance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's undersides or Jag had pot shirts </v>

1399
01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:58.760
<v Speaker 2>leaving a trail in the mud like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>threshing sledge.</v>

1400
01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:03.650
<v Speaker 2>It makes the depth churn like a boiling </v>
<v Speaker 2>cauldron and stays up to see like a part</v>

1401
01:18:03.651 --> 01:18:08.651
<v Speaker 2>of ointment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It leaves that glistening wake behind </v>

1402
01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:09.260
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One would think the deep had white hair.</v>

1403
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Nothing on earth is it's equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a creature without fear.</v>

1404
01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:17.960
<v Speaker 2>It looks down on all that or haughty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>is king overall that are proud.</v>

1405
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what's God doing?</v>

1406
01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.650
<v Speaker 2>He's describing what he defeated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to create the world.</v>

1407
01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:28.490
<v Speaker 2>That's Marta can tie matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1408
01:18:28.491 --> 01:18:31.040
<v Speaker 2>so that's one reference like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

1409
01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:36.100
<v Speaker 2>so now another reference like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from psalms 74.</v>

1410
01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Yet God is my king of old working </v>
<v Speaker 2>salvation in the midst of the earth.</v>

1411
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Thou did break the CND pieces by thy </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength,</v>

1412
01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Thou dits chatter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heads of the sea monsters in the </v>

1413
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:57.450
<v Speaker 2>waters vow did crush the heads of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Leviathan,</v>

1414
01:18:57.570 --> 01:19:02.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the creature that we just heard </v>

1415
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:04.191
<v Speaker 2>described.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thou gave us to him to be food to the </v>

1416
01:19:04.191 --> 01:19:07.170
<v Speaker 2>folk inhabiting the Wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you remember,</v>

1417
01:19:07.171 --> 01:19:12.171
<v Speaker 2>so when Marta defeats Tye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maddie cuts her into pieces and makes </v>

1418
01:19:12.171 --> 01:19:12.630
<v Speaker 2>the world out of her pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In here.</v>

1419
01:19:12.631 --> 01:19:15.810
<v Speaker 2>What's happening is that the force that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that encounters,</v>

1420
01:19:15.811 --> 01:19:19.140
<v Speaker 2>the Leviathan is able to break it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces and feed everyone with it.</v>

1421
01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I'm telling you that in </v>

1422
01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:25.050
<v Speaker 2>relationship to this is because and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth was what?</v>

1423
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Without form and void and darkness was </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon the face of the deep.</v>

1424
01:19:28.710 --> 01:19:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you a little bit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those lines before God's God begins to </v>

1425
01:19:40.531 --> 01:19:45.531
<v Speaker 2>create the world is Tohu wa Bohu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's from the Hebrew.</v>

1426
01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:49.530
<v Speaker 2>The word Tohu by itself means emptiness </v>
<v Speaker 2>or futility,</v>

1427
01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:54.980
<v Speaker 2>so there's a psychological element to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hay and that emptiness or futility </v>

1428
01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:59.091
<v Speaker 2>in some senses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you confront when you're trying to </v>

1429
01:19:59.091 --> 01:20:01.311
<v Speaker 2>extract your life from the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is used to describe the desert </v>

1430
01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:01.830
<v Speaker 2>wilderness as well.</v>

1431
01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.270
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1432
01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1433
01:20:06.091 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is the condition</v>

1434
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.770
<v Speaker 4>that Barra ordering remedies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1435
01:20:10.771 --> 01:20:15.690
<v Speaker 4>so there's the idea in the first verses </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this initial chaos is being ordered</v>

1436
01:20:15.691 --> 01:20:17.730
<v Speaker 4>and the order is what makes the world so</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

1437
01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1438
01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:22.800
<v Speaker 4>it's standard cosmology order emerges </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of chaos,</v>

1439
01:20:22.801 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 4>and the thing that makes it emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The word of God.</v>

1440
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Now darkness and deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is home in Hebrew,</v>

1441
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:34.440
<v Speaker 4>are two of the three elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos represented in Intoa,</v>

1442
01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:37.170
<v Speaker 4>Tohu wa Bohu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The third is the form of this earth.</v>

1443
01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:42.530
<v Speaker 4>In the Enuma elish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The deep is personified as the God </v>

1444
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:45.180
<v Speaker 4>goddess time at the enemy of Martech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it is the formless body of primeval</v>

1445
01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:47.640
<v Speaker 4>water surrounding the habitable world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1446
01:20:47.641 --> 01:20:52.641
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we know tailem and out are the same </v>

1447
01:20:52.641 --> 01:20:55.700
<v Speaker 4>word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least tatum was derived from </v>

1448
01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.251
<v Speaker 4>timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that's presented at the </v>

1449
01:20:58.251 --> 01:21:00.861
<v Speaker 4>beginning of genesis is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an abstracted and psychologized </v>

1450
01:21:00.861 --> 01:21:04.260
<v Speaker 4>representation of the story that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mesopotamians put forward.</v>

1451
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.900
<v Speaker 4>So Yahuah is Marduk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking,</v>

1452
01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:11.370
<v Speaker 4>going out and conquering the dragon of </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos and making order out of it.</v>

1453
01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:13.690
<v Speaker 4>And then there are these illusions later</v>
<v Speaker 4>say in job,</v>

1454
01:21:13.691 --> 01:21:16.140
<v Speaker 4>been in the psalms of him doing exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1455
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.800
<v Speaker 4>conquering a primordial monster and </v>
<v Speaker 4>making the world out of its pieces.</v>

1456
01:21:19.801 --> 01:21:22.020
<v Speaker 4>While so what does that mean exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1457
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:28.070
<v Speaker 4>it means that the highest ordering </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle is the spirit that goes out </v>

1458
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:32.781
<v Speaker 4>into the darkness or the deep that </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounters the dragon of chaos because </v>

1459
01:21:32.781 --> 01:21:37.521
<v Speaker 4>of obviously Leviathan is a dragon and </v>
<v Speaker 4>defeats it and feeds the people as a </v>

1460
01:21:37.521 --> 01:21:42.051
<v Speaker 4>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while we are hunting creatures after </v>

1461
01:21:42.051 --> 01:21:44.901
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in order to establish our place in </v>

1462
01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:47.031
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had to go out there and conquer the </v>

1463
01:21:47.031 --> 01:21:47.031
<v Speaker 4>dragons of the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might wonder,</v>

1464
01:21:47.031 --> 01:21:49.770
<v Speaker 4>why does a dragon breathe fire?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1465
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:51.870
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of reasons as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can tell,</v>

1466
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:57.830
<v Speaker 4>fire is all inspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fire and a terrible Predator or the </v>

1467
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 4>same thing because they both inspire.</v>

1468
01:21:59.430 --> 01:22:02.980
<v Speaker 4>All fire is transforming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but predit like,</v>

1469
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:06.720
<v Speaker 4>what's a good metaphor for being bitten </v>
<v Speaker 4>by a poisonous snake?</v>

1470
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:12.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever seen the wounds that a </v>

1471
01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:12.020
<v Speaker 4>poisonous stake produces?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're bitten by them,</v>

1472
01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.770
<v Speaker 4>it's like someone took your arm and </v>
<v Speaker 4>incinerated it,</v>

1473
01:22:13.771 --> 01:22:16.980
<v Speaker 4>and so the idea that a snake has fiery </v>
<v Speaker 4>breath is,</v>

1474
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:22.220
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it close enough from a </v>

1475
01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:22.220
<v Speaker 4>metaphorical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now,</v>

1476
01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:24.930
<v Speaker 4>God is claiming to job that he's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>spirit.</v>

1477
01:22:24.931 --> 01:22:29.931
<v Speaker 4>That clique that clears the wilderness </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then builds order out of chaos and </v>

1478
01:22:29.931 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 4>because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>

1479
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.140
<v Speaker 4>because he's the embodiment of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>spirit,</v>

1480
01:22:34.141 --> 01:22:39.141
<v Speaker 4>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>job has no reason to ever question his </v>

1481
01:22:39.141 --> 01:22:40.800
<v Speaker 4>moral decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that in the story of</v>

1482
01:22:40.801 --> 01:22:45.801
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the point that that point we'll </v>

1483
01:22:45.801 --> 01:22:45.960
<v Speaker 4>leave aside because it's a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated issue.</v>

1484
01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:51.620
<v Speaker 4>The point is that the writers of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bible are trying to dream up a </v>

1485
01:22:52.831 --> 01:22:55.560
<v Speaker 4>representation of the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>

1486
01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.680
<v Speaker 4>That's the right way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can think of Yahuah as the spirit of</v>

1487
01:22:58.681 --> 01:23:00.990
<v Speaker 4>civilization and what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1488
01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.050
<v Speaker 4>it's the thing that encounters the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wilderness and makes habitable order,</v>

1489
01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:09.051
<v Speaker 4>but then it's also the spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>order itself and that's I think why in </v>

1490
01:23:09.051 --> 01:23:12.541
<v Speaker 4>Christianity there's a representation of</v>
<v Speaker 4>God the father because he's a </v>

1491
01:23:12.541 --> 01:23:16.111
<v Speaker 4>representation of the culture that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>generated after the chaos has ordered,</v>

1492
01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:21.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have the spirit that goes out into </v>

1493
01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.191
<v Speaker 4>chaos and slash orders and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>the spirit of the order and then the </v>

1494
01:23:23.191 --> 01:23:27.001
<v Speaker 4>spirit of the order and the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ordering principle have to figure </v>

1495
01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:30.451
<v Speaker 4>out how to coexist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's partly what the Egyptians were </v>

1496
01:23:30.451 --> 01:23:30.451
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1497
01:23:30.451 --> 01:23:34.090
<v Speaker 4>There's a dynamic relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the culture and the spirit that </v>

1498
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:35.890
<v Speaker 4>generates the culture and then you might</v>
<v Speaker 4>also ask,</v>

1499
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:41.100
<v Speaker 4>should the culture be superordinate or </v>
<v Speaker 4>should despirit that generates the </v>

1500
01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:45.481
<v Speaker 4>culture be super superordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the answer seems to be the emergent </v>

1501
01:23:45.481 --> 01:23:49.441
<v Speaker 4>answer seems to be that the spirit that </v>
<v Speaker 4>generates the culture should be super </v>

1502
01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:50.230
<v Speaker 4>superordinate to the spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

1503
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:55.470
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that and that's also</v>
<v Speaker 4>why I think that one of the brilliant </v>

1504
01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:56.830
<v Speaker 4>discoveries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1505
01:23:57.190 --> 01:24:02.190
<v Speaker 4>of Western individualistic civilization </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the group is there to serve the </v>

1506
01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:06.130
<v Speaker 4>individual because the individual is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that revivified the group,</v>

1507
01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:11.050
<v Speaker 4>so each depend on the other integrally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you subordinate the individual to</v>

1508
01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:13.960
<v Speaker 4>the group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the group stagnates and dies and so</v>

1509
01:24:13.961 --> 01:24:18.961
<v Speaker 4>that's a very bad longterm strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though the group and belonging to </v>

1510
01:24:18.961 --> 01:24:22.771
<v Speaker 4>the group is clearly necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to uphold the values of the </v>

1511
01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:26.281
<v Speaker 4>group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the values of the group should be </v>

1512
01:24:26.281 --> 01:24:26.530
<v Speaker 4>subordinated to producing the individual</v>
<v Speaker 4>who gives the group vision.</v>

1513
01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:30.280
<v Speaker 4>And the Mesopotamians figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Egyptians figured that out.</v>

1514
01:24:30.281 --> 01:24:35.281
<v Speaker 4>We've figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just don't know that we figured it </v>

1515
01:24:35.281 --> 01:24:36.100
<v Speaker 4>out and it's not a mere arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposition.</v>

1516
01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:42.340
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I should show you because this is </v>

1517
01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.330
<v Speaker 4>actually interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think perhaps</v>

1518
01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:52.930
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1519
01:24:57.110 --> 01:25:00.740
<v Speaker 4>I want to show you what the cosmology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what people considered,</v>

1520
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:03.890
<v Speaker 4>because the structure of the initial </v>
<v Speaker 4>order,</v>

1521
01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:05.780
<v Speaker 4>because it's kind of interesting and God</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1522
01:25:05.781 --> 01:25:10.781
<v Speaker 4>let there be a firmament in the midst of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the waters and let it divide the waters </v>

1523
01:25:10.781 --> 01:25:14.141
<v Speaker 4>from the waters and God made the </v>
<v Speaker 4>firmament and divided the waters which </v>

1524
01:25:14.141 --> 01:25:15.800
<v Speaker 4>were under the firmament from the waters</v>
<v Speaker 4>which were above the firmament,</v>

1525
01:25:15.801 --> 01:25:20.801
<v Speaker 4>and it was so God called the firmament </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavens and the evening and the morning </v>

1526
01:25:20.801 --> 01:25:20.801
<v Speaker 4>were the second day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1527
01:25:20.801 --> 01:25:22.310
<v Speaker 4>so what are they thinking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1528
01:25:22.311 --> 01:25:24.650
<v Speaker 4>that's the sort of classical view of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1529
01:25:24.651 --> 01:25:28.860
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a desk,</v>

1530
01:25:29.230 --> 01:25:32.930
<v Speaker 4>it's the disc we inhabit and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>land that's the desk,</v>

1531
01:25:32.931 --> 01:25:34.850
<v Speaker 4>and under the desk there's water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fresh water,</v>

1532
01:25:34.851 --> 01:25:39.851
<v Speaker 4>and then under that there's the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of that there's a dome </v>

1533
01:25:39.851 --> 01:25:39.851
<v Speaker 4>and that's the sky.</v>

1534
01:25:39.851 --> 01:25:40.940
<v Speaker 4>That's the firmament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's heaven.</v>

1535
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.240
<v Speaker 4>And there's water above that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well obviously because it rains,</v>

1536
01:25:44.241 --> 01:25:49.241
<v Speaker 4>so there has to be water up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the way the cosmos was </v>

1537
01:25:49.241 --> 01:25:49.340
<v Speaker 4>conceptualized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just so you know.</v>

1538
01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.480
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a phenomenal logical </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptualization because that's what it</v>

1539
01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:54.680
<v Speaker 4>looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1540
01:25:54.681 --> 01:25:56.120
<v Speaker 4>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's wrong.</v>

1541
01:25:56.121 --> 01:25:57.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1542
01:25:57.141 --> 01:25:57.890
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1543
01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 4>it's wrong in a functional sort of way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right from a phenomenological </v>

1544
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:04.910
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's wrong from a,</v>

1545
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 4>from a scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was never designed to be a scientific </v>

1546
01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all right,</v>

1547
01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.491
<v Speaker 4>so we won't bother with this part will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll start here so god makes animals </v>

1548
01:26:18.231 --> 01:26:20.540
<v Speaker 4>and plants and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then at the end of it,</v>

1549
01:26:20.541 --> 01:26:22.400
<v Speaker 4>this is on which day,</v>

1550
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:32.510
<v Speaker 4>Sixth Day God said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let us make man in our image after our </v>

1551
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:36.561
<v Speaker 4>likeness and let them have dominion over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fish of the sea and the fowl of the </v>

1552
01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:36.720
<v Speaker 4>air over the cattle and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>

1553
01:26:36.721 --> 01:26:39.630
<v Speaker 4>and over every creeping thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>creepeth upon the earth.</v>

1554
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:40.290
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1555
01:26:40.291 --> 01:26:42.540
<v Speaker 4>the relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's two relevant issues there.</v>

1556
01:26:42.541 --> 01:26:45.900
<v Speaker 4>One is let us make man in our image </v>
<v Speaker 4>after our likeness.</v>

1557
01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what exactly does that mean?</v>

1558
01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:52.790
<v Speaker 4>While we've already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've already encountered that to some </v>

1559
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:56.631
<v Speaker 4>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've already encountered what the </v>

1560
01:26:56.631 --> 01:26:57.630
<v Speaker 4>nature of the spirit of God is in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

1561
01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:03.980
<v Speaker 4>The nature of the spirit of God that </v>
<v Speaker 4>creates order out of chaos is the thing </v>

1562
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:07.611
<v Speaker 4>that creates order out of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the statement here is that </v>

1563
01:27:07.611 --> 01:27:08.940
<v Speaker 4>there's something about human beings</v>

1564
01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:13.370
<v Speaker 4>that partakes in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1565
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:15.710
<v Speaker 4>when I started unpacking this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

1566
01:27:15.711 --> 01:27:16.450
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1567
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:19.040
<v Speaker 4>there's an idea that's at the root of </v>
<v Speaker 4>our legal system,</v>

1568
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.500
<v Speaker 4>and so our legal system is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>articulation of the patterns by which we</v>

1569
01:27:24.501 --> 01:27:26.510
<v Speaker 4>live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to a fair degree,</v>

1570
01:27:26.511 --> 01:27:27.830
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an evolved system.</v>

1571
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:32.831
<v Speaker 4>It's a culturally constructed system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's an evolved system as well and </v>

1572
01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:36.011
<v Speaker 4>it's predicated on the idea that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something about the individual that the </v>

1573
01:27:36.011 --> 01:27:36.560
<v Speaker 4>law has to respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1574
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:37.850
<v Speaker 4>so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1575
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:42.350
<v Speaker 4>is that just an arbitrary supposition?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that's really the question.</v>

1576
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:47.590
<v Speaker 4>It's the same question as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is Western civilization founded on </v>

1577
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:50.000
<v Speaker 4>something that's a rock or is it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>founded on something that's an opinion?</v>

1578
01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:55.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same question with regards to </v>

1579
01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.921
<v Speaker 4>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The law assumes that there's something </v>

1580
01:27:56.921 --> 01:27:57.530
<v Speaker 4>about you that sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're a murderer,</v>

1581
01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:03.190
<v Speaker 4>you have unalienable rights now you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that is a bloody weird thing for </v>

1582
01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:07.391
<v Speaker 4>any sort of system to have come up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the idea that if you're the </v>

1583
01:28:07.391 --> 01:28:11.951
<v Speaker 4>ultimate in malevolent transgressors </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you still have some sort of </v>

1584
01:28:12.411 --> 01:28:13.520
<v Speaker 4>sovereign value.</v>

1585
01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:18.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like that is such an unlikely thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people to think up that you really </v>

1586
01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.240
<v Speaker 4>have to think a long time about how that</v>
<v Speaker 4>might've come to be.</v>

1587
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:21.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an idea here.</v>

1588
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:25.280
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something about human beings,</v>

1589
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:27.100
<v Speaker 4>men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1590
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:30.470
<v Speaker 4>because people often complain about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal structure of the Bible.</v>

1591
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:35.471
<v Speaker 4>It's based on a misapprehension of </v>
<v Speaker 4>anthropology that was popularized by </v>

1592
01:28:35.471 --> 01:28:37.530
<v Speaker 4>someone named Gimbutas at Ucla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is for,</v>

1593
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.600
<v Speaker 4>for for her perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a shred of historical </v>

1594
01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.031
<v Speaker 4>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although there's some psychological </v>

1595
01:28:46.031 --> 01:28:46.031
<v Speaker 4>truth in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1596
01:28:46.031 --> 01:28:49.120
<v Speaker 4>in Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both men and women are created in the </v>

1597
01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:49.760
<v Speaker 4>image of God and that's quite a </v>
<v Speaker 4>remarkable thing.</v>

1598
01:28:49.761 --> 01:28:54.761
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a remarkable part of the document </v>

1599
01:28:54.761 --> 01:28:54.860
<v Speaker 4>because it's not what you'd expect from </v>
<v Speaker 4>a patriarchal,</v>

1600
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:55.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from a,</v>

1601
01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:01.120
<v Speaker 4>from a document that was designed to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing but extend the domain of the </v>

1602
01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:01.120
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy.</v>

1603
01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like you left with the damn cattle </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would've made things a lot easier </v>

1604
01:29:05.290 --> 01:29:08.990
<v Speaker 4>and that isn't what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so both men and women have this image </v>

1605
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:12.800
<v Speaker 4>and what's the image?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the image of the thing that can </v>

1606
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.321
<v Speaker 4>order chaos and so it's necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 4>treat you as if you have intrinsic value</v>

1607
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:22.310
<v Speaker 4>because the fact that you can partake in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the process of mediating between order </v>

1608
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:25.260
<v Speaker 4>and chaos means that you're basically </v>
<v Speaker 4>the salvation of society.</v>

1609
01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:30.510
<v Speaker 4>That's what it means and so society </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't impose on you to to greater degree</v>

1610
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:35.690
<v Speaker 4>because you are too valuable for even </v>
<v Speaker 4>the law to push arbitrarily past a </v>

1611
01:29:37.321 --> 01:29:40.210
<v Speaker 4>certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now then you have to think this,</v>

1612
01:29:40.211 --> 01:29:41.760
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1613
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:44.430
<v Speaker 4>this is where you really have to think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about what you believe.</v>

1614
01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:49.970
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that or not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there's not much difference </v>

1615
01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:52.830
<v Speaker 4>really technically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not much difference than that.</v>

1616
01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:55.830
<v Speaker 4>Between that and believing these </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories,</v>

1617
01:29:55.831 --> 01:29:57.840
<v Speaker 4>it depends bloody well what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 4>belief.</v>

1618
01:29:57.841 --> 01:30:01.110
<v Speaker 4>They're not scientific representations </v>
<v Speaker 4>of an evolutionary process.</v>

1619
01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.950
<v Speaker 4>Obviously the people who came up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1620
01:30:02.951 --> 01:30:03.900
<v Speaker 4>words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists,</v>

1621
01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:05.820
<v Speaker 4>so whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not that,</v>

1622
01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:11.090
<v Speaker 4>but they're making a proposition that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not an accidental proposition and we </v>

1623
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:13.410
<v Speaker 4>know that partly because it's rooted so </v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply in these ancient stories.</v>

1624
01:30:13.411 --> 01:30:15.930
<v Speaker 4>We have no idea how old the Mesopotamian</v>
<v Speaker 4>story is.</v>

1625
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:18.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the oldest story we have in written</v>

1626
01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:20.280
<v Speaker 4>form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we know that,</v>

1627
01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.010
<v Speaker 4>but God only knows how old it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of an oral tradition and these</v>

1628
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:26.220
<v Speaker 4>oral traditions can be</v>

1629
01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:33.170
<v Speaker 2>look the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carver gave me a big thing called a CSO </v>

1630
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Udl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a man in the middle of a double</v>

1631
01:30:36.841 --> 01:30:38.730
<v Speaker 2>headed sea serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1632
01:30:38.731 --> 01:30:40.380
<v Speaker 2>So they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 14,000</v>

1633
01:30:40.381 --> 01:30:44.040
<v Speaker 2>years old that came from Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same bloody idea.</v>

1634
01:30:44.190 --> 01:30:47.700
<v Speaker 2>It's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these ideas aren't arbitrary.</v>

1635
01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:49.470
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1636
01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:52.470
<v Speaker 2>are they true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then the question is,</v>

1637
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:57.210
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you mean by true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the comes down to that.</v>

1638
01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Is it true that habitable order is </v>
<v Speaker 4>dependent on the spirit that moves into </v>

1639
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:07.171
<v Speaker 4>the unknown and takes the Leviathan and </v>
<v Speaker 4>chops it into pieces and distributes it </v>

1640
01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:08.770
<v Speaker 4>and answer to that is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

1641
01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:12.670
<v Speaker 4>As far as I can tell you mean is it </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally true?</v>

1642
01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.120
<v Speaker 4>While it's is true as things get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how we got here.</v>

1643
01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:18.670
<v Speaker 4>We got here because people went into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown,</v>

1644
01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:23.200
<v Speaker 4>they conquered what was out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took what was of utility from that.</v>

1645
01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:25.810
<v Speaker 4>They brought it back and they shared it </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the community.</v>

1646
01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:30.900
<v Speaker 4>That's why we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the central story of humankind </v>

1647
01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:30.900
<v Speaker 4>and that's still what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1648
01:31:31.150 --> 01:31:36.150
<v Speaker 4>we're not exactly necessarily going out </v>
<v Speaker 4>to conquer an embodied monster,</v>

1649
01:31:36.611 --> 01:31:38.590
<v Speaker 4>although we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we hunt for example,</v>

1650
01:31:38.591 --> 01:31:40.930
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of us don't do that anymore,</v>

1651
01:31:40.931 --> 01:31:43.210
<v Speaker 4>but to the degree that you're an </v>
<v Speaker 4>explorer in the,</v>

1652
01:31:43.211 --> 01:31:48.211
<v Speaker 4>in the intellectual realm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're still going out into the unknown </v>

1653
01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:51.450
<v Speaker 4>and conquering what's out there looming </v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe it's the cure for a disease </v>

1654
01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:56.430
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at right in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to decompose it and break </v>

1655
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:59.851
<v Speaker 4>it into its parts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to understand it and then </v>

1656
01:31:59.851 --> 01:32:02.371
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to tell everybody what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>found while and everybody pats you on </v>

1657
01:32:02.371 --> 01:32:02.371
<v Speaker 4>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says,</v>

1658
01:32:02.371 --> 01:32:02.371
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1659
01:32:02.371 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a brave explorer of the unknown.</v>

1660
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:08.530
<v Speaker 4>While that is exactly the sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we should be fostering,</v>

1661
01:32:08.531 --> 01:32:12.220
<v Speaker 4>and it's the thing that we all admire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so okay,</v>

1662
01:32:12.221 --> 01:32:17.221
<v Speaker 4>so that happens on the sixth day and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>now we know human beings are made in </v>

1663
01:32:19.811 --> 01:32:20.800
<v Speaker 4>God's image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1664
01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:22.030
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean exactly?</v>

1665
01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what it means a reasonable way </v>

1666
01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:30.810
<v Speaker 4>of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can take about it like the genie.</v>

1667
01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:34.350
<v Speaker 4>The genie has this tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>power that's constrained in a very small</v>

1668
01:32:34.351 --> 01:32:38.220
<v Speaker 4>space and genie and genius or the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>word roughly speaking.</v>

1669
01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:43.520
<v Speaker 4>So the genius is the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your genius is the genie that inhabits </v>

1670
01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:43.520
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1671
01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:48.141
<v Speaker 4>It's this logo spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an gets put in a very small </v>

1672
01:32:48.141 --> 01:32:51.951
<v Speaker 4>container.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that idea represented in the </v>

1673
01:32:51.951 --> 01:32:55.551
<v Speaker 4>Christian conception of the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 4>between Christ and God because there's </v>

1674
01:32:55.551 --> 01:32:59.481
<v Speaker 4>an idea that God had to empty himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>out in order to fit into the body of </v>

1675
01:32:59.481 --> 01:33:00.180
<v Speaker 4>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>

1676
01:33:00.181 --> 01:33:05.181
<v Speaker 4>They call that Kenosis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a technical word and what it </v>

1677
01:33:05.181 --> 01:33:06.930
<v Speaker 4>seems to be the idea that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lawyer.</v>

1678
01:33:06.931 --> 01:33:11.931
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're a low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 4>representations of the ultimate spirit </v>

1679
01:33:11.931 --> 01:33:13.440
<v Speaker 4>that encounters the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>

1680
01:33:13.650 --> 01:33:18.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a very smart idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you could say maybe that's what </v>

1681
01:33:18.650 --> 01:33:21.411
<v Speaker 4>human beings have in common is that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that reached an embodiment of that </v>

1682
01:33:21.411 --> 01:33:22.140
<v Speaker 4>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for lack of a better word.</v>

1683
01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:27.500
<v Speaker 4>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then God makes the god makes human </v>

1684
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:32.151
<v Speaker 4>beings male and female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes them in his own image and is happy</v>

1685
01:33:32.221 --> 01:33:33.210
<v Speaker 4>about them and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1686
01:33:33.211 --> 01:33:38.211
<v Speaker 4>you're going to dominate the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which people like David Suzuki read that</v>

1687
01:33:38.221 --> 01:33:42.210
<v Speaker 4>to say you should go out and dominate </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world because they read that kind of</v>

1688
01:33:42.211 --> 01:33:47.211
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal oppression into the text,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is more a description of how </v>

1689
01:33:47.211 --> 01:33:51.381
<v Speaker 4>things are going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then whether or not they should be that </v>

1690
01:33:51.381 --> 01:33:52.010
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

1691
01:33:52.011 --> 01:33:53.780
<v Speaker 4>that's the sixth day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The seventh day</v>

1692
01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:56.980
<v Speaker 4>God rests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1693
01:33:56.981 --> 01:33:59.530
<v Speaker 4>So that's the origin of the week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking.</v>

1694
01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.380
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1695
01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:07.680
<v Speaker 4>that's one story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's two creation stories in genesis </v>

1696
01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.060
<v Speaker 4>and they actually don't match completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their structure.</v>

1697
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:12.730
<v Speaker 4>And what happened was someone they </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the redactor,</v>

1698
01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:14.440
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was a bunch of people we don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1699
01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:19.620
<v Speaker 4>to a creation story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one and creation story too from </v>

1700
01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:22.471
<v Speaker 4>different places and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well these are sort of the same and </v>

1701
01:34:22.471 --> 01:34:25.531
<v Speaker 4>they're sort of different and people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be unhappy if we dispense with </v>

1702
01:34:25.531 --> 01:34:25.800
<v Speaker 4>this one and they're going to be unhappy</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we dispense this,</v>

1703
01:34:25.801 --> 01:34:27.910
<v Speaker 4>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't make sense together.</v>

1704
01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:33.120
<v Speaker 4>So let's see if we can put them in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of order that makes approximate </v>

1705
01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.810
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they took the newer one and put it </v>

1706
01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:36.810
<v Speaker 4>second and took the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

1707
01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:38.450
<v Speaker 4>they took the older one and put it </v>
<v Speaker 4>second and put,</v>

1708
01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:40.240
<v Speaker 4>took the newer one and put it first.</v>

1709
01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.600
<v Speaker 4>So Adam and eve is an older story than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the story that I just told you.</v>

1710
01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:45.580
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a different story.</v>

1711
01:34:45.581 --> 01:34:50.581
<v Speaker 4>It's written in a different style,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's been more or less brought into </v>

1712
01:34:50.581 --> 01:34:52.810
<v Speaker 4>narrative coherence with the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

1713
01:34:53.170 --> 01:34:58.170
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could say at the level of the </v>

1714
01:34:58.170 --> 01:34:58.170
<v Speaker 4>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is paradoxes,</v>

1715
01:34:58.170 --> 01:35:01.280
<v Speaker 4>but at the level of the chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say the stories make sense.</v>

1716
01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:06.600
<v Speaker 4>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what happens up there went from the </v>

1717
01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:06.600
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a mist,</v>

1718
01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:11.111
<v Speaker 4>and it watered the whole face of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground and the Lord God formed man of </v>

1719
01:35:11.111 --> 01:35:14.351
<v Speaker 4>the dust of the ground and breathed into</v>
<v Speaker 4>his nostrils the breath of life and man </v>

1720
01:35:14.351 --> 01:35:16.560
<v Speaker 4>became a living soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an identity in this archaic sort</v>

1721
01:35:16.561 --> 01:35:19.820
<v Speaker 4>of thought between breath and spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right respiration,</v>

1722
01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.620
<v Speaker 4>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inspiration,</v>

1723
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:25.340
<v Speaker 4>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pneuma like pneumatic tire spirit.</v>

1724
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.770
<v Speaker 4>The breath contains the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1725
01:35:27.771 --> 01:35:28.550
<v Speaker 4>why is that?</v>

1726
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:30.020
<v Speaker 4>Well?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when people die,</v>

1727
01:35:30.021 --> 01:35:35.021
<v Speaker 4>the breath leaves their body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it's an easy thing to identify </v>

1728
01:35:35.021 --> 01:35:36.040
<v Speaker 4>that with the animating spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now,</v>

1729
01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:38.480
<v Speaker 4>anima means spirit as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1730
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:42.380
<v Speaker 4>so that's the phenomenological reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the story.</v>

1731
01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.790
<v Speaker 4>And Lord God planted a garden eastward </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Eden and there he put the man whom he</v>

1732
01:35:46.791 --> 01:35:50.150
<v Speaker 4>had formed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eden means well watered place.</v>

1733
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:51.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

1734
01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:52.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where do you want to live?</v>

1735
01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:53.990
<v Speaker 4>These are desert people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1736
01:35:53.991 --> 01:35:54.830
<v Speaker 4>Who are writing this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1737
01:35:54.831 --> 01:35:56.550
<v Speaker 4>what do they want?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want an oasis.</v>

1738
01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.130
<v Speaker 4>What's an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's an oasis?</v>

1739
01:35:58.131 --> 01:36:03.131
<v Speaker 4>It's a garden with water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While you're gonna you're gonna live </v>

1740
01:36:03.131 --> 01:36:05.621
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to be out in the middle </v>

1741
01:36:05.621 --> 01:36:06.791
<v Speaker 4>of the damn desert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to be in a garden that's </v>

1742
01:36:06.791 --> 01:36:09.821
<v Speaker 4>watered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you could say you also be in a </v>

1743
01:36:09.821 --> 01:36:09.821
<v Speaker 4>walled garden that's protected and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what paradise means.</v>

1744
01:36:09.821 --> 01:36:12.110
<v Speaker 4>Paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A means walled garden.</v>

1745
01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.930
<v Speaker 4>So this initial paradise is a walled </v>
<v Speaker 4>garden.</v>

1746
01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:18.320
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Walled order culture,</v>

1747
01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.240
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it mean?</v>

1748
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:25.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the natural environment of human </v>

1749
01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:25.360
<v Speaker 4>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1750
01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.230
<v Speaker 4>It's the optimal balance between culture</v>
<v Speaker 4>and nature.</v>

1751
01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:32.260
<v Speaker 4>That's what a walled garden is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with enough water flowing in it to keep </v>

1752
01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:35.591
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep it fertile and that water is </v>

1753
01:36:35.591 --> 01:36:35.591
<v Speaker 4>also chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1754
01:36:35.591 --> 01:36:38.630
<v Speaker 4>There has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't be static and dry and solid and</v>

1755
01:36:38.631 --> 01:36:43.631
<v Speaker 4>stale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There has to be some living element to </v>

1756
01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:43.631
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

1757
01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:46.810
<v Speaker 4>So it's a walled place that the water </v>
<v Speaker 4>can still fruit,</v>

1758
01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.260
<v Speaker 4>defy</v>

1759
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:53.950
<v Speaker 4>and out of the ground made the Lord God </v>
<v Speaker 4>to grow every tree that is pleasant to </v>

1760
01:36:53.950 --> 01:36:54.320
<v Speaker 4>the sight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's also full of trees.</v>

1761
01:36:54.321 --> 01:36:57.380
<v Speaker 4>This is our natural habitat and good for</v>
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

1762
01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.860
<v Speaker 4>The tree of life also in the midst of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the garden and the tree of the knowledge</v>

1763
01:37:00.861 --> 01:37:02.900
<v Speaker 4>of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these are two trees,</v>

1764
01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:05.330
<v Speaker 4>they bring forth fruit that produced </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1765
01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.360
<v Speaker 4>One produces the knowledge of good and </v>
<v Speaker 4>evil and the other producers eternal </v>

1766
01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.200
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why?</v>

1767
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get to that emit and a river went </v>

1768
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:20.331
<v Speaker 4>out of Eden to water the garden and from</v>
<v Speaker 4>dance it was parted and became into </v>

1769
01:37:20.331 --> 01:37:22.070
<v Speaker 4>foreheads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We won't bother with that.</v>

1770
01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:25.460
<v Speaker 4>So now God has having a little chat with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam and he says,</v>

1771
01:37:25.461 --> 01:37:30.461
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can eat every tree of the garden </v>

1772
01:37:30.461 --> 01:37:30.620
<v Speaker 4>except one of the tree of the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 4>of good and evil.</v>

1773
01:37:30.621 --> 01:37:33.650
<v Speaker 4>You don't eat that because in the day </v>
<v Speaker 4>you eat,</v>

1774
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:36.860
<v Speaker 4>you'll surely die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you might ask,</v>

1775
01:37:36.861 --> 01:37:39.590
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is the tree put there to begin with?</v>

1776
01:37:39.591 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 4>And well the answer to that is who the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hell knows?</v>

1777
01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:44.660
<v Speaker 4>That's how the story portrays it and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know.</v>

1778
01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:53.200
<v Speaker 4>And the Lord God said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is not good that the man should be </v>

1779
01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.571
<v Speaker 4>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will make a help meet for him and out </v>

1780
01:37:55.571 --> 01:37:55.571
<v Speaker 4>of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Lord God formed every beast,</v>

1781
01:37:55.571 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 4>the field and every fall</v>

1782
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:01.070
<v Speaker 2>of the year and brought them unto Adam </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see what he would call them and </v>

1783
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:02.580
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever Adam called every living </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature that was the name thereof.</v>

1784
01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 2>So that's an echo of the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power of the word.</v>

1785
01:38:05.731 --> 01:38:10.731
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though these stories are from </v>

1786
01:38:10.731 --> 01:38:10.731
<v Speaker 2>different traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're separate traditions.</v>

1787
01:38:10.731 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 2>You see at the beginning that God uses </v>
<v Speaker 2>his word to bring order out of chaos.</v>

1788
01:38:14.311 --> 01:38:19.311
<v Speaker 2>And then he allows Adam in some sense to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the same thing is that there's this </v>

1789
01:38:19.311 --> 01:38:23.960
<v Speaker 2>unarticulated plethora of being and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>man comes along and says that's that.</v>

1790
01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

1791
01:38:25.561 --> 01:38:28.440
<v Speaker 2>And that brings them into a higher order</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of being.</v>

1792
01:38:28.441 --> 01:38:31.350
<v Speaker 2>So it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a replication of the creation in a,</v>

1793
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:36.590
<v Speaker 2>in a shrunken form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Adam gave names to all the cattle </v>

1794
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:39.870
<v Speaker 2>cattle or just anything that has four </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs roughly speaking and to the fowl of</v>

1795
01:38:39.871 --> 01:38:41.550
<v Speaker 2>the air and to every beast of the field.</v>

1796
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:46.910
<v Speaker 2>But for Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was not found to help meet for </v>

1797
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:49.041
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to </v>

1798
01:38:49.041 --> 01:38:52.161
<v Speaker 2>fall upon Adam and he slept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he took one of his ribs and closed </v>

1799
01:38:52.161 --> 01:38:52.680
<v Speaker 2>up the flesh instead thereof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the rib,</v>

1800
01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:54.900
<v Speaker 2>which the Lord God had taken from </v>
<v Speaker 2>manmade,</v>

1801
01:38:54.901 --> 01:38:57.180
<v Speaker 2>he a woman and brought her unto the man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Adam said,</v>

1802
01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:59.820
<v Speaker 2>this is now bone of my bones and flesh </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my flesh.</v>

1803
01:38:59.821 --> 01:39:02.700
<v Speaker 2>She shall be called woman because she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was taken out of man.</v>

1804
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:08.270
<v Speaker 2>And then there's an injunction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore a man shall leave his father </v>

1805
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.790
<v Speaker 2>and his mother and shall cleave unto his</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife.</v>

1806
01:39:08.791 --> 01:39:11.080
<v Speaker 2>And they shall be one flesh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while there's also a,</v>

1807
01:39:11.170 --> 01:39:16.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a moral injunction there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea is that the two beings </v>

1808
01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:19.230
<v Speaker 2>that have been created are actually not </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole until they're one thing.</v>

1809
01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once they're joined together,</v>

1810
01:39:21.061 --> 01:39:26.061
<v Speaker 2>that's supposed to be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that one thing is actually a more </v>

1811
01:39:26.061 --> 01:39:28.230
<v Speaker 2>perfect entity than the two things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are a part.</v>

1812
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.040
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually part of the sacred </v>

1813
01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.501
<v Speaker 2>basis of the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of monogamous relationships in western </v>

1814
01:39:36.501 --> 01:39:38.070
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were both naked,</v>

1815
01:39:38.071 --> 01:39:39.870
<v Speaker 2>the man and his wife and were not </v>
<v Speaker 2>ashamed.</v>

1816
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.460
<v Speaker 2>A crucial piece of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what exactly does that mean?</v>

1817
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first question is what does it mean </v>

1818
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:52.750
<v Speaker 2>to be naked?</v>

1819
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:56.910
<v Speaker 2>And so that's something that I thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a lot in relationship and there's </v>

1820
01:39:56.910 --> 01:40:00.930
<v Speaker 2>a relationship there with shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first question is what does it </v>

1821
01:40:02.051 --> 01:40:07.051
<v Speaker 2>mean to be naked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second question is what does it </v>

1822
01:40:07.051 --> 01:40:08.020
<v Speaker 2>mean to be not ashamed of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While there's an.</v>

1823
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:13.100
<v Speaker 2>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say there an implication of a </v>

1824
01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.700
<v Speaker 2>kind of unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Adam and Eve existed in this paradise</v>

1825
01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.270
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

1826
01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:23.340
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the capacity for self </v>

1827
01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:23.340
<v Speaker 2>reflection there no selfconsciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1828
01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would I say that?</v>

1829
01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Because there's very little difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between self consciousness and shame.</v>

1830
01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:33.360
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do psychometric analysis of the </v>

1831
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.660
<v Speaker 2>state of self consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it loads with neuroticism,</v>

1832
01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:37.090
<v Speaker 2>so loads with anxiety and emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>

1833
01:40:37.091 --> 01:40:42.091
<v Speaker 2>So to become self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to become self </v>

1834
01:40:42.091 --> 01:40:42.640
<v Speaker 2>conscious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes,</v>

1835
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:47.790
<v Speaker 2>it means you become aware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One way of thinking about it as you </v>

1836
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:49.420
<v Speaker 2>become aware of your vulnerability or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another is that you become aware of your</v>

1837
01:40:49.421 --> 01:40:51.010
<v Speaker 2>insufficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1838
01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:53.080
<v Speaker 2>so let's say that you're standing up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front,</v>

1839
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>a crowd talking</v>

1840
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:57.460
<v Speaker 4>and you become self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens?</v>

1841
01:40:57.610 --> 01:40:59.230
<v Speaker 4>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't talk anymore.</v>

1842
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.980
<v Speaker 4>The second is he kind of fall inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The third is you feel ashamed,</v>

1843
01:41:02.981 --> 01:41:05.530
<v Speaker 4>and the fourth is that you retreat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you look down,</v>

1844
01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:10.770
<v Speaker 4>so it's a low status operation and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with heightened anxiety and </v>

1845
01:41:11.351 --> 01:41:12.280
<v Speaker 4>so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1846
01:41:12.281 --> 01:41:15.070
<v Speaker 4>why would you become self conscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>before a crowd?</v>

1847
01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:17.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the answer is they can see you,</v>

1848
01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:23.340
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can judge you and you can make </v>

1849
01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.981
<v Speaker 4>an error in front of them and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a fool of yourself so they put you </v>

1850
01:41:25.981 --> 01:41:25.981
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>

1851
01:41:25.981 --> 01:41:30.180
<v Speaker 4>You can display yourself in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 4>that ratchets you down the dominance </v>

1852
01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:33.631
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's to become self conscious and so </v>

1853
01:41:33.631 --> 01:41:35.740
<v Speaker 4>well at least you have the advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being covered up in front of the crowd,</v>

1854
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:38.650
<v Speaker 4>but let's say all of a sudden you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>stripped of your clothes.</v>

1855
01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:40.990
<v Speaker 4>So what's the problem with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1856
01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:46.320
<v Speaker 4>all of your insufficiencies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say are on painful display.</v>

1857
01:41:46.631 --> 01:41:50.110
<v Speaker 4>You can be evaluated by everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even more importantly than that,</v>

1858
01:41:50.111 --> 01:41:55.111
<v Speaker 4>if possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that close to actually protect the </v>

1859
01:41:55.111 --> 01:41:56.440
<v Speaker 4>most vulnerable parts of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human beings are upright animals,</v>

1860
01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:58.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're very strange animals.</v>

1861
01:41:58.810 --> 01:42:01.690
<v Speaker 4>You take a cat or a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're basically armored.</v>

1862
01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:05.050
<v Speaker 4>The part of them that you see their back</v>
<v Speaker 4>is heavily armored,</v>

1863
01:42:05.051 --> 01:42:07.780
<v Speaker 4>heavily protected human being stretched </v>
<v Speaker 4>upright,</v>

1864
01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:11.290
<v Speaker 4>and so the softest part of parts of us </v>
<v Speaker 4>are there for display,</v>

1865
01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 4>but also were displayed as sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>creatures too,</v>

1866
01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:20.010
<v Speaker 4>and so to become,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be naked and not ashamed of it is to </v>

1867
01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:23.371
<v Speaker 4>lack self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is that the Adam and eve in </v>

1868
01:42:23.371 --> 01:42:24.880
<v Speaker 4>the original state in the garden lacks </v>
<v Speaker 4>self consciousness.</v>

1869
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:33.030
<v Speaker 4>Now the serpent was more subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Subtle is an interesting word here </v>

1870
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:36.451
<v Speaker 4>because it means kind of foglight and </v>
<v Speaker 4>vague and difficult to detect.</v>

1871
01:42:36.611 --> 01:42:39.010
<v Speaker 4>So it's something that that lurks in is </v>
<v Speaker 4>hidden.</v>

1872
01:42:39.190 --> 01:42:43.180
<v Speaker 4>So that's what the serpent is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in the domain of hidden things than</v>

1873
01:42:43.181 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 4>any beast of the field,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which the Lord God had made.</v>

1874
01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.790
<v Speaker 4>And the serpent said unto the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1875
01:42:48.791 --> 01:42:51.190
<v Speaker 4>hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God said you shouldn't eat of every tree</v>

1876
01:42:51.191 --> 01:42:52.750
<v Speaker 4>of the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the woman said,</v>

1877
01:42:52.751 --> 01:42:54.160
<v Speaker 4>we may eat of the fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the trees,</v>

1878
01:42:54.161 --> 01:42:55.990
<v Speaker 4>of the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of the fruit of the tree,</v>

1879
01:42:55.991 --> 01:42:58.480
<v Speaker 4>which is in the middle of the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the central fruit,</v>

1880
01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:00.940
<v Speaker 4>God has said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] shall not eat of it.</v>

1881
01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:03.220
<v Speaker 4>Neither shall you touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lest you die.</v>

1882
01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:08.730
<v Speaker 4>The serpent said unto the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shall not surely die for God knows </v>

1883
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:13.830
<v Speaker 4>that in the day you eat thereof,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your eyes will be opened and you </v>

1884
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.990
<v Speaker 4>will be as gods knowing good and evil.</v>

1885
01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.710
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's another implication there.</v>

1886
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:22.950
<v Speaker 4>We already saw that there's an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the implication that Adam and </v>

1887
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:26.221
<v Speaker 4>eve are not self conscious and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the implication that their eyes </v>

1888
01:43:26.221 --> 01:43:27.430
<v Speaker 4>aren't open or at least that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

1889
01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.740
<v Speaker 4>They're not open fully in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not open,</v>

1890
01:43:29.741 --> 01:43:32.200
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

1891
01:43:32.410 --> 01:43:35.980
<v Speaker 4>And that seems to be associated somehow </v>
<v Speaker 4>with death in some strange way.</v>

1892
01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1893
01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.970
<v Speaker 4>and it's the serpent talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman.</v>

1894
01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:43.570
<v Speaker 4>So the serpent is that is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>temperature of the woman.</v>

1895
01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.570
<v Speaker 4>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why in the world would that be?</v>

1896
01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:51.900
<v Speaker 4>I showed you those representations of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mary holding the infant up in air with </v>

1897
01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:53.240
<v Speaker 4>her foot on the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you think,</v>

1898
01:43:53.241 --> 01:43:55.130
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's more self conscious,</v>

1899
01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.820
<v Speaker 4>women or men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the answer to that is women are more</v>

1900
01:43:58.821 --> 01:44:03.821
<v Speaker 4>self conscious than meant and even </v>
<v Speaker 4>further you might say that women taught </v>

1901
01:44:03.821 --> 01:44:05.300
<v Speaker 4>men to be self conscious and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>that to be the case.</v>

1902
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:07.760
<v Speaker 4>Maybe babies taught women to be self </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious,</v>

1903
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.210
<v Speaker 4>but women taught men to be self </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious and they still teach them that</v>

1904
01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:16.211
<v Speaker 4>all the time because there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes a man more self conscious </v>

1905
01:44:16.211 --> 01:44:17.600
<v Speaker 4>that to be rejected by a woman that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>desires.</v>

1906
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:23.050
<v Speaker 4>So the woman is always offering </v>
<v Speaker 4>selfconsciousness demand and it isn't </v>

1907
01:44:23.050 --> 01:44:26.540
<v Speaker 4>necessarily a gift that they exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciate and that Motif of course runs</v>

1908
01:44:26.541 --> 01:44:31.541
<v Speaker 4>through the Adam and Eve story centrally</v>
<v Speaker 4>because eve is damned forever in some </v>

1909
01:44:31.541 --> 01:44:33.620
<v Speaker 4>sense for making them self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1910
01:44:33.621 --> 01:44:38.621
<v Speaker 4>he didn't want to be self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things were pretty good when his eyes </v>

1911
01:44:38.621 --> 01:44:41.471
<v Speaker 4>were closed and new is wandering around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not worrying about whether he was naked </v>

1912
01:44:41.471 --> 01:44:41.471
<v Speaker 4>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1913
01:44:41.471 --> 01:44:43.190
<v Speaker 4>the women became self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1914
01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.620
<v Speaker 4>Because of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1915
01:44:45.621 --> 01:44:48.770
<v Speaker 4>maybe right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's exactly what happened,</v>

1916
01:44:48.771 --> 01:44:52.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she imagined we're being preyed upon for</v>

1917
01:44:52.191 --> 01:44:54.440
<v Speaker 4>millions of years by predatory reptiles.</v>

1918
01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:59.440
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we become more and more alert to </v>

1919
01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:01.391
<v Speaker 4>threat and more and more alert to threat</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then one day we get so alert to </v>

1920
01:45:01.391 --> 01:45:05.381
<v Speaker 4>threat that we can see threat lurking in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the future and then all of a sudden we </v>

1921
01:45:05.381 --> 01:45:09.821
<v Speaker 4>become aware of the future and then we </v>
<v Speaker 4>become aware of death and then we're </v>

1922
01:45:09.821 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 4>really self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's pretty good if you want to keep</v>

1923
01:45:10.881 --> 01:45:15.881
<v Speaker 4>the snakes down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we've been doing quite </v>

1924
01:45:15.881 --> 01:45:15.920
<v Speaker 4>successfully ever since then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a big price to pay.</v>

1925
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:21.250
<v Speaker 4>We got so damn sensitive to threat that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we were finally able to conceive the </v>

1926
01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:23.120
<v Speaker 4>ultimate threat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not proximal threats,</v>

1927
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:28.390
<v Speaker 4>but the fact of threat itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact of mortality itself and the </v>

1928
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:32.231
<v Speaker 4>fact of finitude itself and maybe women </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned that because they become </v>

1929
01:45:32.231 --> 01:45:36.080
<v Speaker 4>painfully aware of the mortal </v>
<v Speaker 4>limitations of their infants first.</v>

1930
01:45:36.081 --> 01:45:39.430
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This small thing could die,</v>

1931
01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:44.980
<v Speaker 4>could end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it'll certainly as an object of </v>

1932
01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:48.281
<v Speaker 4>predation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can imagine God only knows how </v>

1933
01:45:48.281 --> 01:45:48.920
<v Speaker 4>many infants human beings last to </v>
<v Speaker 4>predators.</v>

1934
01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:53.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told you at one point I believe that </v>

1935
01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.490
<v Speaker 4>there was a cat that was found that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a,</v>

1936
01:45:55.540 --> 01:46:00.540
<v Speaker 4>that had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a skull and jaws that were </v>

1937
01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:03.230
<v Speaker 4>specialized for biting the skulls of </v>
<v Speaker 4>protocol.</v>

1938
01:46:03.231 --> 01:46:08.231
<v Speaker 4>Humans one long tooth at the back that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would drive right through the back of </v>

1939
01:46:08.231 --> 01:46:12.491
<v Speaker 4>the skull so the cat could put its teeth</v>
<v Speaker 4>here and drive the tooth right into the </v>

1940
01:46:12.491 --> 01:46:16.271
<v Speaker 4>back of the skull so you know that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good enough dragon for are for all </v>

1941
01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:18.290
<v Speaker 4>intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

1942
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:24.910
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the snake comes along and opens the </v>

1943
01:46:24.910 --> 01:46:26.861
<v Speaker 4>woman's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the woman saw that the tree was </v>

1944
01:46:26.861 --> 01:46:30.551
<v Speaker 4>good for food and that it was pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the eye and it treated to be desired </v>

1945
01:46:30.551 --> 01:46:33.881
<v Speaker 4>to make one wise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she took of the fruit thereof and did </v>

1946
01:46:33.881 --> 01:46:36.761
<v Speaker 4>eat and gave also unto her husband with </v>
<v Speaker 4>her and he did eat and the eyes of both </v>

1947
01:46:36.761 --> 01:46:41.501
<v Speaker 4>of them were opened and they knew that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were naked and they sewed fig </v>

1948
01:46:41.501 --> 01:46:41.501
<v Speaker 4>leaves together and made themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>aprons.</v>

1949
01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.670
<v Speaker 4>While there's a lot happening in those </v>
<v Speaker 4>few lines,</v>

1950
01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.940
<v Speaker 4>now there's a fruit thing going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1951
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:48.620
<v Speaker 4>snake and fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1952
01:46:48.621 --> 01:46:50.820
<v Speaker 4>so we know from Lynn is bell </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothetically,</v>

1953
01:46:50.821 --> 01:46:55.821
<v Speaker 4>that the reason that primates like us </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed our intense vision is because </v>

1954
01:46:55.821 --> 01:46:57.630
<v Speaker 4>we evolve with snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The snakes opened her eyes.</v>

1955
01:46:57.631 --> 01:47:01.760
<v Speaker 4>What about fruit color vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1956
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:06.800
<v Speaker 4>Why to detect ripe fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know that and our women and ripe </v>

1957
01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:07.630
<v Speaker 4>fruit the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1958
01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.790
<v Speaker 4>they're the same in so far as it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>women offering the ripe fruit and that's</v>

1959
01:47:11.791 --> 01:47:13.710
<v Speaker 4>undoubtedly something that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1960
01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:18.180
<v Speaker 4>the hypothetical idea is the males </v>
<v Speaker 4>haunted bring home protein.</v>

1961
01:47:18.181 --> 01:47:20.670
<v Speaker 4>The women gather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are they gathering?</v>

1962
01:47:20.730 --> 01:47:25.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're gathering at at minimum ripe </v>

1963
01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:27.060
<v Speaker 4>fruit and then what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're sharing it.</v>

1964
01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:32.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you also bring about a moral obligation </v>

1965
01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:32.620
<v Speaker 4>when you're sharing food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1966
01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:34.530
<v Speaker 4>There's an invitation to reciprocity </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1967
01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:40.040
<v Speaker 4>and so the fact that women were sharing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say ripe fruit with men also </v>

1968
01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:40.830
<v Speaker 4>brings them into there.</v>

1969
01:47:41.610 --> 01:47:46.610
<v Speaker 4>What would you call builds up the basis </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the potential of a reciprocal moral </v>

1970
01:47:46.610 --> 01:47:47.190
<v Speaker 4>obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that,</v>

1971
01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:52.170
<v Speaker 4>and the problem again for men with being</v>
<v Speaker 4>allied with women and infants is that it</v>

1972
01:47:52.171 --> 01:47:57.171
<v Speaker 4>also heightens their self consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're a lot tougher and more </v>

1973
01:47:57.171 --> 01:47:58.050
<v Speaker 4>indomitable safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just you,</v>

1974
01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:03.260
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as you have a wife say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you also have an infant while </v>

1975
01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:06.060
<v Speaker 4>all the burden of their self </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and their vulnerability is</v>

1976
01:48:06.061 --> 01:48:07.590
<v Speaker 4>placed upon you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1977
01:48:07.591 --> 01:48:09.300
<v Speaker 4>it's a hell of a bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1978
01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.850
<v Speaker 4>why did men except the bargain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1979
01:48:12.150 --> 01:48:15.960
<v Speaker 4>it's partly because women stood in front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of them offering them fruit,</v>

1980
01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:16.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1981
01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.220
<v Speaker 4>prior to the price that the men paid for</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was to wake the hell up.</v>

1982
01:48:20.490 --> 01:48:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the hell wants that?</v>

1983
01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot more calming to remain asleep</v>

1984
01:48:26.251 --> 01:48:31.251
<v Speaker 4>with no knowledge of the sort of burden </v>
<v Speaker 4>of mortality that you would bear if you </v>

1985
01:48:31.251 --> 01:48:31.350
<v Speaker 4>became self conscious.</v>

1986
01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.350
<v Speaker 4>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now they're done with it.</v>

1987
01:48:34.351 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the snake and the fruit woke them up and</v>

1988
01:48:36.451 --> 01:48:41.010
<v Speaker 4>they can see and the scales drop from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rise and so we can really see.</v>

1989
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what does that mean?</v>

1990
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:45.570
<v Speaker 4>Half our brain is visual is devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>visual processing,</v>

1991
01:48:45.810 --> 01:48:47.240
<v Speaker 4>so as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as,</v>

1992
01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:52.310
<v Speaker 4>as her eyes got better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our brain got bigger and bigger and </v>

1993
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:53.040
<v Speaker 4>bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens when it gets big enough?</v>

1994
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only can you see,</v>

1995
01:48:54.871 --> 01:48:58.650
<v Speaker 4>you can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can start to see into the future.</v>

1996
01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.660
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what happened to us.</v>

1997
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:05.870
<v Speaker 4>Not only could we see with her eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could see with our imagination and </v>

1998
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:08.610
<v Speaker 4>our imagination is our are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see with your eyes closed,</v>

1999
01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Close your eyes,</v>

2000
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:14.010
<v Speaker 4>bring up a vision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can imagine the future.</v>

2001
01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you seeing?</v>

2002
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:18.360
<v Speaker 4>You're seeing a potential future with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your eyes closed,</v>

2003
01:49:18.450 --> 01:49:19.650
<v Speaker 4>the circuitries there.</v>

2004
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Once it's developed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can use it to imagine.</v>

2005
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:27.680
<v Speaker 4>You can project your project,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your vision into places that don't even </v>

2006
01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.850
<v Speaker 4>exist and you can start to conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 4>the future.</v>

2007
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:32.520
<v Speaker 4>What happens when you conceptualize the </v>
<v Speaker 4>future?</v>

2008
01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:33.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a.</v>

2009
01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:38.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm spoiling the punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to work because you can see the</v>

2010
01:49:38.251 --> 01:49:39.270
<v Speaker 4>future coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Think,</v>

2011
01:49:39.271 --> 01:49:40.500
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the future's coming.</v>

2012
01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:44.610
<v Speaker 4>It isn't just the present anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to just worry about whether</v>

2013
01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:47.140
<v Speaker 4>or not I'm hungry right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to worry about whether</v>

2014
01:49:47.141 --> 01:49:49.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm hungry tomorrow and next week and </v>
<v Speaker 4>next month and next year,</v>

2015
01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 4>and for me and for my wife and for my </v>
<v Speaker 4>child and for the community.</v>

2016
01:49:53.950 --> 01:49:58.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can forget about your day </v>
<v Speaker 4>to day existence in paradise.</v>

2017
01:49:58.001 --> 01:50:03.001
<v Speaker 4>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no evidence that people in </v>

2018
01:50:03.001 --> 01:50:05.611
<v Speaker 4>industrialized societies are happier </v>
<v Speaker 4>than people in non industrialized </v>

2019
01:50:05.611 --> 01:50:05.611
<v Speaker 4>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

2020
01:50:05.611 --> 01:50:05.950
<v Speaker 4>quite the contrary.</v>

2021
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:07.810
<v Speaker 4>We're less happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2022
01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:11.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we fully and constantly bear the</v>

2023
01:50:11.411 --> 01:50:13.090
<v Speaker 4>burden of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2024
01:50:13.091 --> 01:50:18.091
<v Speaker 4>that's good because we don't die and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>lived maybe 30 years longer and we have </v>

2025
01:50:18.091 --> 01:50:20.170
<v Speaker 4>fewer horrible diseases and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean it's any picnic.</v>

2026
01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:22.900
<v Speaker 4>You have to carry that along with you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever you go.</v>

2027
01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:25.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the burden of self consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2028
01:50:25.451 --> 01:50:30.451
<v Speaker 4>And that's exactly what happens when God</v>
<v Speaker 4>finds out that Adam and eve have become </v>

2029
01:50:30.451 --> 01:50:33.601
<v Speaker 4>self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one of the first things he says is </v>

2030
01:50:33.601 --> 01:50:33.601
<v Speaker 4>jigs up now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2031
01:50:33.601 --> 01:50:36.820
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be working forever </v>
<v Speaker 4>toiling forever.</v>

2032
01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:39.160
<v Speaker 4>It's your destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no escaping from it.</v>

2033
01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:41.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings work.</v>

2034
01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:46.260
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sacrifice the present for the </v>

2035
01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:49.621
<v Speaker 4>future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's partly as soon as this </v>

2036
01:50:49.621 --> 01:50:49.621
<v Speaker 4>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next story,</v>

2037
01:50:49.621 --> 01:50:52.150
<v Speaker 4>which is cain and enable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see the Motif of sacrifice emerge,</v>

2038
01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:52.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2039
01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 4>That story circulates around the Motif </v>
<v Speaker 4>of sacrifice,</v>

2040
01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:58.110
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice the present for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2041
01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:01.330
<v Speaker 4>what's the price you pay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get the present.</v>

2042
01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:03.430
<v Speaker 4>That's a big price,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2043
01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Because what you do is what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially is you're taking all the </v>

2044
01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:12.061
<v Speaker 4>potential suffering of the future and </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting it into the present all the </v>

2045
01:51:12.061 --> 01:51:13.060
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2046
01:51:13.061 --> 01:51:14.140
<v Speaker 4>so what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2047
01:51:14.141 --> 01:51:16.420
<v Speaker 4>maybe you live longer and live </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthier,</v>

2048
01:51:16.421 --> 01:51:20.440
<v Speaker 4>but you're not without the burden that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that puts on you.</v>

2049
01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:25.960
<v Speaker 4>So the eyes of them were both opened and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they knew they were naked.</v>

2050
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:27.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what does that mean?</v>

2051
01:51:27.070 --> 01:51:28.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is naked mean?</v>

2052
01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:31.780
<v Speaker 4>It means you know you're vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what it means.</v>

2053
01:51:31.781 --> 01:51:36.781
<v Speaker 4>They know they're vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they sewed fig leaves together and </v>

2054
01:51:36.781 --> 01:51:38.560
<v Speaker 4>make themselves aprons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is they wake up,</v>

2055
01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:40.510
<v Speaker 4>their eyes open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know they're vulnerable,</v>

2056
01:51:40.511 --> 01:51:41.710
<v Speaker 4>so they discover the future.</v>

2057
01:51:41.710 --> 01:51:44.290
<v Speaker 4>They discover their vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 4>extended into the future,</v>

2058
01:51:44.291 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 4>and the first thing they do is build </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>

2059
01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the fig leaves.</v>

2060
01:51:47.381 --> 01:51:48.400
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2061
01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:53.760
<v Speaker 4>here's the vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We put a barrier between us and the </v>

2062
01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:53.760
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a wall,</v>

2063
01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because this is externalized clothing.</v>

2064
01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:00.720
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so to put that clothing on,</v>

2065
01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:03.160
<v Speaker 4>this is clothing as a human universal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

2066
01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:06.100
<v Speaker 4>Now sometimes it's only used for </v>
<v Speaker 4>decorative purposes,</v>

2067
01:52:06.101 --> 01:52:08.500
<v Speaker 4>but far more often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in cold climates,</v>

2068
01:52:08.501 --> 01:52:13.501
<v Speaker 4>it's used for protection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to clothe yourself is to recognize </v>

2069
01:52:13.931 --> 01:52:17.020
<v Speaker 4>your vulnerability and to use culture to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold it at bay.</v>

2070
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:22.470
<v Speaker 4>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made themselves aprons and they </v>

2071
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:23.830
<v Speaker 4>heard the voice of the Lord God walking </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the garden in the cool of the day,</v>

2072
01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:30.060
<v Speaker 4>and Adam and his wife hid themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the presence of the Lord God among </v>

2073
01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:30.060
<v Speaker 4>the trees of the garden.</v>

2074
01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:33.340
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So before Adam and eve wake up,</v>

2075
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:36.070
<v Speaker 4>before they realize they're vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't hide from God.</v>

2076
01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:38.740
<v Speaker 4>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2077
01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:43.200
<v Speaker 4>he's the spirit that goes into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown to,</v>

2078
01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.610
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2079
01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:46.580
<v Speaker 4>to conquer it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to make the world.</v>

2080
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:48.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say that's what you're supposed</v>

2081
01:52:48.441 --> 01:52:51.380
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to mediate between chaos</v>

2082
01:52:51.381 --> 01:52:52.760
<v Speaker 4>and order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2083
01:52:52.761 --> 01:52:54.470
<v Speaker 4>And you were supposed to do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>forthrightly,</v>

2084
01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:57.290
<v Speaker 4>so then the question is what the Hell's </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopping you?</v>

2085
01:52:57.830 --> 01:53:01.400
<v Speaker 4>And that answer's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your knowledge of your vulnerability.</v>

2086
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:03.770
<v Speaker 4>Obviously that's what stopping you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2087
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:06.740
<v Speaker 4>why aren't you courageous and </v>
<v Speaker 4>forthright?</v>

2088
01:53:07.130 --> 01:53:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can be cut off at the knees </v>

2089
01:53:12.130 --> 01:53:13.910
<v Speaker 4>and terribly hurt and so you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>shrink back from that responsibility and</v>

2090
01:53:13.911 --> 01:53:15.200
<v Speaker 4>it's no bloody wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2091
01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:20.260
<v Speaker 4>It's obviously what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the Lord God calls them to Adam.</v>

2092
01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:25.150
<v Speaker 4>So He's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that means for the,</v>

2093
01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:28.310
<v Speaker 4>for God to call on you is to say for God</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>

2094
01:53:28.311 --> 01:53:31.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm I want to act through you or I want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to act with you.</v>

2095
01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:32.930
<v Speaker 4>Have that spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say.</v>

2096
01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:34.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam says,</v>

2097
01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:38.270
<v Speaker 4>I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard God says to Adam,</v>

2098
01:53:38.271 --> 01:53:39.980
<v Speaker 4>where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam says,</v>

2099
01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:42.710
<v Speaker 4>I heard your voice in the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2100
01:53:42.711 --> 01:53:46.880
<v Speaker 4>I heard the call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was afraid because I was naked and</v>

2101
01:53:46.881 --> 01:53:47.960
<v Speaker 4>I hid myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2102
01:53:47.961 --> 01:53:52.961
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what human beings are </v>

2103
01:53:52.961 --> 01:53:54.581
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's precisely exactly what we're </v>

2104
01:53:54.581 --> 01:53:54.590
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We hear the call,</v>

2105
01:53:54.591 --> 01:53:56.840
<v Speaker 4>but we hide and we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is it's.</v>

2106
01:53:57.090 --> 01:54:02.090
<v Speaker 4>There's good reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not something trivial and God said,</v>

2107
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:06.230
<v Speaker 4>who told you you were naked?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you eat the tree that I told you you</v>

2108
01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:11.240
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't eat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the man says the man doesn't come </v>

2109
01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:11.420
<v Speaker 4>off very well in this particular phrase </v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

2110
01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:16.540
<v Speaker 4>and there's actually quite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is actually quite a comedic story </v>

2111
01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:17.360
<v Speaker 4>except that it's also a catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 4>tragedy.</v>

2112
01:54:17.490 --> 01:54:22.130
<v Speaker 4>It's like God calls out him out like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's with you now?</v>

2113
01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:24.080
<v Speaker 4>You know you're hiding from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2114
01:54:24.081 --> 01:54:26.540
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing out of him does it </v>
<v Speaker 4>says it's her fault.</v>

2115
01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:28.790
<v Speaker 4>It's her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She made me self conscious.</v>

2116
01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:30.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see that in resentful.</v>

2117
01:54:30.471 --> 01:54:35.471
<v Speaker 4>Men All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're very antipathetic towards women </v>

2118
01:54:35.471 --> 01:54:39.670
<v Speaker 4>and they blame their misery and </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentment on the fact that women won't </v>

2119
01:54:39.670 --> 01:54:41.660
<v Speaker 4>have anything to do with them while the </v>
<v Speaker 4>women are making them self conscious for</v>

2120
01:54:41.661 --> 01:54:43.820
<v Speaker 4>not being old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should be because the women think,</v>

2121
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:48.970
<v Speaker 4>why should I bother with you if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not the embodiment of the spirit that </v>

2122
01:54:48.970 --> 01:54:50.210
<v Speaker 4>will move into the unknown and and face </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Leviathan,</v>

2123
01:54:50.211 --> 01:54:51.800
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what she should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

2124
01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:52.820
<v Speaker 4>And you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2125
01:54:52.821 --> 01:54:54.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2126
01:54:54.501 --> 01:54:56.510
<v Speaker 4>but I'd like women to like me anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2127
01:54:56.511 --> 01:54:57.890
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck with that.</v>

2128
01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:02.980
<v Speaker 4>So that doesn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so instead of getting your act </v>

2129
01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:02.980
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you say those God damn women,</v>

2130
01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:04.130
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what Adam says to God.</v>

2131
01:55:04.130 --> 01:55:04.610
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2132
01:55:04.630 --> 01:55:06.560
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be laying this on my feet.</v>

2133
01:55:06.561 --> 01:55:11.561
<v Speaker 4>It's the woman you made her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She made me all self conscious and </v>

2134
01:55:11.561 --> 01:55:11.780
<v Speaker 4>cowardly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like brilliant,</v>

2135
01:55:11.781 --> 01:55:13.040
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderful.</v>

2136
01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.950
<v Speaker 4>And God says to the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did you do?</v>

2137
01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.240
<v Speaker 4>And the woman said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2138
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:22.330
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the serpent that confused me and </v>

2139
01:55:22.330 --> 01:55:22.760
<v Speaker 4>I ate well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2140
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:25.240
<v Speaker 4>actually I'm a little more sympathetic </v>
<v Speaker 4>to her then dad,</v>

2141
01:55:25.241 --> 01:55:28.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm all things considered because after </v>
<v Speaker 4>all she was trying to deal with the damn</v>

2142
01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:29.510
<v Speaker 4>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2143
01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:34.690
<v Speaker 4>And we find out that the snake is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>only the thing that preys upon her </v>

2144
01:55:34.690 --> 01:55:35.450
<v Speaker 4>infants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as the tradition develop,</v>

2145
01:55:35.451 --> 01:55:37.760
<v Speaker 4>it's identified with Satan himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2146
01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:42.950
<v Speaker 4>and that's the snake in every soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the right way of thinking about </v>

2147
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:43.410
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she had her reasons,</v>

2148
01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:47.580
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You pay whether you have your reasons or</v>

2149
01:55:47.581 --> 01:55:49.980
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so God says to the serpent,</v>

2150
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:52.950
<v Speaker 4>because you've done this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're cursed above all cattle,</v>

2151
01:55:53.190 --> 01:55:55.880
<v Speaker 4>above every beast of the field,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upon the Belize,</v>

2152
01:55:55.890 --> 01:55:57.660
<v Speaker 4>shelled out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go and dust shelled out,</v>

2153
01:55:57.661 --> 01:55:59.400
<v Speaker 4>eat all the days of thy life.</v>

2154
01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:02.400
<v Speaker 4>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the serpent seems to have legs,</v>

2155
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:07.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's turned into a snake and </v>

2156
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:07.950
<v Speaker 4>that's actually how it worked by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

2157
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:09.360
<v Speaker 4>because snakes had legs and they lost </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2158
01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:13.260
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm not trying to say that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>story necessarily represents that,</v>

2159
01:56:13.261 --> 01:56:16.890
<v Speaker 4>but it's an interesting parallel and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>tells the snake,</v>

2160
01:56:16.891 --> 01:56:20.580
<v Speaker 4>I'll put enmity between the and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman and between thy seed and her seed,</v>

2161
01:56:20.730 --> 01:56:23.790
<v Speaker 4>it shall bruise thy head and Thou shall </v>
<v Speaker 4>bruise his heel.</v>

2162
01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:25.690
<v Speaker 4>While yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's the snake striking.</v>

2163
01:56:25.691 --> 01:56:30.691
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that when human being see </v>

2164
01:56:30.691 --> 01:56:32.661
<v Speaker 4>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to just like the simpsons </v>

2165
01:56:32.661 --> 01:56:32.661
<v Speaker 4>whacking day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2166
01:56:32.661 --> 01:56:35.960
<v Speaker 4>It's time to get rid of the snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why the many great saints are </v>

2167
01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:39.291
<v Speaker 4>those who drive the snakes from the land</v>
<v Speaker 4>like St Patrick or St George and the </v>

2168
01:56:39.291 --> 01:56:43.311
<v Speaker 4>Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's the same representation of the </v>

2169
01:56:43.311 --> 01:56:44.520
<v Speaker 4>hero moving out into the Wilderness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>confronting the predatory,</v>

2170
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:49.910
<v Speaker 4>the predatory predatory potential is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>right way of thinking about it.</v>

2171
01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:56.840
<v Speaker 4>All right unto the woman he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and </v>

2172
01:56:56.881 --> 01:57:00.630
<v Speaker 4>thy conception in sorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thou shalt bring forth children and that</v>

2173
01:57:00.631 --> 01:57:04.350
<v Speaker 4>desire to be shall be to thy husband and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shall rule over thee.</v>

2174
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:07.110
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a statement of destiny,</v>

2175
01:57:07.111 --> 01:57:09.870
<v Speaker 4>not a statement of the way it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what does it mean?</v>

2176
01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:14.130
<v Speaker 4>I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and </v>
<v Speaker 4>die conception,</v>

2177
01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:19.260
<v Speaker 4>while self consciousness will do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of course women are fully aware </v>

2178
01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:19.830
<v Speaker 4>of exactly how fragile their infants </v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

2179
01:57:19.831 --> 01:57:23.490
<v Speaker 4>So that's a big problem in sorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thou shalt bring forth children.</v>

2180
01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:25.980
<v Speaker 4>That's something particular to human </v>
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>

2181
01:57:26.010 --> 01:57:27.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's why,</v>

2182
01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:32.010
<v Speaker 4>the price we paid for the rapid </v>
<v Speaker 4>expansion of our brain,</v>

2183
01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:36.030
<v Speaker 4>which is also something that gave us </v>
<v Speaker 4>this self consciousness and vision meant</v>

2184
01:57:36.031 --> 01:57:41.031
<v Speaker 4>that there's an evolutionary arms race </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the pelvic width of women and </v>

2185
01:57:41.031 --> 01:57:43.470
<v Speaker 4>the hole in the center of the pelvis and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the infants had.</v>

2186
01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:49.010
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is the infant is born </v>
<v Speaker 4>far too young for a mammal of our size </v>

2187
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:51.660
<v Speaker 4>because if it was benny older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the head would be too big,</v>

2188
01:57:51.661 --> 01:57:56.661
<v Speaker 4>the pelvis would have to be too wide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's structural stability would be </v>

2189
01:57:56.661 --> 01:58:00.051
<v Speaker 4>compromised and then women couldn't run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So right now women are at the maximum </v>

2190
01:58:00.051 --> 01:58:01.740
<v Speaker 4>for hip width in terms of their ability </v>
<v Speaker 4>to run.</v>

2191
01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:07.160
<v Speaker 4>So what's happened is that infants have </v>
<v Speaker 4>had to be born younger with a </v>

2192
01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:07.710
<v Speaker 4>compressible head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2193
01:58:07.711 --> 01:58:12.711
<v Speaker 4>the bones of an infant scholar joined </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and sometimes after babies are </v>

2194
01:58:12.711 --> 01:58:16.641
<v Speaker 4>born,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their head is actually almost cone </v>

2195
01:58:16.641 --> 01:58:18.711
<v Speaker 4>shaped because of the tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure that was exerted on their head </v>

2196
01:58:18.711 --> 01:58:19.830
<v Speaker 4>during the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the birthing process.</v>

2197
01:58:19.831 --> 01:58:22.500
<v Speaker 4>And of course that's killed innumerable </v>
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>

2198
01:58:23.070 --> 01:58:28.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean women's life expectancy before </v>

2199
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:31.700
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The latter half of the 20th century was </v>

2200
01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:33.840
<v Speaker 4>way below men because they died in </v>
<v Speaker 4>childbirth all the time and why?</v>

2201
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:34.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

2202
01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:38.610
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you call that?</v>

2203
01:58:39.370 --> 01:58:40.690
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

2204
01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:48.240
<v Speaker 4>It's a very narrow gateway and the price</v>
<v Speaker 4>that women pay for it is very high risk </v>

2205
01:58:48.341 --> 01:58:53.341
<v Speaker 4>of death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very high risk of sorrow because of </v>

2206
01:58:53.341 --> 01:58:56.260
<v Speaker 4>death of children in childbirth and also</v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily extraordinary pain in </v>

2207
01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.990
<v Speaker 4>giving birth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's the price women pay for having</v>

2208
01:58:58.991 --> 01:59:03.420
<v Speaker 4>vision and being self conscious while </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's and then worse,</v>

2209
01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 4>they desire their husband and he will </v>
<v Speaker 4>rule over the well.</v>

2210
01:59:06.970 --> 01:59:09.340
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not that's good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

2211
01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:11.860
<v Speaker 4>God's statement is that's how it's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

2212
01:59:11.861 --> 01:59:16.861
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly that's because as far as I can </v>

2213
01:59:16.861 --> 01:59:16.861
<v Speaker 4>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there isn't really women.</v>

2214
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:21.870
<v Speaker 4>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's women with infants and a woman </v>

2215
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:24.370
<v Speaker 4>with an infant is compromised in terms </v>
<v Speaker 4>of her what?</v>

2216
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:30.750
<v Speaker 4>Independent individuality to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>remarkable degree because the infant is </v>

2217
01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:31.390
<v Speaker 4>dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely dependent,</v>

2218
01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:36.540
<v Speaker 4>absolutely dependent for a year and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably dependent for like eight </v>

2219
01:59:36.791 --> 01:59:40.660
<v Speaker 4>years after that and then still pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>dependent for another five.</v>

2220
01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:45.930
<v Speaker 4>So once you have an infant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's no longer you and I've talked to </v>

2221
01:59:45.930 --> 01:59:46.870
<v Speaker 4>lots of women for whom that was a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>relief by the way,</v>

2222
01:59:46.871 --> 01:59:51.871
<v Speaker 4>because it actually is somewhat of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relief to now not be the center of </v>

2223
01:59:51.871 --> 01:59:52.170
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2224
01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:54.430
<v Speaker 4>if you go visit your in laws for </v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

2225
01:59:54.431 --> 01:59:59.431
<v Speaker 4>and you have a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they pay attention to the </v>

2226
01:59:59.431 --> 01:59:59.431
<v Speaker 4>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your parents will do the same thing.</v>

2227
01:59:59.431 --> 02:00:03.270
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of Nice to have that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still an absolute catastrophe </v>

2228
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:06.790
<v Speaker 4>for you as an independent being and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not getting out in the forest and</v>

2229
02:00:06.791 --> 02:00:08.680
<v Speaker 4>hunt down dragons when you have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>infant.</v>

2230
02:00:08.710 --> 02:00:11.590
<v Speaker 4>So even if you could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to do it.</v>

2231
02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:14.440
<v Speaker 4>And so that's basically what that </v>
<v Speaker 4>statement outlines.</v>

2232
02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:15.880
<v Speaker 4>And then to Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

2233
02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:18.820
<v Speaker 4>because you listened to your wife and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ate of that tree,</v>

2234
02:00:18.821 --> 02:00:19.780
<v Speaker 4>which I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2235
02:00:19.781 --> 02:00:21.250
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's not such a good idea.</v>

2236
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Curse it is the ground for the sake in </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorrow.</v>

2237
02:00:24.881 --> 02:00:27.760
<v Speaker 4>Show thou eat of it all the days of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>light of thy life.</v>

2238
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:31.660
<v Speaker 4>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>forth to thee.</v>

2239
02:00:31.661 --> 02:00:36.661
<v Speaker 4>And now she'll eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The herb of the field in the sweat of </v>

2240
02:00:36.661 --> 02:00:37.720
<v Speaker 4>thy face shall thou eat bread til thou </v>
<v Speaker 4>return into the ground.</v>

2241
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:41.620
<v Speaker 4>That's the death part for out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was Thou taken for dust,</v>

2242
02:00:41.621 --> 02:00:46.621
<v Speaker 4>thou art and unto dust thou shalt thou </v>
<v Speaker 4>return and I missed one thing about </v>

2243
02:00:46.621 --> 02:00:48.670
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the serpent,</v>

2244
02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:51.580
<v Speaker 4>this took me a long time to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've mentioned it already,</v>

2245
02:00:51.581 --> 02:00:56.581
<v Speaker 4>but it's worth reviewing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The serpent tells eve that if she eats </v>

2246
02:00:58.481 --> 02:01:03.481
<v Speaker 4>from the fruit of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then her eyes will be open and shall be </v>

2247
02:01:03.481 --> 02:01:03.790
<v Speaker 4>as gods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knowing good and evil.</v>

2248
02:01:04.230 --> 02:01:05.770
<v Speaker 4>Well serpent doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2249
02:01:05.771 --> 02:01:09.280
<v Speaker 4>you'll be as as gods in so far as new </v>
<v Speaker 4>and good and evil,</v>

2250
02:01:09.281 --> 02:01:12.280
<v Speaker 4>but you'll die so you only get half the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gift.</v>

2251
02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:13.840
<v Speaker 4>And so then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2252
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:18.460
<v Speaker 4>there's this weird minter mangling of of</v>
<v Speaker 4>occurrences in the story.</v>

2253
02:01:19.330 --> 02:01:24.330
<v Speaker 4>There's the development of vision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the development of self </v>

2254
02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:24.790
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the knowledge of nakedness,</v>

2255
02:01:24.791 --> 02:01:29.791
<v Speaker 4>there's the emergence of work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the emergence of pain and </v>

2256
02:01:29.791 --> 02:01:32.611
<v Speaker 4>suffering and childbirth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's knowledge of good and evil </v>

2257
02:01:32.611 --> 02:01:32.611
<v Speaker 4>thought for ages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

2258
02:01:32.611 --> 02:01:33.700
<v Speaker 4>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell?</v>

2259
02:01:33.701 --> 02:01:38.701
<v Speaker 4>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is there an emphasis on moral </v>

2260
02:01:38.701 --> 02:01:39.770
<v Speaker 4>knowledge?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does this have to do with moral and</v>

2261
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.190
<v Speaker 4>the implication is that in the initial </v>
<v Speaker 4>state of unconsciousness,</v>

2262
02:01:43.191 --> 02:01:46.490
<v Speaker 4>there was no moral knowledge and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that as an animal like state,</v>

2263
02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:48.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no moral knowledge in animals.</v>

2264
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:53.770
<v Speaker 4>You don't think while that evil cat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't ever think that even if it's </v>

2265
02:01:53.770 --> 02:01:55.010
<v Speaker 4>acting like a Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's playing with its prey,</v>

2266
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:58.310
<v Speaker 4>you don't attribute moral knowledge to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cat because you say,</v>

2267
02:01:58.311 --> 02:01:59.990
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't know what it's doing.</v>

2268
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:03.770
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't understand what it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is to say it acted out,</v>

2269
02:02:03.771 --> 02:02:06.230
<v Speaker 4>but it can't represent it or maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

2270
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:11.830
<v Speaker 4>It acts it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it can't represent it and it </v>

2271
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.900
<v Speaker 4>certainly can't analyze its </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation.</v>

2272
02:02:12.110 --> 02:02:17.110
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have that level of capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we do so there's that's associated </v>

2273
02:02:17.110 --> 02:02:19.490
<v Speaker 4>with moral knowledge to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why knowledge of good and evil.</v>

2274
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:20.540
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2275
02:02:20.541 --> 02:02:25.541
<v Speaker 4>here's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's think about what you would </v>

2276
02:02:25.541 --> 02:02:25.610
<v Speaker 4>consider reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Universally.</v>

2277
02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:29.210
<v Speaker 4>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how's this torturing and infant?</v>

2278
02:02:30.170 --> 02:02:33.290
<v Speaker 4>I would consider that virtually </v>
<v Speaker 4>universally reprehensible,</v>

2279
02:02:33.291 --> 02:02:34.610
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2280
02:02:34.611 --> 02:02:37.100
<v Speaker 4>so we will accept that as a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 4>definition,</v>

2281
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:39.590
<v Speaker 4>so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2282
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:45.490
<v Speaker 4>why would you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll leave that aside for a moment to </v>

2283
02:02:45.490 --> 02:02:49.360
<v Speaker 4>how do you know how to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the issue and that's easy.</v>

2284
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:54.350
<v Speaker 4>Once I know how I can be hurt because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm aware of my own vulnerability,</v>

2285
02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:59.540
<v Speaker 4>I know how you can be hurt and I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>make it into a game and I can prolong it</v>

2286
02:02:59.541 --> 02:03:03.170
<v Speaker 4>forever and I can do it the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible way,</v>

2287
02:03:03.650 --> 02:03:08.180
<v Speaker 4>and that's why when you open your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know your vulnerability and your</v>

2288
02:03:08.181 --> 02:03:13.181
<v Speaker 4>nakedness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you immediately have the knowledge </v>

2289
02:03:13.181 --> 02:03:13.490
<v Speaker 4>of good and evil and so then evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes something like,</v>

2290
02:03:14.210 --> 02:03:17.090
<v Speaker 4>while there's tragedy in life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine earthquakes,</v>

2291
02:03:17.091 --> 02:03:22.091
<v Speaker 4>cancer disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those terrible things that's </v>

2292
02:03:22.091 --> 02:03:22.910
<v Speaker 4>different than me deciding that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to make you miserable.</v>

2293
02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:26.600
<v Speaker 4>The one is while you're a limited </v>
<v Speaker 4>creature in an unlimited world,</v>

2294
02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:31.900
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get hurt because of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe there's ways that you can be </v>

2295
02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:35.231
<v Speaker 4>that will enable you to transcend that </v>
<v Speaker 4>at least to some degree and still have </v>

2296
02:03:35.231 --> 02:03:39.131
<v Speaker 4>the benefits of being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's entirely different than me </v>

2297
02:03:39.131 --> 02:03:42.041
<v Speaker 4>deciding that things are going to go a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot worse for you than they might and </v>

2298
02:03:42.041 --> 02:03:44.300
<v Speaker 4>human beings are capable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've ever gone to some</v>

2299
02:03:44.301 --> 02:03:46.550
<v Speaker 4>of the dungeon porcher dungeons in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe.</v>

2300
02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:48.260
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are fun places to go.</v>

2301
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:53.470
<v Speaker 4>You think you take the most malevolent </v>
<v Speaker 4>person you possibly could then have a </v>

2302
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:58.061
<v Speaker 4>little convention of those people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then get them to think up the worst </v>

2303
02:03:58.061 --> 02:04:00.920
<v Speaker 4>possible things that they could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>devise and then you have the instruments</v>

2304
02:04:00.921 --> 02:04:04.700
<v Speaker 4>of torture that in euro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a medieval torture dungeon,</v>

2305
02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:07.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an art form and you think,</v>

2306
02:04:07.221 --> 02:04:08.030
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do people,</v>

2307
02:04:08.031 --> 02:04:10.700
<v Speaker 4>why are people willing to inflict that </v>
<v Speaker 4>on one another?</v>

2308
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:13.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll talk about that next time when</v>

2309
02:04:13.881 --> 02:04:18.881
<v Speaker 4>we talk about the story of Cain and Abel</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think it holds the secret to </v>

2310
02:04:18.881 --> 02:04:18.881
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in the meantime,</v>

2311
02:04:18.881 --> 02:04:23.681
<v Speaker 4>I'll stop with this story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I want to tell you the story of the </v>

2312
02:04:23.681 --> 02:04:23.681
<v Speaker 4>Buddha because it maps onto it very </v>
<v Speaker 4>nicely.</v>

2313
02:04:23.681 --> 02:04:24.140
<v Speaker 4>So what do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have.</v>

2314
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:29.830
<v Speaker 4>You have a protected space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's unconscious beings in a </v>

2315
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:34.031
<v Speaker 4>protected space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something comes in in the form of the </v>

2316
02:04:34.031 --> 02:04:37.001
<v Speaker 4>serpent to reveal death to reveal </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerability,</v>

2317
02:04:37.230 --> 02:04:37.830
<v Speaker 4>death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2318
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:43.040
<v Speaker 4>And then the paradise comes to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The human beings are eliminated from it </v>

2319
02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:47.721
<v Speaker 4>and they don't get to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So God puts angels with flaming swords </v>

2320
02:04:47.721 --> 02:04:47.721
<v Speaker 4>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the,</v>

2321
02:04:47.721 --> 02:04:52.680
<v Speaker 4>at the gateway to Paradise so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people cannot come back in and it isn't </v>

2322
02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:56.601
<v Speaker 4>obvious what that means except that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gotta be some sort of trial by </v>

2323
02:04:56.601 --> 02:04:57.690
<v Speaker 4>fire before reentering paradise.</v>

2324
02:04:57.690 --> 02:04:59.220
<v Speaker 4>But we can leave that alone for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

2325
02:04:59.430 --> 02:05:01.410
<v Speaker 4>So that's the basic structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

2326
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:04.950
<v Speaker 4>Unconscious human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>emergence of knowledge,</v>

2327
02:05:05.730 --> 02:05:10.350
<v Speaker 4>realization of death and suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the elimination of the paradise.</v>

2328
02:05:10.351 --> 02:05:11.070
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2329
02:05:11.071 --> 02:05:12.840
<v Speaker 4>So now I'll read you the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddha,</v>

2330
02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:17.490
<v Speaker 4>the father of Prince Gautama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Buddha savior of the Orient,</v>

2331
02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:21.090
<v Speaker 4>determined to protect his son from </v>
<v Speaker 4>desperate knowledge and tragic awareness</v>

2332
02:05:21.091 --> 02:05:25.350
<v Speaker 4>built for him and enclosed pavilion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a walled garden of earthly delights.</v>

2333
02:05:25.650 --> 02:05:30.650
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the story goes that at angel visited </v>

2334
02:05:30.650 --> 02:05:34.400
<v Speaker 4>Buddhist father and said that he's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have a son and the son is either </v>

2335
02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:37.851
<v Speaker 4>going to become the greatest ruler that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world has ever seen or a spiritual </v>

2336
02:05:37.851 --> 02:05:40.260
<v Speaker 4>leader and the father being a practical </v>
<v Speaker 4>man thought where there's no bloody way.</v>

2337
02:05:40.261 --> 02:05:43.230
<v Speaker 4>I want my son to be some like wandering </v>
<v Speaker 4>spiritual leader.</v>

2338
02:05:43.410 --> 02:05:46.140
<v Speaker 4>I want him to be the greatest king that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world has ever seen.</v>

2339
02:05:46.530 --> 02:05:49.770
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the father decides,</v>

2340
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:55.910
<v Speaker 4>how am I going to get my son to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest ruler of the world has ever </v>

2341
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:59.871
<v Speaker 4>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I better get them to fall in love with </v>

2342
02:05:59.871 --> 02:06:01.911
<v Speaker 4>the world because then he's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go traipsing after some sort of half </v>

2343
02:06:01.911 --> 02:06:04.200
<v Speaker 4>witted spiritual knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to stick to practical tasks,</v>

2344
02:06:04.201 --> 02:06:06.150
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's something that a father should do</v>

2345
02:06:06.151 --> 02:06:08.220
<v Speaker 4>to some degree is orient you in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

2346
02:06:08.221 --> 02:06:13.221
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe shouldn't subvert your </v>

2347
02:06:13.221 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 4>spiritual development to any great </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree,</v>

2348
02:06:13.501 --> 02:06:15.610
<v Speaker 4>but there's a practical element to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2349
02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:17.580
<v Speaker 4>and so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how it works.</v>

2350
02:06:17.581 --> 02:06:22.581
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The father bill is this city of </v>

2351
02:06:22.581 --> 02:06:27.261
<v Speaker 4>perfection and he eliminates from it </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that's a reminder of the </v>

2352
02:06:27.601 --> 02:06:30.690
<v Speaker 4>suffering that's associated with life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the only thing that's allowed,</v>

2353
02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:32.760
<v Speaker 4>the only creatures that are allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be in there,</v>

2354
02:06:32.761 --> 02:06:35.190
<v Speaker 4>the only people that are allowed to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>in there are healthy,</v>

2355
02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:36.720
<v Speaker 4>young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and happy people,</v>

2356
02:06:36.810 --> 02:06:41.810
<v Speaker 4>so the Buddha grows up surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing but the positive elements of </v>

2357
02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:41.810
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2358
02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:42.030
<v Speaker 4>While you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2359
02:06:42.031 --> 02:06:45.120
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>While it's akin to the paradise idea,</v>

2360
02:06:45.121 --> 02:06:48.990
<v Speaker 4>obviously walled closure of paradise </v>
<v Speaker 4>where there's no death,</v>

2361
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:54.470
<v Speaker 4>but there's more to it than that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also in some sense what a good </v>

2362
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:56.280
<v Speaker 4>father would do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do with your young children?</v>

2363
02:06:56.620 --> 02:06:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't expose them to death and decay</v>

2364
02:06:58.921 --> 02:07:00.900
<v Speaker 4>at every step of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right to you.</v>

2365
02:07:01.110 --> 02:07:05.010
<v Speaker 4>You build a protected world for them </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a wall enclosure,</v>

2366
02:07:05.310 --> 02:07:10.310
<v Speaker 4>and you only keep what's healthy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>life giving inside of it and you don't </v>

2367
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:12.240
<v Speaker 4>expose them to things that they can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>tolerate.</v>

2368
02:07:12.241 --> 02:07:14.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you don't take a three year old to</v>

2369
02:07:14.041 --> 02:07:15.240
<v Speaker 4>a funeral now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you do,</v>

2370
02:07:15.241 --> 02:07:20.241
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's things that you don't expect </v>

2371
02:07:20.241 --> 02:07:22.491
<v Speaker 4>them to be able to cope with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You regulate what they're allowed to </v>

2372
02:07:22.491 --> 02:07:25.761
<v Speaker 4>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to show them the tech </v>

2373
02:07:25.761 --> 02:07:25.761
<v Speaker 4>Texas chainsaw massacre when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>four years old,</v>

2374
02:07:25.761 --> 02:07:30.741
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so so you're staving off knowledge of </v>

2375
02:07:30.741 --> 02:07:33.711
<v Speaker 4>mortality and death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so he's just being a good father in </v>

2376
02:07:33.711 --> 02:07:33.711
<v Speaker 4>many ways here.</v>

2377
02:07:33.711 --> 02:07:36.970
<v Speaker 4>All signs of decay and degeneration </v>
<v Speaker 4>where thus kept hidden from the prince,</v>

2378
02:07:37.630 --> 02:07:42.630
<v Speaker 4>immersed in the immediate pleasures of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the senses in physical love and dance </v>

2379
02:07:42.630 --> 02:07:44.860
<v Speaker 4>and music and beauty and pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gautama grew to maturity,</v>

2380
02:07:44.861 --> 02:07:47.920
<v Speaker 4>protected absolutely from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>limitations of mortal being.</v>

2381
02:07:48.190 --> 02:07:53.190
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he grew curious despite his father's </v>

2382
02:07:53.190 --> 02:07:55.630
<v Speaker 4>most particular attention and will and </v>
<v Speaker 4>resolve to leave his seductive present.</v>

2383
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:57.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that curiosity element.</v>

2384
02:07:57.521 --> 02:08:00.820
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing that lurks in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam and Eve story.</v>

2385
02:08:00.821 --> 02:08:04.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like God tells Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see that tree over there.</v>

2386
02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Don't be bothered with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2387
02:08:06.431 --> 02:08:08.080
<v Speaker 4>you know what's going to happen with </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings,</v>

2388
02:08:08.081 --> 02:08:10.150
<v Speaker 4>especially if there's a snake associated</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

2389
02:08:10.151 --> 02:08:11.470
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be over there right </v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

2390
02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:15.040
<v Speaker 4>Check in that place out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's exactly what happens with the</v>

2391
02:08:15.041 --> 02:08:20.041
<v Speaker 4>Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like he's raised to be healthy and </v>

2392
02:08:20.041 --> 02:08:24.001
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the consequence of that is that </v>

2393
02:08:24.001 --> 02:08:27.030
<v Speaker 4>the fact that he's healthy makes them </v>
<v Speaker 4>look for what's beyond the protected </v>

2394
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:28.810
<v Speaker 4>confines of the thing that made him </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy.</v>

2395
02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:34.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like even in the Japan story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know where Japan Paints on </v>

2396
02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:34.600
<v Speaker 4>Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his mouth,</v>

2397
02:08:34.601 --> 02:08:39.601
<v Speaker 4>and he's ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He puts them outside the next day and </v>

2398
02:08:39.601 --> 02:08:39.601
<v Speaker 4>Pinocchio is ready to run away with all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the kids.</v>

2399
02:08:39.601 --> 02:08:42.130
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the consequence of raising a child in</v>

2400
02:08:42.131 --> 02:08:46.090
<v Speaker 4>a healthy way is that the child is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be curious enough to go out there and</v>

2401
02:08:46.091 --> 02:08:51.091
<v Speaker 4>look for some trouble and we actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that because there is followup </v>

2402
02:08:51.091 --> 02:08:55.320
<v Speaker 4>studies of teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You imagine that there's teenagers who </v>

2403
02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:56.350
<v Speaker 4>never break any rules and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>teenagers who break all the rules.</v>

2404
02:08:56.351 --> 02:08:59.200
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>These teenagers don't do very well.</v>

2405
02:08:59.350 --> 02:09:00.610
<v Speaker 4>Introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed,</v>

2406
02:09:00.611 --> 02:09:02.050
<v Speaker 4>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed.</v>

2407
02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:03.550
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said that twice.</v>

2408
02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:06.820
<v Speaker 4>These ones are antisocial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ones in the middle.</v>

2409
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:11.910
<v Speaker 4>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want your damn teenager to get out </v>

2410
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:14.611
<v Speaker 4>of the paradisical confines of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>house and to go cause some trouble and </v>

2411
02:09:14.611 --> 02:09:14.611
<v Speaker 4>to investigate.</v>

2412
02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:17.050
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you don't want to know about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore than you have to.</v>

2413
02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:22.260
<v Speaker 4>You don't want them to be breaking rules</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time and you don't want them to </v>

2414
02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:26.041
<v Speaker 4>be so timid into a press that they can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a move on their own and never make </v>

2415
02:09:26.041 --> 02:09:28.240
<v Speaker 4>a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the paradoxical thing here,</v>

2416
02:09:28.241 --> 02:09:31.390
<v Speaker 4>and it's sort of echoed are this is why </v>
<v Speaker 4>I like these two stories back to back is</v>

2417
02:09:31.391 --> 02:09:35.890
<v Speaker 4>like if you give people what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the first thing they're gonna do is</v>

2418
02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:40.950
<v Speaker 4>try to get beyond it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Dostoevsky says the same thing and </v>

2419
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.950
<v Speaker 4>notes from underground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

2420
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:42.580
<v Speaker 4>if you gave people everything they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted,</v>

2421
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:44.410
<v Speaker 4>pure utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he says,</v>

2422
02:09:44.411 --> 02:09:49.411
<v Speaker 4>so that they're sitting in a pool of </v>
<v Speaker 4>bliss with nothing but bubbles of </v>

2423
02:09:49.411 --> 02:09:52.960
<v Speaker 4>happiness coming up from the surface and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all they have to do is eat cake and busy</v>

2424
02:09:52.961 --> 02:09:55.330
<v Speaker 4>themselves with the continuation of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>species.</v>

2425
02:09:55.570 --> 02:10:00.570
<v Speaker 4>Dusty said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dostoyevsky's observation is the first </v>

2426
02:10:00.570 --> 02:10:01.930
<v Speaker 4>thing that people would do is find </v>
<v Speaker 4>something to smash that with.</v>

2427
02:10:02.110 --> 02:10:04.780
<v Speaker 4>Just so that something interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>perverse could happen.</v>

2428
02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:05.770
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2429
02:10:05.771 --> 02:10:06.460
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2430
02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:10.720
<v Speaker 4>we're creatures that are designed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter the unknown.</v>

2431
02:10:10.721 --> 02:10:12.820
<v Speaker 4>We want to keep moving beyond what we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

2432
02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:15.340
<v Speaker 4>even if we have what we have is what we </v>
<v Speaker 4>want,</v>

2433
02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:18.430
<v Speaker 4>and maybe that's partly because we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>oriented towards the future.</v>

2434
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:20.020
<v Speaker 4>We think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is great,</v>

2435
02:10:20.021 --> 02:10:21.910
<v Speaker 4>but it's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great,</v>

2436
02:10:21.911 --> 02:10:26.911
<v Speaker 4>but it's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always something more that </v>

2437
02:10:26.911 --> 02:10:26.911
<v Speaker 4>drives us forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While.</v>

2438
02:10:26.911 --> 02:10:28.870
<v Speaker 4>So that's what happens with the Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets curious.</v>

2439
02:10:28.871 --> 02:10:31.840
<v Speaker 4>He sees the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thinks there's walls,</v>

2440
02:10:31.841 --> 02:10:33.650
<v Speaker 4>there's probably something outside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those walls.</v>

2441
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.400
<v Speaker 4>So then he goes to his father and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

2442
02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to go outside,</v>

2443
02:10:41.541 --> 02:10:43.010
<v Speaker 4>what's outside?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his father says,</v>

2444
02:10:43.011 --> 02:10:44.330
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to go outside.</v>

2445
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:45.170
<v Speaker 4>And Buddha says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2446
02:10:45.171 --> 02:10:48.680
<v Speaker 4>well I really do want to go outside and </v>
<v Speaker 4>his father knows that unless he lets him</v>

2447
02:10:48.681 --> 02:10:53.681
<v Speaker 4>go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to climb over the walls and </v>

2448
02:10:53.681 --> 02:10:54.320
<v Speaker 4>so the father decides he's going to let </v>
<v Speaker 4>them go outside.</v>

2449
02:10:54.321 --> 02:10:56.090
<v Speaker 4>Bugs get fixed everything out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

2450
02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:01.480
<v Speaker 4>So he goes outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the Chinese preparing for the </v>

2451
02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:04.181
<v Speaker 4>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when they sprayed the grass </v>

2452
02:11:04.181 --> 02:11:04.181
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

2453
02:11:04.181 --> 02:11:04.181
<v Speaker 4>with green paint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got rid of all the homeless people.</v>

2454
02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:07.310
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he goes outside the city and he tells</v>

2455
02:11:07.311 --> 02:11:08.090
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2456
02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:10.670
<v Speaker 4>old people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sick people dying,</v>

2457
02:11:10.671 --> 02:11:14.000
<v Speaker 4>people hit the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to see it for awhile,</v>

2458
02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:16.850
<v Speaker 4>clean all this out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want the attractive people around the</v>

2459
02:11:16.851 --> 02:11:21.851
<v Speaker 4>sides of the roads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like waving palm fronds and all of that </v>

2460
02:11:21.851 --> 02:11:24.641
<v Speaker 4>and so when my son comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to see nothing but what's </v>

2461
02:11:24.641 --> 02:11:24.641
<v Speaker 4>good and so we get that all arranged.</v>

2462
02:11:24.641 --> 02:11:29.570
<v Speaker 4>He lets his son go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now his son goes outside in this little </v>

2463
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:31.250
<v Speaker 4>carrier thing and he has someone with </v>
<v Speaker 4>him now,</v>

2464
02:11:31.251 --> 02:11:36.251
<v Speaker 4>unbeknownst to his father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that person that's with them as an </v>

2465
02:11:36.251 --> 02:11:39.461
<v Speaker 4>emissary of the gods and so in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>perverse way he plays the same role as </v>

2466
02:11:39.461 --> 02:11:43.391
<v Speaker 4>the serpent in the story of Adam and eve</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the gods have already arranged so </v>

2467
02:11:43.911 --> 02:11:48.911
<v Speaker 4>that the father's a carer is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>insufficient and it's the snake in the </v>

2468
02:11:50.241 --> 02:11:55.241
<v Speaker 4>garden idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like no matter how much care you </v>

2469
02:11:55.241 --> 02:11:55.490
<v Speaker 4>take to make things perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the,</v>

2470
02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:59.360
<v Speaker 4>some of what you're excluding is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to come back in.</v>

2471
02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:04.600
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddha goes outside and he's in his </v>

2472
02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.741
<v Speaker 4>chariot and preparations were made to </v>
<v Speaker 4>guild is chosen route to cover the </v>

2473
02:12:08.741 --> 02:12:12.581
<v Speaker 4>adventurous path with flowers and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>display for his admiration and </v>

2474
02:12:12.581 --> 02:12:13.190
<v Speaker 4>preoccupation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fairest women of the kingdom,</v>

2475
02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:16.090
<v Speaker 4>the print set out with full red,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new in the shield,</v>

2476
02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:21.100
<v Speaker 4>the comfort of a chaperone chariot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>delighted in the Panorama previously </v>

2477
02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:21.100
<v Speaker 4>prepared for him.</v>

2478
02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:22.610
<v Speaker 4>The gods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>

2479
02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:27.880
<v Speaker 4>decided to disrupt these most carefully </v>
<v Speaker 4>laid plans and sent an aged man to </v>

2480
02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:32.861
<v Speaker 4>hobble in full view alongside the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The prince's fascinated gaze fell upon </v>

2481
02:12:33.111 --> 02:12:35.970
<v Speaker 4>the ancient interloper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>compelled by curiosity.</v>

2482
02:12:35.971 --> 02:12:39.140
<v Speaker 4>He asked his attendant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that creature stumbling,</v>

2483
02:12:39.141 --> 02:12:44.141
<v Speaker 4>shabby bent and broken beside my retinue</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the attendant answered that is a man</v>

2484
02:12:44.151 --> 02:12:47.270
<v Speaker 4>like other men who was born in infant </v>
<v Speaker 4>became a child,</v>

2485
02:12:47.271 --> 02:12:48.260
<v Speaker 4>a youth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a husband,</v>

2486
02:12:48.261 --> 02:12:53.261
<v Speaker 4>a father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a father of fathers has become old </v>

2487
02:12:53.261 --> 02:12:54.470
<v Speaker 4>subject to destruction of his beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his will,</v>

2488
02:12:54.471 --> 02:12:57.620
<v Speaker 4>and the possibilities of life like other</v>
<v Speaker 4>men,</v>

2489
02:12:57.621 --> 02:12:59.840
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hesitantly inquired the prints.</v>

2490
02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:05.080
<v Speaker 4>That means this will happen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the attendant answered inevitably </v>

2491
02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:06.950
<v Speaker 4>with the passage of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2492
02:13:06.951 --> 02:13:11.951
<v Speaker 4>that's the end of that party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world collapses in on Buddha and </v>

2493
02:13:11.951 --> 02:13:12.470
<v Speaker 4>paying he hightails at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2494
02:13:12.471 --> 02:13:13.580
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2495
02:13:13.581 --> 02:13:14.690
<v Speaker 4>that's what children do.</v>

2496
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:17.610
<v Speaker 4>Roughly speaking is there around their </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother there.</v>

2497
02:13:17.670 --> 02:13:20.000
<v Speaker 4>They've got security there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go out into the unknown.</v>

2498
02:13:20.001 --> 02:13:22.670
<v Speaker 4>They encounter something that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit too much for them.</v>

2499
02:13:22.740 --> 02:13:23.690
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come home,</v>

2500
02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:25.520
<v Speaker 4>they get old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>padded back into shape,</v>

2501
02:13:25.521 --> 02:13:30.521
<v Speaker 4>and how been taken care of hugging </v>
<v Speaker 4>children and patting them is actually </v>

2502
02:13:30.521 --> 02:13:31.740
<v Speaker 4>analgesic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It actually reduces paid.</v>

2503
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you do with someone who's </v>

2504
02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:36.980
<v Speaker 4>grieving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2505
02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:38.110
<v Speaker 4>So you hug them because grief is paid </v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2506
02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:39.660
<v Speaker 4>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2507
02:13:39.661 --> 02:13:41.320
<v Speaker 4>you pat them and they get rid of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>pain.</v>

2508
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:44.730
<v Speaker 4>They get rid of their anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You calm them down and what happens?</v>

2509
02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next day they want to go out again.</v>

2510
02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what happens to the </v>

2511
02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's all shorted out by his encounter</v>

2512
02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:55.731
<v Speaker 4>with death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has very little different than </v>

2513
02:13:55.731 --> 02:13:57.570
<v Speaker 4>what happens to Adam and eve runs back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recovers for six months.</v>

2514
02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:02.600
<v Speaker 4>He has posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He runs home and he recovers for six </v>

2515
02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:04.440
<v Speaker 4>months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in time,</v>

2516
02:14:04.441 --> 02:14:06.120
<v Speaker 4>his anxiety lessened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His curiosity,</v>

2517
02:14:06.121 --> 02:14:11.121
<v Speaker 4>grinned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He ventured outside again this time the </v>

2518
02:14:11.121 --> 02:14:12.650
<v Speaker 4>God sent a sick man interview this creek</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheerios does attendance,</v>

2519
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:14.850
<v Speaker 4>shaking and palsy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horribly afflicted,</v>

2520
02:14:14.851 --> 02:14:17.880
<v Speaker 4>unbearable to behold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a source of pity and contempt.</v>

2521
02:14:17.881 --> 02:14:21.840
<v Speaker 4>What is he and the attendant answered </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a man like other men</v>

2522
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:26.370
<v Speaker 4>who was born whole but who became ill </v>
<v Speaker 4>and sick,</v>

2523
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:29.550
<v Speaker 4>unable to cope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a burden to himself and others suffering</v>

2524
02:14:29.551 --> 02:14:33.300
<v Speaker 4>and incurable like other men you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inquired the prince.</v>

2525
02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:36.270
<v Speaker 4>This could happen to me and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>attendant answers,</v>

2526
02:14:36.330 --> 02:14:39.000
<v Speaker 4>no man is exempt from the ravages of </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

2527
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:42.350
<v Speaker 4>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world collapsed and Gautama returned</v>

2528
02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:47.400
<v Speaker 4>to his home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the delights of his previous life </v>

2529
02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.930
<v Speaker 4>where ash is in his mouth and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>ventured forth a third time,</v>

2530
02:14:50.890 --> 02:14:54.460
<v Speaker 4>the gods in their mercy sent him a dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>man in funeral procession.</v>

2531
02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:00.000
<v Speaker 4>This creature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he asked his attendant laying so still </v>

2532
02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.911
<v Speaker 4>appearing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fearsome surrounded by grief and by </v>

2533
02:15:02.911 --> 02:15:03.190
<v Speaker 4>Soro last and for Lauren.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is he?</v>

2534
02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:08.140
<v Speaker 4>And the attendant answered that is a man</v>
<v Speaker 4>like other men born of woman,</v>

2535
02:15:08.141 --> 02:15:10.330
<v Speaker 4>beloved and hated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who is once you.</v>

2536
02:15:10.450 --> 02:15:14.380
<v Speaker 4>Who once was you and now as the earth </v>
<v Speaker 4>like other men you say,</v>

2537
02:15:14.381 --> 02:15:17.110
<v Speaker 4>acquired the prince.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then this could happen to me.</v>

2538
02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:20.860
<v Speaker 4>This is your and said the attendant and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end of all men.</v>

2539
02:15:21.490 --> 02:15:22.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the end of childhood,</v>

2540
02:15:22.890 --> 02:15:25.090
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no going back after that.</v>

2541
02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:28.480
<v Speaker 4>It's like Pinocchio goes back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no one home anymore.</v>

2542
02:15:28.530 --> 02:15:33.530
<v Speaker 4>It's there's nothing that your father </v>
<v Speaker 4>can do to protect you from knowledge of </v>

2543
02:15:33.530 --> 02:15:38.071
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no returning to the childhood </v>

2544
02:15:38.071 --> 02:15:40.210
<v Speaker 4>unconsciousness because you now know and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no going backwards.</v>

2545
02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:45.660
<v Speaker 4>Suicide that's going backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you replace your emergent </v>

2546
02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:48.040
<v Speaker 4>self consciousness with the old blissful</v>
<v Speaker 4>unconsciousness,</v>

2547
02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:53.160
<v Speaker 4>and that's exactly what suicidal people </v>
<v Speaker 4>wish they are going to destroy their </v>

2548
02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:56.410
<v Speaker 4>painful selfconsciousness and make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>all go away.</v>

2549
02:15:58.570 --> 02:16:01.900
<v Speaker 4>The world collapsed to final time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gautama asked to be returned home,</v>

2550
02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:05.890
<v Speaker 4>but the attendant had orders from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>prince's father and took them instead to</v>

2551
02:16:05.891 --> 02:16:07.310
<v Speaker 4>a festival of women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2552
02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:12.320
<v Speaker 4>curing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Near occurring nearby in a grove in the </v>

2553
02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:14.491
<v Speaker 4>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The prince was met by a beautiful </v>

2554
02:16:14.491 --> 02:16:15.730
<v Speaker 4>assemblage who offered themselves freely</v>
<v Speaker 4>to him without restraint in song,</v>

2555
02:16:15.731 --> 02:16:18.190
<v Speaker 4>dance and play in the spirit of sensual </v>
<v Speaker 4>love.</v>

2556
02:16:18.730 --> 02:16:23.730
<v Speaker 4>But gautama could think only of death </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the inevitable decomposition of </v>

2557
02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:25.300
<v Speaker 4>beauty and took no pleasure in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>display.</v>

2558
02:16:27.810 --> 02:16:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you see the parallels</v>

2559
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:33.220
<v Speaker 2>between one story and the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the same.</v>

2560
02:16:33.490 --> 02:16:36.370
<v Speaker 2>They have the same underlying structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>initial paradise,</v>

2561
02:16:36.430 --> 02:16:38.800
<v Speaker 2>partly childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly unconsciousness,</v>

2562
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:44.190
<v Speaker 2>the emergence of knowledge of mortality </v>
<v Speaker 2>into that and the demolition of the of </v>

2563
02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:48.811
<v Speaker 2>the paradise is the same metal story </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've been talking about all along </v>

2564
02:16:48.811 --> 02:16:52.620
<v Speaker 2>ordered state collapse into chaos while </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the story is the return,</v>

2565
02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:55.390
<v Speaker 2>like in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible is actually set up that way.</v>

2566
02:16:55.391 --> 02:17:00.391
<v Speaker 2>It's collapse into history and then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement upward.</v>

2567
02:17:01.091 --> 02:17:03.040
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the movement upward?</v>

2568
02:17:03.041 --> 02:17:07.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the question here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the collapse is caused by knowledge</v>

2569
02:17:07.511 --> 02:17:12.511
<v Speaker 2>of mortality and self and the emergence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of self consciousness and knowledge of </v>

2570
02:17:12.511 --> 02:17:16.591
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any manner in which redemption </v>

2571
02:17:16.591 --> 02:17:17.350
<v Speaker 2>can be attained or is that the final </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2572
02:17:17.351 --> 02:17:19.120
<v Speaker 2>is that finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that.</v>

2573
02:17:19.121 --> 02:17:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Does that finally demolish you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2574
02:17:21.581 --> 02:17:23.750
<v Speaker 2>that's the question and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2575
02:17:23.810 --> 02:17:28.810
<v Speaker 2>that's it's the answer to that question </v>
<v Speaker 2>that entire civilizations constantly </v>

2576
02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:32.500
<v Speaker 2>pursue and the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2577
02:17:32.501 --> 02:17:33.670
<v Speaker 2>what is the answer?</v>

2578
02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:38.790
<v Speaker 2>And part of the answer is identification</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the spirit that generates order out</v>

2579
02:17:39.281 --> 02:17:41.830
<v Speaker 2>of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the answer.</v>

2580
02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:44.470
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question is,</v>

2581
02:17:44.471 --> 02:17:45.940
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2582
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:49.390
<v Speaker 2>that will be what the last two lectures </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the course or about,</v>

2583
02:17:49.391 --> 02:17:53.920
<v Speaker 2>because we're down to two last lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so any questions,</v>

2584
02:17:54.590 --> 02:17:57.380
<v Speaker 2>does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>More,</v>

2585
02:17:57.520 --> 02:17:59.260
<v Speaker 2>more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is there,</v>

2586
02:17:59.261 --> 02:18:04.261
<v Speaker 2>is there any way in which it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sense because these stories are not</v>

2587
02:18:04.271 --> 02:18:06.580
<v Speaker 2>supposed to make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2588
02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:11.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the theory is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>archaic superstitions or something like </v>

2589
02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:12.310
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2590
02:18:12.311 --> 02:18:14.170
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to me that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

2591
02:18:14.171 --> 02:18:17.590
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that they make insanely </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect sense.</v>

2592
02:18:17.591 --> 02:18:22.591
<v Speaker 2>They're exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tell you exactly what human beings </v>

2593
02:18:22.591 --> 02:18:26.311
<v Speaker 2>are like and exactly what the situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we face is so.</v>

2594
02:18:27.250 --> 02:18:28.480
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the question is,</v>

2595
02:18:28.481 --> 02:18:30.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the diagnosis is made properly.</v>

2596
02:18:30.791 --> 02:18:33.580
<v Speaker 2>What has the cure been properly </v>
<v Speaker 2>identified?</v>

2597
02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
