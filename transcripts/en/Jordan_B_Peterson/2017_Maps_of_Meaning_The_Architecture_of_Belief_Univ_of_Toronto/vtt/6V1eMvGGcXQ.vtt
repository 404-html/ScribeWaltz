1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.350
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started the beginning of the class </v>

3
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Speaker 2>three months ago talking to you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it,</v>

4
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 2>what the problem was that I was trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to address</v>

5
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 2>and the fundamental problem was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem of belief systems and the issue </v>

6
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:40.681
<v Speaker 2>is was what precisely constitutes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief system and then a secondary </v>

7
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:50.071
<v Speaker 2>question was why are people so inclined </v>
<v Speaker 2>to even engage in conflict to maintain </v>

8
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:58.741
<v Speaker 2>and expand their belief systems and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a sub question of that and is </v>

9
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:04.141
<v Speaker 2>there an alternative to conflict with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to belief systems and then the </v>

10
00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:09.991
<v Speaker 2>last issue was something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well is there a way of judging the </v>

11
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:13.870
<v Speaker 2>relative quality of belief systems?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those are all very,</v>

12
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:18.871
<v Speaker 2>very complicated questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first one is something like </v>

13
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 2>how is it possible to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures by which we orient ourselves </v>

14
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.971
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second one is something like what's </v>

15
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 2>the psychological significance precisely</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those systems?</v>

16
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 2>What role does it play in psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>health and maybe also in social health.</v>

17
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 2>The next one is</v>

18
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 2>can you make it non relativistic case </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you assess an array of different </v>

19
00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:55.891
<v Speaker 2>value systems and then linked to that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible to hierarchically </v>

20
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 2>organized value systems in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's justifiable so that something can</v>

21
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 2>be reasonably considered in a superior </v>
<v Speaker 2>or subordinate position?</v>

22
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last question drew my attention </v>

23
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.110
<v Speaker 2>because of the implications of the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>set and the last question drew my </v>

24
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:26.311
<v Speaker 2>attention because I was trying to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the metaphysics in some sense of the</v>

25
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question was,</v>

26
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>was this just a battle ground between </v>
<v Speaker 2>two hypothetically,</v>

27
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 2>equally appropriate belief systems which</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be a morally a moral relativistic </v>

28
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

29
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:50.311
<v Speaker 2>It's belief systems are arbitrary and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>combat between them is in some sense,</v>

30
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:56.011
<v Speaker 2>inevitable and even more to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't any other way around the </v>

31
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.890
<v Speaker 2>discontinuity in some sense than combat </v>
<v Speaker 2>or subordination because there's no way </v>

32
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:08.611
<v Speaker 2>of adjudicating a victor because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no such thing as victory.</v>

33
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 2>If there's no way of ranking value </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

34
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>It's arbitrary and it's a frightening </v>
<v Speaker 2>prospect because it means that if you </v>

35
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>have a value system and I have a value </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and they're different and they're</v>

36
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:23.701
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can talk or you can </v>

37
00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 2>subordinate yourself or I could do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same,</v>

38
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 2>but there's also no reason why we </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't just didn't engage in flat out</v>

39
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

40
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Now it's complicated in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

41
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.800
<v Speaker 2>obviously by the fact that conflict can </v>
<v Speaker 2>become so untrammeled that it risks </v>

42
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:43.111
<v Speaker 2>destroying everything and that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem necessarily to be in anyone's best </v>

43
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 2>interest and less your interest happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in destroying everything.</v>

44
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:51.091
<v Speaker 2>And certainly there are no shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people whose interests tilt in that </v>

45
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

46
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.110
<v Speaker 2>so the first question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

47
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.720
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to have a belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>

48
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very complicated problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think</v>

49
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a subset of the question of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can break the question of </v>

50
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:18.611
<v Speaker 2>being into two domains which we've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this class and you could say,</v>

51
00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:24.161
<v Speaker 2>well you can assess being from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of what exists and then you </v>

52
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:28.310
<v Speaker 2>can assess being from the perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you ought to act.</v>

53
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you walk into a room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can describe the furniture or you </v>

54
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:38.030
<v Speaker 2>can determine how you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct yourself in the room.</v>

55
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's the difference between a play</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the stage setting for a play.</v>

56
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the modernist perspective,</v>

57
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.540
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the fundamental reality is to be</v>

58
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:52.460
<v Speaker 2>found in the description of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>furniture,</v>

59
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.130
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that description of what is.</v>

60
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the scientific</v>

61
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 2>process and the scientific process seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>to involve the stripping off of the </v>

62
00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:10.541
<v Speaker 2>subjective from perception and to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree from action and the extraction of</v>

63
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:16.991
<v Speaker 2>the commonalities across perception as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>means of delineating the nature of </v>

64
00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:24.401
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously that's a very powerful </v>

65
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 2>process and it has many advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but exactly what it is that science is </v>

66
00:05:28.821 --> 00:05:33.821
<v Speaker 2>doing is not precisely clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One perspective might be is that we are </v>

67
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 2>genuinely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm discovering the nature of objective </v>

68
00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:42.530
<v Speaker 2>reality and perhaps even the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality itself,</v>

69
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.970
<v Speaker 2>but there are some problems with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

70
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.340
<v Speaker 2>One of them being that</v>

71
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.190
<v Speaker 2>the scientific process seems to strip </v>
<v Speaker 2>the subjective from the phenomena.</v>

72
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>It does technically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

73
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have a hypothesis about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>something is and you have a hypothesis </v>

74
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.641
<v Speaker 2>about what something is and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis about some what something is </v>

75
00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:10.360
<v Speaker 2>and we undertake a number of procedures </v>
<v Speaker 2>to assess what the fundamental phenomena</v>

76
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:15.371
<v Speaker 2>is and then we look across our </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual sets and we extract out the </v>

77
00:06:15.371 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>commonalities and we dispense with </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that is superfluous.</v>

78
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:22.991
<v Speaker 2>Everything that's merely subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you feel about the chair is not </v>

79
00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 2>relevant to the objective existence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chair.</v>

80
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.340
<v Speaker 2>And so it eradicates subjectivity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very useful process because it </v>

81
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:35.621
<v Speaker 2>does seem to enable us to grasp reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a fundamental sense more profoundly,</v>

82
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.730
<v Speaker 2>but it leaves the subjective behind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's a problem because they </v>

83
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.910
<v Speaker 2>didn't make the noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

84
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

85
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want.</v>

86
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate it.</v>

87
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the issue might be,</v>

88
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:58.871
<v Speaker 2>well it is something irretrievably lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you dispense with this objective and </v>

89
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.930
<v Speaker 2>and also how deep a hole you dig when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you dispense with this objective.</v>

90
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.590
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's an intrinsically</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the problem of the </v>

91
00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:19.021
<v Speaker 2>relationship between is an ot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's an old philosophical </v>

92
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.690
<v Speaker 2>conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think first put forth by Dave,</v>

93
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.970
<v Speaker 2>David Hume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who made the claim that no matter how </v>

94
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.680
<v Speaker 2>much you know about something from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>empirical perspective,</v>

95
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.780
<v Speaker 2>you cannot use that as an unerring guide</v>
<v Speaker 2>to action in relationship to that,</v>

96
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.130
<v Speaker 2>to that empirical object or set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>empirical objects and people.</v>

97
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a tricky issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:44.620
<v Speaker 2>because obviously you can use empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>information to inform your decisions.</v>

99
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.670
<v Speaker 3>But I think.</v>

100
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.120
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple pathways of action that are </v>

101
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.271
<v Speaker 2>implied by any set of data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be the fundamental </v>

102
00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:00.001
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that is that you </v>

103
00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:01.651
<v Speaker 2>can't draw a one to one specification to</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the empirical districts </v>

104
00:08:01.651 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 2>description and what you should do about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

105
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:08.821
<v Speaker 2>And like maybe an example is where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can gather a lot of information about </v>

106
00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:13.051
<v Speaker 2>aids and you can gather a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information about cancer and you can </v>

107
00:08:13.051 --> 00:08:15.841
<v Speaker 2>gather a lot of information about </v>
<v Speaker 2>educational outcomes and economic </v>

108
00:08:15.841 --> 00:08:19.231
<v Speaker 2>outcomes and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't obvious how you then use </v>

109
00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:21.130
<v Speaker 2>that empirical information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

110
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:23.260
<v Speaker 2>how to guide policy decisions because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

111
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:28.261
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much money should we spend on </v>

112
00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:29.521
<v Speaker 2>education compared to cancer prevention </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much money should be spent on </v>

113
00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:33.280
<v Speaker 2>cancer prevention compared to curing </v>
<v Speaker 2>aids and or or addressing disease in the</v>

114
00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:34.150
<v Speaker 2>third world country.</v>

115
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:39.330
<v Speaker 2>What happens is that the set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>variables that you encounter while </v>

116
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.901
<v Speaker 2>trying to make your empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculation get to be so massive so </v>

117
00:08:42.901 --> 00:08:46.441
<v Speaker 2>rapidly that there doesn't seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>any logical way of linking them to a </v>

118
00:08:46.441 --> 00:08:50.281
<v Speaker 2>behavioral outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of associated with the </v>

119
00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:50.281
<v Speaker 2>postmodern conundrum as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

120
00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:51.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a set of data and it,</v>

121
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.380
<v Speaker 2>it could be a literary work for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

122
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a very large number of that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can derive from that set of data and </v>

123
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.811
<v Speaker 2>there's no simple way of deciding which </v>
<v Speaker 2>one is going to be canonical and so it </v>

124
00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 2>isn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason that you can't derive</v>

125
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.830
<v Speaker 2>an ot from an ias is because you run </v>
<v Speaker 2>into something like competent tutorial </v>

126
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 2>explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have an infinite number of</v>

127
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:12.480
<v Speaker 2>facts at your disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

128
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:17.481
<v Speaker 2>and then another infinite number of ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can organize those facts and </v>

129
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:21.020
<v Speaker 2>that massive array of facts and and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>recategorized facts doesn't tell you </v>

130
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 2>what to do in a given situation.</v>

131
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.520
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe the question of what to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a given situation is a different </v>

132
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 2>domain of question and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that to be the case.</v>

133
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Stephen Jay Gould who </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about religion and science as to,</v>

134
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I think he called them different </v>
<v Speaker 2>magisterium.</v>

135
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Two different fundamental domains that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that each had their realm of </v>

136
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 2>operation and one was the description of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the objective world.</v>

137
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:56.631
<v Speaker 2>Obviously that's on the scientific end </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other was the realm of ethics </v>

138
00:09:56.631 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 2>and so you could put religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology,</v>

139
00:09:58.591 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the humanities,</v>

140
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.850
<v Speaker 2>all of that history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even for that matter to some degree,</v>

141
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:07.851
<v Speaker 2>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the ethics category and because I </v>

142
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:14.241
<v Speaker 2>don't see a straightforward way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a set of facts and then </v>

143
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 2>transforming them into a behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsion.</v>

144
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Then I do think that these two things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are reasonably regarded as overlapping </v>

145
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.210
<v Speaker 2>and intrinsically associated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

146
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 2>but technically and philosophically </v>
<v Speaker 2>separable.</v>

147
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then then the next question emerges,</v>

148
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:37.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're separable,</v>

149
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 2>if there has to be a domain of inquiry </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the structure of values,</v>

150
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:50.230
<v Speaker 2>what might that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how is it that you would understand</v>

151
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 2>the psychological and sociological </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena that are associated with a </v>

152
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:00.780
<v Speaker 2>moral stance?</v>

153
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.720
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would,</v>

154
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.930
<v Speaker 2>how would you understand the details of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and then even more to the point,</v>

155
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.650
<v Speaker 2>is there any way of subjecting different</v>
<v Speaker 2>sets of ethical interpretation to </v>

156
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.790
<v Speaker 2>testing so that you can judge their </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparative validity because that's sort</v>

157
00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:22.760
<v Speaker 2>of the way out of moral relativism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking.</v>

158
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:27.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like first you make the proposition</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are value structures and that</v>

159
00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:33.221
<v Speaker 2>they're independent from empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation and then the next is that </v>

160
00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:37.271
<v Speaker 2>you investigate the possibility that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can compare and contrast different </v>

161
00:11:37.271 --> 00:11:39.860
<v Speaker 2>structures of ethics and draw some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of conclusion.</v>

162
00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:44.861
<v Speaker 2>That's not merely arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it might be turtles all the way </v>

163
00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:45.320
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how the old joke goes.</v>

164
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

165
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.430
<v Speaker 2>but maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was interested in that again </v>

166
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.430
<v Speaker 2>because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

167
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 2>are we fighting the cold war merely </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're having an argument or is </v>

168
00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:04.851
<v Speaker 2>there some manner in which one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems can be just determined to be </v>

169
00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:10.041
<v Speaker 2>wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course there was more weight </v>

170
00:12:10.041 --> 00:12:14.151
<v Speaker 2>behind that query because the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and the system and the system </v>

171
00:12:17.221 --> 00:12:22.221
<v Speaker 2>that's in place in North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not only predicated on different </v>

172
00:12:22.221 --> 00:12:26.541
<v Speaker 2>assumptions than the western system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were also extraordinarily </v>

173
00:12:26.541 --> 00:12:29.691
<v Speaker 2>murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that seemed to add additional </v>

174
00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:31.170
<v Speaker 2>weight to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the sequence of questions.</v>

175
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:33.840
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

176
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

177
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.500
<v Speaker 2>I was reading young at the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>young was Carl young was fundamentally,</v>

178
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 2>I would say a psychologist of narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>of story.</v>

179
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 2>And and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he outlined this.</v>

180
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.920
<v Speaker 2>He outlined the idea for me that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabited stories,</v>

181
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:01.921
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said actually they inhabited myths </v>

182
00:13:01.921 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 2>and even more to the point whether they </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew it or not,</v>

183
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 2>they inhabited archetipal myths or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were possessed by them.</v>

184
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 2>And so it was the first time I'd really </v>
<v Speaker 2>come into contact with the idea directly</v>

185
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:16.411
<v Speaker 2>put that there was a direct relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the structures that you use to </v>

186
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 2>orient yourself in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>

187
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:26.190
<v Speaker 2>And so then I started to assess the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental elements of stories,</v>

188
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:29.410
<v Speaker 2>what might a story looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and while I was doing that,</v>

189
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:32.020
<v Speaker 2>that was informed by a number of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I was reading about,</v>

190
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:37.050
<v Speaker 2>including a set of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read the neuroscience literature with </v>

191
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:42.100
<v Speaker 2>regards to information processing fairly</v>
<v Speaker 2>extensively.</v>

192
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.740
<v Speaker 2>And that introduced me to a whole set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other ideas including cybernetic ideas </v>

193
00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.491
<v Speaker 2>which have been incorporated into what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was describing to you in this basic </v>

194
00:13:52.491 --> 00:13:56.001
<v Speaker 2>cybernetic system is a system that has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting point in a system that has an </v>

195
00:13:56.001 --> 00:14:00.640
<v Speaker 2>endpoint and a system that has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsystem that monitors progress or </v>

196
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.410
<v Speaker 2>deviation from progress along the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway to the end point.</v>

197
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:09.411
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that looks a lot like a story or </v>

198
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:09.411
<v Speaker 2>map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

199
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:09.900
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

200
00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:14.901
<v Speaker 2>well that's where the overlap is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fundamental story is something </v>

201
00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:14.901
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very straightforward.</v>

202
00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:19.700
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the frame that you inhabit </v>

203
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.671
<v Speaker 2>when you conceptualize the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrow and narrow and simplify the </v>

204
00:14:22.671 --> 00:14:26.661
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you have to do because it's so </v>

205
00:14:26.661 --> 00:14:28.131
<v Speaker 2>complex because you have this infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of facts that are laying around </v>

206
00:14:28.131 --> 00:14:31.701
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are you doing while you're a </v>

207
00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:31.701
<v Speaker 2>mobile creature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living creature,</v>

208
00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:35.700
<v Speaker 2>not a static information processor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your targeted.</v>

209
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.610
<v Speaker 2>You're a targeted creature and otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't move.</v>

210
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To move is to be a targeted creature </v>

211
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.281
<v Speaker 2>because you have to move towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>something or away from something so the </v>

212
00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:48.921
<v Speaker 2>targeting is built right into the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're a mobile creature and then </v>

213
00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:48.921
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

214
00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:49.560
<v Speaker 2>what do you target?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>

215
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you target your target.</v>

216
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.020
<v Speaker 2>You could say you target what you aim </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

217
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:55.460
<v Speaker 2>but then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

218
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you aim for what you want.</v>

219
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.830
<v Speaker 2>You target your desires and then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>leads you into a discussion of the </v>

220
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.660
<v Speaker 2>underlying neurobiology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially you bring to the table a set</v>

221
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:10.661
<v Speaker 2>of inbuilt desires and the targets that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you pick have to address the fact that </v>

222
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 2>those desires exist in the desires are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually grounded in necessity.</v>

223
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

224
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.160
<v Speaker 2>this is a sidebar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is where I think piaget's </v>

225
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.711
<v Speaker 2>theory is weaker than it should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>because piaget and you know I'm a great </v>

226
00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:30.470
<v Speaker 2>admirer of piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believed that the human infant came into</v>

227
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Speaker 2>the world with a fairly primordial set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of reflexes,</v>

228
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 2>mostly sensory motor reflexes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then boot strapped him or herself up</v>

229
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 2>on the basis of those reflexes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociological,</v>

230
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:47.140
<v Speaker 2>in the in the social surround,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's a constructivist view point </v>

231
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 2>that the child comes in with a few basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements that can get it going.</v>

232
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Elements of exploration and memory </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

233
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:57.010
<v Speaker 2>and then it builds itself as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of its exploration in the </v>

234
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.500
<v Speaker 2>social community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think that's true except that it's</v>

235
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:05.501
<v Speaker 2>too empty because what it fails to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>into consideration is the fact that,</v>

236
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an observation in some sense,</v>

237
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:15.941
<v Speaker 2>philosophically that was first made by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Emmanuel Kant when he criticized pure </v>

238
00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:19.310
<v Speaker 2>reason so that you can't come into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world structureless.</v>

239
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.340
<v Speaker 2>You have to come into the world with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inbuilt structure and then it's the </v>

240
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 2>interaction of that structure with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that provides the information that</v>

241
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:31.631
<v Speaker 2>you can use to build yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the structure has to be there and I </v>

242
00:16:31.631 --> 00:16:35.411
<v Speaker 2>would say that's the same mythologically</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking as the idea that the great </v>

243
00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:35.510
<v Speaker 2>father is always there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

244
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:36.800
<v Speaker 2>There's the great mother is always </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

245
00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:39.110
<v Speaker 2>That's chaos itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The great father is always there.</v>

246
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:44.111
<v Speaker 2>That's order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the interpretive structure that </v>

247
00:16:44.111 --> 00:16:46.211
<v Speaker 2>you use to interact with the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then of course the individual is </v>

248
00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:49.571
<v Speaker 2>always there at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and piaget in some sense re retold that </v>

249
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:55.301
<v Speaker 2>story except he didn't give enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>credence to the fact that the infant </v>

250
00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:02.120
<v Speaker 2>comes into the world far more fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>formed than his theory.</v>

251
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:09.250
<v Speaker 2>His theory presumes now the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See the problem with that is that </v>

252
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.570
<v Speaker 2>without that additional underlying set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

253
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:16.750
<v Speaker 2>let's call them biological constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interpretation universe gets too </v>

254
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:21.401
<v Speaker 2>large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need constraints to narrow the </v>

255
00:17:21.401 --> 00:17:26.081
<v Speaker 2>domain of phenomena that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>contending with and and it's in the </v>

256
00:17:26.081 --> 00:17:30.560
<v Speaker 2>analysis of the constraints that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer to how do you stop drowning in an</v>

257
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 2>infinite number of potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations emerges.</v>

258
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:40.270
<v Speaker 2>The interpretations are subject to </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints and that's also the way out </v>

259
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 2>of the moral relativist paradox as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I can tell.</v>

260
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:46.841
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I really liked about </v>

261
00:17:46.841 --> 00:17:48.221
<v Speaker 2>piaget was that he described some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints was one of the constraints </v>

262
00:17:48.221 --> 00:17:50.320
<v Speaker 2>was as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

263
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:55.370
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to exist in a social world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to because I won't exist </v>

264
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I don't exist in a social world,</v>

265
00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.340
<v Speaker 2>then there are constraints on the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have to interact with other </v>

266
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.891
<v Speaker 2>people and and Psj is essential point </v>
<v Speaker 2>was I have to organize myself to play a </v>

267
00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:10.701
<v Speaker 2>joint game with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the game has constraints and one of </v>

268
00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:14.451
<v Speaker 2>them is you have to want to play because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have other options and then there </v>

269
00:18:14.451 --> 00:18:14.520
<v Speaker 2>are other constraints.</v>

270
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.560
<v Speaker 2>You and I have to be able to play in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that other people don't object to or</v>

271
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 2>maybe even that you and I have to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that other people will be,</v>

272
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will support.</v>

273
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.740
<v Speaker 2>And then you can imagine another </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraint which is you and I have to </v>

274
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.921
<v Speaker 2>play a game in a way that other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would support that will last more than </v>

275
00:18:33.921 --> 00:18:33.921
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it has the law,</v>

276
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 2>it has to work today and tomorrow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>next week.</v>

277
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:39.540
<v Speaker 2>It has to work across the span of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to work not only for you and I,</v>

278
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:41.430
<v Speaker 2>but it has to work for our future </v>
<v Speaker 2>selves.</v>

279
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.470
<v Speaker 2>And so the dam constraints are starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pile up.</v>

280
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:47.100
<v Speaker 2>That's just on the socio cultural side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's on the constructionist side only,</v>

281
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.730
<v Speaker 2>but there's the biological constraints </v>
<v Speaker 2>are equally important because not only </v>

282
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.630
<v Speaker 2>does the game that you and I have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play have to satisfy those emergent </v>

283
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 2>sociological constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the game also has to be organized so</v>

284
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 2>that the internal polity that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>composed of,</v>

285
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.240
<v Speaker 2>let's call them the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational and emotional systems that </v>

286
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:11.240
<v Speaker 2>make that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

287
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.570
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that constitute us.</v>

288
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.590
<v Speaker 2>They have to all find satisfaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise the system grinds to a</v>

289
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:21.591
<v Speaker 2>halt and so this seems to me to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginnings of an answer to the </v>

290
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 2>postmodern conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

291
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:29.061
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any set of facts is amenable to an </v>

292
00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:29.061
<v Speaker 2>infinite number of interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

293
00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes deriving an is from analog to</v>

294
00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:34.830
<v Speaker 2>a very difficult endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

295
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.390
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

296
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:39.660
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that any old </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution will work.</v>

297
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

298
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:46.341
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's merely because we introduced work </v>

299
00:19:46.341 --> 00:19:49.550
<v Speaker 2>into the conversation to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The interpretation has to be functional </v>

300
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:50.730
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it seems.</v>

301
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.040
<v Speaker 2>That's what seems to tie it back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

302
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.310
<v Speaker 2>This is also what got me interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatism technically speaking and so </v>

303
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.601
<v Speaker 2>because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your conundrum is here you are and </v>

304
00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:04.770
<v Speaker 2>there you have to be and and how to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

305
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Then one of the constraints on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner in which you interpret the world </v>

306
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.580
<v Speaker 2>is when you apply your interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you end up moving from the point </v>

307
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 2>you're at to the point you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if the answer to that is no,</v>

308
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.180
<v Speaker 2>then the solution is insufficient.</v>

309
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Now you could call the solution untrue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I it's dangerous to to to introduce </v>

310
00:20:23.341 --> 00:20:28.341
<v Speaker 2>the truth or falsity dilemmas because </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't it's functionality,</v>

311
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.020
<v Speaker 2>more functionality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than truth.</v>

312
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Although I think you could say that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the final analysis,</v>

313
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 2>truth is integrally linked to function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to touch that question</v>

314
00:20:37.291 --> 00:20:40.920
<v Speaker 2>for the time being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is is that your interpretation</v>

315
00:20:40.921 --> 00:20:45.921
<v Speaker 2>of the world carries within it </v>
<v Speaker 2>implicitly a theory about its own </v>

316
00:20:45.921 --> 00:20:49.341
<v Speaker 2>validity and the theory about its own </v>
<v Speaker 2>validity is that if you enact it in the </v>

317
00:20:49.341 --> 00:20:54.091
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will produce the result that you </v>

318
00:20:54.091 --> 00:20:55.810
<v Speaker 2>desire and then the consequence of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if it doesn't produce the result</v>

319
00:20:55.811 --> 00:21:00.811
<v Speaker 2>that you desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it isn't good enough theory period </v>

320
00:21:00.811 --> 00:21:04.080
<v Speaker 2>and that's how you grapple with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that although you don't know everything,</v>

321
00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.260
<v Speaker 2>you still have to orient yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

322
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:14.100
<v Speaker 2>You lay out partial theories that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make partial predictions and if </v>

323
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.781
<v Speaker 2>they do a good enough job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't worry about it anymore </v>

324
00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:18.781
<v Speaker 2>and you go onto the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

325
00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:23.221
<v Speaker 2>So then you think there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints piling up on your </v>

326
00:21:23.221 --> 00:21:23.221
<v Speaker 2>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

327
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.850
<v Speaker 2>they have to work for the creature that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are and so you know,</v>

328
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 2>we can lay it sort of like maslow's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of needs.</v>

329
00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:33.751
<v Speaker 2>Something like that's not exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same because I don't think that he got </v>

330
00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:34.480
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy right for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for very complex reasons,</v>

331
00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:37.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonably obvious to,</v>

332
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.690
<v Speaker 2>to observe that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to work out very well </v>

333
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:42.940
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have anything to eat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

334
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:47.941
<v Speaker 2>you you've got about a week and you if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have anything to drink and </v>

335
00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 2>obviously you need shelter and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>

336
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 2>you need companionship and by need.</v>

337
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.660
<v Speaker 2>What I mean is that if you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

338
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 2>then you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole game comes to a halt so we can</v>

339
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:59.650
<v Speaker 2>ground that in self evident reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>without any real problem.</v>

340
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.710
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's the list of human </v>

341
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.710
<v Speaker 2>necessities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that's,</v>

342
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.880
<v Speaker 2>that's a difficult thing to parameterize</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can argue about the degree </v>

343
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:14.941
<v Speaker 2>to which something is necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some things that we know </v>

344
00:22:14.941 --> 00:22:14.941
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

345
00:22:14.941 --> 00:22:16.810
<v Speaker 2>we covered the basics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature regulation,</v>

346
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.310
<v Speaker 2>elimination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

347
00:22:18.311 --> 00:22:19.600
<v Speaker 2>intake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shelter,</v>

348
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's more subtle things </v>

349
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:24.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

350
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.660
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

351
00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:27.870
<v Speaker 2>die without touch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's.</v>

352
00:22:27.871 --> 00:22:32.440
<v Speaker 2>There's something integral about tactile</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction with other people,</v>

353
00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:34.510
<v Speaker 2>so we could call that love if you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that's.</v>

354
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not optional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

355
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Play is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Children do not develop properly unless </v>

356
00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:47.131
<v Speaker 2>they played,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say that adults also can't </v>

357
00:22:47.131 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 2>maintain their mental health or physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>health unless they play too.</v>

358
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.220
<v Speaker 2>And so you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

359
00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a core set of necessities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then off of that there's a secondary</v>

360
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:57.780
<v Speaker 2>set of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call them?</v>

361
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.010
<v Speaker 2>They're not ultimate necessities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're pretty high.</v>

362
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.040
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be pretty highly valued</v>
<v Speaker 2>by people and more or less universally </v>

363
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.620
<v Speaker 2>pain avoidance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

364
00:23:05.621 --> 00:23:10.621
<v Speaker 2>under most circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people don't really like to be in </v>

365
00:23:10.621 --> 00:23:13.981
<v Speaker 2>terror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people really don't like to be </v>

366
00:23:13.981 --> 00:23:13.981
<v Speaker 2>disgusted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

367
00:23:13.981 --> 00:23:17.310
<v Speaker 2>you can lay out the basic emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can lay out the basic motivations </v>

368
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.310
<v Speaker 2>and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

369
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.930
<v Speaker 2>the game that you're going to play has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to operate within this space that's </v>

370
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 2>defined by that set of a priory </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints.</v>

371
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now things are getting pretty </v>

372
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:27.900
<v Speaker 2>constrained here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had the game,</v>

373
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.041
<v Speaker 2>you play house to satisfy that set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological demands,</v>

374
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:38.070
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic biological demands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it has to be something that you can </v>

375
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:42.390
<v Speaker 2>utilize with other people voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it has to be something that will be </v>

376
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:48.301
<v Speaker 2>playable across multiple iterations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say there's a very limited </v>

377
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:53.450
<v Speaker 2>number of interpretive interpretive </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures that are going to satisfy all</v>

378
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:55.160
<v Speaker 2>of those preconditions simultaneously.</v>

379
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.330
<v Speaker 2>And to me that just blows out the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>

380
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:03.080
<v Speaker 2>It blows out the claims of moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>relativism and it it,</v>

381
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.010
<v Speaker 2>it also demotions and this is the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in some sense.</v>

382
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.460
<v Speaker 2>It demolishes ideas that the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which people organize themselves in the </v>

383
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.110
<v Speaker 2>world as individuals and as societies is</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow arbitrary.</v>

384
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:20.770
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look to me to be arbitrary at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all and so in is genius.</v>

385
00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I think in some part was observing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in children's spontaneously in that when</v>

386
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:30.101
<v Speaker 2>children past the egocentric phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means after they were about two </v>

387
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:34.290
<v Speaker 2>years of old or they're maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

388
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:39.330
<v Speaker 2>They're approaching three years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've more or less got their internal </v>

389
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.730
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms organized so that they're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>unitary being.</v>

390
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking at three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start to develop the ability to use</v>

391
00:24:48.731 --> 00:24:53.731
<v Speaker 2>fictional frames of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and that's an interesting thing </v>

392
00:24:53.731 --> 00:24:57.511
<v Speaker 2>because I would say that the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological systems come armed with their</v>

393
00:24:58.001 --> 00:25:00.250
<v Speaker 2>own frame of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're hungry,</v>

394
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.880
<v Speaker 2>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up comes a frame of reference and within</v>

395
00:25:03.881 --> 00:25:08.881
<v Speaker 2>that your perceptions are shaped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the action proclivities are</v>

396
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.800
<v Speaker 2>rr primed and the world lays itself out </v>
<v Speaker 2>around that particular biological </v>

397
00:25:16.241 --> 00:25:19.240
<v Speaker 2>necessity and you can lay those out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same if you're thirsty,</v>

398
00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:24.450
<v Speaker 2>same if you're too hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same if you want to play all those </v>

399
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.571
<v Speaker 2>systems come built in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the problem with that is that </v>

400
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:33.060
<v Speaker 2>they compete because it isn't obvious </v>
<v Speaker 2>which one should take priority and then </v>

401
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.540
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to organize them in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>social space.</v>

402
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:39.541
<v Speaker 2>And so what seems to have happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings is that we've been able to </v>

403
00:25:39.541 --> 00:25:42.361
<v Speaker 2>replace the frame that's predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational necessity with abstracted </v>

404
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:49.510
<v Speaker 2>frames that are more voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily constructed that incorporate</v>

405
00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.910
<v Speaker 2>multiple motivational systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>

406
00:25:51.911 --> 00:25:56.911
<v Speaker 2>And that's in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also what it's the same thing as </v>

407
00:25:56.911 --> 00:26:00.211
<v Speaker 2>we've learned how to think abstractly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the frame that you're going to </v>

408
00:26:00.211 --> 00:26:00.310
<v Speaker 2>lay out on the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a good frame,</v>

409
00:26:00.311 --> 00:26:04.990
<v Speaker 2>is one that solves a whole set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems at the same time and so that,</v>

410
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.330
<v Speaker 2>and you can slot different frames.</v>

411
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.300
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can experiment with different frames</v>

412
00:26:10.301 --> 00:26:15.301
<v Speaker 2>and that's a precondition to being able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to play because one of the things that </v>

413
00:26:15.301 --> 00:26:18.601
<v Speaker 2>Piaget pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see this when children pretend </v>

414
00:26:18.601 --> 00:26:20.860
<v Speaker 2>play is like for an even more clearly in</v>
<v Speaker 2>in games that have rules,</v>

415
00:26:20.861 --> 00:26:23.860
<v Speaker 2>but let's say they're in pretend play </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to say,</v>

416
00:26:23.861 --> 00:26:28.861
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to lay out a little </v>

417
00:26:28.861 --> 00:26:30.330
<v Speaker 2>fictional schema here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to play out and you can be </v>

418
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:30.330
<v Speaker 2>the cat and I'll be the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the dad,</v>

419
00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:35.370
<v Speaker 2>and then you negotiate a bit to see if </v>
<v Speaker 2>those rules are acceptable and then you </v>

420
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.241
<v Speaker 2>run it as a simulation and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are doing when they're playing and </v>

421
00:26:39.241 --> 00:26:42.480
<v Speaker 2>they're experimented with different </v>
<v Speaker 2>super ordinate frames of reference that </v>

422
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>are accessible in the world and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

423
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:49.340
<v Speaker 2>They're learning how to develop those </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual schemes and also how to </v>

424
00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.910
<v Speaker 2>interact in a manner that allows the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme that they're using to find it </v>

425
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 2>social acceptability and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

426
00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.400
<v Speaker 2>The child assumes that the scheme is </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful if both children have fun </v>

427
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:08.751
<v Speaker 2>while they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's the volunteerism and so </v>

428
00:27:08.751 --> 00:27:11.901
<v Speaker 2>piaget made a very interesting point </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that that I think is absolutely </v>

429
00:27:11.901 --> 00:27:11.901
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that</v>

430
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:18.590
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between a game that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will play voluntarily and one </v>

431
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 2>that has to be enforced and so then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can imagine an environment where gay may</v>

432
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:27.141
<v Speaker 2>is played voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a certain end and game b is </v>

433
00:27:27.141 --> 00:27:30.171
<v Speaker 2>played by force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but both of them are moving towards the </v>

434
00:27:30.171 --> 00:27:33.651
<v Speaker 2>same end and Piaget's claim was the game</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's played voluntarily or even more </v>

435
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:39.230
<v Speaker 2>to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The set of all games that are played </v>

436
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.201
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily will outcompete the set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all games that are played by force if </v>

437
00:27:42.201 --> 00:27:44.040
<v Speaker 2>they're put head to head in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive environment.</v>

438
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

439
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:50.421
<v Speaker 2>that's such a brilliant observation </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there you have the basis for a </v>

440
00:27:50.421 --> 00:27:53.910
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic grounding of for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evaluation of ethics.</v>

441
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can pick the target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter whatever target you </v>

442
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.441
<v Speaker 2>pick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the game is voluntary and aimed at </v>

443
00:28:03.441 --> 00:28:05.961
<v Speaker 2>the target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will defeat a game that's imposed by </v>

444
00:28:05.961 --> 00:28:05.961
<v Speaker 2>tyranny.</v>

445
00:28:05.961 --> 00:28:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a pretty good proposition.</v>

446
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.740
<v Speaker 2>I would say there's a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence for this proposition and a fair</v>

447
00:28:10.741 --> 00:28:14.340
<v Speaker 2>bit of it is actually derived from </v>
<v Speaker 2>observation of animal behavior because I</v>

448
00:28:14.341 --> 00:28:17.550
<v Speaker 2>ran you guys through the emerging </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature on this stability,</v>

449
00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:22.551
<v Speaker 2>say of chimpanzee hierarchies and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee tyrant hierarchy isn't very </v>

450
00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:28.311
<v Speaker 2>stable and the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to subordinate chimps who are three </v>

451
00:28:28.311 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 2>quarters as strong as the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrant can take them out and they do,</v>

452
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.960
<v Speaker 2>and so then the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

453
00:28:33.961 --> 00:28:38.460
<v Speaker 2>how do you have to conduct yourself as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>high dominance chimp if you're not going</v>

454
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:43.461
<v Speaker 2>to be torn apart by those who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically your subordinates and </v>

455
00:28:43.461 --> 00:28:44.220
<v Speaker 2>answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

456
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.530
<v Speaker 2>don't be too much of a tyrant.</v>

457
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Formulate some social connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Engage in some reciprocity with regards </v>

458
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.360
<v Speaker 2>to your social relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't oppress the females,</v>

459
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.640
<v Speaker 2>don't torment the children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

460
00:28:58.641 --> 00:29:03.641
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that makes you unpopular and </v>

461
00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:06.191
<v Speaker 2>then you'll get torn to shreds and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are practical limits on the </v>

462
00:29:06.191 --> 00:29:11.171
<v Speaker 2>expression of tyranny that are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence both of biological </v>

463
00:29:11.171 --> 00:29:14.981
<v Speaker 2>limitations because people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>object if the system is set up so that </v>

464
00:29:14.981 --> 00:29:19.631
<v Speaker 2>their fundamental needs aren't met and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also going to object if the game</v>

465
00:29:20.031 --> 00:29:22.940
<v Speaker 2>that's being played isn't functioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially and so this is very,</v>

466
00:29:22.941 --> 00:29:26.390
<v Speaker 2>very tight set of constraints and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the question might be,</v>

467
00:29:26.391 --> 00:29:28.400
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take that set of constraints,</v>

468
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:33.410
<v Speaker 2>what sort of systems can operate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

469
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that what set of systems can </v>

470
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.070
<v Speaker 2>operate within those sets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints.</v>

471
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Then you might say if you take that set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all systems that might operate within</v>

472
00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 2>those constraints and you look at what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>common across them,</v>

473
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:50.290
<v Speaker 2>then you could extract out what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially a universal morality.</v>

474
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.740
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and I don't see</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that proposition is precisely </v>

475
00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.691
<v Speaker 2>questionable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that all of that's built </v>

476
00:30:00.691 --> 00:30:02.971
<v Speaker 2>on rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's no doubt that infants </v>

477
00:30:02.971 --> 00:30:06.841
<v Speaker 2>bring biological necessity to the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fully established and </v>

478
00:30:06.841 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 2>it's established physiologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's established behaviorly.</v>

479
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:16.510
<v Speaker 2>It's established with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary history because we can take</v>

480
00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 2>the motivational systems that are part </v>
<v Speaker 2>and parcel of our being and we can trace</v>

481
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:23.890
<v Speaker 2>their development back in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a billion years,</v>

482
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:29.340
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that the infant is a blank </v>

483
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.361
<v Speaker 2>slate when it's born and thus subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite sociological manipulation is a.</v>

484
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dead in the water.</v>

485
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.280
<v Speaker 2>That's just not the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>

486
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:44.281
<v Speaker 2>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've got that nailed down hard and </v>

487
00:30:44.281 --> 00:30:48.421
<v Speaker 2>then the idea that your identity is also</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaped sociologically.</v>

488
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.280
<v Speaker 2>While I don't think anybody disputes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

489
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.620
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter where they are on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretive framework.</v>

490
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:58.621
<v Speaker 2>They might dispute the degree to which </v>
<v Speaker 2>that occurs and the mechanisms by which </v>

491
00:30:58.621 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 2>it occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that it occurs that's.</v>

492
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.680
<v Speaker 2>That's close enough to self evidence so </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can just leave it there.</v>

493
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Well then the question is what are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of the,</v>

494
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.970
<v Speaker 2>of sociological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of associate,</v>

495
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.140
<v Speaker 2>of socialization,</v>

496
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:16.600
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

497
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:23.420
<v Speaker 2>once you admit to the existence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>realm of biological necessity,</v>

498
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:28.370
<v Speaker 2>you instantly put a set of constraints </v>
<v Speaker 2>on how society is constructed themselves</v>

499
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.440
<v Speaker 2>so that they will not be</v>

500
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:36.810
<v Speaker 2>torn down and overthrown with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at how kids are socialized,</v>

501
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I think that Piaget's developmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>observations are buying by,</v>

502
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:46.441
<v Speaker 2>correct the first two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly interactions between the </v>

503
00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:48.220
<v Speaker 2>infant and the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

504
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.540
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bi-directional though because the </v>

505
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:53.540
<v Speaker 2>infant has to come to terms with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>

506
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.470
<v Speaker 2>but the mother also has to come to terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the infants.</v>

507
00:31:55.471 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's not even top down at the level </v>
<v Speaker 2>of infant maternal relationship.</v>

508
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch a new mother adapt to a </v>

509
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.071
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that the mother is doing as </v>

510
00:32:08.071 --> 00:32:10.621
<v Speaker 2>much adaptation to the baby as the baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to the mother because the infant has </v>

511
00:32:10.621 --> 00:32:14.851
<v Speaker 2>this inbuilt character already and has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be charmed into a relationship that's</v>

512
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.590
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that and,</v>

513
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:22.620
<v Speaker 2>and detention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very little different than </v>

514
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:22.620
<v Speaker 2>establishing a relationship with someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's older.</v>

515
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.290
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's lower resolution and it's harder to</v>

516
00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:29.500
<v Speaker 2>make the observations because of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>the infant is only capable of behavioral</v>

517
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 2>display count,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't speak,</v>

518
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:36.690
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the necessity for establishing the </v>

519
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:36.690
<v Speaker 2>individual relationship is there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>

520
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 2>So even in the early stages of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>infants socialization,</v>

521
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.380
<v Speaker 2>the process isn't state downward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not great father downward.</v>

522
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.420
<v Speaker 2>It's mutual and then of course by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time the child is old enough to be </v>

523
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:54.701
<v Speaker 2>launched out into the social world than </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the constraints that are associated </v>

524
00:32:54.701 --> 00:32:59.501
<v Speaker 2>with the playground are immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>placed on that child and that's a very </v>

525
00:32:59.501 --> 00:32:59.501
<v Speaker 2>unforgiving landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

526
00:32:59.501 --> 00:33:04.360
<v Speaker 2>because the last thing a child wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>really the last thing that child wants </v>

527
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.991
<v Speaker 2>is not to have any friends or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps equally seriously not to have a </v>

528
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:09.810
<v Speaker 2>best friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

529
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Not read something so idiotic the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day that I couldn't believe it.</v>

530
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:17.330
<v Speaker 2>So the newest prince,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Queen Elizabeth,</v>

531
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I guess great grandchild is off to </v>
<v Speaker 2>daycare and in the UK and in this </v>

532
00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:26.621
<v Speaker 2>daycare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't let the kids have best </v>

533
00:33:26.621 --> 00:33:26.621
<v Speaker 2>friends because that's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

534
00:33:26.621 --> 00:33:26.930
<v Speaker 2>you know</v>

535
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.040
<v Speaker 2>something times you see something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so stupid you can't even believe it.</v>

536
00:33:32.041 --> 00:33:33.480
<v Speaker 2>It it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it exists.</v>

537
00:33:33.481 --> 00:33:36.810
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of those examples </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's been known for quite a long</v>

538
00:33:36.811 --> 00:33:41.811
<v Speaker 2>time that one of the developmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>milestones that children attain </v>

539
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:47.660
<v Speaker 2>somewhere between say the age of five </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 10 is they pick a best friend and so</v>

540
00:33:47.761 --> 00:33:52.761
<v Speaker 2>they and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know the hypothesis well that's </v>

541
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:52.860
<v Speaker 2>unfair to all the other children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

542
00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.020
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be the best friend to everyone</v>

543
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.230
<v Speaker 2>because you then maybe there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion children,</v>

544
00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.260
<v Speaker 2>so each of them gets one second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's just not a very deep </v>

545
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.201
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that you can be equally </v>

546
00:34:06.201 --> 00:34:07.620
<v Speaker 2>friendly with everyone is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a preposterous,</v>

547
00:34:07.621 --> 00:34:08.850
<v Speaker 2>but even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

548
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.120
<v Speaker 2>the thing that the child is doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually becoming.</v>

549
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.920
<v Speaker 2>They're stepping out of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>egocentricity because they're best </v>

550
00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:17.970
<v Speaker 2>friends becomes more important than they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

551
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:23.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's a precursor for adult </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships where you know if you're </v>

552
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.691
<v Speaker 2>married while your partner should be at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least as important as you are and the </v>

553
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:28.590
<v Speaker 2>relationship should be more important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when you have children,</v>

554
00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're more important than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you that that's that.</v>

555
00:34:31.081 --> 00:34:33.000
<v Speaker 2>It's unless there's something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

556
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.270
<v Speaker 2>you come second in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your children come first and they're way</v>

557
00:34:36.271 --> 00:34:37.370
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not just a little.</v>

558
00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're necessary because without </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

559
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.730
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to manage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to take care of yourself,</v>

560
00:34:41.731 --> 00:34:45.270
<v Speaker 2>but you're not number one anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you have kids and less seriously,</v>

561
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:50.450
<v Speaker 2>unless you didn't learn the lessons in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the playground and when you have a best </v>

562
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.450
<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not number one.</v>

563
00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.880
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

564
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:55.110
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are these constraints that emerged</v>

565
00:34:55.111 --> 00:34:56.970
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the social landscape,</v>

566
00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:02.510
<v Speaker 2>you have to have friends and also you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to single someone out as </v>

567
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 2>particularly unique among those friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>and establish a genuinely reciprocal and</v>

568
00:35:06.451 --> 00:35:11.451
<v Speaker 2>caring relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the psychiatrist who </v>

569
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:14.481
<v Speaker 2>studied this so intently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately he was the first person to</v>

570
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 2>do a detailed analysis of the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend relationships that children </v>

571
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.940
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

572
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.350
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to give him credit for his </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

573
00:35:24.351 --> 00:35:26.180
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately I can't remember his </v>
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>

574
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:30.380
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

575
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.470
<v Speaker 2>So what are the proposition so far?</v>

576
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 2>You inhabit a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The door emc in the</v>

577
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.980
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has something that's akin to a </v>

578
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:42.980
<v Speaker 3>narrative structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here,</v>

579
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm going there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the way I did it.</v>

580
00:35:43.681 --> 00:35:45.210
<v Speaker 3>It's narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you describe it,</v>

581
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.560
<v Speaker 3>it's based in biological necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's shaped by social socialization </v>

582
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:56.330
<v Speaker 3>and the fact of of that base and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaping means that the set of </v>

583
00:35:57.091 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 3>interpretive Schema that you can lay out</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world are bounded.</v>

584
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Those would be functional hypothetically</v>
<v Speaker 3>functional systems and maybe they </v>

585
00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 3>compete over over the evolutionary time </v>
<v Speaker 3>span,</v>

586
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.780
<v Speaker 3>but there's something in common across </v>
<v Speaker 3>that set of functional interpretations </v>

587
00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:19.071
<v Speaker 3>and if you extract that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get the initial images of what </v>

588
00:36:19.071 --> 00:36:21.390
<v Speaker 3>you might describe as an archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee,</v>

589
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 3>universal morality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what archetypes are fundamentally</v>

590
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:31.490
<v Speaker 3>so and to say all that is no more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that people can obstruct across </v>

591
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:36.230
<v Speaker 3>instances and we can obviously do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the question is can you start to</v>

592
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 3>develop an articulated picture of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>that archetipal</v>

593
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.450
<v Speaker 2>structure of universal morality might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be?</v>

594
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:49.260
<v Speaker 2>And so my answer to that was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

595
00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:52.680
<v Speaker 2>let's look at old stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as many old stories as we can collect,</v>

596
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.640
<v Speaker 2>and if the stories are stories that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>survived for a very long period of time,</v>

597
00:36:56.641 --> 00:36:57.940
<v Speaker 2>so much the better because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

598
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.620
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

599
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:03.740
<v Speaker 2>that indicates that they're peculiarly </v>
<v Speaker 2>memorable and peculiarly functional,</v>

600
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.520
<v Speaker 2>because if they weren't memorable than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd have been forgotten.</v>

601
00:37:08.521 --> 00:37:13.521
<v Speaker 2>And if they weren't functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't have managed to be the </v>

602
00:37:13.521 --> 00:37:16.851
<v Speaker 2>foundation stories for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for cultures that lasted for thousands </v>

603
00:37:16.851 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 2>or even tens of thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

604
00:37:18.421 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 2>and then we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

605
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:24.441
<v Speaker 2>let's collect a whole variety of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories and see if there's patterns </v>

606
00:37:24.441 --> 00:37:24.441
<v Speaker 2>across the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the danger of that is,</v>

607
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.390
<v Speaker 2>have you collected an unbiased set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories?</v>

608
00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Danger number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know that you're not just </v>

609
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:34.600
<v Speaker 2>reading into the stories that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern problem,</v>

610
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.770
<v Speaker 2>reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable objections.</v>

611
00:37:36.771 --> 00:37:40.550
<v Speaker 2>And so that those objections have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>laid against people like,</v>

612
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote the golden bough Fraser,</v>

613
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.420
<v Speaker 2>who was the frazier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was one of the first anthropologists</v>

614
00:37:47.421 --> 00:37:52.421
<v Speaker 2>to collect stories from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and to start to look for </v>

615
00:37:52.421 --> 00:37:55.091
<v Speaker 2>commonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same objection has been laid at the </v>

616
00:37:55.091 --> 00:37:56.960
<v Speaker 2>feet of people like Richard Lee or Carl </v>
<v Speaker 2>young or Joseph Campbell.</v>

617
00:37:56.961 --> 00:37:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know you just how do you know</v>

618
00:37:59.241 --> 00:38:01.730
<v Speaker 2>you're not just cherry picking your damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations?</v>

619
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Perfectly reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly reasonable objection,</v>

620
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:10.750
<v Speaker 2>and I would say that the reason I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that I'm Cherry picking my </v>

621
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:11.810
<v Speaker 2>interpretations is because I used a </v>
<v Speaker 2>method.</v>

622
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a method that's akin to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>multitrack multi-method method of </v>

623
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.611
<v Speaker 2>construct validation that that clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and other disciplines of </v>

624
00:38:21.611 --> 00:38:26.171
<v Speaker 2>psychology rely upon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also akin to a process put </v>

625
00:38:26.171 --> 00:38:27.500
<v Speaker 2>forward by Eo Wilson that he called </v>
<v Speaker 2>consilience,</v>

626
00:38:27.501 --> 00:38:30.530
<v Speaker 2>and the process is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

627
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.300
<v Speaker 2>pick your level of analysis.</v>

628
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Does the phenomena manifest itself at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that level of analysis?</v>

629
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick another level of analysis and </v>

630
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.231
<v Speaker 2>another level of analysis and another </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis and see if the same </v>

631
00:38:43.231 --> 00:38:46.591
<v Speaker 2>phenomena manifests itself at every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single level and then assume that the </v>

632
00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:51.181
<v Speaker 2>probability that that will happen by </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance decreases with each additional </v>

633
00:38:51.181 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis that fits that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's concordance and I thought,</v>

634
00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

635
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.980
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

636
00:38:56.981 --> 00:39:01.981
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't only that you can look for </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns and stories because you know </v>

637
00:39:01.981 --> 00:39:06.060
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a hyperactive pattern </v>

638
00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.441
<v Speaker 2>detector,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically means like there are </v>

639
00:39:07.441 --> 00:39:07.441
<v Speaker 2>people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who tilt towards paranoia,</v>

640
00:39:07.441 --> 00:39:08.860
<v Speaker 2>people who tilt towards conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories,</v>

641
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.920
<v Speaker 2>you could see it manifest itself in new </v>
<v Speaker 2>age thinking all the time.</v>

642
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Then because new age thinkers are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>high in openness but not very good at </v>

643
00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 2>critical thinking and so they see so now</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to a and B and c and d,</v>

644
00:39:18.281 --> 00:39:19.150
<v Speaker 2>they think pattern.</v>

645
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Then they think universal pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't attempt to disconfirm </v>

646
00:39:24.611 --> 00:39:29.611
<v Speaker 2>their pattern prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I tried to do when I was </v>

647
00:39:29.611 --> 00:39:32.851
<v Speaker 2>starting to see patterns emerge in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories in informed by people like you </v>

648
00:39:32.851 --> 00:39:37.021
<v Speaker 2>and Eliana and so forth was to see if </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were describing manifested </v>

649
00:39:37.021 --> 00:39:41.221
<v Speaker 2>itself at any other levels of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we're independent intellectually </v>

650
00:39:41.221 --> 00:39:43.780
<v Speaker 2>from that stream of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found it in two places.</v>

651
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:49.020
<v Speaker 2>I found to cybernetics and I found it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience and so and and that,</v>

652
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.220
<v Speaker 2>that and the neuroscience element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That includes the physiology,</v>

653
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:59.221
<v Speaker 2>but also the behavioral analysis that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was done by by people most particularly </v>

654
00:39:59.221 --> 00:40:03.601
<v Speaker 2>like like like Jeffrey Gray and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal experimentalists who were </v>

655
00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:07.441
<v Speaker 2>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant scientists and who've done a </v>

656
00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:09.751
<v Speaker 2>very good job of laying out the manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>in which interpretive frameworks exist</v>

657
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.670
<v Speaker 2>within the realm of animal cognition and</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

658
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.530
<v Speaker 2>and to describe how they manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves in the world.</v>

659
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.430
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

660
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:19.450
<v Speaker 2>that's not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got.</v>

661
00:40:19.451 --> 00:40:24.451
<v Speaker 2>We've got maybe four different levels of</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence all pointing in the same </v>

662
00:40:24.451 --> 00:40:28.471
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I walked you guys </v>

663
00:40:28.471 --> 00:40:30.961
<v Speaker 2>through the neuro psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a story is you're going </v>

664
00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:34.531
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're somewhere and you're going </v>

665
00:40:34.531 --> 00:40:34.531
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and you're tracking your </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

666
00:40:34.531 --> 00:40:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the story.</v>

667
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

668
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.430
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you look at how people</v>
<v Speaker 2>lay out there called cognitive maps,</v>

669
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.820
<v Speaker 2>while it's the same thing you specify a </v>
<v Speaker 2>target and endpoint is you specify a </v>

670
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 2>beginning point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just where you are,</v>

671
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.360
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comparative mechanism that operates or</v>

672
00:40:49.361 --> 00:40:53.860
<v Speaker 2>multiple comparitor mechanisms that </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate neuro physiologically.</v>

673
00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:58.720
<v Speaker 2>To Orient Yourself towards that goal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emotions basically emerge as a,</v>

674
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:04.070
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of that positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions indicating that you're moving </v>

675
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:07.321
<v Speaker 2>forward properly negative emotions </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicating that you've encountered some </v>

676
00:41:07.321 --> 00:41:07.321
<v Speaker 2>kind of obstacle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

677
00:41:07.321 --> 00:41:08.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the basic.</v>

678
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the basic structure of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

679
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

680
00:41:11.891 --> 00:41:14.650
<v Speaker 2>so now we can see how it's instantiated </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurophysiologically.</v>

681
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 2>That adds a fair bit of credence to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the entire process,</v>

682
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.740
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

683
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.730
<v Speaker 2>now normally when you look at the basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>cybernetic work,</v>

684
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:39.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a hypothesis that the system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented towards a goal and that it's </v>

685
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:45.791
<v Speaker 2>comparing what is manifesting itself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world to that desire to instate as </v>

686
00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 2>the system moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's too simple because people don't</v>

687
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:54.641
<v Speaker 2>precisely have gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have nested hierarchy of goals and </v>

688
00:41:55.131 --> 00:42:00.131
<v Speaker 2>so the issue of emotional regulation </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes more complex than are you </v>

689
00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:09.501
<v Speaker 2>proceeding happily towards your current </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal because your goal is composed of </v>

690
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.960
<v Speaker 2>micro goals and it's a constituent </v>
<v Speaker 2>element of a set of macro goals,</v>

691
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 2>and so that makes the problem of error </v>
<v Speaker 2>far more complex than it would be if you</v>

692
00:42:20.761 --> 00:42:24.210
<v Speaker 2>only had one frame of reference and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were only adjudicating your error within</v>

693
00:42:24.211 --> 00:42:29.211
<v Speaker 2>that frame of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question starts to become what does </v>

694
00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:32.200
<v Speaker 2>it mean when you make a mistake?</v>

695
00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.680
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the behavioral answer to that was,</v>

696
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:41.681
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you encounter a stimuli that's a threat </v>

697
00:42:41.681 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 2>or maybe a punishment or an incentive </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward or a conservatory reward,</v>

698
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

699
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:50.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a unit dimensional and </v>

700
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.590
<v Speaker 2>oversimplified answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not complaining about it has great </v>

701
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:53.300
<v Speaker 2>utility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's the problem,</v>

702
00:42:53.301 --> 00:42:58.301
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem and the problem is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't take into account the nested </v>

703
00:42:58.301 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 2>structure of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your goal hierarchy.</v>

704
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.900
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>underestimates the difficulty of </v>

705
00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:09.401
<v Speaker 2>responding to an error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the problem with an error is </v>

706
00:43:09.401 --> 00:43:14.081
<v Speaker 2>that you don't know what the error </v>
<v Speaker 2>signifies and that's a huge problem and </v>

707
00:43:14.081 --> 00:43:16.430
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what I want to delve into</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in more depth today,</v>

708
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 2>and so this is like Alice in wonderland </v>
<v Speaker 2>going down the rabbit hole.</v>

709
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.000
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the hole.</v>

710
00:43:22.001 --> 00:43:24.720
<v Speaker 2>The rabbit hole is you made a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

711
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:30.010
<v Speaker 2>You made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got your oversimplified </v>

712
00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:30.010
<v Speaker 2>representation of the world laid upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

713
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:33.740
<v Speaker 2>It validates itself in its execution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it executes properly,</v>

714
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.310
<v Speaker 2>if it executes improperly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what does that signify?</v>

715
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:40.730
<v Speaker 2>And the answer isn't precisely that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've made a mistake.</v>

716
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:45.350
<v Speaker 2>The answer is it signifies that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in the world that you excluded</v>

717
00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:50.351
<v Speaker 2>that shouldn't have been excluded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a big problem because when </v>

718
00:43:50.351 --> 00:43:52.910
<v Speaker 2>you've laid out a simplified schema on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

719
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.240
<v Speaker 2>you've excluded virtually everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that as soon </v>

720
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.651
<v Speaker 2>as you make an error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the search space for the error </v>

721
00:44:02.651 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 2>immediately tends towards the infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you experienced that and it's,</v>

722
00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of it.</v>

723
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Human existential experience and the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>you experienced that is,</v>

724
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.220
<v Speaker 2>especially if your mood is shaky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you lay out a small plan,</v>

725
00:44:13.221 --> 00:44:18.221
<v Speaker 2>like maybe you go out for coffee with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that you're romantically </v>

726
00:44:18.221 --> 00:44:19.750
<v Speaker 2>interested in and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

727
00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:20.660
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

728
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.950
<v Speaker 2>they're not pleasant to you.</v>

729
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:24.710
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that scenario it means,</v>

730
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean?</v>

731
00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've construed yourself wrong.</v>

732
00:44:27.891 --> 00:44:31.740
<v Speaker 2>You've construed them wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've construed the opposite sex wrong.</v>

733
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.800
<v Speaker 2>You've construed human beings wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a walking catastrophe and you </v>

734
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.220
<v Speaker 2>might as well not even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

735
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

736
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that extreme.</v>

737
00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:46.371
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that uncommon for people to </v>

738
00:44:46.371 --> 00:44:49.740
<v Speaker 2>have exactly that set of catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>responses to even a minor setback.</v>

739
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say no,</v>

740
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:58.311
<v Speaker 2>just because you scraped your foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean you should dig a grave and </v>

741
00:44:58.311 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 2>jump into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull the dirt on,</v>

742
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:59.840
<v Speaker 2>on top of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

743
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 2>so you don't want to start by taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself completely apart,</v>

744
00:45:03.391 --> 00:45:05.160
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean people won't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

745
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.170
<v Speaker 2>They do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

746
00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always a mystery that they don't do</v>

747
00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:14.031
<v Speaker 2>it every single time because the logical</v>
<v Speaker 2>inference for why didn't you get someone</v>

748
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:19.311
<v Speaker 2>interested in you could easily be </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're a failure as a human </v>

749
00:45:19.311 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 2>being and at some level that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

750
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

751
00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 2>it's true in a way that's not that </v>
<v Speaker 2>helpful,</v>

752
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:26.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's just too catastrophic,</v>

753
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:31.550
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't obvious at all how people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can defend themselves against that </v>

754
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.780
<v Speaker 2>cascade of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

755
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.270
<v Speaker 2>of Ka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ka,</v>

756
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Ka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ka,</v>

757
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.400
<v Speaker 2>catastrophizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

758
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:37.110
<v Speaker 2>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are everything you could be,</v>

759
00:45:37.111 --> 00:45:38.910
<v Speaker 2>then maybe everyone would be attracted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

760
00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean perhaps not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you get the point and no and no easy</v>

761
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:45.180
<v Speaker 2>rationalization is going to let you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>brush that away,</v>

762
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:50.570
<v Speaker 2>especially if you actually happen to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in the person because that's </v>

763
00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:50.910
<v Speaker 2>even worse because then not only are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>rejected,</v>

764
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:55.911
<v Speaker 2>but you're rejected by someone who's who</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon whom you've projected an ideal or </v>

765
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.020
<v Speaker 2>perhaps on from whom you've actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>observed an ideal.</v>

766
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:02.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

767
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:07.380
<v Speaker 2>you're rejected by someone that you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have be attracted to you to validate </v>

768
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 2>your own miserable existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a trivial problem,</v>

769
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.850
<v Speaker 2>so you're in this protected space that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

770
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:24.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made an analogy between that and the </v>

771
00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.331
<v Speaker 2>garden of Eden or the city that Buddha </v>
<v Speaker 2>was raised in.</v>

772
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 2>It's all protected and everything inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this beautiful and functional,</v>

773
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:34.700
<v Speaker 2>and that's by definition because if your</v>
<v Speaker 2>frame of reference is working properly,</v>

774
00:46:35.551 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 2>then what's within it is things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

775
00:46:38.431 --> 00:46:40.320
<v Speaker 2>that are functional and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

776
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.400
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

777
00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:44.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are serving your purposes.</v>

778
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.500
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

779
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.450
<v Speaker 2>when you're successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the garden of Eden.</v>

780
00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:49.920
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

781
00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:52.380
<v Speaker 2>when the things that you're laying out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world are delivering what they're</v>

782
00:46:52.381 --> 00:46:55.200
<v Speaker 2>supposed to deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you inhabit.</v>

783
00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:00.440
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's always the snake inside </v>

784
00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.811
<v Speaker 2>the garden and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the story that's echoed in the </v>

785
00:47:02.811 --> 00:47:02.811
<v Speaker 2>story of Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that case.</v>

786
00:47:02.811 --> 00:47:05.100
<v Speaker 2>It's Buddha's own curiosity that happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the snake.</v>

787
00:47:05.101 --> 00:47:07.290
<v Speaker 2>And you could actually say the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about human beings.</v>

788
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it wasn't the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was eve's curiosity.</v>

789
00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:16.570
<v Speaker 2>They're the same thing in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's Buddhist curiosity that </v>

790
00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.450
<v Speaker 2>drives them outside the city to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

791
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:23.451
<v Speaker 2>And death and to blow apart his </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradisical conceptualization of the </v>

792
00:47:23.451 --> 00:47:27.471
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when we're looking at you for </v>

793
00:47:27.471 --> 00:47:30.090
<v Speaker 2>universality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing we might say as well,</v>

794
00:47:30.091 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 2>if you have a frame of reference that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've laid on the world,</v>

795
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a story.</v>

796
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.860
<v Speaker 2>You live inside a story and the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing we could,</v>

797
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 2>and that's universally true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the content of the story can differ.</v>

798
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:40.990
<v Speaker 2>That's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about that.</v>

799
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:43.700
<v Speaker 2>It's the structural equivalence that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>

800
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:48.670
<v Speaker 2>You live inside a story and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do because you have to live in something</v>

801
00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:53.671
<v Speaker 2>like that because you are goal directed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be and you have to </v>

802
00:47:53.671 --> 00:47:57.241
<v Speaker 2>simplify the world because you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough of you to take into account </v>

803
00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.810
<v Speaker 2>everything at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

804
00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:03.811
<v Speaker 2>you could hardly take into account </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything at once so you don't have to </v>

805
00:48:03.811 --> 00:48:07.651
<v Speaker 2>narrow things unbelievably and by </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrowing and including only certain </v>

806
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you exclude virtually everything else.</v>

807
00:48:11.291 --> 00:48:16.291
<v Speaker 2>So you're always in the problem in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where you have this little </v>

808
00:48:16.291 --> 00:48:18.280
<v Speaker 2>bounded universe that you inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but outside of it is chaos itself.</v>

809
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:24.230
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's the existential landscape </v>

810
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:27.130
<v Speaker 2>order surrounded by chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

811
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:28.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>

812
00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:32.050
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary home of primates,</v>

813
00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:35.700
<v Speaker 2>the tree with the snakes on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

814
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:40.710
<v Speaker 2>that's our landscape or it's the fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>for tribal people and the terrorists of </v>

815
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:43.090
<v Speaker 2>the forest that are beyond the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are beyond the.</v>

816
00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:48.720
<v Speaker 2>The light that the fire casts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's explored territory versus </v>

817
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an archetype as well that,</v>

818
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 2>that you can't not be in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>where that's the case.</v>

819
00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're among friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:04.230
<v Speaker 2>you think that's explored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not exactly right because what </v>

821
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:07.231
<v Speaker 2>happens if you're among friends is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they carefully reveal new parts of </v>

822
00:49:07.721 --> 00:49:12.721
<v Speaker 2>themselves all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like they're blasting little </v>

823
00:49:12.721 --> 00:49:16.240
<v Speaker 2>elements of unexplored territory </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory at you constantly.</v>

824
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what happens?</v>

825
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:24.750
<v Speaker 2>You get bored and you look for New </v>
<v Speaker 2>People and we know there's empirical </v>

826
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:29.101
<v Speaker 2>data on that with regards to intimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships because there was a nice </v>

827
00:49:29.101 --> 00:49:32.641
<v Speaker 2>study done awhile back showing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the ratio of positive to </v>

828
00:49:32.641 --> 00:49:37.351
<v Speaker 2>negative emotional experiences that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>most predictive of long term </v>

829
00:49:37.351 --> 00:49:37.351
<v Speaker 2>relationship success.</v>

830
00:49:37.351 --> 00:49:41.640
<v Speaker 2>And the answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now obviously it depends on how you </v>

831
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.020
<v Speaker 2>would measure an event and how you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure positive and negative emotion.</v>

832
00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:48.460
<v Speaker 2>But that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the finding was something like if you're</v>

833
00:49:48.461 --> 00:49:53.461
<v Speaker 2>in a relationship and you only have five</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive interactions to one negative </v>

834
00:49:53.461 --> 00:49:55.420
<v Speaker 2>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the relationship will land.</v>

835
00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It's too negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have more than 11 positive </v>

836
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.380
<v Speaker 2>interactions to one negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction,</v>

837
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.430
<v Speaker 2>then it also ends and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's pretty bloody peculiar.</v>

838
00:50:06.431 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world would that be?</v>

839
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Don't you want like a 100 to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive to negative interactions?</v>

840
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.280
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is what makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that you wanted to relationships </v>

841
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.240
<v Speaker 2>so that you can be happy or at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy moment to moment.</v>

842
00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that it's not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not the case is that you </v>

843
00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:24.510
<v Speaker 2>know that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm,</v>

844
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:29.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean I bet you there's not a person in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this room who hasn't rejected someone </v>

845
00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.530
<v Speaker 2>because they were too nice to them.</v>

846
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Something like that person's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>

847
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:38.171
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want someone who you know you can </v>

848
00:50:38.171 --> 00:50:41.411
<v Speaker 2>get along with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now and then they bite you and you </v>

849
00:50:41.411 --> 00:50:41.411
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

850
00:50:41.411 --> 00:50:41.411
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

851
00:50:41.411 --> 00:50:43.490
<v Speaker 2>You know I didn't really expect that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you go and puzzle over it for a</v>

852
00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get tortured yourself about it,</v>

853
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:50.201
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the things that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>you really linked into the relationship </v>

854
00:50:50.201 --> 00:50:53.651
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that you want the </v>

855
00:50:53.651 --> 00:50:53.930
<v Speaker 2>relationship isn't so that you're happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

856
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:59.100
<v Speaker 2>It's so that you can live a high quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>life across multiple decades and so </v>

857
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:04.181
<v Speaker 2>you're looking for someone that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to contend with who's going to push you </v>

858
00:51:04.181 --> 00:51:08.231
<v Speaker 2>beyond what you already are and who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to judge you harshly often for </v>

859
00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:12.611
<v Speaker 2>your limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that'll make you angry and all of </v>

860
00:51:12.611 --> 00:51:15.131
<v Speaker 2>that you'll know and resentful and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll take your revenge and all of </v>

861
00:51:15.131 --> 00:51:19.241
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want someone who thinks </v>

862
00:51:19.241 --> 00:51:19.460
<v Speaker 2>you're perfect in your current forum.</v>

863
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Partly because why would you want to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with someone that diluted?</v>

864
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:28.240
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got this interpretive Schema </v>

865
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:34.631
<v Speaker 2>laid out on the world and it excludes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire world and because it excludes</v>

866
00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:39.821
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world tends to manifest itself </v>

867
00:51:39.821 --> 00:51:43.370
<v Speaker 2>inside that protected space on a in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncontrollable manner,</v>

868
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:49.450
<v Speaker 2>and that can take you down and it takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you down the rabbit hole and down the </v>

869
00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:52.130
<v Speaker 2>rabbit hole is where everything is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you make an error,</v>

870
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 2>what that is is the manifestation of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>excluded world and the problem with that</v>

871
00:51:57.231 --> 00:51:59.750
<v Speaker 2>is that's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

872
00:51:59.751 --> 00:52:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Because if you step out of the lifeboat </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the ocean,</v>

873
00:52:02.511 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 2>then you drown and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not any good.</v>

874
00:52:05.181 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 2>You can't drown every time something </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself that you didn't expect.</v>

875
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:15.620
<v Speaker 2>There has to be a mechanism for </v>
<v Speaker 2>orienting you in the face of error.</v>

876
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:20.720
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what exactly does that imply?</v>

877
00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.590
<v Speaker 2>The question is what you discover when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go down the rabbit hole.</v>

878
00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.620
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about that a lot today.</v>

879
00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:37.890
<v Speaker 2>I showed you that diagram that I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like a map of the phenomenal logical</v>

880
00:52:37.891 --> 00:52:42.891
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lowest resolution category is </v>

881
00:52:42.991 --> 00:52:46.050
<v Speaker 2>something like the dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>

882
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:51.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you discover when you make an </v>

883
00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:51.590
<v Speaker 2>error?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

884
00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:52.650
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a brief manifestation of the dragon</v>

885
00:52:52.651 --> 00:52:57.651
<v Speaker 2>of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's no more to say than when you </v>

886
00:52:57.651 --> 00:53:01.740
<v Speaker 2>encounter the incursion of unexplored </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory into explored territory.</v>

887
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:07.010
<v Speaker 2>The circuitry you use is the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuits that we use to to respond </v>

888
00:53:08.701 --> 00:53:12.330
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously to the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory forces.</v>

889
00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:18.020
<v Speaker 2>We use that circuit and that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect sense because the Predator is </v>

890
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.531
<v Speaker 2>almost by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that lurks beyond the safe </v>

891
00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:24.891
<v Speaker 2>confines of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I told you I believe a story about </v>

892
00:53:24.891 --> 00:53:27.600
<v Speaker 2>rats raised in naturalistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>environments.</v>

893
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:33.860
<v Speaker 2>The rats are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got the burrows on one end of the </v>

894
00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:33.860
<v Speaker 2>little field.</v>

895
00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.960
<v Speaker 2>They're little rat hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing their little rat social </v>

896
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:37.960
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're playing and they're laughing and</v>

897
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.300
<v Speaker 2>they're tickling each other and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

898
00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:40.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising the rat families.</v>

899
00:53:40.981 --> 00:53:44.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's all working out just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rats in that situation,</v>

900
00:53:44.281 --> 00:53:49.281
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are very difficult to get addicted to </v>

901
00:53:49.281 --> 00:53:49.281
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want a dick,</v>

902
00:53:49.281 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 2>the rat to cocaine and you have to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in a cage at isolated,</v>

903
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not really a rat anymore than any </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than you're a person if you're in </v>

904
00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:56.600
<v Speaker 2>solitary confinement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

905
00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're mostly,</v>

906
00:53:58.171 --> 00:54:00.690
<v Speaker 2>you're just misery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

907
00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:04.470
<v Speaker 2>In solitary confinement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be after cocaine nonstop and maybe</v>

908
00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:06.780
<v Speaker 2>under other circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like a normal rat.</v>

909
00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not that interested in cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just a side note.</v>

910
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rats are doing their thing and then </v>

911
00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:16.470
<v Speaker 2>they've learned that they can go out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side of the field and they can</v>

912
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 2>get food and so one day the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimenters,</v>

913
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:25.950
<v Speaker 2>instead of putting food out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>put a cat out there and the rat goes out</v>

914
00:54:25.951 --> 00:54:28.110
<v Speaker 2>and gets a whiff of the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they do not like.</v>

915
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:33.110
<v Speaker 2>And then the rat runs home and pokes his</v>
<v Speaker 2>beak out of the borough and screams for </v>

916
00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 2>like two days ultrasonically and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other rats are like frozen stiff.</v>

917
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going anywhere.</v>

918
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:42.320
<v Speaker 2>And so a two day rat screaming fit is no</v>
<v Speaker 2>trivial thing that be.</v>

919
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I calculated that'd be the equivalent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>use screaming for two weeks,</v>

920
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.260
<v Speaker 2>so you have to be pretty upset to scream</v>
<v Speaker 2>for two weeks.</v>

921
00:54:49.261 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is hard on the wrap,</v>

922
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:56.360
<v Speaker 2>but the reason I'm telling you this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the route doesn't expect the cat to be </v>

923
00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.150
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rat goes out and there was a cat and</v>

924
00:54:57.151 --> 00:55:01.710
<v Speaker 2>what it uses its Predator detection and </v>
<v Speaker 2>alert systems to signify the presence of</v>

925
00:55:01.711 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 2>the cat and what we've done with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon imagery,</v>

926
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:09.471
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is making a Mailgun of predatory bond </v>

927
00:55:09.471 --> 00:55:12.541
<v Speaker 2>stirs and state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a symbol for what lurks beyond </v>

928
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:13.470
<v Speaker 2>safety because we're.</v>

929
00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:18.610
<v Speaker 2>We're observing our own responses in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense and it's not only that we're </v>

930
00:55:18.871 --> 00:55:23.871
<v Speaker 2>observing our own responses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also have a category categorical </v>

931
00:55:23.871 --> 00:55:25.530
<v Speaker 2>set of responses to Predator and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

932
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.470
<v Speaker 2>there's no speculation about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We already know this,</v>

933
00:55:29.471 --> 00:55:31.740
<v Speaker 2>like if you go studied monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

934
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.400
<v Speaker 2>they have distinct sets of vocalization </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are associated with Predator </v>

935
00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:42.231
<v Speaker 2>detection that have distinct circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that there are Predator </v>

936
00:55:42.231 --> 00:55:46.341
<v Speaker 2>detection circuits and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>unreasonable to also presuppose that </v>

937
00:55:46.341 --> 00:55:48.120
<v Speaker 2>they underlie the phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

938
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:50.670
<v Speaker 2>that human beings are very good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning fear to snakes.</v>

939
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Snake fear might be innate like that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing the argument,</v>

940
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:59.150
<v Speaker 2>but at minimum psychologists have </v>
<v Speaker 2>already concluded that even if snake </v>

941
00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:00.480
<v Speaker 2>fear isn't an eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it probably is,</v>

942
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:04.860
<v Speaker 2>that it can be learned like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can condition people to be afraid</v>

943
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:09.861
<v Speaker 2>of pictures of snakes way faster than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can condition them to be afraid of </v>

944
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 2>pictures of electrical outlets are </v>
<v Speaker 2>handguns,</v>

945
00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:15.900
<v Speaker 2>so that's well documented.</v>

946
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody disputes that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

947
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:23.600
<v Speaker 2>So the first assumption is when </v>
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected emerges,</v>

948
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.970
<v Speaker 2>so we'll call that the snake in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>garden that you're prey and Predator in </v>

949
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.250
<v Speaker 2>the monster has come to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

950
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Now the representation of the dragon is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more complex than mere monster because </v>

951
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.740
<v Speaker 2>the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mythological dragon also is the </v>

952
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 2>thing that hoards treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really liked that symbol.</v>

953
00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:47.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's also why it will never go</v>

954
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:52.681
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a great symbol because it </v>

955
00:56:52.681 --> 00:56:52.681
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

956
00:56:52.681 --> 00:56:52.930
<v Speaker 2>the unknown can take you down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can,</v>

957
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:56.530
<v Speaker 2>it can bite you with its fiery breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a poisonous snake,</v>

958
00:56:56.531 --> 00:57:01.531
<v Speaker 2>and it can burn things like fire and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an aerial Predator that can take </v>

959
00:57:01.531 --> 00:57:05.911
<v Speaker 2>you from the air and it's a carnivorous </v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator that can take you from the </v>

960
00:57:05.911 --> 00:57:05.911
<v Speaker 2>ground and it's Reptilian.</v>

961
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.580
<v Speaker 2>It's the sort of thing that can pull you</v>
<v Speaker 2>down into the water and it's easy to see</v>

962
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:14.581
<v Speaker 2>that as an amalgam of of the threats </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been laid forth for human </v>

963
00:57:14.581 --> 00:57:19.030
<v Speaker 2>being since the beginning of time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and monster is an amalgam of Predator,</v>

964
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.840
<v Speaker 2>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

965
00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:21.370
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

966
00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

967
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:27.031
<v Speaker 2>It's just a loose category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's common across all predators </v>

968
00:57:27.031 --> 00:57:30.130
<v Speaker 2>equals dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's not.</v>

969
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.690
<v Speaker 2>They're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're hyper real.</v>

970
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:33.970
<v Speaker 2>They're more real than the phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

971
00:57:33.971 --> 00:57:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Just like an abstraction can be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>real than the phenomenon of themselves,</v>

972
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:40.240
<v Speaker 2>and then the canonical dragon for human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings isn't just a predator.</v>

973
00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:45.300
<v Speaker 2>We're not rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine that the dragon for a </v>

974
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.680
<v Speaker 2>rabbit is just a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no damn treasure there at all,</v>

975
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:52.890
<v Speaker 2>but for human beings it's ambivalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the thing that you don't know </v>

976
00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:56.290
<v Speaker 2>about is also the thing that holds the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest gift and why is that?</v>

977
00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:01.440
<v Speaker 2>It's because the unrealized world </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself when you make an error </v>

978
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.110
<v Speaker 2>and the unrealized world is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can take you down obviously,</v>

979
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:07.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the source of all new </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

980
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:13.710
<v Speaker 2>It's an infinite source of information </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a really useful thing to </v>

981
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:16.921
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Error is an infinite source of </v>

982
00:58:16.921 --> 00:58:19.261
<v Speaker 2>information and that's one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can help you recalibrate the way </v>

983
00:58:19.261 --> 00:58:21.430
<v Speaker 2>that you interact with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

984
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:22.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're interacting.</v>

985
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's say we're having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's flowing melodically and all of </v>

986
00:58:28.841 --> 00:58:31.180
<v Speaker 2>a sudden I say something and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disjunction,</v>

987
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:32.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're offended by it.</v>

988
00:58:32.741 --> 00:58:35.290
<v Speaker 2>There's some negative emotion that comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>up or or,</v>

989
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.250
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

990
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I've said something to impress you</v>

991
00:58:38.321 --> 00:58:43.321
<v Speaker 2>or to be arrogant and you respond badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we've got this melodic thing </v>

992
00:58:43.321 --> 00:58:47.521
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a conceptual frame and something </v>

993
00:58:47.521 --> 00:58:49.660
<v Speaker 2>pokes itself up to put a disjunction in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation.</v>

994
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

995
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:54.730
<v Speaker 2>that's where the inflammation is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like something went wrong,</v>

996
00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:57.700
<v Speaker 2>something didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not looking at the world properly or</v>

997
00:58:57.701 --> 00:59:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know you well enough for as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I thought there's something there and</v>

998
00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:04.690
<v Speaker 2>if I have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to focus my attention on that,</v>

999
00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.700
<v Speaker 2>like not obsessively or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1000
00:59:06.701 --> 00:59:11.701
<v Speaker 2>but that's where all the information is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as long as what we're doing is </v>

1001
00:59:11.701 --> 00:59:14.140
<v Speaker 2>working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we both know enough already.</v>

1002
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.320
<v Speaker 2>As soon as what we're doing together </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't working,</v>

1003
00:59:17.321 --> 00:59:19.840
<v Speaker 2>then that's instant evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about us that needs to</v>

1004
00:59:19.841 --> 00:59:21.470
<v Speaker 2>be updated and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1005
00:59:21.471 --> 00:59:23.660
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the answer is yes,</v>

1006
00:59:23.661 --> 00:59:25.160
<v Speaker 2>of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible thing,</v>

1007
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:30.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the next stage of the </v>

1008
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.070
<v Speaker 2>development of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it universal morality.</v>

1009
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:36.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like the universal morality might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be found in the answer to the question,</v>

1010
00:59:37.131 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 2>what should you do when you make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake?</v>

1011
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one answer is catastrophic disillusion.</v>

1012
00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:45.950
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a collapse into chaos.</v>

1013
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:50.210
<v Speaker 2>While that's no one is going to pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>that voluntarily,</v>

1014
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.810
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an unbelievably unpleasant,</v>

1015
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:59.680
<v Speaker 2>terribly anxiety provoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shameful and painful all at the same </v>

1016
01:00:02.781 --> 01:00:05.210
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worse,</v>

1017
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:10.211
<v Speaker 2>it can mean the absence of positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion because if you really collapse </v>

1018
01:00:10.211 --> 01:00:11.300
<v Speaker 2>into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only are you overwhelmed by negative</v>

1019
01:00:11.301 --> 01:00:14.300
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the positive emotion system shut off</v>

1020
01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:18.800
<v Speaker 2>and that's what happens to someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily depressed and also hyper</v>

1021
01:00:18.801 --> 01:00:23.801
<v Speaker 2>anxious at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only are they suffering from an </v>

1022
01:00:23.801 --> 01:00:27.371
<v Speaker 2>excess of negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've got no incentive movement </v>

1023
01:00:27.371 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 2>forward whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1024
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:32.771
<v Speaker 2>so that's not an optimal solution </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it takes you out the other </v>

1025
01:00:32.771 --> 01:00:36.851
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I would call that a nihilistic </v>

1026
01:00:36.851 --> 01:00:37.400
<v Speaker 2>solution or a chaotic solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a solution.</v>

1027
01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:42.401
<v Speaker 2>It's a disillusion and you can think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it as a precursor to a potential </v>

1028
01:00:42.401 --> 01:00:46.481
<v Speaker 2>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very easy to get stuck there </v>

1029
01:00:46.481 --> 01:00:47.120
<v Speaker 2>and that's why Jonah could have stayed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the belly of the whale along with all</v>

1030
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:50.210
<v Speaker 2>the other people that were eaten by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whale and never got back out.</v>

1031
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.370
<v Speaker 2>And you see people like that all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1032
01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Their error has come along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blown out their frames of reference.</v>

1033
01:00:56.481 --> 01:00:59.180
<v Speaker 2>They've collapsed into the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the chaotic underworld,</v>

1034
01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:04.390
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know how to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have posttraumatic stress disorder </v>

1035
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:06.170
<v Speaker 2>or they're depressed or they're hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious or or they're.</v>

1036
01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:11.380
<v Speaker 2>They're resentful and aggressive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive like there's any number of </v>

1037
01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:16.780
<v Speaker 2>states of being that can overwhelm you </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the bottom has fallen out of your </v>

1038
01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:21.551
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it isn't something that people are </v>

1039
01:01:21.551 --> 01:01:21.551
<v Speaker 2>going to.</v>

1040
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not an optimal solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

1041
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1042
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:29.650
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a nihilistic solutions a </v>

1043
01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:30.530
<v Speaker 2>collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other solution is</v>

1044
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>we're talking and I don't get what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want from you,</v>

1045
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 2>and so I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better not do that again.</v>

1046
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see that from you again </v>
<v Speaker 2>and starts a tyrannical attitude,</v>

1047
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:47.021
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm going to do is I'm going to </v>

1048
01:01:47.021 --> 01:01:48.080
<v Speaker 2>take my universe of order and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictions and I'm going to say,</v>

1049
01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>you go along with this or I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>punish you,</v>

1050
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.130
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

1051
01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Now there is an element in society like </v>
<v Speaker 2>society is made up of threats like that.</v>

1052
01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:05.981
<v Speaker 2>To some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an erotica bowl in eradicable part </v>

1053
01:02:05.981 --> 01:02:10.181
<v Speaker 2>of society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be the tyrannical aspect of </v>

1054
01:02:10.181 --> 01:02:10.181
<v Speaker 2>the Greek king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1055
01:02:10.181 --> 01:02:14.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we we've organized a set of punishments </v>

1056
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:14.040
<v Speaker 2>and threats that keep each of us in </v>
<v Speaker 2>alignment.</v>

1057
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.310
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

1058
01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:21.580
<v Speaker 2>in a society that's functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've decided to adopt agreement with </v>

1059
01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.760
<v Speaker 2>that set of principles more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily and we say,</v>

1060
01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:25.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have rights and responsibilities and</v>

1061
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I have rights and responsibilities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to pay a price for years,</v>

1062
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.580
<v Speaker 2>including the acceptance of punishment </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I transgress,</v>

1063
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:35.640
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to do the same for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are.</v>

1064
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.760
<v Speaker 2>There are intelligent ways that </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment and threat can be used and </v>

1065
01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.121
<v Speaker 2>bound it so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that could easily degenerate into </v>

1066
01:02:44.121 --> 01:02:48.261
<v Speaker 2>tyranny and one of the methods that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can choose to use if I don't want to </v>

1067
01:02:48.261 --> 01:02:52.941
<v Speaker 2>encounter error is just to enforce my </v>
<v Speaker 2>will on everyone else and I think when </v>

1068
01:02:53.071 --> 01:02:58.071
<v Speaker 2>that happens personally and in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family and in the community and in the </v>

1069
01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:02.070
<v Speaker 2>state all at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get the emergence of a tyranny</v>

1070
01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:03.430
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1071
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:09.020
<v Speaker 2>so I would consider those to </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive</v>

1072
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:13.570
<v Speaker 2>reactions to the emergence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unrealized world.</v>

1073
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:17.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like you say something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like a collapse completely.</v>

1074
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Children don't like other children who </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that by the way.</v>

1075
01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that's very interesting to </v>

1076
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:29.191
<v Speaker 2>observe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's say kids have organized </v>

1077
01:03:29.191 --> 01:03:32.131
<v Speaker 2>themselves to play a little game of </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball with a plastic bat and a ball </v>

1078
01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:35.850
<v Speaker 2>and you know one child pitches and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other child hits the ball and the child </v>

1079
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:39.931
<v Speaker 2>catches it and puts the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts the batter out and the batter </v>

1080
01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:39.931
<v Speaker 2>bursts into tears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1081
01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:44.350
<v Speaker 2>what happens is the other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the first time that happens,</v>

1082
01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.660
<v Speaker 2>they'll be sympathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The third time that happens,</v>

1083
01:03:46.661 --> 01:03:48.760
<v Speaker 2>they won't invite that kid out to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball anymore,</v>

1084
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.240
<v Speaker 2>so the answer to we're not getting along</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not you get to burst into tears and </v>

1085
01:03:55.670 --> 01:04:00.670
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and manifest extraordinary emotional </v>

1086
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.191
<v Speaker 2>distress because if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to want to play with you </v>

1087
01:04:03.191 --> 01:04:06.440
<v Speaker 2>and that's a lesson that many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>could stand learning.</v>

1088
01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:11.441
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I think that's really </v>

1089
01:04:11.441 --> 01:04:13.151
<v Speaker 2>destabilizing our society right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe is that I'm not sure that kids </v>

1090
01:04:13.191 --> 01:04:18.191
<v Speaker 2>have been encouraged or allowed to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough in the last 25,</v>

1091
01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:24.041
<v Speaker 2>30 years and I think a lot of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity stuff is actually fantasy play.</v>

1092
01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>It's delayed fantasy play because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of what you do when you're seven </v>

1093
01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1094
01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be this identity.</v>

1095
01:04:30.381 --> 01:04:35.381
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're doing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend you're going to go along with </v>

1096
01:04:35.381 --> 01:04:35.381
<v Speaker 2>that because we're going to play this </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1097
01:04:35.381 --> 01:04:35.381
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1098
01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:37.460
<v Speaker 2>You don't impose that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1099
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Not Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a kid that has a clue,</v>

1100
01:04:39.111 --> 01:04:44.111
<v Speaker 2>you invite people to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't insist on your identity and </v>

1101
01:04:44.111 --> 01:04:48.401
<v Speaker 2>their compliance with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a playable game and you don't </v>

1102
01:04:48.401 --> 01:04:52.931
<v Speaker 2>burst into tears and runoff when someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't play your game because then they </v>

1103
01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.170
<v Speaker 2>won't play with you and then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn to force and that's.</v>

1104
01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.120
<v Speaker 2>That's fine if that's what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1105
01:04:56.121 --> 01:04:59.300
<v Speaker 2>but you better look out because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>better be ready to use it.</v>

1106
01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.640
<v Speaker 2>This creating universal morality through</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible making sure because this </v>

1107
01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:15.330
<v Speaker 2>search or a better this structure being </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a programmatic perspective,</v>

1108
01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.860
<v Speaker 2>the does come with responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that people are trapped.</v>

1109
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps the medical leave structuring </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else,</v>

1110
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.220
<v Speaker 2>but we have a responsibility that </v>
<v Speaker 2>against.</v>

1111
01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's part of the question that </v>

1112
01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.990
<v Speaker 2>in some sense motivated in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated the American incursion into </v>

1113
01:05:36.331 --> 01:05:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1114
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:40.950
<v Speaker 2>So what's our responsibility in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to tyranny?</v>

1115
01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

1116
01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Feminists are getting this for </v>
<v Speaker 2>protesting about the petition of human </v>

1117
01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.820
<v Speaker 2>and say Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1118
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1119
01:05:53.431 --> 01:05:58.431
<v Speaker 2>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that criticism is more emerging </v>

1120
01:05:58.431 --> 01:05:58.431
<v Speaker 2>because of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's apparently.</v>

1121
01:05:58.431 --> 01:06:02.550
<v Speaker 2>It's apparently paradoxical in they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>laid out a set of principles to which in</v>

1122
01:06:02.551 --> 01:06:07.551
<v Speaker 2>principle they they adhere and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those principles is to reduce the </v>

1123
01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:10.920
<v Speaker 2>destructive power of the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1124
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.890
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is some destructive patriarchy for</v>

1125
01:06:13.891 --> 01:06:15.780
<v Speaker 2>you radio silence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1126
01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.600
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now what am I supposed to do about that?</v>

1127
01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Am I supposed to question your adherence</v>
<v Speaker 2>to those principles?</v>

1128
01:06:21.271 --> 01:06:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Which is exactly what should be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a.</v>

1129
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1130
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a criticism of performative </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradiction.</v>

1131
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.660
<v Speaker 2>You say you're for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to act it out,</v>

1132
01:06:30.661 --> 01:06:34.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't selectively in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if there's something wrong,</v>

1133
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:38.040
<v Speaker 2>there's something about your game that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not being straight about.</v>

1134
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:41.160
<v Speaker 2>That's the criticism and maybe there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rejoinders to that,</v>

1135
01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.800
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1136
01:06:43.801 --> 01:06:44.490
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1137
01:06:44.491 --> 01:06:46.410
<v Speaker 2>well responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1138
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:47.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'd have to look at,</v>

1139
01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:49.040
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at different levels of,</v>

1140
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.540
<v Speaker 2>of analysis with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions.</v>

1141
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:56.870
<v Speaker 2>You definitely have a responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your partner and your children.</v>

1142
01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your responsibility to your children </v>

1143
01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:03.020
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is don't.</v>

1144
01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:04.500
<v Speaker 2>It's twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1145
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:09.530
<v Speaker 2>don't let your children do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you dislike them and there's a </v>

1146
01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:10.560
<v Speaker 2>corollary to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is don't be an idiot.</v>

1147
01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:16.040
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's partly why you need a partner </v>

1148
01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.021
<v Speaker 2>because your partner has to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>when your demands on your children are </v>

1149
01:07:18.021 --> 01:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>excessive because you're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1150
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.380
<v Speaker 2>you're not 100 percent oriented </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

1151
01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:27.650
<v Speaker 2>but still you're their target adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's up to you to help them </v>

1152
01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:31.710
<v Speaker 2>choose a path that makes you want them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be around.</v>

1153
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that's your critical </v>

1154
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.441
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and hopefully your enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>of an an analog of the broader community</v>

1155
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:43.200
<v Speaker 2>so that if they can figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get along with you,</v>

1156
01:07:43.201 --> 01:07:48.201
<v Speaker 2>it radically increases the probability </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they'll be able to get along with </v>

1157
01:07:48.201 --> 01:07:48.201
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1158
01:07:48.201 --> 01:07:51.570
<v Speaker 2>if you're playing with your children two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

1159
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:53.970
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you help them,</v>

1160
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.670
<v Speaker 2>you encourage them to play in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fun.</v>

1161
01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.600
<v Speaker 2>And if you get that down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know when you introduce them to</v>

1162
01:08:00.601 --> 01:08:05.601
<v Speaker 2>another child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to play in a manner </v>

1163
01:08:05.601 --> 01:08:06.330
<v Speaker 2>that's fun and so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've solved the problem.</v>

1164
01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:11.570
<v Speaker 2>The problem is to get your child to </v>
<v Speaker 2>enter into the collaborative social </v>

1165
01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:11.570
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yes,</v>

1166
01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:13.110
<v Speaker 2>you have a primary responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1167
01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:18.530
<v Speaker 2>And then with regards to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's something to think about with </v>

1168
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:22.931
<v Speaker 2>regards to roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my wife and I have had this </v>

1169
01:08:22.931 --> 01:08:22.931
<v Speaker 2>discussion many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the discussions as well,</v>

1170
01:08:22.931 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 2>how are we to treat each other in </v>
<v Speaker 2>public?</v>

1171
01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.290
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her name is Tammy.</v>

1172
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 2>The discussion isn't how should Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 2>treat Tammy in public?</v>

1173
01:08:31.071 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Or how should tammy treat Jordan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the discussion.</v>

1174
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:37.460
<v Speaker 2>This isn't personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how should a wife treat her husband</v>

1175
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
<v Speaker 2>and how should a husband treat his wife?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impersonal and it's partly you </v>

1176
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.010
<v Speaker 2>don't put your partner down in public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1177
01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not because you're hurting that </v>

1178
01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:51.240
<v Speaker 2>persons feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not why.</v>

1179
01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.820
<v Speaker 2>It's that you're denigrating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship that you are in </v>

1180
01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:54.820
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1181
01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.720
<v Speaker 2>some of the most painful days I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent.</v>

1182
01:08:56.721 --> 01:09:00.830
<v Speaker 2>One in particular I spent with a group </v>
<v Speaker 2>of men who had been in therapy for their</v>

1183
01:09:00.831 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Speaker 2>marriage and who bloody well needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that.</v>

1184
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:07.640
<v Speaker 2>And they spent their whole day </v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining about their wives.</v>

1185
01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Like it just made me sweat the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1186
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm here with you guys.</v>

1187
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why was it,</v>

1188
01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:19.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just happenstance more than </v>

1189
01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:19.230
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

1190
01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:19.700
<v Speaker 2>how can you be so damn dump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1191
01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:24.701
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly possible that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage barbara married barbarian </v>

1192
01:09:24.701 --> 01:09:28.421
<v Speaker 2>witches fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have your so lacking in </v>

1193
01:09:28.421 --> 01:09:30.380
<v Speaker 2>sense that you would discuss that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>

1194
01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Not noticing that you pick them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically all you're doing is holding</v>

1195
01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:37.520
<v Speaker 2>up a sign and waving it constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That says,</v>

1196
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot.</v>

1197
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so well,</v>

1198
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Responsibility,</v>

1199
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.440
<v Speaker 2>you have a responsibility to those whom </v>
<v Speaker 2>you love and are obligated to,</v>

1200
01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:57.670
<v Speaker 2>to ensure that they manifest themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a manner that's most beneficial to </v>

1201
01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:01.430
<v Speaker 2>them over the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you have the same responsibility,</v>

1202
01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I would say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll have blind spots.</v>

1203
01:10:04.431 --> 01:10:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Other people have to help you with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so the rule is you know,</v>

1204
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:13.030
<v Speaker 2>you don't let your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you help your wife figure out how </v>

1205
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:16.871
<v Speaker 2>not to make a fool of herself in public </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she extends to you the same courtesy</v>

1206
01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.170
<v Speaker 2>and it's partly maintenance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacred nature of the relationship.</v>

1207
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:24.650
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with you or her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

1208
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:27.470
<v Speaker 2>It's broader and wider than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1209
01:10:27.471 --> 01:10:29.540
<v Speaker 2>so then that's two levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

1210
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partner,</v>

1211
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.520
<v Speaker 2>next level of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're asked at your workplace to go </v>

1212
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.210
<v Speaker 2>uncaught to undergo unconscious bias </v>
<v Speaker 2>retraining new say yes.</v>

1213
01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1214
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.570
<v Speaker 2>you've just admitted that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigot,</v>

1215
01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:46.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're acting it out.</v>

1216
01:10:46.851 --> 01:10:51.851
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm a racist bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I need to be retrained and so </v>

1217
01:10:51.851 --> 01:10:51.851
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1218
01:10:51.851 --> 01:10:53.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to make a fuss about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1219
01:10:53.361 --> 01:10:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Or I've been told to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you agree with it fine,</v>

1220
01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and if that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you agree with it,</v>

1221
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:01.100
<v Speaker 2>no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make a case for it.</v>

1222
01:11:01.101 --> 01:11:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a week and appalling case </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>

1223
01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.680
<v Speaker 2>but you can make a case for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could say,</v>

1224
01:11:06.681 --> 01:11:07.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1225
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I am interested in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my biases and how to rectify them and </v>

1226
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:12.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair enough,</v>

1227
01:11:12.261 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are biased,</v>

1228
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 2>but if you object to it and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>say anything,</v>

1229
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:24.290
<v Speaker 2>then you're complicit and then it's on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you know like a causes B and C </v>

1230
01:11:27.331 --> 01:11:29.670
<v Speaker 2>and b causes c and d and so forth.</v>

1231
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:34.700
<v Speaker 2>The thing tends does noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has this tendency to expand and </v>

1232
01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:38.331
<v Speaker 2>you'll come home angry and upset and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll go to the training program and </v>

1233
01:11:38.331 --> 01:11:42.171
<v Speaker 2>you'll think this is ridiculous because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is what you'll think in all </v>

1234
01:11:42.171 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 2>likelihood and you won't say anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>but it eats at you.</v>

1235
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've abrogated your responsibility.</v>

1236
01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:48.690
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you might say,</v>

1237
01:11:48.691 --> 01:11:49.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then,</v>

1238
01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:51.810
<v Speaker 2>then that's how the community becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt.</v>

1239
01:11:51.811 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 2>That's how the community starts to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt,</v>

1240
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:58.910
<v Speaker 2>is that people turn a blind eye to </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergent pathology when they know it's </v>

1241
01:11:58.910 --> 01:12:03.501
<v Speaker 2>pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what the Egyptian story </v>

1242
01:12:03.501 --> 01:12:03.501
<v Speaker 2>says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1243
01:12:03.501 --> 01:12:07.011
<v Speaker 2>cyrus is overcome by Seth because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>willfully blind,</v>

1244
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:11.700
<v Speaker 2>willfully blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means he knows,</v>

1245
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:17.330
<v Speaker 2>but refuses to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows quote his Predator detection </v>

1246
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:20.700
<v Speaker 2>systems have gone off monster while then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to look okay,</v>

1247
01:12:20.701 --> 01:12:22.620
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What sort of monster is this?</v>

1248
01:12:22.621 --> 01:12:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have wings.</v>

1249
01:12:23.521 --> 01:12:24.810
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have a tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1250
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you cut it down into the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cut it from the monster that it </v>

1251
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:32.280
<v Speaker 2>could be into the monster that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first step.</v>

1252
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:37.550
<v Speaker 2>And then you take the appropriate steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you also noticed the other </v>

1253
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:38.400
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because here's something to think about.</v>

1254
01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 2>You're going to pay a price for speaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1255
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:45.720
<v Speaker 2>but you're gonna pay a price for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking up.</v>

1256
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.100
<v Speaker 2>So it's like monsters on the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters on the left.</v>

1257
01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Pick the ones you want to battle with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you decide not to make your stand,</v>

1258
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:59.640
<v Speaker 2>you weaken yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do it 100 times,</v>

1259
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.160
<v Speaker 2>then even if the monster was only this </v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

1260
01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:04.470
<v Speaker 2>now you're this big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to eat you.</v>

1261
01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.600
<v Speaker 2>You know when it was this big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably could have kicked it across</v>

1262
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 2>the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too late for that.</v>

1263
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:12.570
<v Speaker 2>You have capitulated and capitulated and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you've done.</v>

1264
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:15.690
<v Speaker 2>This is a way to think about it from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>union perspective.</v>

1265
01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:18.660
<v Speaker 2>This is what young was trying to get at </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was talking about elk alchemy.</v>

1266
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:24.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like the thing that pops up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>object to you is this incredibly complex</v>

1267
01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:29.700
<v Speaker 2>entity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1268
01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 2>it's the entire world encapsulated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the event.</v>

1269
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.330
<v Speaker 2>If you interact with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you unpack it.</v>

1270
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.640
<v Speaker 2>You differentiate your sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and you and you gather new skills.</v>

1271
01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:46.850
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say there's something going on at </v>

1272
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:49.911
<v Speaker 2>your workplace and that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>object to it because it's driving you </v>

1273
01:13:49.911 --> 01:13:52.851
<v Speaker 2>crazy and you talk it over with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife so that you've got your head </v>

1274
01:13:52.851 --> 01:13:52.851
<v Speaker 2>screwed on straight and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1275
01:13:52.851 --> 01:13:56.591
<v Speaker 2>I've got to say something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you go there and you say something </v>

1276
01:13:56.591 --> 01:13:56.730
<v Speaker 2>and you're stumbling and awkward and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

1277
01:13:56.731 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you watch the response and maybe you</v>

1278
01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:01.620
<v Speaker 2>get what you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't,</v>

1279
01:14:01.621 --> 01:14:03.240
<v Speaker 2>but you've learned a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've learned.</v>

1280
01:14:03.241 --> 01:14:08.241
<v Speaker 2>While I'm not as coherent as I could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as good at putting my arguments </v>

1281
01:14:08.241 --> 01:14:08.241
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My boss is more of a son of a bitch that</v>

1282
01:14:08.241 --> 01:14:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he thought he was.</v>

1283
01:14:09.031 --> 01:14:10.740
<v Speaker 2>This is a worst problem that I knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1284
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:13.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiated.</v>

1285
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:18.150
<v Speaker 2>So now the landscape is higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution and so were you well,</v>

1286
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.990
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you're a little bit next,</v>

1287
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 2>better prepared the next time you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

1288
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:27.720
<v Speaker 2>And so the issue here to some degree is </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't lose an opportunity to grapple </v>

1289
01:14:29.501 --> 01:14:34.501
<v Speaker 2>with something that objects to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when the object objection is </v>

1290
01:14:34.501 --> 01:14:37.120
<v Speaker 2>rather small because that's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

1291
01:14:37.121 --> 01:14:39.650
<v Speaker 2>well I can put up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like fair enough.</v>

1292
01:14:39.651 --> 01:14:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't want to make everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a war.</v>

1293
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I usually use your rule of three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're interacting and you do </v>

1294
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:47.800
<v Speaker 2>something that I find disruptive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll note it.</v>

1295
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:51.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like potential dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go on and I'll leave it be.</v>

1296
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.890
<v Speaker 2>And then if you do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1297
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.480
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that probably wasn't merely situation,</v>

1298
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.090
<v Speaker 2>but I'll leave it be because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>still not enough evidence.</v>

1299
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:04.000
<v Speaker 2>But if you do it a third time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll say,</v>

1300
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:06.070
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just noticed this and you'll say,</v>

1301
01:15:06.071 --> 01:15:07.090
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't happen.</v>

1302
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:08.440
<v Speaker 2>And I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1303
01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:13.600
<v Speaker 2>no one really did it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it happened here and it happened </v>

1304
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.531
<v Speaker 2>here and I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something going on here like </v>

1305
01:15:16.531 --> 01:15:17.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not ignoring it and we can get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of it.</v>

1306
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:22.920
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll come up with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>objections about why that isn't </v>

1307
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:22.920
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you push those aside.</v>

1308
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Now come up with a few more objections </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then push those aside.</v>

1309
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.930
<v Speaker 2>And then usually they'll get mad or </v>
<v Speaker 2>burst into tears.</v>

1310
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.920
<v Speaker 2>And if you push that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get to have a conversation,</v>

1311
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can solve the problem.</v>

1312
01:15:35.891 --> 01:15:36.700
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1313
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:40.180
<v Speaker 2>you got to be a monster because first of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1314
01:15:40.181 --> 01:15:44.080
<v Speaker 2>you need six arguments about why their </v>
<v Speaker 2>objections aren't gonna stop you.</v>

1315
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:47.680
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to not be intimidated </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the anger.</v>

1316
01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:52.890
<v Speaker 2>And you have to not be swamped by </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion about the tiers and then you </v>

1317
01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:56.890
<v Speaker 2>can have a conversation and people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1318
01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.580
<v Speaker 2>They won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they don't solve the problems.</v>

1319
01:16:00.581 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 2>And so then the problem's accrue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1320
01:16:02.981 --> 01:16:05.260
<v Speaker 2>And if they accrue over 15 years of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

1321
01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:07.450
<v Speaker 2>they end up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they end up fat,</v>

1322
01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:09.010
<v Speaker 2>ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>end in divorce court.</v>

1323
01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1324
01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:11.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a,</v>

1325
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:17.460
<v Speaker 2>that's not a great outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a divorce court and cancer are </v>

1326
01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.830
<v Speaker 2>similar in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their seriousness,</v>

1327
01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:21.680
<v Speaker 2>not always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1328
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:27.090
<v Speaker 2>but sufficiently often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when that error emerges,</v>

1329
01:16:27.091 --> 01:16:29.290
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a glimmering.</v>

1330
01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1331
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:34.240
<v Speaker 2>we talked a lot about the hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of goals,</v>

1332
01:16:34.241 --> 01:16:36.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so here's,</v>

1333
01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.520
<v Speaker 2>here's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's something to think about.</v>

1334
01:16:39.521 --> 01:16:44.521
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that analysis itself is </v>
<v Speaker 2>error has a twofold nature.</v>

1335
01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:48.220
<v Speaker 2>That's because it's chaos in order at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time,</v>

1336
01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.520
<v Speaker 2>or it's because it's all the archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures at the same time,</v>

1337
01:16:51.521 --> 01:16:54.130
<v Speaker 2>it's the dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the great mother,</v>

1338
01:16:54.131 --> 01:16:55.780
<v Speaker 2>positive or negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the great father,</v>

1339
01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:59.500
<v Speaker 2>positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the individual hero and adversary.</v>

1340
01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:02.440
<v Speaker 2>All of that manifests itself in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment of error,</v>

1341
01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:04.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The architects come forward.</v>

1342
01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Did you make an error because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad person.</v>

1343
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Could be now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1344
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:11.750
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things to think about with</v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to that is,</v>

1345
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:13.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Mesopotamian creation story,</v>

1346
01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:15.220
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1347
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.960
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when time comes flooding back,</v>

1348
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:19.430
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting that story.</v>

1349
01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Think about what she does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's the archetype of error.</v>

1350
01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the error that can take you </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1351
01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:30.200
<v Speaker 2>they can dissolve you in salt water </v>
<v Speaker 2>tears.</v>

1352
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's irritated because apps,</v>

1353
01:17:33.741 --> 01:17:36.320
<v Speaker 2>it was destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the structure is gone.</v>

1354
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Carelessness is destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The structure up comes,</v>

1355
01:17:38.651 --> 01:17:40.280
<v Speaker 2>tie or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not happy.</v>

1356
01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.880
<v Speaker 2>What does she do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She prepares a phalanx of monstrous </v>

1357
01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.400
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what the story says.</v>

1358
01:17:46.401 --> 01:17:51.401
<v Speaker 2>She produces a whole horde of monsters </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come at you and she puts king you at </v>

1359
01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:57.401
<v Speaker 2>their head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Kenya was the king of the monsters </v>

1360
01:17:57.401 --> 01:17:58.940
<v Speaker 2>and later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's the ultimate bad guy.</v>

1361
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.950
<v Speaker 2>He's Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all intents and purposes,</v>

1362
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:06.010
<v Speaker 2>in the midst of Damien version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's out of him that makes human beings.</v>

1363
01:18:06.201 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 2>It's out of his blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But mark makes human beings.</v>

1364
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.610
<v Speaker 2>That's a critical issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1365
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:15.850
<v Speaker 2>The Mesopotamian said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine the worst monster you can </v>

1366
01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:17.690
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine the king of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>

1367
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:22.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the blood of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1368
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:24.080
<v Speaker 2>So what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1369
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that one of the terrible things</v>

1370
01:18:26.811 --> 01:18:31.811
<v Speaker 2>that lurks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that you've been in the </v>

1371
01:18:31.811 --> 01:18:35.030
<v Speaker 2>longterm relationship and it collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you were,</v>

1372
01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a tendency towards alcoholism.</v>

1373
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.760
<v Speaker 2>You weren't so great with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your drug use.</v>

1374
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:46.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that conscientious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had like four or five kinda low ran </v>

1375
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:51.390
<v Speaker 2>to affairs and you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your marriage collapses bank.</v>

1376
01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do you first meet when you fall into</v>

1377
01:18:55.131 --> 01:19:00.131
<v Speaker 2>chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You meet King of the monsters and he's </v>

1378
01:19:00.131 --> 01:19:01.340
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did my marriage fall apart?</v>

1379
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:02.870
<v Speaker 2>What did I do wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1380
01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1381
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

1382
01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I did all these things wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1383
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Because of that thing and habits me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1384
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most horrifying question,</v>

1385
01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:13.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why.</v>

1386
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.130
<v Speaker 2>So down there in the architectural </v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

1387
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:19.610
<v Speaker 2>all these things lurk the heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adversary,</v>

1388
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:22.220
<v Speaker 2>but you've just met the adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1389
01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you were tyrant.</v>

1390
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:27.650
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe everything around you was chaotic,</v>

1391
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:30.140
<v Speaker 2>so what do you encounter when things </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall apart?</v>

1392
01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Even counter the adversary you </v>
<v Speaker 2>encountered the tyrant,</v>

1393
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:38.890
<v Speaker 2>you encounter the catastrophe of nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you encountered the dragon of the </v>

1394
01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 2>chaos and they're all intermingled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to sort that out.</v>

1395
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.420
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens to Ellis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she goes down the rabbit hole,</v>

1396
01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:49.660
<v Speaker 2>she meets the Red Queen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Red Queen is always running around,</v>

1397
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:52.160
<v Speaker 2>off with their heads off with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>heads,</v>

1398
01:19:52.161 --> 01:19:53.900
<v Speaker 2>and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my kingdom,</v>

1399
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:58.070
<v Speaker 2>you have to run as fast as you can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay in the same place right down the</v>

1400
01:19:58.071 --> 01:20:01.280
<v Speaker 2>rabbit hole you meet the archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1401
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:04.610
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back to responsibility.</v>

1402
01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things,</v>

1403
01:20:05.511 --> 01:20:07.060
<v Speaker 2>soldier and incent detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1404
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.500
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1405
01:20:07.501 --> 01:20:09.900
<v Speaker 2>how does society go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Corrupt said it's easy.</v>

1406
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:15.540
<v Speaker 2>One little sin at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to work,</v>

1407
01:20:15.541 --> 01:20:18.030
<v Speaker 2>someone's Lording it over you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that they're tyrannical.</v>

1408
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.580
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the wherewithal to stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1409
01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:21.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1410
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:23.520
<v Speaker 2>you're a slave.</v>

1411
01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:28.660
<v Speaker 2>And so if you continue to agree to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>slave,</v>

1412
01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:32.710
<v Speaker 2>you will continue to generate tyrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1413
01:20:32.711 --> 01:20:34.720
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing that can stop you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from doing that,</v>

1414
01:20:34.721 --> 01:20:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I think is the right kind of terror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1415
01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:41.360
<v Speaker 2>be careful what you give up because now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this logo.</v>

1416
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:41.710
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1417
01:20:41.711 --> 01:20:42.250
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1418
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:43.910
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's this logo.</v>

1419
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.990
<v Speaker 2>The logo is the thing that enables you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to mediate between eight,</v>

1420
01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:49.900
<v Speaker 2>between order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you have to have some faith in</v>

1421
01:20:49.901 --> 01:20:50.860
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1422
01:20:50.861 --> 01:20:55.861
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should you do with someone who's </v>

1423
01:20:55.861 --> 01:20:55.861
<v Speaker 2>harassing you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1424
01:20:55.861 --> 01:20:55.861
<v Speaker 2>you should fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1425
01:20:55.861 --> 01:21:00.631
<v Speaker 2>what does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the most effective way to fight </v>

1426
01:21:00.631 --> 01:21:00.631
<v Speaker 2>back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1427
01:21:00.631 --> 01:21:03.040
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not necessarily for the best.</v>

1428
01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's through articulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's through analysis,</v>

1429
01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be sharp,</v>

1430
01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.810
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to decompose a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1431
01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:16.020
<v Speaker 2>You want to be able to formulate an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument and a counter response and </v>

1432
01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:16.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe you want to be so good at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people don't mess with you to begin</v>

1433
01:21:16.991 --> 01:21:17.230
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1434
01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:22.850
<v Speaker 2>And then you're a perfectly articulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter monster and you never have to </v>

1435
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:24.090
<v Speaker 2>take your sword out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1436
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:29.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the place that you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people should know after three</v>

1437
01:21:29.081 --> 01:21:34.081
<v Speaker 2>seconds of interacting with you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>harassing you will be a seriously bad </v>

1438
01:21:34.081 --> 01:21:36.640
<v Speaker 2>idea and then you'll have a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine time with them,</v>

1439
01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:42.900
<v Speaker 2>so and that's part of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's some utility in meeting the </v>

1440
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:43.690
<v Speaker 2>devil in underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1441
01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Because maybe he's got something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach you that's certainly possible that</v>

1442
01:21:47.711 --> 01:21:51.910
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught is that your normative morality,</v>

1443
01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:56.940
<v Speaker 2>which is basically your harmlessness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your naivety masquerading as virtue is </v>

1444
01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.150
<v Speaker 2>completely insufficient to protect you </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>

1445
01:22:01.151 --> 01:22:03.340
<v Speaker 2>especially against the sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're talking about,</v>

1446
01:22:03.341 --> 01:22:08.020
<v Speaker 2>which are tyrant tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyrants will push until you push back.</v>

1447
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.620
<v Speaker 2>It's in their nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have internal controls,</v>

1448
01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:15.010
<v Speaker 2>so they just push and push and push and </v>
<v Speaker 2>push and push and push.</v>

1449
01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Even kids do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like little kids do that all the time.</v>

1450
01:22:17.861 --> 01:22:20.140
<v Speaker 2>They'll just push you until they hit a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>

1451
01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:25.260
<v Speaker 2>They're actually quite happy when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit a wall because the last thing a </v>

1452
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:27.400
<v Speaker 2>child wants is a universe without walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It terrifies them,</v>

1453
01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:29.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to see while I'm in a swimming</v>

1454
01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:31.120
<v Speaker 2>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an edge.</v>

1455
01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1456
01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.090
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't as important.</v>

1457
01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:36.580
<v Speaker 2>This is an ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the middle of an ocean.</v>

1458
01:22:36.670 --> 01:22:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to drown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible thing for children.</v>

1459
01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.680
<v Speaker 2>That's why they need discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure because it's consistency and </v>

1460
01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:49.231
<v Speaker 2>predictability and routine and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are extraordinarily helpful </v>

1461
01:22:49.231 --> 01:22:50.230
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1462
01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:55.231
<v Speaker 2>so now think about that hierarchy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about so you're not in a </v>

1463
01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:58.510
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in nested stories,</v>

1464
01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:01.150
<v Speaker 2>and the nest is stories ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1465
01:23:01.151 --> 01:23:04.930
<v Speaker 2>inaction in actual embodied action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to sit,</v>

1466
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:10.140
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to be a good a partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you help prepare the meals and to </v>

1467
01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:16.861
<v Speaker 2>help prepare the meals means you pick up</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plate with your hand and you move it </v>

1468
01:23:16.861 --> 01:23:18.190
<v Speaker 2>physically through space and you put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the table.</v>

1469
01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 2>That's where it stops being an </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction.</v>

1470
01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:24.400
<v Speaker 2>So at the bottom of an ethical hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 2>of value,</v>

1471
01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:29.380
<v Speaker 2>our actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not things that's the scientific world,</v>

1472
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:35.130
<v Speaker 2>but actions and then you can label the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions with abstractions as you move up</v>

1473
01:23:37.301 --> 01:23:42.301
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're good at setting the table so </v>

1474
01:23:42.301 --> 01:23:45.210
<v Speaker 2>that means you're good at making dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that means that you've got one </v>

1475
01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:47.941
<v Speaker 2>element of good being a good partner in </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and being a good partner is one </v>

1476
01:23:47.941 --> 01:23:51.811
<v Speaker 2>element of being a good person and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you you're not so good at setting the </v>

1477
01:23:51.811 --> 01:23:53.260
<v Speaker 2>table and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not a good person.</v>

1478
01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

1479
01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:59.610
<v Speaker 2>you should go down to the higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution levels of the hierarchy and </v>

1480
01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 2>start there and that's what you do when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're arguing with people.</v>

1481
01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:05.610
<v Speaker 2>But there's another thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful about conceptualizing the </v>

1482
01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy in this manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't miss it.</v>

1483
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.980
<v Speaker 2>So I think what we'll do is we'll stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>now for 10 minutes and I'll,</v>

1484
01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:17.040
<v Speaker 2>because I want to bring up this diagram </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what I want to do next is it's a</v>

1485
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:22.110
<v Speaker 2>bleak story at the moment because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story is something like you're going to </v>

1486
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:26.401
<v Speaker 2>lay out over simplifications in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and they're going to be prone to </v>

1487
01:24:26.401 --> 01:24:29.041
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic error and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter what's terrifying in order to </v>

1488
01:24:29.041 --> 01:24:32.881
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that </v>

1489
01:24:32.881 --> 01:24:32.881
<v Speaker 2>progression is always dependent on </v>
<v Speaker 2>terror.</v>

1490
01:24:32.881 --> 01:24:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Something like that and there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth in that and that's why people </v>

1491
01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:40.351
<v Speaker 2>don't progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a sufficient truth and I </v>

1492
01:24:40.351 --> 01:24:43.261
<v Speaker 2>want to unpack that when we come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's come back in 10 minutes and </v>

1493
01:24:43.261 --> 01:24:43.480
<v Speaker 2>then I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can unpack that.</v>

1494
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:48.260
<v Speaker 4>There's this parable in the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>testament that just came to mind.</v>

1495
01:24:48.630 --> 01:24:53.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to mangle it a bit because </v>

1496
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.630
<v Speaker 4>it's not one that I have well memorized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1497
01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.840
<v Speaker 4>and I'm probably going to conflate two </v>
<v Speaker 4>or three stories together,</v>

1498
01:24:56.841 --> 01:24:58.370
<v Speaker 4>but I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've got it right.</v>

1499
01:24:59.450 --> 01:25:04.450
<v Speaker 4>Christ is walking down the road and </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone picks them up and if the person </v>

1500
01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:09.281
<v Speaker 4>is rich and wealthy and he has a talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they talk and the wealthy man basically </v>

1501
01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.510
<v Speaker 4>tells him all the things that are wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>with his life.</v>

1502
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:21.410
<v Speaker 4>And then he asks him what he should do </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1503
01:25:21.411 --> 01:25:26.411
<v Speaker 4>And Chris says to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to give up everything you own </v>

1504
01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:30.851
<v Speaker 4>and follow me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's often be read as a criticism </v>

1505
01:25:30.851 --> 01:25:34.751
<v Speaker 4>of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's actually not what the story </v>

1506
01:25:34.751 --> 01:25:34.751
<v Speaker 4>means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the story means is this,</v>

1507
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.340
<v Speaker 4>this guy has a lot of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's still miserable.</v>

1508
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:42.770
<v Speaker 4>And so that means that what he has is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the obstacle to what he could be.</v>

1509
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:47.830
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the message of the story </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that if you're miserable with what </v>

1510
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:48.350
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have to let go of what you have</v>

1511
01:25:48.351 --> 01:25:50.480
<v Speaker 4>so that maybe you could have something </v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

1512
01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:54.770
<v Speaker 4>And so and then there's some commentary </v>
<v Speaker 4>on that story.</v>

1513
01:25:54.771 --> 01:25:57.680
<v Speaker 4>I think other people are listening and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>

1514
01:25:57.770 --> 01:26:00.830
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's the price to be paid,</v>

1515
01:26:00.831 --> 01:26:05.831
<v Speaker 4>then no one is ever to pay it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's where the statement,</v>

1516
01:26:06.021 --> 01:26:11.021
<v Speaker 4>it is easier for a man to go through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>eye of a needle for a camel to go </v>

1517
01:26:11.021 --> 01:26:15.110
<v Speaker 4>through an eye of the eye of a needle </v>
<v Speaker 4>than for a rich man to enter paradise.</v>

1518
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:18.170
<v Speaker 4>I believe that's the derivation of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

1519
01:26:18.171 --> 01:26:23.171
<v Speaker 4>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's been read as a critique of </v>

1520
01:26:23.171 --> 01:26:23.171
<v Speaker 4>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't.</v>

1521
01:26:23.171 --> 01:26:24.020
<v Speaker 4>It's a critique of attachment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1522
01:26:24.021 --> 01:26:25.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Buddhist doctrine,</v>

1523
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:28.400
<v Speaker 3>one of the</v>

1524
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:33.480
<v Speaker 4>impediments to enlightenment is </v>
<v Speaker 4>attachment.</v>

1525
01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:35.580
<v Speaker 4>And people read that as saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1526
01:26:35.581 --> 01:26:37.530
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't care for anything in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1527
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:42.950
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a nihilism that's associated </v>

1528
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:44.250
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a strong nihilistic tendency in</v>

1529
01:26:44.251 --> 01:26:48.180
<v Speaker 4>Buddhism that has to do with abandonment</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world.</v>

1530
01:26:48.181 --> 01:26:53.181
<v Speaker 4>Do you see that in Christianity to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree with people going off to lead </v>

1531
01:26:53.181 --> 01:26:53.210
<v Speaker 4>ascetic lives in to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1532
01:26:53.211 --> 01:26:58.211
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of multiple religious </v>

1533
01:26:58.211 --> 01:26:58.211
<v Speaker 4>traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That idea of asceticism and there's some</v>

1534
01:26:58.211 --> 01:27:01.350
<v Speaker 4>utility in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it is your attachment say to material</v>

1535
01:27:01.351 --> 01:27:06.351
<v Speaker 4>things or status or whatever that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>interfering with your psychological </v>

1536
01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:10.941
<v Speaker 4>progression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the idea is that you should let go </v>

1537
01:27:10.941 --> 01:27:13.551
<v Speaker 4>of whatever it is that's interfering </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your psychological progression </v>

1538
01:27:13.551 --> 01:27:16.911
<v Speaker 4>because no matter how valuable what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that's interfering is it's not as </v>

1539
01:27:17.101 --> 01:27:18.630
<v Speaker 4>valuable as what you're giving up.</v>

1540
01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

1541
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:25.100
<v Speaker 4>that criticism still stands and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticism was,</v>

1542
01:27:25.101 --> 01:27:27.590
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the task is that difficult,</v>

1543
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.920
<v Speaker 4>then no one's going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so in in the brothers Karamazov,</v>

1544
01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:39.220
<v Speaker 4>there's a famous story called the grand </v>
<v Speaker 4>inquisitor and it's a story told by Ivan</v>

1545
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:49.030
<v Speaker 4>Karamozov to his brother Leo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Ivan is a very high status,</v>

1546
01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:53.150
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive,</v>

1547
01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:58.690
<v Speaker 4>tough minded soldier and Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Osha is his younger brother and he's </v>

1548
01:27:59.901 --> 01:28:04.901
<v Speaker 4>kind of softer and less rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a more spiritual,</v>

1549
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:10.870
<v Speaker 4>and also training to be a novitiate at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the local monastery and Ivan likes to </v>

1550
01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:15.530
<v Speaker 4>tear strips off it because he's a cynic </v>
<v Speaker 4>and an atheist,</v>

1551
01:28:15.531 --> 01:28:19.250
<v Speaker 4>and and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in Dostoyevsky's normal,</v>

1552
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:23.360
<v Speaker 4>brilliant manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He makes Ivan and incredibly powerful,</v>

1553
01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:28.400
<v Speaker 4>articulate and admirable character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when Dostoevsky wants to take someone</v>

1554
01:28:28.401 --> 01:28:33.401
<v Speaker 4>on and his literary investigations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't take his enemy and turned </v>

1555
01:28:33.401 --> 01:28:34.790
<v Speaker 4>them into some sort of weak puppet.</v>

1556
01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:39.940
<v Speaker 4>He takes his enemy and turns them into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the strongest possible enemy he can </v>

1557
01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:43.190
<v Speaker 4>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then goes to battle against that.</v>

1558
01:28:43.191 --> 01:28:46.220
<v Speaker 4>It's a hallmark of great literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what distinguishes dusty ask,</v>

1559
01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:47.600
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Ayn rand,</v>

1560
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:50.450
<v Speaker 4>because what Ayn rand does is she takes </v>
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

1561
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:53.810
<v Speaker 4>She's a darling of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say libertarian slash,</v>

1562
01:28:53.811 --> 01:28:58.811
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She takes her enemies and they're all </v>

1563
01:28:58.811 --> 01:28:58.811
<v Speaker 4>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1564
01:28:58.811 --> 01:29:03.281
<v Speaker 4>every single one of her negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>characters is exactly the same as every </v>

1565
01:29:03.281 --> 01:29:03.480
<v Speaker 4>other one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're all bad.</v>

1566
01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:04.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1567
01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:06.630
<v Speaker 4>there's no redeeming qualities </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever in them.</v>

1568
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:08.340
<v Speaker 4>And they also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

1569
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:11.250
<v Speaker 4>make their weak characters who make weak</v>
<v Speaker 4>arguments.</v>

1570
01:29:11.251 --> 01:29:16.251
<v Speaker 4>That's not the way to progress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way to progress is to take your </v>

1571
01:29:16.251 --> 01:29:19.581
<v Speaker 4>enemy seriously and to even inflate them</v>
<v Speaker 4>into something beyond their capacity to </v>

1572
01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:23.910
<v Speaker 4>inflate themselves and then see if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can hammer out a solution to the genuine</v>

1573
01:29:23.911 --> 01:29:26.320
<v Speaker 4>problem that's being posed anyways.</v>

1574
01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:29.160
<v Speaker 4>So dusty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does that brilliantly always.</v>

1575
01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 4>And that's what makes him so absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>remarkable.</v>

1576
01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:35.400
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I even tell Lee Osha this story,</v>

1577
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:38.190
<v Speaker 4>he calls it the grand inquisitor and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the story,</v>

1578
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:42.480
<v Speaker 4>Christ comes back to Earth in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Spanish inquisition and he's,</v>

1579
01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:47.660
<v Speaker 4>he's out by a fountain and people sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of notice him and he starts performing </v>

1580
01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:50.100
<v Speaker 4>miracles in a big crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gathers around and it's like happy days,</v>

1581
01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:51.000
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1582
01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:56.540
<v Speaker 4>but then the inquisitor's shows up this </v>
<v Speaker 4>old harsh tyrannical guy and he has his </v>

1583
01:29:57.361 --> 01:29:59.760
<v Speaker 4>guards arrested and throwing them in </v>
<v Speaker 4>prison.</v>

1584
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:05.750
<v Speaker 4>And so now Christ is in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the inquisitive it comes down and </v>

1585
01:30:06.661 --> 01:30:08.280
<v Speaker 4>says to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1586
01:30:08.281 --> 01:30:10.440
<v Speaker 4>you're probably wondering why we throw </v>
<v Speaker 4>you in prison.</v>

1587
01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:15.500
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially given that we're the members </v>

1588
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:15.500
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1589
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.020
<v Speaker 4>where the representatives of the church </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you hypothetically founded and,</v>

1590
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:21.270
<v Speaker 4>and Christ remained silent through this </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire episode.</v>

1591
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:25.080
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the inquisitor basically says,</v>

1592
01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:25.710
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1593
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.100
<v Speaker 4>you laid down this ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1594
01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:31.570
<v Speaker 4>it's wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's superhuman.</v>

1595
01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:34.410
<v Speaker 4>No one can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's asking way too much.</v>

1596
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:37.290
<v Speaker 4>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put the burden you put on people was</v>

1597
01:30:37.291 --> 01:30:42.291
<v Speaker 4>just far too great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what we've done in the Catholic </v>

1598
01:30:42.291 --> 01:30:44.100
<v Speaker 4>church in the centuries since the church</v>
<v Speaker 4>was founded is lightened the load.</v>

1599
01:30:44.101 --> 01:30:44.690
<v Speaker 4>We said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1600
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.080
<v Speaker 4>we'd take ordinary people and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1601
01:30:46.081 --> 01:30:51.081
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's some things you can do to be a </v>

1602
01:30:51.081 --> 01:30:51.081
<v Speaker 4>little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1603
01:30:51.081 --> 01:30:51.930
<v Speaker 4>we've instituted confession and </v>
<v Speaker 4>repentance and all that.</v>

1604
01:30:51.931 --> 01:30:56.340
<v Speaker 4>We've kind of toned it down so that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>average person has some hope of progress</v>

1605
01:30:56.341 --> 01:30:59.700
<v Speaker 4>and we're making headway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the last bloody thing we need around</v>

1606
01:30:59.701 --> 01:31:02.430
<v Speaker 4>here is you coming back and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>screwing up all our,</v>

1607
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:05.490
<v Speaker 4>all our good efforts is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was nice to have you around once,</v>

1608
01:31:05.491 --> 01:31:06.810
<v Speaker 4>but once was plenty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1609
01:31:06.811 --> 01:31:08.010
<v Speaker 4>we don't need you around anymore.</v>

1610
01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.920
<v Speaker 4>And so Christ listens to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't say anything,</v>

1611
01:31:10.921 --> 01:31:15.921
<v Speaker 4>and then the inquisitor turns to leave </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Christ grabs him and kisses him on </v>

1612
01:31:15.921 --> 01:31:19.680
<v Speaker 4>the lips and the inquisitor turns white </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then leaves.</v>

1613
01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:24.770
<v Speaker 4>And when he leaves the door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he leaves the door open and that's the </v>

1614
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:25.350
<v Speaker 4>end of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's an amazing store.</v>

1615
01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:28.950
<v Speaker 4>It's an absolutely remarkable story in </v>
<v Speaker 4>every possible way.</v>

1616
01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:30.240
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1617
01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:35.280
<v Speaker 4>dusty was objecting to some degree to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tyranny of the Catholic church,</v>

1618
01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.350
<v Speaker 4>or even if the Christian church for that</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

1619
01:31:37.351 --> 01:31:42.351
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that he did that was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>damn brilliant is that he even made the </v>

1620
01:31:42.351 --> 01:31:45.210
<v Speaker 4>inquisitor leave the door open now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as a balanced critique of </v>

1621
01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:46.980
<v Speaker 4>Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even during the inquisition,</v>

1622
01:31:46.981 --> 01:31:51.150
<v Speaker 4>it's so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so emblematic of Dostoyevsky's take</v>

1623
01:31:51.151 --> 01:31:56.151
<v Speaker 4>on the world that he criticized the </v>
<v Speaker 4>inquisitorial aspect of Christianity.</v>

1624
01:31:56.611 --> 01:31:57.150
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

1625
01:31:57.151 --> 01:31:59.530
<v Speaker 4>it's the tyrannical aspect of any belief</v>
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

1626
01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:02.500
<v Speaker 4>but noted that they bloody well left the</v>
<v Speaker 4>door open.</v>

1627
01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.240
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's brilliant.</v>

1628
01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:06.120
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1629
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.990
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1630
01:32:06.991 --> 01:32:07.930
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's remarkable.</v>

1631
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:13.110
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole point that I'm making here is </v>

1632
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:15.751
<v Speaker 4>that there are terrible impediments to </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment and the light,</v>

1633
01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:21.200
<v Speaker 4>the impediments are the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice and the necessity area of </v>

1634
01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.320
<v Speaker 4>necessity of the voluntary acceptance of</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>

1635
01:32:23.690 --> 01:32:24.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that in Buddhism,</v>

1636
01:32:24.911 --> 01:32:26.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because one of the canons of Buddha,</v>

1637
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:31.710
<v Speaker 4>one of the fundamental principles of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddhism is that life is suffering and </v>

1638
01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:34.480
<v Speaker 4>that attachment makes it worse and well </v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't,</v>

1639
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:39.750
<v Speaker 4>it isn't precisely attachment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an attachment to things such that </v>

1640
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:43.000
<v Speaker 4>you cannot release the things when it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>time to let them go.</v>

1641
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.250
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like you're a phoenix,</v>

1642
01:32:45.730 --> 01:32:47.710
<v Speaker 4>you're 100 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your feathers,</v>

1643
01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:49.180
<v Speaker 4>they're not working anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1644
01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.830
<v Speaker 4>You're all wrinkly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're done.</v>

1645
01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.770
<v Speaker 4>It's time to burst into flames and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>reborn,</v>

1646
01:32:53.771 --> 01:32:55.480
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want to burn off your </v>
<v Speaker 4>feathers.</v>

1647
01:32:55.810 --> 01:33:00.810
<v Speaker 4>You want to clean to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not good because you have to </v>

1648
01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:01.810
<v Speaker 4>be willing to undergo that </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation process.</v>

1649
01:33:01.811 --> 01:33:03.870
<v Speaker 4>And that involves like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1650
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:08.910
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you take your self apart because </v>

1651
01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Speaker 4>you've made a mistake and you find out </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is about you,</v>

1652
01:33:09.701 --> 01:33:14.701
<v Speaker 4>that's not set up properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why the mistake occurred and </v>

1653
01:33:14.701 --> 01:33:15.850
<v Speaker 4>that's really going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

1654
01:33:15.851 --> 01:33:17.560
<v Speaker 4>when an intimate relationship breaks </v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

1655
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:22.950
<v Speaker 4>then you have to be in a position where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to let the errors that </v>

1656
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:24.550
<v Speaker 4>are part of your character that define </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1657
01:33:24.551 --> 01:33:29.551
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might even be part of your </v>

1658
01:33:29.551 --> 01:33:30.901
<v Speaker 4>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to let you have to be willing </v>

1659
01:33:30.901 --> 01:33:33.091
<v Speaker 4>to let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be willing to let them burn </v>

1660
01:33:33.091 --> 01:33:34.030
<v Speaker 4>off and that's a hell of a thing to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then the question might be,</v>

1661
01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:39.031
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a less radical solution to the </v>

1662
01:33:39.031 --> 01:33:41.461
<v Speaker 4>problem then then then crucifixion and </v>
<v Speaker 4>resurrection or that the total emulation</v>

1663
01:33:42.831 --> 01:33:45.700
<v Speaker 4>and regeneration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's the archetype will.</v>

1664
01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:48.850
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the archetype will and point that</v>

1665
01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.360
<v Speaker 4>if you want to put your self together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to die and be reborn.</v>

1666
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:55.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean that and that motif comes up all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time in,</v>

1667
01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.100
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1668
01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:59.230
<v Speaker 4>in popular popular stories and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mythology.</v>

1669
01:33:59.530 --> 01:34:01.690
<v Speaker 4>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>

1670
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:06.750
<v Speaker 4>here's how I think that problem can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>resolved.</v>

1671
01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:12.550
<v Speaker 4>So let's go back to the UN story </v>
<v Speaker 4>momentarily.</v>

1672
01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:18.240
<v Speaker 4>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the Pinocchio Story to me is </v>

1673
01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:18.850
<v Speaker 4>analogous in its structure to the sermon</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the mountain.</v>

1674
01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.580
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to make a parallel between </v>
<v Speaker 4>those two things.</v>

1675
01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:26.880
<v Speaker 4>So basically what the sermon on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mount suggests is that you should </v>

1676
01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:31.620
<v Speaker 4>conceptualize the highest good that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're capable of conceptualizing and </v>

1677
01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:34.120
<v Speaker 4>orient yourself towards that and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>having done that,</v>

1678
01:34:34.121 --> 01:34:39.121
<v Speaker 4>you should live in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like you should live in the </v>

1679
01:34:39.121 --> 01:34:41.110
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't say that because that's often</v>

1680
01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:42.570
<v Speaker 4>Christ the Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1681
01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:47.610
<v Speaker 4>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hippies who have adopted that or </v>

1682
01:34:47.610 --> 01:34:47.610
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of,</v>

1683
01:34:47.610 --> 01:34:49.240
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that element of Christianity say,</v>

1684
01:34:49.241 --> 01:34:50.800
<v Speaker 4>well you live for the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1685
01:34:50.801 --> 01:34:51.430
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1686
01:34:51.431 --> 01:34:54.040
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in meditation and other practices,</v>

1687
01:34:54.041 --> 01:34:56.710
<v Speaker 4>some of the attempt is to get you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live in the moment,</v>

1688
01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:02.080
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to tell people to live in the </v>

1689
01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:02.080
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1690
01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:02.080
<v Speaker 4>what the hell kind of advice is that?</v>

1691
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:03.650
<v Speaker 4>What about the future?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1692
01:35:03.651 --> 01:35:08.651
<v Speaker 4>that it's not helpful advice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody comes to you and they're </v>

1693
01:35:08.651 --> 01:35:11.531
<v Speaker 4>suffering dreadfully because their </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother has Alzheimer's and they're </v>

1694
01:35:11.531 --> 01:35:11.531
<v Speaker 4>unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1695
01:35:11.531 --> 01:35:12.060
<v Speaker 4>live in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1696
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.890
<v Speaker 4>that's just not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because it's even worse than that.</v>

1697
01:35:15.891 --> 01:35:17.120
<v Speaker 4>It's judgmental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>

1698
01:35:17.121 --> 01:35:22.121
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only reason you're suffering is </v>

1699
01:35:22.121 --> 01:35:22.121
<v Speaker 4>because you haven't oriented yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Property live in the moment.</v>

1700
01:35:22.121 --> 01:35:22.400
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1701
01:35:22.401 --> 01:35:25.820
<v Speaker 4>you're suffering because your mother has</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's and you don't have a job,</v>

1702
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.460
<v Speaker 4>so like it's not because you aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>living in the moment,</v>

1703
01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:32.690
<v Speaker 4>so living in the moment isn't the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>answer.</v>

1704
01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 4>The right answer is something more like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Orient Yourself towards the highest good</v>

1705
01:35:37.641 --> 01:35:40.370
<v Speaker 4>that you can imagine and then act in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

1706
01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole different story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that's what happens in the Pinocchio</v>

1707
01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:48.400
<v Speaker 4>Story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically what happens is that Japan </v>

1708
01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:51.180
<v Speaker 4>sees the star that cutting in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>distance and he orients himself towards </v>

1709
01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:55.721
<v Speaker 4>the highest good he can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wants to take this creation of his </v>

1710
01:35:55.721 --> 01:35:59.340
<v Speaker 4>and so this is manifesting itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptually at multiple levels </v>

1711
01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:03.971
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously because there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a story about the destiny of </v>

1712
01:36:03.971 --> 01:36:05.900
<v Speaker 4>humanity in relationship to God nested </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the story.</v>

1713
01:36:05.901 --> 01:36:10.550
<v Speaker 4>It's like take your fallible creation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your puppet and</v>

1714
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:18.590
<v Speaker 4>set up the pre,</v>
<v Speaker 4>set up the conditions such that it's </v>

1715
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:20.120
<v Speaker 4>capable of taking on full functional </v>
<v Speaker 4>independence.</v>

1716
01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:21.950
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's what you do.</v>

1717
01:36:21.951 --> 01:36:23.330
<v Speaker 4>If you're a good parent with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>

1718
01:36:23.331 --> 01:36:25.940
<v Speaker 4>you don't protect them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't offer them safety,</v>

1719
01:36:26.210 --> 01:36:31.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do any of that except insofar as it's </v>

1720
01:36:31.210 --> 01:36:33.611
<v Speaker 4>necessary to facilitate their </v>
<v Speaker 4>development as fully competent and </v>

1721
01:36:35.481 --> 01:36:40.481
<v Speaker 4>courageous beings that the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the protection is only to allow that </v>

1722
01:36:40.481 --> 01:36:41.570
<v Speaker 4>developmental process to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to continue.</v>

1723
01:36:41.571 --> 01:36:46.571
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've Orient Japan himself and so the </v>

1724
01:36:46.571 --> 01:36:48.650
<v Speaker 4>father orients himself and then the sun </v>
<v Speaker 4>undertakes the voyage.</v>

1725
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:51.020
<v Speaker 4>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>

1726
01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:56.080
<v Speaker 4>so let's say that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Orient Yourself first,</v>

1727
01:36:56.710 --> 01:37:01.710
<v Speaker 4>then you can start to rely on your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you can start to concentrate more </v>

1728
01:37:01.710 --> 01:37:03.160
<v Speaker 4>on your orientation to the moment.</v>

1729
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1730
01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you another story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

1731
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.280
<v Speaker 4>I was just watching Harry Potter the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other day,</v>

1732
01:37:11.281 --> 01:37:16.281
<v Speaker 4>the first one and I was watching the </v>
<v Speaker 4>quidditch game and the quidditch game is</v>

1733
01:37:16.771 --> 01:37:19.980
<v Speaker 4>very interesting because there's a game </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a game going on at the same time.</v>

1734
01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:22.860
<v Speaker 4>So the game is just the standard </v>
<v Speaker 4>quidditch game.</v>

1735
01:37:22.861 --> 01:37:24.780
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like basketball played on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brooms,</v>

1736
01:37:24.781 --> 01:37:29.781
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to throw balls through hoops </v>

1737
01:37:29.781 --> 01:37:29.781
<v Speaker 4>and if you get enough points you win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time,</v>

1738
01:37:29.850 --> 01:37:33.150
<v Speaker 4>so there's the normal players and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two seekers,</v>

1739
01:37:33.151 --> 01:37:38.151
<v Speaker 4>one from each team and the seekers </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't playing the same game that the </v>

1740
01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.770
<v Speaker 4>game is nested inside the secret game </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

1741
01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:44.490
<v Speaker 4>because if you're a seeker and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>perform your task that everyone wins,</v>

1742
01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.590
<v Speaker 4>you win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But everyone wins.</v>

1743
01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:49.020
<v Speaker 4>And so you're not even playing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal game.</v>

1744
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.550
<v Speaker 4>You're playing the seeker game.</v>

1745
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:52.200
<v Speaker 4>And the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1746
01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.070
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1747
01:37:53.370 --> 01:37:57.000
<v Speaker 4>Harry Potter chases is this thing called</v>
<v Speaker 4>snitch and the snitch.</v>

1748
01:37:57.030 --> 01:38:02.030
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the things that I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the hell jk rowling </v>

1749
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:05.900
<v Speaker 4>figured this out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cannot figure it out because that </v>

1750
01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:05.900
<v Speaker 4>snitch is a winged ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1751
01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:10.430
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's actually a symbol of that wing </v>

1752
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:11.580
<v Speaker 4>ball called the round chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which [inaudible] describes in his works</v>

1753
01:38:11.581 --> 01:38:13.170
<v Speaker 4>on alchemy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his works on how it could be,</v>

1754
01:38:13.171 --> 01:38:14.370
<v Speaker 4>are really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really difficult.</v>

1755
01:38:14.371 --> 01:38:16.500
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy to figure out what he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about at all.</v>

1756
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:20.380
<v Speaker 4>But the round chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a wing ball is,</v>

1757
01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:25.440
<v Speaker 4>is it's a manifestation of the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mercury and mercury is an emissary of </v>

1758
01:38:26.041 --> 01:38:31.041
<v Speaker 4>the God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can think about mercury has the </v>

1759
01:38:31.041 --> 01:38:33.240
<v Speaker 4>unconscious manifesting itself in your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your field of experience,</v>

1760
01:38:33.241 --> 01:38:35.520
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In any case,</v>

1761
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:40.820
<v Speaker 4>the round chaos is the container of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>primordial material from which the world</v>

1762
01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:45.780
<v Speaker 4>is made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think about it like this.</v>

1763
01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:50.940
<v Speaker 4>It's this thing there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that.</v>

1764
01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:55.800
<v Speaker 4>So when you encounter an normally an </v>
<v Speaker 4>error,</v>

1765
01:38:57.150 --> 01:39:00.030
<v Speaker 4>it's a container that's a way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptualizing it.</v>

1766
01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:02.190
<v Speaker 4>And what does it contain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1767
01:39:02.191 --> 01:39:05.370
<v Speaker 4>it contains in some sense it contains </v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole world.</v>

1768
01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:07.020
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's an example.</v>

1769
01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Like look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1770
01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say that you've had repeated </v>

1771
01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:17.190
<v Speaker 4>fights with your wife about how domestic</v>
<v Speaker 4>duties are going to be arranged among,</v>

1772
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.860
<v Speaker 4>around meal time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you believe me,</v>

1773
01:39:19.861 --> 01:39:24.861
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have those fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so and so what's happening is that </v>

1774
01:39:24.861 --> 01:39:28.950
<v Speaker 4>mealtimes are unpleasant because there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a war for power going on in the kitchen,</v>

1775
01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:34.700
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you think one day while </v>

1776
01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.941
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna you're gonna note that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're going to do an archaeological</v>

1777
01:39:39.531 --> 01:39:41.990
<v Speaker 4>investigation and find out just what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell is going on.</v>

1778
01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:48.160
<v Speaker 4>And so you start unpacking the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>mealtimes are not pleasant.</v>

1779
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:52.990
<v Speaker 4>And so what's in that little thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're unpacking that package?</v>

1780
01:39:52.991 --> 01:39:53.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1781
01:39:54.730 --> 01:39:58.720
<v Speaker 4>the entire power dynamic between men and</v>
<v Speaker 4>women in the modern world is inside that</v>

1782
01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:04.140
<v Speaker 4>dispute and you might find that part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason that your wife is upset about</v>

1783
01:40:04.721 --> 01:40:09.721
<v Speaker 4>the way that mealtimes are arranged </v>
<v Speaker 4>because because her grand mother was </v>

1784
01:40:09.821 --> 01:40:14.821
<v Speaker 4>beat by her grandfather and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing a role in it played a role in </v>

1785
01:40:15.821 --> 01:40:20.821
<v Speaker 4>determining her unconscious expectations</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's pathologizing one of the day </v>

1786
01:40:20.821 --> 01:40:23.770
<v Speaker 4>to day rituals in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're going to unpack that,</v>

1787
01:40:23.771 --> 01:40:26.430
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to unpack all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that into the.</v>

1788
01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:29.350
<v Speaker 4>You take a little monster new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>decompose it.</v>

1789
01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:34.370
<v Speaker 4>You find out it's a hydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got 50 heads and then you have to work </v>

1790
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:35.200
<v Speaker 4>through every single one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

1791
01:40:35.201 --> 01:40:38.920
<v Speaker 4>really difficult and so it's a container</v>
<v Speaker 4>that contains everything,</v>

1792
01:40:38.921 --> 01:40:40.990
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is if you want packet </v>
<v Speaker 4>successfully,</v>

1793
01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:42.820
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you deal with it,</v>

1794
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:46.270
<v Speaker 4>you negotiate a consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden you get,</v>

1795
01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:48.100
<v Speaker 4>you get paced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say around your meal times,</v>

1796
01:40:48.101 --> 01:40:53.101
<v Speaker 4>which is a major accomplishment man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you have to eat three times a </v>

1797
01:40:53.101 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 4>day and it's the center,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the household and all of that.</v>

1798
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:59.220
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is is that often when </v>

1799
01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:03.811
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in the context of a of an </v>

1800
01:41:03.811 --> 01:41:06.151
<v Speaker 4>intimate relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things will emerge that produced </v>

1801
01:41:06.151 --> 01:41:09.080
<v Speaker 4>discontinuities and the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what should your attitude towards that </v>

1802
01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:12.391
<v Speaker 4>discontinuity be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>While you can punish the person for </v>

1803
01:41:12.391 --> 01:41:13.750
<v Speaker 4>manifesting the discontinuity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the tyrannical aspect,</v>

1804
01:41:13.751 --> 01:41:17.170
<v Speaker 4>or you can let it take the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>apart and that will happen.</v>

1805
01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:22.171
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's often how relationships </v>
<v Speaker 4>and is that a discontinuity emerges and </v>

1806
01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.900
<v Speaker 4>people get into it and things go </v>
<v Speaker 4>sideways so badly.</v>

1807
01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:29.680
<v Speaker 4>The whole relationship descends into </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos and people bail out of it.</v>

1808
01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:35.640
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's no wonder that people want to </v>

1809
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.000
<v Speaker 4>ignore it and it's also no wonder that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to tyrannized it.</v>

1810
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:38.920
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quit bothering me with that.</v>

1811
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

1812
01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:44.900
<v Speaker 4>possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but probably not.</v>

1813
01:41:44.901 --> 01:41:48.770
<v Speaker 4>And also if my attitude towards you is </v>
<v Speaker 4>quit bothering me with that,</v>

1814
01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:52.610
<v Speaker 4>your attitude towards me when I have the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same sort of problem in reverse,</v>

1815
01:41:52.611 --> 01:41:56.270
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be exactly the same and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to get anywhere with it.</v>

1816
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:58.350
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

1817
01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:04.030
<v Speaker 4>But that still is painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now let's go back to the quidditch </v>

1818
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:06.020
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1819
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:07.190
<v Speaker 4>here's what happens is that</v>

1820
01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:12.320
<v Speaker 4>Harry Potter is picked to be the seeker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So with that being,</v>

1821
01:42:12.321 --> 01:42:16.120
<v Speaker 4>t is the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever he represents is the seeker and</v>

1822
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:21.510
<v Speaker 4>he's an interesting character because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's touched by evil and he's a rule </v>

1823
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:23.350
<v Speaker 4>breaker and he's also kind of a normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

1824
01:42:23.351 --> 01:42:25.120
<v Speaker 4>He's not a hyper intellect or anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1825
01:42:25.121 --> 01:42:26.140
<v Speaker 4>That's her mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These role,</v>

1826
01:42:26.141 --> 01:42:27.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So He's,</v>

1827
01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:28.840
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's normal but,</v>

1828
01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.320
<v Speaker 4>but super normal at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he gets picked to be the seeker and,</v>

1829
01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:37.630
<v Speaker 4>and then you think about what is it he </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeks and he seeks this thing that </v>

1830
01:42:37.630 --> 01:42:37.630
<v Speaker 4>glimmers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1831
01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.380
<v Speaker 4>It flashes in front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's made out of gold and it has wings.</v>

1832
01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:45.100
<v Speaker 4>And if he grabs it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then he wins.</v>

1833
01:42:45.610 --> 01:42:48.280
<v Speaker 4>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that represent?</v>

1834
01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:53.820
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting that when people watch </v>

1835
01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:53.820
<v Speaker 4>that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually find that,</v>

1836
01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:53.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think that that's kind of cool,</v>

1837
01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:54.130
<v Speaker 4>that it's a cool game.</v>

1838
01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is a cool game.</v>

1839
01:42:57.010 --> 01:42:59.200
<v Speaker 4>She laid it out very nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is that,</v>

1840
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.120
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a game and if you play it,</v>

1841
01:43:01.121 --> 01:43:04.360
<v Speaker 4>normally you win the game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in that game is a metagame.</v>

1842
01:43:04.361 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 4>And if you play that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then not only do you win,</v>

1843
01:43:06.401 --> 01:43:11.401
<v Speaker 4>but everybody wins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then the next rule is the metagame </v>

1844
01:43:11.401 --> 01:43:14.701
<v Speaker 4>supersedes the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the same idea that I'm </v>

1845
01:43:14.701 --> 01:43:16.630
<v Speaker 4>chasing here with you today about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>metta morality.</v>

1846
01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:21.720
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the morality that emerges as a </v>

1847
01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:22.210
<v Speaker 4>consequence of the analysis of a set of </v>
<v Speaker 4>moralities or it's the morality.</v>

1848
01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.740
<v Speaker 4>It's the morality to which other all </v>
<v Speaker 4>other morality's should be subjugated.</v>

1849
01:43:26.741 --> 01:43:29.560
<v Speaker 4>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1850
01:43:29.561 --> 01:43:31.250
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a terrible thing because it,</v>

1851
01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:36.540
<v Speaker 4>it involves painful sacrifice or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>it involves confronting the thing you </v>

1852
01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:37.300
<v Speaker 4>least want to confront.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the union dictum,</v>

1853
01:43:37.301 --> 01:43:37.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1854
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:39.940
<v Speaker 4>If your life isn't all that it should </v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

1855
01:43:39.941 --> 01:43:43.420
<v Speaker 4>then you should find out the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you least want to confront,</v>

1856
01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:46.390
<v Speaker 4>that you're avoiding and confront that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's easy to say,</v>

1857
01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.720
<v Speaker 4>but it's a terrible thing because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>means you're going to have to turn your </v>

1858
01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:54.230
<v Speaker 4>gaze to the place where you are weakest </v>
<v Speaker 4>and most vulnerable and that is asking a</v>

1859
01:43:54.231 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 4>lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you might say,</v>

1860
01:43:57.021 --> 01:43:58.340
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there an alternative?</v>

1861
01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:01.810
<v Speaker 4>And I think there is an alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1862
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:03.290
<v Speaker 4>So this is the anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1863
01:44:03.291 --> 01:44:04.880
<v Speaker 4>This is the ball that contains </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1864
01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:08.360
<v Speaker 4>I think there is an alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's associated with this idea.</v>

1865
01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:09.980
<v Speaker 4>So imagine,</v>

1866
01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.020
<v Speaker 4>imagine we have a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could have a conflict.</v>

1867
01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:20.110
<v Speaker 4>If we were in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can have a conflict that would blow </v>

1868
01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:20.110
<v Speaker 4>the relationship apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1869
01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:24.431
<v Speaker 4>so we don't want to have that conflict </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then we could have no conflict </v>

1870
01:44:24.431 --> 01:44:28.211
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means that you would never get to </v>

1871
01:44:28.211 --> 01:44:30.641
<v Speaker 4>say what you wanted and I would never </v>
<v Speaker 4>get to say what I wanted because we're </v>

1872
01:44:30.641 --> 01:44:34.481
<v Speaker 4>either identical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just not happening or we're </v>

1873
01:44:34.481 --> 01:44:37.751
<v Speaker 4>going to have conflict because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to want some things that I don't </v>

1874
01:44:37.751 --> 01:44:38.360
<v Speaker 4>want and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if there's no conflict,</v>

1875
01:44:38.361 --> 01:44:40.520
<v Speaker 4>we are not in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1876
01:44:40.521 --> 01:44:45.521
<v Speaker 4>So zero conflict is the wrong amount and</v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict that destroys the relationship </v>

1877
01:44:45.521 --> 01:44:47.450
<v Speaker 4>is the wrong amount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you might say,</v>

1878
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:49.400
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1879
01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:51.920
<v Speaker 4>what's the optimal amount of conflict?</v>

1880
01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:53.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1881
01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:58.980
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then we can think about how people </v>

1882
01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:01.321
<v Speaker 4>respond emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say if you go after the person </v>

1883
01:45:01.321 --> 01:45:05.041
<v Speaker 4>that you're arguing with and you say </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a bad person and you really make </v>

1884
01:45:05.041 --> 01:45:05.860
<v Speaker 4>that case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you bloody well hammered home.</v>

1885
01:45:05.861 --> 01:45:09.490
<v Speaker 4>You remember 50 things they've done that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were bad and you lay them out like,</v>

1886
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:11.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to stomp you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a bad person.</v>

1887
01:45:11.651 --> 01:45:13.240
<v Speaker 4>You really need to change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1888
01:45:13.241 --> 01:45:18.241
<v Speaker 4>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to meet tremendous </v>

1889
01:45:18.241 --> 01:45:18.241
<v Speaker 4>resistance and that's like you've got </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hydrogen.</v>

1890
01:45:18.241 --> 01:45:19.360
<v Speaker 4>You're bringing the hydrogen bomb to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>

1891
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:24.750
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe unless you want to destroy </v>

1892
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:26.851
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's not the most logical </v>

1893
01:45:26.851 --> 01:45:26.851
<v Speaker 4>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then by the same token,</v>

1894
01:45:26.851 --> 01:45:28.990
<v Speaker 4>everything's all right and we never have</v>
<v Speaker 4>any conflict.</v>

1895
01:45:28.991 --> 01:45:33.991
<v Speaker 4>That's not helpful either and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get bored of that and you're </v>

1896
01:45:33.991 --> 01:45:34.480
<v Speaker 4>not going to develop and so then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>question is,</v>

1897
01:45:34.481 --> 01:45:37.000
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe there's some happy medium here.</v>

1898
01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:40.930
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you want to be repairing this </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure.</v>

1899
01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:46.140
<v Speaker 4>You know the structure that goes from </v>
<v Speaker 4>micro actions up to higher order </v>

1900
01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:49.591
<v Speaker 4>conceptualizations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you want to be updating that on a </v>

1901
01:45:49.591 --> 01:45:52.561
<v Speaker 4>constant basis and you want to update it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a manner that doesn't drop you into </v>

1902
01:45:53.111 --> 01:45:57.280
<v Speaker 4>chaos or place you in too much status </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the answer is,</v>

1903
01:45:57.281 --> 01:45:57.700
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how?</v>

1904
01:45:57.790 --> 01:46:02.790
<v Speaker 4>Then the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the question is how is it that you </v>

1905
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:05.731
<v Speaker 4>can calibrate your approach to error so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you get the benefits of doing it </v>

1906
01:46:05.861 --> 01:46:10.350
<v Speaker 4>without the disadvantage of collapsing </v>
<v Speaker 4>into chaos and then the issue.</v>

1907
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:15.390
<v Speaker 4>The answer to that is something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something like once you have </v>

1908
01:46:20.141 --> 01:46:25.141
<v Speaker 4>decided to adopt responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 4>being and will say that what that means </v>

1909
01:46:26.171 --> 01:46:31.171
<v Speaker 4>is that you have conceptualized a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good that you're willing to devote </v>

1910
01:46:33.311 --> 01:46:38.311
<v Speaker 4>yourself to and I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're perfectly welcome to do that on </v>

1911
01:46:38.311 --> 01:46:41.821
<v Speaker 4>an individual basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should do it on an </v>

1912
01:46:41.821 --> 01:46:44.401
<v Speaker 4>individual basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should consult with your ancestors </v>

1913
01:46:44.401 --> 01:46:45.910
<v Speaker 4>while you're doing that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>generally speaking,</v>

1914
01:46:46.630 --> 01:46:51.630
<v Speaker 4>the route to optimal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the route to to quality of life and </v>

1915
01:46:52.531 --> 01:46:56.090
<v Speaker 4>productivity has been laid out by other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1916
01:46:56.130 --> 01:46:58.130
<v Speaker 4>We we kind of know what the parameters </v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

1917
01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:02.440
<v Speaker 4>You need to do something that other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people find is useful and and,</v>

1918
01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:05.090
<v Speaker 4>and you have to regard it as useful as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1919
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:09.310
<v Speaker 4>or at least you have to be entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There has to be something about you have</v>

1920
01:47:09.311 --> 01:47:12.590
<v Speaker 4>value to other people that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pursue with a fair bit of diligence,</v>

1921
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:17.030
<v Speaker 4>so you have to play a productive social </v>
<v Speaker 4>role.</v>

1922
01:47:18.850 --> 01:47:19.990
<v Speaker 4>Probably need friends,</v>

1923
01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.520
<v Speaker 4>probably need an intimate relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if it could be medium to long term </v>

1924
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:28.570
<v Speaker 4>infant intimate relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps all the better.</v>

1925
01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.350
<v Speaker 4>That's what most societies hold up as </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideal could assume.</v>

1926
01:47:32.351 --> 01:47:33.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's probably a reason for that.</v>

1927
01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:39.120
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the reasons is is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>your life gets fragmented otherwise </v>

1928
01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.181
<v Speaker 4>badly fragmented because every time you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a longterm relationship and and it </v>

1929
01:47:42.491 --> 01:47:47.491
<v Speaker 4>fragments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like your identity is blown into </v>

1930
01:47:47.491 --> 01:47:47.491
<v Speaker 4>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get fragmented across time.</v>

1931
01:47:47.491 --> 01:47:48.220
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

1932
01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:53.340
<v Speaker 4>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It breaks you into pieces and you don't </v>

1933
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:56.641
<v Speaker 4>necessarily recovered that well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes everything much more </v>

1934
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.150
<v Speaker 4>impermanent and unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of those things,</v>

1935
01:48:01.151 --> 01:48:06.151
<v Speaker 4>so it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It introduces a tremendous amount of </v>

1936
01:48:06.151 --> 01:48:08.851
<v Speaker 4>uncertainty into your life and it also </v>
<v Speaker 4>means that you don't have anyone around </v>

1937
01:48:08.851 --> 01:48:11.701
<v Speaker 4>that you can really trust and that's bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you have someone around you </v>

1938
01:48:11.701 --> 01:48:14.701
<v Speaker 4>can really trust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have two brains instead of one </v>

1939
01:48:14.701 --> 01:48:15.460
<v Speaker 4>and like you probably need two brains to</v>
<v Speaker 4>to manage your way through life.</v>

1940
01:48:15.461 --> 01:48:16.510
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty complicated,</v>

1941
01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:21.590
<v Speaker 4>so you orient yourself towards some </v>
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>

1942
01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:27.580
<v Speaker 4>highest good that you can conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it has to be through a consultation </v>

1943
01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:32.341
<v Speaker 4>with your ancestors because you need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do the things that people have always </v>

1944
01:48:32.341 --> 01:48:35.761
<v Speaker 4>done it and you need to do them properly</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you need to assume that that's the </v>

1945
01:48:35.761 --> 01:48:39.991
<v Speaker 4>way that you should live unless you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very good reason to change it </v>

1946
01:48:39.991 --> 01:48:43.411
<v Speaker 4>dramatically and maybe you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to start with some axiomatic</v>

1947
01:48:43.511 --> 01:48:48.511
<v Speaker 4>set of presuppositions because otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to invent everything on your </v>

1948
01:48:48.511 --> 01:48:48.520
<v Speaker 4>own and you don't have enough time to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1949
01:48:48.521 --> 01:48:52.270
<v Speaker 4>So you have to use normative guidelines </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't,</v>

1950
01:48:52.271 --> 01:48:53.710
<v Speaker 4>then people won't know what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1951
01:48:53.711 --> 01:48:57.040
<v Speaker 4>That's another big problem is if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>live completely outside the norm.</v>

1952
01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:58.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1953
01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:01.750
<v Speaker 4>remarkable artists manage that to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree,</v>

1954
01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:04.900
<v Speaker 4>but of course they pay for the privilege</v>
<v Speaker 4>by being remarkable artists.</v>

1955
01:49:04.901 --> 01:49:07.480
<v Speaker 4>So if there's something truly remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 4>about you,</v>

1956
01:49:07.481 --> 01:49:10.660
<v Speaker 4>perhaps you could justify deviating from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the normative path.</v>

1957
01:49:10.661 --> 01:49:13.660
<v Speaker 4>But if there isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1958
01:49:13.661 --> 01:49:18.661
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing remarkable enough about </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to justify deviating in every way </v>

1959
01:49:18.661 --> 01:49:20.700
<v Speaker 4>from the normative path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter how remarkable or so,</v>

1960
01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:25.080
<v Speaker 4>so that's part of the rescuing of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>father from the,</v>

1961
01:49:25.530 --> 01:49:29.880
<v Speaker 4>from the depths is to to reunite </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself with the traditional structures</v>

1962
01:49:29.881 --> 01:49:34.881
<v Speaker 4>of your community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that in a way that you feel </v>

1963
01:49:34.881 --> 01:49:38.600
<v Speaker 4>suits your needs best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think you can not do it </v>

1964
01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.710
<v Speaker 4>because it makes you weak and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll drown.</v>

1965
01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:47.640
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's say you have oriented yourself </v>

1966
01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 4>but not perfectly because you're full</v>

1967
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.370
<v Speaker 1>of mistakes and errors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what do you do?</v>

1968
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to fix those errors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still have to be oriented.</v>

1969
01:49:57.370 --> 01:50:02.370
<v Speaker 4>This is why I started getting interested</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get interested in the phenomenon of </v>

1970
01:50:02.370 --> 01:50:05.511
<v Speaker 4>meaning as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a phenomenological experience to </v>

1971
01:50:05.511 --> 01:50:08.070
<v Speaker 4>experience something as meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not exactly obvious what that means</v>

1972
01:50:08.130 --> 01:50:10.830
<v Speaker 4>to experience something as meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that you can.</v>

1973
01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.440
<v Speaker 4>You can approach it obliquely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1974
01:50:13.441 --> 01:50:18.441
<v Speaker 4>like if I said watch yourself for two </v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks and notice when you're doing </v>

1975
01:50:18.441 --> 01:50:19.470
<v Speaker 4>something that you regard as meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could say,</v>

1976
01:50:19.471 --> 01:50:20.310
<v Speaker 4>well here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's some,</v>

1977
01:50:20.610 --> 01:50:24.270
<v Speaker 4>here's some markers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You lose a sense of time.</v>

1978
01:50:24.271 --> 01:50:26.820
<v Speaker 4>You lose a sense of vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're deeply engaged in it.</v>

1979
01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.940
<v Speaker 4>It seems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems worth the effort,</v>

1980
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You forget yourself while you're doing </v>

1981
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.951
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you forget your existential </v>

1982
01:50:36.951 --> 01:50:39.591
<v Speaker 4>concerns while you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not ruminating or obsessing about</v>

1983
01:50:39.961 --> 01:50:41.910
<v Speaker 4>the meaning of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1984
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:43.170
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's markers for,</v>

1985
01:50:43.171 --> 01:50:45.930
<v Speaker 4>it's like the flow states that chicks at</v>
<v Speaker 4>my highly described,</v>

1986
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:47.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1987
01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:55.160
<v Speaker 4>and then you can experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You experienced it under a certain sort </v>

1988
01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:58.191
<v Speaker 4>of ritualistic conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might experience it when you go see </v>

1989
01:50:58.191 --> 01:51:00.801
<v Speaker 4>a great movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might experience it when you listen </v>

1990
01:51:00.801 --> 01:51:00.801
<v Speaker 4>to music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think music is a very,</v>

1991
01:51:00.801 --> 01:51:04.731
<v Speaker 4>very standard pathway for people to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of experience because </v>

1992
01:51:04.731 --> 01:51:09.000
<v Speaker 4>virtually everyone gets intimations of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mute of meaning from music.</v>

1993
01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:14.330
<v Speaker 4>And I think music music is </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchically structured patterns that </v>

1994
01:51:14.911 --> 01:51:18.510
<v Speaker 4>are representative of being laying </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself out properly.</v>

1995
01:51:18.511 --> 01:51:23.511
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's an abstract representation of </v>

1996
01:51:23.511 --> 01:51:26.331
<v Speaker 4>proper being and so we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can grapple with the phenomena of </v>

1997
01:51:26.581 --> 01:51:28.980
<v Speaker 4>music and we can we can bark or </v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomena of meaning.</v>

1998
01:51:28.981 --> 01:51:31.380
<v Speaker 4>We can box it in a little bit and start </v>
<v Speaker 4>to conceptualize it.</v>

1999
01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:33.900
<v Speaker 1>W</v>

2000
01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:39.140
<v Speaker 4>we can start to conceptualize it perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the manifestation of a deep instinct </v>

2001
01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:43.850
<v Speaker 4>and so I would say well meaning is what </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifests itself when you are,</v>

2002
01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:52.130
<v Speaker 4>when you've oriented yourself properly </v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you've optimized the flow of </v>

2003
01:51:54.690 --> 01:51:59.220
<v Speaker 4>information between you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>between you and chaos.</v>

2004
01:51:59.250 --> 01:52:02.610
<v Speaker 4>That might be the right way to thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it because you think about a piece</v>

2005
01:52:02.611 --> 01:52:04.230
<v Speaker 4>of music because you want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>predictable,</v>

2006
01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:06.930
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want it to be perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 4>predictable.</v>

2007
01:52:06.931 --> 01:52:11.931
<v Speaker 4>You want it to be predictable with some </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting variations and predictable </v>

2008
01:52:11.931 --> 01:52:15.651
<v Speaker 4>with some variations that make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe you can conceptualize that as </v>

2009
01:52:15.651 --> 01:52:18.531
<v Speaker 4>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's predictable that this </v>

2010
01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:19.940
<v Speaker 4>order of of stability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

2011
01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:25.020
<v Speaker 4>It's varying down here from time to time</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you've got stable stability </v>

2012
01:52:25.021 --> 01:52:27.420
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but variability there and you can handle</v>

2013
01:52:27.421 --> 01:52:28.890
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you want</v>

2014
01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:35.460
<v Speaker 4>an overarching structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stability with some internal </v>

2015
01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:36.100
<v Speaker 4>variability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe that's the way that you update</v>

2016
01:52:36.101 --> 01:52:41.101
<v Speaker 4>yourself without falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I would say you can find the </v>

2017
01:52:41.101 --> 01:52:45.061
<v Speaker 4>pathway to the optimal rate of update by</v>
<v Speaker 4>relying on your sense of meaning.</v>

2018
01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it tells you is that you're.</v>

2019
01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:55.420
<v Speaker 4>You're wandering your way through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world between the catastrophes of chaos </v>

2020
01:52:55.891 --> 01:53:00.230
<v Speaker 4>in the catastrophes of order and now and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you swing into the proper locale.</v>

2021
01:53:00.630 --> 01:53:05.630
<v Speaker 4>You're where you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is you get engaged by </v>

2022
01:53:05.630 --> 01:53:06.440
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get meaningfully engaged by that and</v>

2023
01:53:06.441 --> 01:53:07.970
<v Speaker 4>it's fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll move on you,</v>

2024
01:53:07.971 --> 01:53:12.971
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's very difficult to exist at </v>

2025
01:53:12.971 --> 01:53:14.120
<v Speaker 4>that point constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your bad habits,</v>

2026
01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:16.010
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your situation,</v>

2027
01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:18.110
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to interfere with that,</v>

2028
01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:21.410
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you should be.</v>

2029
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.030
<v Speaker 4>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2030
01:53:23.031 --> 01:53:25.760
<v Speaker 4>that's where you should strive to be all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

2031
01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:27.680
<v Speaker 4>And then the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2032
01:53:27.681 --> 01:53:30.410
<v Speaker 4>what would it be like if you were there </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time?</v>

2033
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:35.600
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's where intimations of </v>
<v Speaker 4>paradise come from,</v>

2034
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:41.390
<v Speaker 4>being when words think of it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>wordsworth talked about intimations of </v>

2035
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:44.591
<v Speaker 4>immortality and childhood people tend to</v>
<v Speaker 4>romanticize their childhood because of </v>

2036
01:53:44.591 --> 01:53:47.810
<v Speaker 4>the sense of intense engagement that </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes along with being a child.</v>

2037
01:53:47.811 --> 01:53:50.060
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of the wonderful things </v>
<v Speaker 4>about being around children.</v>

2038
01:53:50.061 --> 01:53:50.660
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2039
01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:54.440
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's why they pay you for their care.</v>

2040
01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:59.980
<v Speaker 4>And the way that children pay you for </v>
<v Speaker 4>their care is that they turn normal </v>

2041
01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:04.121
<v Speaker 4>things into magic again when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>around them because you've seen it 100 </v>

2042
01:54:04.121 --> 01:54:05.660
<v Speaker 4>times before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you see it,</v>

2043
01:54:05.661 --> 01:54:08.060
<v Speaker 4>you don't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see what you already know.</v>

2044
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:11.210
<v Speaker 4>But when a child sees it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't because they don't know,</v>

2045
01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:11.960
<v Speaker 4>they see it.</v>

2046
01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:14.840
<v Speaker 4>And then when you watch them see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see it too.</v>

2047
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:19.990
<v Speaker 4>And so it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's tremendous fun leading a small </v>

2048
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:22.160
<v Speaker 4>child around to do things that you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>done before because they're so,</v>

2049
01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:23.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like this,</v>

2050
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:28.750
<v Speaker 4>they're like all the time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's too much and they cry and </v>

2051
01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:29.900
<v Speaker 4>they get upset and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a good part of the time,</v>

2052
01:54:29.901 --> 01:54:33.560
<v Speaker 4>it's just wild eyed wonder and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can see the world through their eyes and</v>

2053
01:54:33.561 --> 01:54:38.561
<v Speaker 4>it's payment and so that's that sense of</v>
<v Speaker 4>being engaged like that is something </v>

2054
01:54:38.561 --> 01:54:41.000
<v Speaker 4>that people love about children and and </v>
<v Speaker 4>rightly so,</v>

2055
01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.720
<v Speaker 4>but it's also a marker to the proper way</v>
<v Speaker 4>of being.</v>

2056
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:46.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there there's a dictum in the.</v>

2057
01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:52.620
<v Speaker 4>This is a union idea that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between the archetype of the </v>

2058
01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:52.760
<v Speaker 4>wise old man in the archetype of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>child.</v>

2059
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:58.000
<v Speaker 4>They're the same thing because the wise </v>
<v Speaker 4>old man is the person who found what he </v>

2060
01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.750
<v Speaker 4>had in childhood but lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2061
01:54:59.751 --> 01:55:04.751
<v Speaker 4>It's a very powerful moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Teeth is that the purpose of maturation </v>

2062
01:55:04.751 --> 01:55:07.150
<v Speaker 4>is to return to the state of childhood </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a mature b.</v>

2063
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:10.070
<v Speaker 4>not to stay in the state of childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Peter Pan,</v>

2064
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:15.550
<v Speaker 4>but to make the sacrifices necessary for</v>
<v Speaker 4>maturation and then return so well.</v>

2065
01:55:16.761 --> 01:55:17.840
<v Speaker 4>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2066
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:22.870
<v Speaker 4>you do that in part by noting what it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's meaningful for you to engage in.</v>

2067
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:25.550
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's your nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 4>reporting to you,</v>

2068
01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:28.130
<v Speaker 4>right hemisphere and left hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 4>balanced.</v>

2069
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:33.470
<v Speaker 4>The balance between chaos and order </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces an output that says you are in </v>

2070
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:34.310
<v Speaker 4>the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a perception.</v>

2071
01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:37.430
<v Speaker 4>The meaning is a perception of being in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right place.</v>

2072
01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:39.620
<v Speaker 4>It's the genuine thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

2073
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:45.310
<v Speaker 4>because it can be pathologized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing and that's why I think </v>

2074
01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:47.340
<v Speaker 4>there is a call to virtue in most great </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious traditions.</v>

2075
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:50.520
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to rely on your sense of</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning to Orient you,</v>

2076
01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:56.060
<v Speaker 4>you have to play a straight game because</v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise you warp and twist the inputs </v>

2077
01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:58.650
<v Speaker 4>and then the mechanism won't function </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>

2078
01:55:59.070 --> 01:56:00.120
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you.</v>

2079
01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:01.380
<v Speaker 4>If you were only.</v>

2080
01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:07.860
<v Speaker 4>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you blinded yourself to half the </v>

2081
01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:10.261
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't use your perception story at </v>

2082
01:56:10.261 --> 01:56:10.750
<v Speaker 4>yourself properly because the half of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world that you ignoring is gonna pop</v>

2083
01:56:10.751 --> 01:56:13.060
<v Speaker 4>up at you unexpectedly and take you </v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

2084
01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:16.930
<v Speaker 4>and so if your relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world isn't pristine,</v>

2085
01:56:17.150 --> 01:56:18.700
<v Speaker 4>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>primarily,</v>

2086
01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:22.840
<v Speaker 4>then you can't rely on your own internal</v>
<v Speaker 4>orienting mechanisms and then you either</v>

2087
01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:27.900
<v Speaker 4>fall into chaos which is an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe or you have to rely on some </v>

2088
01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:31.561
<v Speaker 4>kind of external authority and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you prone to possession by </v>

2089
01:56:31.561 --> 01:56:32.650
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical etiologies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

2090
01:56:32.651 --> 01:56:37.651
<v Speaker 4>which give you that sense of meaning </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you showed in fact have as a </v>

2091
01:56:37.651 --> 01:56:37.651
<v Speaker 4>consequence of your own action.</v>

2092
01:56:39.490 --> 01:56:43.670
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the question as best as I can,</v>

2093
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:47.890
<v Speaker 5>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if,</v>

2094
01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:53.780
<v Speaker 5>if all relationships are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are sort of predicated on this balance </v>

2095
01:56:57.941 --> 01:57:02.941
<v Speaker 5>between no conflict and conflict that </v>
<v Speaker 5>destructs um,</v>

2096
01:57:04.510 --> 01:57:09.510
<v Speaker 5>then if we were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we were to look at this at a more </v>

2097
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:12.421
<v Speaker 5>macro level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we see this sort of manifest in,</v>

2098
01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:19.220
<v Speaker 5>in history in our world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like with conflict in between countries </v>

2099
01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:19.720
<v Speaker 5>in between systems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideology,</v>

2100
01:57:19.730 --> 01:57:24.730
<v Speaker 5>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what if this sort of navigation </v>

2101
01:57:24.730 --> 01:57:29.260
<v Speaker 5>between the exact line of no conflict </v>
<v Speaker 5>versus conflict,</v>

2102
01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:34.360
<v Speaker 5>how does that not imply that some people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are inherently doomed to chaos?</v>

2103
01:57:35.170 --> 01:57:37.540
<v Speaker 4>It might imply that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2104
01:57:37.541 --> 01:57:38.860
<v Speaker 4>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so look,</v>

2105
01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:42.810
<v Speaker 4>so sometimes,</v>

2106
01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:44.800
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2107
01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.450
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you don't have an answer that </v>
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>

2108
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:51.860
<v Speaker 4>You've announced that produces the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highest proBability of success.</v>

2109
01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:57.580
<v Speaker 4>And like I could view the archetype of </v>
<v Speaker 4>world from a religious perspective and </v>

2110
01:57:57.580 --> 01:58:01.280
<v Speaker 4>say that there's such a thing as </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate and final redemption.</v>

2111
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:02.970
<v Speaker 4>That's a metaphysical claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2112
01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:08.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's independent of what I'm </v>

2113
01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:10.241
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is that there's an </v>

2114
01:58:10.241 --> 01:58:13.121
<v Speaker 4>archetypal path that's laid out in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the mythology of the hero and it's </v>

2115
01:58:13.121 --> 01:58:13.880
<v Speaker 4>your best bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>

2116
01:58:14.210 --> 01:58:19.210
<v Speaker 4>It's your best bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that if you apply it </v>

2117
01:58:19.210 --> 01:58:21.770
<v Speaker 4>that everything is going to turn out the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way you might want it to turn out,</v>

2118
01:58:21.771 --> 01:58:23.330
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would say this,</v>

2119
01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:28.480
<v Speaker 4>there is a way of of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an interesting twist on that to </v>

2120
01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:32.200
<v Speaker 4>mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I came to </v>

2121
01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:33.641
<v Speaker 4>understand about trying to speak the </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth is that you can make an </v>

2122
01:58:33.841 --> 01:58:38.841
<v Speaker 4>assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can make a fundamental assumption </v>

2123
01:58:38.841 --> 01:58:41.960
<v Speaker 4>based on your ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say I'm the ineradicable quality </v>

2124
01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:44.710
<v Speaker 4>of your ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can't compute the best possible</v>

2125
01:58:44.711 --> 01:58:49.711
<v Speaker 4>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you can do instead is make a </v>

2126
01:58:49.711 --> 01:58:49.711
<v Speaker 4>decision and one decision is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2127
01:58:49.711 --> 01:58:50.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say what I think and see </v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens,</v>

2128
01:58:52.190 --> 01:58:54.750
<v Speaker 4>and then you can define that as the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible outcome.</v>

2129
01:58:55.370 --> 01:59:00.370
<v Speaker 4>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well now and then that's going to lead </v>

2130
01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:00.370
<v Speaker 4>you into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2131
01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:00.370
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

2132
01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:00.950
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange.</v>

2133
01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:05.760
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange inversion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but regardless of all that,</v>

2134
01:59:05.761 --> 01:59:10.380
<v Speaker 4>I would still say human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 4>finite and limited in mortal,</v>

2135
01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:12.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and and death is final,</v>

2136
01:59:12.630 --> 01:59:14.700
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that,</v>

2137
01:59:14.701 --> 01:59:17.580
<v Speaker 4>but we could easily say that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

2138
01:59:17.610 --> 01:59:21.360
<v Speaker 4>This is still the best pathway forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't certainty.</v>

2139
01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:22.260
<v Speaker 4>There's no certainty</v>

2140
01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:28.840
<v Speaker 4>and it's very frequently in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have poison oak or poison be like </v>

2141
01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:32.231
<v Speaker 4>you get to pick your poison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to pick the elixir of </v>

2142
01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:32.231
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would,</v>

2143
01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:36.970
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would also say I don't think there's </v>

2144
01:59:36.970 --> 01:59:38.831
<v Speaker 4>any reason to be particularly </v>
<v Speaker 4>pessimistic because we don't know what </v>

2145
01:59:38.831 --> 01:59:40.070
<v Speaker 4>would happen if people really tried hard</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get their acts together.</v>

2146
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:43.820
<v Speaker 4>Like if they understood the necessity of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and really put it forward.</v>

2147
01:59:43.821 --> 01:59:45.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2148
01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:50.320
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had lots of experience with my </v>

2149
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:51.971
<v Speaker 4>clinical clients now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen dozens and dozens of people </v>

2150
01:59:51.971 --> 01:59:55.360
<v Speaker 4>and we have tried jointly to get their </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives straight her and it works almost </v>

2151
01:59:56.271 --> 01:59:57.230
<v Speaker 4>inevitably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2152
01:59:57.231 --> 01:59:59.240
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean I've had clients who </v>
<v Speaker 4>died,</v>

2153
01:59:59.650 --> 02:00:04.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were three quarters through a </v>

2154
02:00:04.650 --> 02:00:07.660
<v Speaker 4>wonderful process of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>renovation and they got cancer and died </v>

2155
02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:07.940
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's,</v>

2156
02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:10.580
<v Speaker 4>there's no certainty associated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2157
02:00:11.150 --> 02:00:15.350
<v Speaker 4>but it's the best solution available.</v>

2158
02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:21.250
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's also possible that it's a good </v>

2159
02:00:21.250 --> 02:00:21.250
<v Speaker 4>enough solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2160
02:00:21.250 --> 02:00:23.690
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to my class yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this,</v>

2161
02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:24.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you,</v>

2162
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:28.640
<v Speaker 4>if you pursue the things in your life </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are meaningful once you've oriented</v>

2163
02:00:28.641 --> 02:00:33.641
<v Speaker 4>yourself and that means accepting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>challenges that come along with that </v>

2164
02:00:33.641 --> 02:00:33.641
<v Speaker 4>because one of the things that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>find,</v>

2165
02:00:33.641 --> 02:00:36.680
<v Speaker 4>you even find this in music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you know a piece of music completely,</v>

2166
02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:39.080
<v Speaker 4>then you tend not to want to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it anymore.</v>

2167
02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:41.210
<v Speaker 4>There's still has to be some challenge </v>
<v Speaker 4>in it.</v>

2168
02:00:41.211 --> 02:00:43.970
<v Speaker 4>You still have to track it and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 4>music is so complex,</v>

2169
02:00:43.971 --> 02:00:45.980
<v Speaker 4>you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just sounds like noise.</v>

2170
02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:48.050
<v Speaker 4>Modern music is often like that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so.</v>

2171
02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:53.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tends towards the chaotic and so </v>

2172
02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:53.570
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find it difficult to listen to because</v>

2173
02:00:53.571 --> 02:00:56.120
<v Speaker 4>I can't get a handle on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you know,</v>

2174
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:57.470
<v Speaker 4>so it's too challenging.</v>

2175
02:00:57.470 --> 02:01:00.050
<v Speaker 4>And then there's other music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pop music is often like this,</v>

2176
02:01:00.051 --> 02:01:01.820
<v Speaker 4>it's catchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first two times you hear it and then</v>

2177
02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:03.800
<v Speaker 4>you never want to hear it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too much.</v>

2178
02:01:03.801 --> 02:01:05.960
<v Speaker 4>There's too much predictability and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough chaos.</v>

2179
02:01:05.961 --> 02:01:10.961
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully you find a piece of music </v>
<v Speaker 4>that somewhere in the middle you can </v>

2180
02:01:10.961 --> 02:01:11.840
<v Speaker 4>listen to it 50 or 100 times and each </v>
<v Speaker 4>time you listen to it,</v>

2181
02:01:11.841 --> 02:01:14.660
<v Speaker 4>there's still some new nuance in it that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't,</v>

2182
02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:18.920
<v Speaker 4>that you didn't expect before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so why don't you kind of want to set</v>

2183
02:01:18.921 --> 02:01:20.810
<v Speaker 4>up your life like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that.</v>

2184
02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:26.800
<v Speaker 4>And I think you see that the phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 4>of meaning manifest itself at the area,</v>

2185
02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:32.810
<v Speaker 4>at the locale of optimal challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if the thing.</v>

2186
02:01:32.811 --> 02:01:34.760
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2187
02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:39.970
<v Speaker 4>I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well let's say you want to set some </v>

2188
02:01:39.970 --> 02:01:39.970
<v Speaker 4>goals for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We say,</v>

2189
02:01:39.970 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 4>well they're remarkable goals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're all there too unattainable.</v>

2190
02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:44.930
<v Speaker 4>You're just gonna find it frustrating to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pursue them.</v>

2191
02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:48.290
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be too punishing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we might say,</v>

2192
02:01:48.291 --> 02:01:50.000
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a goal and you think,</v>

2193
02:01:50.001 --> 02:01:50.750
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could do that.</v>

2194
02:01:50.850 --> 02:01:52.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing on my head,</v>

2195
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:53.660
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no challenge in it.</v>

2196
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:59.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both of those two extremes are gonna </v>

2197
02:01:59.050 --> 02:02:00.550
<v Speaker 4>leave you in a state that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>characterized by the optimization of </v>

2198
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:02.750
<v Speaker 4>engagement and meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is too difficult to punishing.</v>

2199
02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:06.580
<v Speaker 4>It's the judge and nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the other is the ultimate unmerciful</v>

2200
02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:11.620
<v Speaker 4>mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you win no matter how you </v>

2201
02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:11.620
<v Speaker 4>play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you calibrate it.</v>

2202
02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:11.620
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2203
02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:12.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need,</v>

2204
02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:15.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm up for a challenge at this level.</v>

2205
02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:22.690
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't recommend that because that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a bit like people do that you might</v>

2206
02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:27.720
<v Speaker 4>want to investigate your character in </v>
<v Speaker 4>detail and decide you know what's going </v>

2207
02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:30.040
<v Speaker 4>on at this level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty harsh,</v>

2208
02:02:30.250 --> 02:02:35.250
<v Speaker 4>but you can certainly continually retool</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself at more micro levels and that,</v>

2209
02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:41.160
<v Speaker 4>and I think what you do is you pick the </v>
<v Speaker 4>level of retooling that optimizes your </v>

2210
02:02:41.861 --> 02:02:46.861
<v Speaker 4>willing to be engaged in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then what's so interesting about </v>

2211
02:02:46.861 --> 02:02:50.770
<v Speaker 4>that is that I think is that you get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits of perfection,</v>

2212
02:02:51.190 --> 02:02:53.740
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while still being imperfect.</v>

2213
02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:59.580
<v Speaker 4>The imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your actual imperfection has nothing to </v>

2214
02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:02.041
<v Speaker 4>do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's relevant is the journey is the </v>

2215
02:03:02.041 --> 02:03:03.100
<v Speaker 4>journey that you're undertaking to </v>
<v Speaker 4>rectify the imperfection.</v>

2216
02:03:03.490 --> 02:03:07.630
<v Speaker 4>So instead of aiming to be that entity </v>
<v Speaker 4>without flaws,</v>

2217
02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:12.870
<v Speaker 4>you're aiming to be the entity that </v>
<v Speaker 4>continues to realize its flaws and </v>

2218
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.870
<v Speaker 4>overcome them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2219
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:13.780
<v Speaker 4>that's a game you can play forever.</v>

2220
02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:17.680
<v Speaker 4>And that's maybe the ultimate in being </v>
<v Speaker 4>an unflawed entity.</v>

2221
02:03:17.710 --> 02:03:19.490
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2222
02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:21.400
<v Speaker 4>So I want to show you some pictures that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2223
02:03:21.401 --> 02:03:26.050
<v Speaker 4>think are associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this one to begin with,</v>

2224
02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:29.710
<v Speaker 4>this is an absolutely amazing picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2225
02:03:30.230 --> 02:03:34.840
<v Speaker 4>So this is bert hold firt mayan tree of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life flanked by yves and mary ecclesia,</v>

2226
02:03:36.010 --> 02:03:41.010
<v Speaker 4>and this in some sense this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this picture summarizes the biblical </v>

2227
02:03:41.010 --> 02:03:41.770
<v Speaker 4>stories in one picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

2228
02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:44.380
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty amazing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that a picture can do that.</v>

2229
02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:47.080
<v Speaker 4>And so I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me explain the picture a little bit.</v>

2230
02:03:47.081 --> 02:03:49.900
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing you see here is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the tree.</v>

2231
02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:52.520
<v Speaker 4>This is the tree of life.</v>

2232
02:03:54.170 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 4>And so it echoes the tree of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge of good and evil,</v>

2233
02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:03.620
<v Speaker 4>but this is post fall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we interpreted that story of adam and</v>

2234
02:04:03.621 --> 02:04:04.510
<v Speaker 4>eve already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2235
02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:07.070
<v Speaker 4>human beings became self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they discovered death,</v>

2236
02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:12.100
<v Speaker 4>they discovered morality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all a consequence of interacting </v>

2237
02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:13.190
<v Speaker 4>with the fruit and the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

2238
02:04:13.191 --> 02:04:16.190
<v Speaker 4>and you can read that as an as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary tail.</v>

2239
02:04:17.090 --> 02:04:22.090
<v Speaker 4>You can at least read it as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation of the emergence of self </v>

2240
02:04:22.090 --> 02:04:23.390
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so what does that mean?</v>

2241
02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:28.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means that the apple in some sense </v>

2242
02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:29.570
<v Speaker 4>was equivalent to death and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you see here.</v>

2243
02:04:29.571 --> 02:04:31.880
<v Speaker 4>You see this picking fruit from the tree</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

2244
02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:37.300
<v Speaker 4>but the fruit is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on the skull side of the tree and </v>

2245
02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:38.790
<v Speaker 4>so eve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the vulnerability of eve.</v>

2246
02:04:39.250 --> 02:04:41.370
<v Speaker 4>She's naked there and displayed to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

2247
02:04:41.371 --> 02:04:43.020
<v Speaker 4>It's the vulnerability of eve.</v>

2248
02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.840
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of thinking about it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>the vulnerability of eve.</v>

2249
02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:51.140
<v Speaker 4>That was the catalyst to the development</v>
<v Speaker 4>of human self consciousness and I think </v>

2250
02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:55.881
<v Speaker 4>that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to be to be a reasonable </v>

2251
02:04:55.881 --> 02:04:59.660
<v Speaker 4>proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so eve eve's relationship with the </v>

2252
02:05:00.121 --> 02:05:04.980
<v Speaker 4>fruit and the snake doomed human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the realization of mortality.</v>

2253
02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:07.830
<v Speaker 4>that's what this side of the picture </v>
<v Speaker 4>represents,</v>

2254
02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:14.060
<v Speaker 4>and so it's a catastrophe and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with here with the snake and </v>

2255
02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:15.960
<v Speaker 4>the fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's human beings attempts to understand</v>

2256
02:05:15.961 --> 02:05:18.390
<v Speaker 4>how it is that they emerged into a self </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious world.</v>

2257
02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:19.950
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fine.</v>

2258
02:05:19.951 --> 02:05:23.490
<v Speaker 4>So that's on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is on the fall end of the story and</v>

2259
02:05:23.491 --> 02:05:26.370
<v Speaker 4>this is on the solution end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

2260
02:05:26.371 --> 02:05:31.371
<v Speaker 4>Now what you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a skull there and there's a </v>

2261
02:05:31.371 --> 02:05:32.910
<v Speaker 4>crucifix here and you see there's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these little fruits on this tree,</v>

2262
02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:38.360
<v Speaker 4>so it's the apple of death that eve is </v>
<v Speaker 4>handing out on this side and it's the </v>

2263
02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:39.870
<v Speaker 4>host that that plays a role in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannibalistic,</v>

2264
02:05:39.871 --> 02:05:40.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2265
02:05:40.110 --> 02:05:43.530
<v Speaker 4>That's at the center of christian ritual</v>
<v Speaker 4>that mary,</v>

2266
02:05:43.531 --> 02:05:47.430
<v Speaker 4>as the church is handing out as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>medication for this.</v>

2267
02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:51.570
<v Speaker 4>So she's handing out the antidote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2268
02:05:51.571 --> 02:05:53.070
<v Speaker 4>what's the antidote?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2269
02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:58.100
<v Speaker 4>it's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's associated with this crucifix and </v>

2270
02:05:58.100 --> 02:05:59.020
<v Speaker 4>that's translated into this wheat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>host,</v>

2271
02:05:59.021 --> 02:06:04.021
<v Speaker 4>so you're supposed to eat that and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the incorporation of whatever </v>

2272
02:06:04.021 --> 02:06:05.220
<v Speaker 4>this represents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2273
02:06:05.221 --> 02:06:07.890
<v Speaker 4>the question then is what does that </v>
<v Speaker 4>represent?</v>

2274
02:06:07.891 --> 02:06:09.930
<v Speaker 4>It's assist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a symbol of suffering.</v>

2275
02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:12.840
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it's a symbol of the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>end suffering.</v>

2276
02:06:12.841 --> 02:06:17.841
<v Speaker 4>It's the weirdest thing because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>picture proposes that to ingest,</v>

2277
02:06:18.061 --> 02:06:23.061
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate in suffering is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously ingest the antidote to </v>

2278
02:06:25.170 --> 02:06:27.060
<v Speaker 4>the catastrophe of the knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>

2279
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:31.050
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but but it's the.</v>

2280
02:06:31.230 --> 02:06:33.930
<v Speaker 4>It's the proper paradox that's at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>center of this,</v>

2281
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:36.420
<v Speaker 4>of the great drama that's represented by</v>
<v Speaker 4>this picture.</v>

2282
02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:42.750
<v Speaker 4>A little knowledge of death destroys </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2283
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Full voluntary acceptance of it is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cure.</v>

2284
02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:51.180
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2285
02:06:51.181 --> 02:06:53.190
<v Speaker 4>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a hell of an idea.</v>

2286
02:06:56.010 --> 02:07:01.010
<v Speaker 4>It's not only to and to accept it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously in some sense to take </v>

2287
02:07:02.761 --> 02:07:04.170
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for it</v>

2288
02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:09.730
<v Speaker 4>because you don't take responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>for things that you don't accept.</v>

2289
02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:14.230
<v Speaker 4>You only take responsibility for things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you do accept,</v>

2290
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:14.860
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2291
02:07:14.861 --> 02:07:19.861
<v Speaker 4>the world is fundamentally flawed </v>
<v Speaker 4>because its fundamental nature is </v>

2292
02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:22.210
<v Speaker 4>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intolerable vulnerability.</v>

2293
02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:24.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to take any responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>

2294
02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:28.600
<v Speaker 4>That that's really caden's attitude in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the story of,</v>

2295
02:07:29.110 --> 02:07:34.110
<v Speaker 4>of cain and abel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He externalizes responsibility for the </v>

2296
02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:38.320
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe of his life and therefore he</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't make the right sacrifices.</v>

2297
02:07:38.321 --> 02:07:43.321
<v Speaker 4>And so the paradoxical injunction here </v>
<v Speaker 4>is except responsibility for the </v>

2298
02:07:43.321 --> 02:07:48.151
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe of your life and that way </v>
<v Speaker 4>you transcended simultaneously and </v>

2299
02:07:49.421 --> 02:07:54.421
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an unbelievably hopeful message </v>

2300
02:07:54.421 --> 02:07:56.910
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the message is you're actually </v>

2301
02:07:56.910 --> 02:07:59.041
<v Speaker 4>strong enough to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just don't know it and you won't </v>

2302
02:07:59.041 --> 02:07:59.380
<v Speaker 4>find out till you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't find out till you do it.</v>

2303
02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:02.350
<v Speaker 4>But if you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd find out that it was true.</v>

2304
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:05.200
<v Speaker 4>It's a massive risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the ultimate in risks,</v>

2305
02:08:05.201 --> 02:08:07.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be willing to loSe your life</v>

2306
02:08:07.451 --> 02:08:09.300
<v Speaker 4>in order to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like.</v>

2307
02:08:09.850 --> 02:08:12.070
<v Speaker 4>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that picture,</v>

2308
02:08:12.071 --> 02:08:13.660
<v Speaker 4>when I started to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 4>picture,</v>

2309
02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:18.680
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time I look at it just blows me </v>

2310
02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:18.680
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't say it's unbelievably,</v>

2311
02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 4>it's an unbelievably sophisticated set </v>
<v Speaker 4>of ideas,</v>

2312
02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:27.220
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it's much different </v>
<v Speaker 4>really than this idea.</v>

2313
02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:32.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buddha finds his enlightenment under a </v>

2314
02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:34.960
<v Speaker 4>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not fluke that that's the case.</v>

2315
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:37.560
<v Speaker 4>That's his natural environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's sitting in the lotus.</v>

2316
02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:42.740
<v Speaker 4>The lotus opens up his thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>springs up from the depths and he sits </v>

2317
02:08:42.791 --> 02:08:47.791
<v Speaker 4>there illuminated the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a halo that's the sun that </v>

2318
02:08:47.791 --> 02:08:49.060
<v Speaker 4>stands for higher consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>

2319
02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:52.780
<v Speaker 4>He's transcended by accepting the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that life is suffering.</v>

2320
02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:57.730
<v Speaker 4>He's transcended the limitations that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are part of mortality.</v>

2321
02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:04.130
<v Speaker 4>You see that symbol there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that swastika.</v>

2322
02:09:04.131 --> 02:09:05.570
<v Speaker 4>You see it there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's reversed.</v>

2323
02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:06.950
<v Speaker 4>The nazis reversed it.</v>

2324
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:13.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about that mean they weren't </v>

2325
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:15.800
<v Speaker 4>stupid symbolism there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>SYmbols had meaning is what the swastika</v>

2326
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:17.710
<v Speaker 4>were represented was what this </v>
<v Speaker 4>represents.</v>

2327
02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:22.270
<v Speaker 4>Reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2328
02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:25.810
<v Speaker 4>that's a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing that this,</v>

2329
02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:28.810
<v Speaker 4>this idea is what enables people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcend their suffering.</v>

2330
02:09:28.811 --> 02:09:29.580
<v Speaker 4>And buddha said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2331
02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:31.960
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be too attached to things,</v>

2332
02:09:32.650 --> 02:09:34.720
<v Speaker 4>and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean deny the world.</v>

2333
02:09:34.721 --> 02:09:37.870
<v Speaker 4>It might mean deny the world if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>too in love with the material,</v>

2334
02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:41.290
<v Speaker 4>like with material wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

2335
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:45.910
<v Speaker 4>Then your pathway to transcendence and </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning might be to abandon that because</v>

2336
02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:49.390
<v Speaker 4>it's constraining you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's making you less than you could be,</v>

2337
02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:54.780
<v Speaker 4>but the fundamental lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more fundamental lesson that's </v>

2338
02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:58.201
<v Speaker 4>underneath that is don't let what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are stop you from being what you could </v>

2339
02:09:58.201 --> 02:09:59.230
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2340
02:09:59.530 --> 02:10:00.670
<v Speaker 4>And so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2341
02:10:00.671 --> 02:10:04.300
<v Speaker 4>what do you identify with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you identify with what you are?</v>

2342
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:08.800
<v Speaker 4>Then you're a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you identify with,</v>

2343
02:10:09.130 --> 02:10:11.890
<v Speaker 4>with chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's the opposite of order.</v>

2344
02:10:11.891 --> 02:10:16.891
<v Speaker 4>Say then you're nihilistic ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't identify with either of those,</v>

2345
02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:19.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're both necessary,</v>

2346
02:10:19.511 --> 02:10:21.220
<v Speaker 4>you know that you have to live with both</v>
<v Speaker 4>of them,</v>

2347
02:10:21.221 --> 02:10:26.221
<v Speaker 4>but you would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you identify with the capacity to </v>

2348
02:10:26.221 --> 02:10:29.440
<v Speaker 4>continually transcend what you are and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you seek out error.</v>

2349
02:10:30.070 --> 02:10:33.320
<v Speaker 4>That's what humility is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm error ridden</v>

2350
02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:35.360
<v Speaker 2>psych,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I want to see,</v>

2351
02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:39.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to put myself in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I can discover one of my areas,</v>

2352
02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:42.710
<v Speaker 2>hopefully not in a way that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>knock me completely out of the game,</v>

2353
02:10:42.711 --> 02:10:44.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

2354
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:47.510
<v Speaker 2>I want to seek out a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to find out where my limits are.</v>

2355
02:10:47.511 --> 02:10:52.511
<v Speaker 2>I want to find out where there's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough of me yet and I want to do it </v>

2356
02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:52.950
<v Speaker 2>that in a way that's engaging because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2357
02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:55.190
<v Speaker 2>you can wear yourself out fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragons.</v>

2358
02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:57.560
<v Speaker 2>So obviously you can exhaust yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

2359
02:10:57.561 --> 02:10:59.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2360
02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:01.460
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2361
02:11:01.461 --> 02:11:06.461
<v Speaker 2>when I was coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was coaching lawyers who these </v>

2362
02:11:06.461 --> 02:11:10.180
<v Speaker 2>were people who had very high end </v>
<v Speaker 2>careers and so they had an infinite </v>

2363
02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:10.180
<v Speaker 2>workload.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter how much they worked,</v>

2364
02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:12.410
<v Speaker 2>flat out there was always way more work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they should do.</v>

2365
02:11:12.410 --> 02:11:17.410
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult thing to learn to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage and so they were exhausting </v>

2366
02:11:17.410 --> 02:11:18.140
<v Speaker 2>themselves and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2367
02:11:18.190 --> 02:11:19.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to work less per day.</v>

2368
02:11:19.731 --> 02:11:20.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2369
02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:21.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not happening.</v>

2370
02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:26.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I learned over time was,</v>

2371
02:11:26.091 --> 02:11:31.091
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is what you have to do every </v>

2372
02:11:31.091 --> 02:11:32.891
<v Speaker 2>three months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to block off four days and go </v>

2373
02:11:32.891 --> 02:11:34.010
<v Speaker 2>have a vacation and you have to plan </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in advance so it's in your calendar</v>

2374
02:11:34.011 --> 02:11:39.011
<v Speaker 2>so that your secretary doesn't book your</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and then you need that because you </v>

2375
02:11:39.011 --> 02:11:43.451
<v Speaker 2>have to recuperate enough so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can work as hard as you're going to </v>

2376
02:11:43.451 --> 02:11:46.331
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course they were nervous about </v>

2377
02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:46.331
<v Speaker 2>that and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

2378
02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:46.331
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can calibrate this.</v>

2379
02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's keep track of your billable hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the next year and see if they </v>

2380
02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:52.370
<v Speaker 2>increase or decrease because I bet you </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take more time off,</v>

2381
02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:54.650
<v Speaker 2>you'll actually have more billable </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

2382
02:11:54.650 --> 02:11:56.300
<v Speaker 2>You'll actually have your cake and eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>it too.</v>

2383
02:11:56.301 --> 02:12:01.301
<v Speaker 2>You'll get to have a vacation and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>be more productive and that inevitably </v>

2384
02:12:01.311 --> 02:12:05.420
<v Speaker 2>that was what happened and so that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter of calibrating the game properly,</v>

2385
02:12:05.421 --> 02:12:10.421
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to play a game that you can </v>

2386
02:12:10.421 --> 02:12:10.421
<v Speaker 2>play today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also one that you can play next week</v>

2387
02:12:10.421 --> 02:12:11.930
<v Speaker 2>and next month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not tAlking about you know,</v>

2388
02:12:11.931 --> 02:12:13.700
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your career this week.</v>

2389
02:12:13.701 --> 02:12:18.701
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about you having a career </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lasts 30 years that doesn't kill </v>

2390
02:12:18.701 --> 02:12:22.541
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make you hate yourself or </v>

2391
02:12:22.541 --> 02:12:22.880
<v Speaker 2>the job that doesn't make you better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't where you to a frazzle,</v>

2392
02:12:23.150 --> 02:12:28.150
<v Speaker 2>so it has to be optimized and so I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can in fact decIde to take on </v>

2393
02:12:28.311 --> 02:12:32.030
<v Speaker 2>the load that's optimally meaningful if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>

2394
02:12:32.031 --> 02:12:33.800
<v Speaker 2>and then you get to have your cake and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat it too.</v>

2395
02:12:34.100 --> 02:12:37.190
<v Speaker 2>You're on the pathway to continual </v>
<v Speaker 2>incremental improvement.</v>

2396
02:12:37.190 --> 02:12:42.190
<v Speaker 2>You only have to burn off a feather at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>time instead of having the whole bloody </v>

2397
02:12:42.190 --> 02:12:43.580
<v Speaker 2>thing burst into flames,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a constant.</v>

2398
02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a constant source of renewal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an idea that to be renewed,</v>

2399
02:12:47.721 --> 02:12:49.760
<v Speaker 2>you have to drink the water of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2400
02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:53.630
<v Speaker 2>That that's an old mythological idea and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the water?</v>

2401
02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:55.790
<v Speaker 2>The water of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is water.</v>

2402
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>water is chaos.</v>

2403
02:12:57.350 --> 02:13:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Water is what washes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much order and to stay continually,</v>

2404
02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:07.180
<v Speaker 2>let's say a refreshed by the water of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is to take on exactly the right </v>

2405
02:13:07.821 --> 02:13:12.821
<v Speaker 2>amount of chaos to make sure that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>garden is properly nourished and I think</v>

2406
02:13:13.131 --> 02:13:17.150
<v Speaker 2>meaning is actually the marker of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as I said,</v>

2407
02:13:17.151 --> 02:13:22.151
<v Speaker 2>you know that I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't consider myself either naive </v>

2408
02:13:22.151 --> 02:13:23.330
<v Speaker 2>or particularly optimistic person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm either of those,</v>

2409
02:13:23.570 --> 02:13:25.550
<v Speaker 2>but this is an actually an idea.</v>

2410
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:30.790
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the only ideas that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever found that I really believe to be </v>

2411
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:32.700
<v Speaker 2>rock solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that it's true and it's</v>

2412
02:13:32.701 --> 02:13:37.701
<v Speaker 2>very optimistic because it says you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>use your sense of meaning to calibrate </v>

2413
02:13:37.701 --> 02:13:39.750
<v Speaker 2>your progress through life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's rules.</v>

2414
02:13:39.751 --> 02:13:44.751
<v Speaker 2>You have to aim at the highest possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>good that you can conceive now and </v>

2415
02:13:44.751 --> 02:13:45.570
<v Speaker 2>that's subject update because what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell you know,</v>

2416
02:13:45.571 --> 02:13:48.090
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start by aiming at the star you can</v>

2417
02:13:48.091 --> 02:13:51.060
<v Speaker 2>see rather than the dimmer one that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't yet perceive,</v>

2418
02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:53.940
<v Speaker 2>and then you decide that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that honestly.</v>

2419
02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that.</v>

2420
02:13:54.910 --> 02:13:59.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a big decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first decision I think in some </v>

2421
02:13:59.910 --> 02:14:03.321
<v Speaker 2>sense is a decision of love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to decide that being is </v>

2422
02:14:03.321 --> 02:14:05.670
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile and that you're going to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>for its betterment and that's a decision</v>

2423
02:14:05.671 --> 02:14:10.671
<v Speaker 2>that's based on law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the second decision is based on </v>

2424
02:14:10.671 --> 02:14:10.671
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

2425
02:14:10.671 --> 02:14:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Having made that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to play a straight game.</v>

2426
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Having made those two decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you can allow your sense of</v>

2427
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:19.731
<v Speaker 2>meaning to calibrate your pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what's so interesting is that </v>

2428
02:14:19.731 --> 02:14:23.361
<v Speaker 2>you hit a state that's as close to </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradise as you're going to hit right </v>

2429
02:14:23.361 --> 02:14:27.951
<v Speaker 2>away because being engaged like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better to be engaged in the </v>

2430
02:14:27.951 --> 02:14:30.930
<v Speaker 2>solution of a complex problem that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a problem at all.</v>

2431
02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:36.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's no different than saying it's </v>

2432
02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:38.880
<v Speaker 2>better for there to be being the non </v>
<v Speaker 2>being because being is a problem.</v>

2433
02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:43.560
<v Speaker 2>and so if you want to have no problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have no being.</v>

2434
02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:44.970
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could say,</v>

2435
02:14:44.971 --> 02:14:47.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being so miserable that maybe that's the</v>

2436
02:14:47.101 --> 02:14:50.250
<v Speaker 2>route we should take and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you can have your cake and eat</v>

2437
02:14:50.251 --> 02:14:52.380
<v Speaker 2>it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have the damn problem,</v>

2438
02:14:53.070 --> 02:14:54.810
<v Speaker 2>it can be a problem we're solving.</v>

2439
02:14:54.930 --> 02:14:59.930
<v Speaker 2>And you can be so engaged in solving the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem that it justifies the fact that </v>

2440
02:14:59.930 --> 02:15:01.080
<v Speaker 2>the problem exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you get,</v>

2441
02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:06.140
<v Speaker 2>then you get to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to have the problem and the </v>

2442
02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:09.561
<v Speaker 2>solution at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe That's better than not having </v>

2443
02:15:09.561 --> 02:15:12.111
<v Speaker 2>the problem at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that because one of the </v>

2444
02:15:12.111 --> 02:15:12.111
<v Speaker 2>things I have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen this so interesting,</v>

2445
02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:15.900
<v Speaker 2>so interesting when I've been lecturing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to people especially more recently,</v>

2446
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:18.900
<v Speaker 2>and this is also manifested itself on </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell phone,</v>

2447
02:15:18.901 --> 02:15:23.901
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to people a lot about </v>

2448
02:15:23.901 --> 02:15:27.081
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and it's young men in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular that seemed to be responding </v>

2449
02:15:27.081 --> 02:15:28.200
<v Speaker 2>to that and I think that's partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think that young women in some</v>

2450
02:15:28.201 --> 02:15:31.860
<v Speaker 2>sense have their responsibility map </v>
<v Speaker 2>already laid out for them.</v>

2451
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:37.310
<v Speaker 2>It's also less voluntary in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>for women because they have more </v>

2452
02:15:37.310 --> 02:15:38.220
<v Speaker 2>complicated problems to solve in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first part of their life,</v>

2453
02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:40.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take because they have to get the family</v>

2454
02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 2>problem solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whatever.</v>

2455
02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking very in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>delineated matter about responsibility,</v>

2456
02:15:48.330 --> 02:15:50.070
<v Speaker 2>whIch is a strange thing to sell to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2457
02:15:50.071 --> 02:15:52.770
<v Speaker 2>but responsibility is what gives your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life meaning.</v>

2458
02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:58.220
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then take on ultimate </v>

2459
02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:00.711
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have an ultimately meaningful life </v>

2460
02:16:00.711 --> 02:16:00.711
<v Speaker 2>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2461
02:16:00.711 --> 02:16:03.270
<v Speaker 2>if your life is ultimately meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if it's</v>

2462
02:16:04.230 --> 02:16:07.200
<v Speaker 2>punctuated by tragedy or even predicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>on tragedy.</v>

2463
02:16:07.590 --> 02:16:12.360
<v Speaker 2>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's true,</v>

2464
02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:15.180
<v Speaker 2>and everything I've seen indicates to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

2465
02:16:15.181 --> 02:16:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Every time I get my clients to take on </v>
<v Speaker 2>more responsibility.</v>

2466
02:16:18.940 --> 02:16:20.790
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't an injunction.</v>

2467
02:16:20.791 --> 02:16:23.010
<v Speaker 2>You're a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should take on responsibility.</v>

2468
02:16:23.130 --> 02:16:26.310
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can defIne the damn responsibility.</v>

2469
02:16:26.460 --> 02:16:29.080
<v Speaker 2>It isn't something that someone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>should impose on you.</v>

2470
02:16:29.081 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not a matter of doing</v>

2471
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.410
<v Speaker 4>what you should do in some abstract </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>

2472
02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:37.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not that it's the choice of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>game you're going to play and you know </v>

2473
02:16:38.291 --> 02:16:40.270
<v Speaker 4>you can play the game of the seeker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

2474
02:16:40.271 --> 02:16:45.271
<v Speaker 4>And if you play that game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then everyone wins and it's the best </v>

2475
02:16:45.271 --> 02:16:45.770
<v Speaker 4>game you can play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>

2476
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:50.870
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the answer in some sense to the tragedy </v>

2477
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:53.611
<v Speaker 4>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the catastrophe of life to the fall </v>

2478
02:16:53.611 --> 02:16:56.940
<v Speaker 4>is to adopt the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mortality that goes along with that and </v>

2479
02:16:57.071 --> 02:17:00.700
<v Speaker 4>to play that game maximally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And paradoxically,</v>

2480
02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:03.670
<v Speaker 4>it's in willingness to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the solution emerges.</v>

2481
02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:09.180
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have done my best with every single </v>

2482
02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:12.571
<v Speaker 4>thing I've talked to you guys about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have done my best to do what </v>

2483
02:17:12.571 --> 02:17:14.170
<v Speaker 4>dostoyevsky he does in his novels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is I make a proposition and then I</v>

2484
02:17:14.171 --> 02:17:19.171
<v Speaker 4>spend months or years trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 4>out if I can take the bloody thing </v>

2485
02:17:19.171 --> 02:17:23.971
<v Speaker 4>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's something wrong with it </v>

2486
02:17:23.971 --> 02:17:26.010
<v Speaker 4>because I want to fInd out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to hit it with a hammer and </v>

2487
02:17:26.010 --> 02:17:28.561
<v Speaker 4>seeing if it breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what I've been trying to do is to </v>

2488
02:17:28.561 --> 02:17:29.080
<v Speaker 4>tell you all the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>gathered,</v>

2489
02:17:29.081 --> 02:17:29.770
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

2490
02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:34.800
<v Speaker 4>or laid out or articulated or discovered</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the last 30 years that I have not </v>

2491
02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:37.510
<v Speaker 4>been able to break with the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>hammer that I could take to them.</v>

2492
02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:41.920
<v Speaker 4>And I guess that's the fundamental one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that I believe that the,</v>

2493
02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:43.550
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2494
02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:47.080
<v Speaker 4>the idea that lurks in these images</v>

2495
02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:54.180
<v Speaker 4>derived from very different cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same idea.</v>

2496
02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:59.910
<v Speaker 4>Life is suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2497
02:18:00.390 --> 02:18:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Indisputable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do about that?</v>

2498
02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:12.280
<v Speaker 4>You voluntarily accepted and then strive</v>
<v Speaker 4>to overcome the suffering.</v>

2499
02:18:13.201 --> 02:18:18.201
<v Speaker 4>That's a consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you do that for you and you do that </v>

2500
02:18:18.201 --> 02:18:19.500
<v Speaker 4>in a Way that makes It better for other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2501
02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:23.250
<v Speaker 4>And then that works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one question might be,</v>

2502
02:18:23.251 --> 02:18:24.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how well does it work?</v>

2503
02:18:24.750 --> 02:18:28.830
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way that you can find out is by</v>

2504
02:18:28.831 --> 02:18:31.140
<v Speaker 4>trying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2505
02:18:31.230 --> 02:18:36.230
<v Speaker 4>That's the existential element of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The proof is to be derived by the </v>

2506
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:37.380
<v Speaker 4>incarnation of the attitude in your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2507
02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:41.040
<v Speaker 4>no one can tell you how it will work for</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2508
02:18:41.370 --> 02:18:46.370
<v Speaker 4>It's the thing that your destiny is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>discover that and you have to make.</v>

2509
02:18:47.490 --> 02:18:49.260
<v Speaker 4>You have to make the decisions to begin </v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

2510
02:18:49.290 --> 02:18:52.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like because you can't do this </v>
<v Speaker 4>without commitment,</v>

2511
02:18:52.170 --> 02:18:57.170
<v Speaker 4>you have to commit to it first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the act of faith that that </v>

2512
02:18:57.170 --> 02:18:58.320
<v Speaker 4>character guard was so insistent upon.</v>

2513
02:18:59.010 --> 02:19:01.800
<v Speaker 4>You have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to act as if being as good,</v>

2514
02:19:01.801 --> 02:19:04.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to act as if truth is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathway to enlightenment.</v>

2515
02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:08.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to act as if I should pursue </v>
<v Speaker 4>the deepest meaning possible in my life.</v>

2516
02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:11.880
<v Speaker 4>And there's there's reasons to do none </v>
<v Speaker 4>of those.</v>

2517
02:19:12.580 --> 02:19:15.720
<v Speaker 4>There are real reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's really a decision,</v>

2518
02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:21.320
<v Speaker 4>but you cannot find out what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of the decision is unless </v>

2519
02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:24.381
<v Speaker 4>you make the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the same thing happens when you </v>

2520
02:19:24.381 --> 02:19:25.740
<v Speaker 4>get married by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you think you might leave,</v>

2521
02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:28.550
<v Speaker 4>you're not married and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2522
02:19:28.551 --> 02:19:29.840
<v Speaker 4>the marriage didn't succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2523
02:19:29.841 --> 02:19:31.940
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you were never married because the</v>

2524
02:19:31.941 --> 02:19:36.020
<v Speaker 4>rule is you don't get to leave and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason for that rule.</v>

2525
02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:41.320
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm not saying that there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>situations where there should be </v>

2526
02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:41.320
<v Speaker 4>exceptions made for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the point.</v>

2527
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:44.900
<v Speaker 4>The point is that there's some games you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get to play unless you're all in,</v>

2528
02:19:46.330 --> 02:19:51.330
<v Speaker 4>and the other thing that's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting about being alive is that </v>

2529
02:19:51.330 --> 02:19:51.330
<v Speaker 4>you're all in.</v>

2530
02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:54.440
<v Speaker 4>No matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're all in.</v>

2531
02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:59.680
<v Speaker 4>this is going to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think you might as well play the </v>

2532
02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:03.881
<v Speaker 4>most magnificent game you can while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're waiting because do you have </v>

2533
02:20:04.401 --> 02:20:06.410
<v Speaker 4>anything better to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

2534
02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:10.370
<v Speaker 4>why not pick the best thing possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you could do?</v>

2535
02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:16.660
<v Speaker 4>Why not do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you could justify you're wretched </v>

2536
02:20:16.660 --> 02:20:16.850
<v Speaker 4>existence to yourself that way I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could.</v>

2537
02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:19.310
<v Speaker 4>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2538
02:20:19.311 --> 02:20:22.260
<v Speaker 4>people find such meaning in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibilities they adopt.</v>

2539
02:20:22.261 --> 02:20:25.490
<v Speaker 4>It stops making them ask questions about</v>
<v Speaker 4>what life is for.</v>

2540
02:20:25.491 --> 02:20:27.410
<v Speaker 4>If you have a newborn child,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2541
02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:33.520
<v Speaker 4>like unless you're really in a bad way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychotically depressed or or maybe your</v>

2542
02:20:33.531 --> 02:20:37.340
<v Speaker 4>personality really needs some retooling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stop thinking about</v>

2543
02:20:39.210 --> 02:20:44.210
<v Speaker 4>anything but ensuring that that baby is </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing well and if someone comes along </v>

2544
02:20:44.671 --> 02:20:48.090
<v Speaker 4>and asks you an existential question </v>
<v Speaker 4>about your commitment to that,</v>

2545
02:20:48.390 --> 02:20:52.290
<v Speaker 4>the right response is why are you asking</v>
<v Speaker 4>me such stupid questions when,</v>

2546
02:20:52.380 --> 02:20:53.990
<v Speaker 4>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when this,</v>

2547
02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:56.670
<v Speaker 4>this is manifesting itself right in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of your eyes,</v>

2548
02:20:56.700 --> 02:20:59.130
<v Speaker 4>like how blind can you be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That isn't a time for,</v>

2549
02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:04.460
<v Speaker 4>for questions about the meaning of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The answer is right in front of you and </v>

2550
02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:06.450
<v Speaker 4>if you can't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not because life has no meaning.</v>

2551
02:21:06.451 --> 02:21:10.000
<v Speaker 4>It's because you're blind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what they image of,</v>

2552
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:15.150
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the virgin mother and the child is </v>

2553
02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:15.150
<v Speaker 4>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2554
02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:15.900
<v Speaker 4>what's the answer to the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life?</v>

2555
02:21:16.770 --> 02:21:18.420
<v Speaker 4>Here's an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT's like,</v>

2556
02:21:18.421 --> 02:21:19.680
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to criticize that.</v>

2557
02:21:19.710 --> 02:21:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go right ahead.</v>

2558
02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:22.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2559
02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:23.790
<v Speaker 4>it's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2560
02:21:23.850 --> 02:21:24.680
<v Speaker 4>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like a.</v>

2561
02:21:24.730 --> 02:21:26.640
<v Speaker 4>You're like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you call that?</v>

2562
02:21:26.730 --> 02:21:29.370
<v Speaker 4>A termite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>KnowIng on a temple,</v>

2563
02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:35.300
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no utility and that sort of </v>

2564
02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:35.300
<v Speaker 4>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

2565
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:40.560
<v Speaker 4>it's blindness and it's the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with regards to the path of the hero.</v>

2566
02:21:40.561 --> 02:21:44.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like it glistens in front of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can criticize it.</v>

2567
02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:44.700
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>

2568
02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:47.320
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

2569
02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:51.440
<v Speaker 4>Put the cart before the horse and see </v>
<v Speaker 4>how far you get.</v>

2570
02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:58.080
<v Speaker 4>So I thought to bring full closure to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the class,</v>

2571
02:21:58.410 --> 02:22:03.410
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to solve this terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>puzzle that confronted me for and many </v>

2572
02:22:04.621 --> 02:22:09.621
<v Speaker 4>other people about how it was that human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings got themselves in such a tangle </v>

2573
02:22:09.871 --> 02:22:14.871
<v Speaker 4>about what they believed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such a tangle that we were pointing the </v>

2574
02:22:14.871 --> 02:22:16.230
<v Speaker 4>ultimate weapons of destruction at one </v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

2575
02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:17.910
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are still doing.</v>

2576
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:21.660
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2577
02:22:21.661 --> 02:22:24.000
<v Speaker 4>well I understand that we need to are </v>
<v Speaker 4>belief systems.</v>

2578
02:22:24.001 --> 02:22:29.001
<v Speaker 4>They orient us and that means there will</v>
<v Speaker 4>be conflict between belief systems and </v>

2579
02:22:29.011 --> 02:22:31.980
<v Speaker 4>that can be a catastrophe and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>being played out everywhere.</v>

2580
02:22:31.981 --> 02:22:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in very many ways.</v>

2581
02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:36.240
<v Speaker 4>What's the solution to that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2582
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:41.520
<v Speaker 4>one possibility is there's no solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just mayhem all the way around.</v>

2583
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:46.670
<v Speaker 4>Could be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seemed to me as I delved into it </v>

2584
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:50.630
<v Speaker 4>that the proper solution to that was to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live properly as an individual because </v>

2585
02:22:50.941 --> 02:22:54.600
<v Speaker 4>you're more powerful than you think way </v>
<v Speaker 4>more powerful than you think.</v>

2586
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:57.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean god only knows what you are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the final analysis.</v>

2587
02:22:58.470 --> 02:23:03.470
<v Speaker 4>You're blind to your own weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're also blind to your own </v>

2588
02:23:03.470 --> 02:23:04.170
<v Speaker 4>strengths and so then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2589
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:07.350
<v Speaker 4>if you've got your act together and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>better for you and instantly it would be</v>

2590
02:23:07.351 --> 02:23:09.990
<v Speaker 4>better for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Assuming they wanted you to get your act</v>

2591
02:23:09.991 --> 02:23:11.610
<v Speaker 4>together and not everyone does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

2592
02:23:12.330 --> 02:23:14.130
<v Speaker 4>And then it would be better for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

2593
02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:19.280
<v Speaker 4>It's like how far could you take that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stopped wasting time and if you </v>

2594
02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:22.521
<v Speaker 4>start lying and if you oriented yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the highest possible good that you </v>

2595
02:23:22.521 --> 02:23:23.430
<v Speaker 4>could conceive of it and you committed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that,</v>

2596
02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.910
<v Speaker 4>how much good could you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2597
02:23:26.911 --> 02:23:28.800
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you find out?</v>

2598
02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:38.060
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I think you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should find out you don't have </v>

2599
02:23:38.060 --> 02:23:39.360
<v Speaker 4>anything better to do and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing in it.</v>

2600
02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:43.140
<v Speaker 4>As far as I've been able to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing in it but good,</v>

2601
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.950
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2602
02:23:47.350 --> 02:23:52.350
<v Speaker 4>maybe you could sort yourself out so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you wanted nothing but the good and</v>

2603
02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:58.100
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe you could help make that </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest in the world and maybe we </v>

2604
02:23:58.100 --> 02:23:59.350
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have all these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

2605
02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Then at least we'd have fewer of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that would be a start.</v>

2606
02:24:03.310 --> 02:24:08.310
<v Speaker 4>So it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the answer to the problem of </v>

2607
02:24:08.310 --> 02:24:13.291
<v Speaker 4>humanity is the is the is the integrity </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the individual.</v>

2608
02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:19.620
<v Speaker 4>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and states that are predicated on </v>

2609
02:24:19.721 --> 02:24:24.400
<v Speaker 4>that realization are healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so in states that aren't,</v>

2610
02:24:25.090 --> 02:24:30.090
<v Speaker 4>are doomed to stagnation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic collapse and personalities </v>

2611
02:24:31.301 --> 02:24:36.301
<v Speaker 4>that are predicated on self tyranny and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tyranny of others are doomed and </v>

2612
02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:43.600
<v Speaker 4>them to collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and then you think,</v>

2613
02:24:43.601 --> 02:24:44.500
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the barrier?</v>

2614
02:24:44.501 --> 02:24:49.501
<v Speaker 4>The barriers are you willing to accept </v>
<v Speaker 4>the responsibility and part of the </v>

2615
02:24:49.501 --> 02:24:52.630
<v Speaker 4>answer to that is reduced the damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility until it's tolerable.</v>

2616
02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:54.820
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to have to fix everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>at once.</v>

2617
02:24:55.150 --> 02:25:00.150
<v Speaker 4>You could just start by fixing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that you could fix or you could </v>

2618
02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:04.081
<v Speaker 4>even do it more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do it with even less self </v>

2619
02:25:04.931 --> 02:25:09.931
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could start by fixing only the </v>

2620
02:25:09.931 --> 02:25:09.931
<v Speaker 4>things that you want to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2621
02:25:09.931 --> 02:25:12.940
<v Speaker 4>you can get a massive way that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so do it.</v>

2622
02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:18.180
<v Speaker 4>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you should have been taught </v>

2623
02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:20.821
<v Speaker 4>in university right from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like aim at the highest good tool </v>

2624
02:25:20.821 --> 02:25:25.081
<v Speaker 4>yourself into something that can attain </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and go out and manifested in the </v>

2625
02:25:25.081 --> 02:25:27.490
<v Speaker 4>world and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that everything that comes your way will</v>

2626
02:25:27.491 --> 02:25:27.850
<v Speaker 4>be</v>

2627
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:33.720
<v Speaker 4>everything that comes your way will be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>blessing and so,</v>

2628
02:25:36.190 --> 02:25:41.190
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to do is give up your </v>

2629
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:42.241
<v Speaker 4>resentment and your hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that's a hard thing to give up </v>

2630
02:25:42.241 --> 02:25:46.290
<v Speaker 4>because he had plenty of reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably a good place to stop,</v>

2631
02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:49.490
<v Speaker 4>so it's a pleasure.</v>

2632
02:25:50.530 --> 02:25:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
