1
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the last time we were here we got </v>

2
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>about maybe a third of the way through </v>
<v Speaker 1>his story,</v>

3
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>his story of no kill and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of a marionette into </v>

4
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:33.571
<v Speaker 1>something hypothetically real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm gonna backtrack a few slides and</v>

5
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>it'll get us into it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you remember that.</v>

6
00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue fairy.</v>

7
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>So I would say the benevolent element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature in the ski matter that </v>

8
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.981
<v Speaker 1>we're going to use to investigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology had more or less been allowed </v>

9
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:54.601
<v Speaker 1>her entrance because Japan was a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and because he wished for the right </v>

10
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense here,</v>

11
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.080
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>genetic studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic slash environmental studies of </v>

13
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>children's temperament have revealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>something quite interesting,</v>

14
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:10.891
<v Speaker 1>which is that the shared environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that children have within a family.</v>

15
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>So that would be what's the same about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your environment and your brother's </v>

16
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

17
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>The Se doesn't have that much effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your temperament or his temperament </v>

18
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>because the presumption always was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a family there was a shared </v>

19
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>That something was common about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment to every child within that </v>

21
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

22
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>but there isn't much of a shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental effect on temperament and </v>

23
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>so then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.961
<v Speaker 1>that makes it appear as though parenting</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that relevant in relationship to </v>

25
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:44.251
<v Speaker 1>the development of temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could also suggest something </v>

26
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:48.001
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could suggest that if parenting is </v>

27
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.871
<v Speaker 1>occurring properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect of the shared environments </v>

28
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>should be very close to zero and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is that you establish an</v>

29
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:59.461
<v Speaker 1>identity on an individual relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each child and the environment is </v>

30
00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:04.531
<v Speaker 1>actually a microenvironment that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed of your observations of your </v>

31
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>child and that specific child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction with you and to some degree,</v>

32
00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:12.481
<v Speaker 1>if there is a shared environment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you're enforcing the same </v>

33
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>principles on every child.</v>

34
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>And so my suspicions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I don't know this because the </v>

35
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 1>research hasn't been done that in bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>families there is a shared environmental</v>

36
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:25.891
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in good families there are there </v>

37
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>that minimize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that lets the child's biological </v>

38
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.441
<v Speaker 1>predisposition roughly manifest itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with support and in some positive </v>

39
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to extend the analogy too </v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

41
00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 1>but you could imagine that if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what this film proposes,</v>

42
00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>is that if you aim properly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your child,</v>

43
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to do is to establish</v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual relationship and to allow </v>

44
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>them to move towards whatever their </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular expression of individuality </v>

45
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.051
<v Speaker 1>happens to be and that's while that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the same as allowing nature to </v>

46
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>take its course in some sense at nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's positive guys,</v>

47
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.671
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly what happens here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that happens of </v>

48
00:03:05.671 --> 00:03:09.181
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the cricket for reasons that </v>

49
00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:13.201
<v Speaker 1>aren't clear precisely is knighted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Blue Fairy and serves as Pinocchio's</v>

50
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

51
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Although he isn't very good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very peculiar thing and quite</v>

52
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:24.271
<v Speaker 1>a market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a point that the film is making that </v>

53
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:27.781
<v Speaker 1>that conscience actually has something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn too and there's actually a </v>

54
00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Friday and element to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:33.241
<v Speaker 1>because Freud thought of the Super Ego </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the internalization roughly speaking </v>

56
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>of the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it could be very severe,</v>

57
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>the superego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be like a really strict father,</v>

58
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>really tyrannical father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inside your head,</v>

59
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.390
<v Speaker 1>although I think it's better to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Super Ego as the internalized </v>

60
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.591
<v Speaker 1>representation of society at large </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediated to some degree through your </v>

61
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>parents because it's not as if your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father even assuming he's too radical,</v>

62
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>is the inventor of all those tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

63
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>He's the propagator of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's actually a proxy voice if he </v>

64
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>even if it's just for the harsh side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

65
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>He's proxy voice for society and because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are social creatures,</v>

66
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>the the utility of having an internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>social voice to guide you.</v>

67
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Although again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem to be able to follow it or not </v>

68
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.281
<v Speaker 1>follow it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I also find spectacularly </v>

69
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>interesting because obviously if it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unerring guide,</v>

70
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 1>you could just follow it and if it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unerring guide,</v>

71
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.300
<v Speaker 1>well you wouldn't need freewill either </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could just act out the </v>

72
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>dictates of this internal representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that isn't what you do.</v>

73
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.960
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proposition here is that the </v>

74
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.381
<v Speaker 1>conscience exists but it's a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>flawed entity and it needs to be </v>

75
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>modified as well by nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is quite interesting because the </v>

76
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>blue fairy night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

77
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>because you also might think of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience as only something that's </v>

78
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>socially constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:55.171
<v Speaker 1>Which is the more typical viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't buy that for a second </v>

80
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:58.530
<v Speaker 1>because I believe firmly and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the pig jetty and interpretation</v>

81
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>of child development more or less bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>this out,</v>

82
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:07.621
<v Speaker 1>is that there are parameters within </v>
<v Speaker 1>which conscience has to operate and that</v>

83
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like this.</v>

84
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like the same parameters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>govern fairplay will say that.</v>

85
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.550
<v Speaker 1>And so you can say there's fairplay </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a game and there's fairplay </v>

86
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.610
<v Speaker 1>across sets of games and the set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>games is pretty much indistinguishable </v>

87
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>from the actual environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

88
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:29.150
<v Speaker 1>If you think about all the things you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is nested games at,</v>

89
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spread of that is large enough so it</v>

90
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>encompasses everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes the environment.</v>

91
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:37.340
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I believe that you're adapted to the set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all possible games,</v>

93
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking all possible playable </v>
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>

94
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

95
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules for that,</v>

96
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>which is why we talked about this a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

97
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Why you're so good at identifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaters,</v>

98
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you have a module for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the evolutionary </v>

99
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.861
<v Speaker 1>psychologists send you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do identify the but really </v>

100
00:05:58.861 --> 00:06:02.561
<v Speaker 1>remember them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really sticks in your mind and </v>

101
00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>there's other evidence to so one piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of evidence that I love.</v>

102
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so well there's a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One I would derive from friends to wall </v>

103
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>who's a famous primatologist and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied.</v>

104
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.700
<v Speaker 1>He studied the prototype morality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges in chimpanzees and it's very </v>

105
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>much rest nested in their dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>

106
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:23.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could think of morality in </v>

107
00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:25.811
<v Speaker 1>some sense as the understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules by which the dominance hierarchy </v>

108
00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>operates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

109
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

110
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 1>the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugliest,</v>

111
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:33.761
<v Speaker 1>meanest chimp and the male dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in chimps seemed to be the </v>

112
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:37.331
<v Speaker 1>predominant ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the females also have a </v>

113
00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:37.331
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite so clear in Bonobos,</v>

114
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 1>which seemed to be more female </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated.</v>

115
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the champ.</v>

116
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Primary chimp dominant structure is male</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could think,</v>

117
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:50.651
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the cave man champion whose </v>

118
00:06:50.651 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 1>biggest and toughest to necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules and who rules longest,</v>

119
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.070
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what the wall filed.</v>

120
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with being mean,</v>

121
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.860
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not not negotiating your social </v>

122
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>landscape and not trading reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>favors,</v>

123
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>is that no matter how powerful you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an individual to pete,</v>

124
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.020
<v Speaker 1>to individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three quarters of your power can do you </v>

125
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.171
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happens with the chimps fairly </v>

126
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:20.141
<v Speaker 1>regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the guy on top is to tyrannical and </v>

127
00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make social connections than </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaker chimps,</v>

128
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>males make good social connections and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's not in such good shape,</v>

129
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 1>they take them down and viciously to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wall has,</v>

130
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 1>has documented some unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrendous acts of,</v>

131
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>let's call it regicide in among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee troops that he studied mostly</v>

132
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:41.681
<v Speaker 1>in the Arnhem Zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a big troop there that's been </v>

133
00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 1>there a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's very interested in prototypical</v>

134
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:48.461
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's some other examples of </v>

135
00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:48.461
<v Speaker 1>prototypical morality emerging among </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

136
00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:50.490
<v Speaker 1>There's many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one is um,</v>

137
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have two wolves have a dominance dispute</v>

138
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be more likely among the male</v>

139
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter.</v>

140
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>They basically display their size and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they grow for all shipley and puff up </v>

141
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.360
<v Speaker 1>their hair so they look bigger and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

142
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 1>you can see cats do that when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go into fight or flight,</v>

143
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do they puff up including their</v>

144
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:13.631
<v Speaker 1>tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they stand sideways and the reason </v>

145
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:13.631
<v Speaker 1>they do that is because they look </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

146
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:18.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're trying to put out the </v>

147
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:18.340
<v Speaker 1>most intimidating possible front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

148
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 1>if two wolves are going at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>

149
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 1>What they're really trying to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>size each other up and they're trying to</v>

150
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>scare each other into backing off </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally because see,</v>

151
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:31.220
<v Speaker 1>the worst case scenario is like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>world for number one and number two.</v>

152
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 1>And we tear each other to shreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I win,</v>

153
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:38.501
<v Speaker 1>but I'm so damaged after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wolf number three comes in and </v>

154
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:41.531
<v Speaker 1>takes me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there's a big cost to be paid </v>

155
00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 1>even for victory in a dominance dispute.</v>

156
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>If a degenerates into violence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and human beings,</v>

157
00:08:45.561 --> 00:08:48.230
<v Speaker 1>but animals in particular have evolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

158
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:53.231
<v Speaker 1>very specific mechanisms to escalate </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance disputes towards violet by </v>

159
00:08:55.681 --> 00:09:00.681
<v Speaker 1>step so that they don't so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>victor doesn't risk incapacitating </v>

160
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 1>himself by winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens with the wolves is that,</v>

161
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they growl at each other and posture and</v>

162
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 1>display and maybe they even snap at each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

163
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.360
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get into a full fledged fight is </v>

164
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.361
<v Speaker 1>pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is one of the wolves </v>

165
00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>backs off and flips over and shows his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>

166
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 1>And that basically means all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tear it out.</v>

167
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other wolf says,</v>

168
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.080
<v Speaker 1>of course he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're kind of an idiot and you're</v>

169
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:30.081
<v Speaker 1>not that strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we might need you to take down a </v>

170
00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:30.081
<v Speaker 1>moose in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

171
00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:33.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite your patheticness I won't tear </v>

172
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:33.920
<v Speaker 1>out your throat.</v>

173
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 1>And then they've established their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant position.</v>

174
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And then from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for some substantial period of </v>

175
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.891
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this subordinate wolf gives way to the </v>

176
00:09:42.891 --> 00:09:45.291
<v Speaker 1>dominant wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at least the subordinate wolf is </v>

177
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:45.291
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

178
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:49.071
<v Speaker 1>he might be dominant over other wolves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so everyone in the whole hierarchy </v>

179
00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:52.761
<v Speaker 1>is sorted that out through either </v>
<v Speaker 1>through mark combat or through combat </v>

180
00:09:52.761 --> 00:09:56.901
<v Speaker 1>itself and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the low ranking members aren't in the </v>

181
00:09:56.901 --> 00:10:00.531
<v Speaker 1>best possible position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least they're not getting their </v>

182
00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 1>heads turn off every second of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

183
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>And so there's even some utility in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability of the dominance hierarchy for</v>

184
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 1>the low ranking members because at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not getting pounded.</v>

185
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>They're getting threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is way better.</v>

186
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's way better than actual combat.</v>

187
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the example of rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love.</v>

188
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 1>This is Jaak Panksepp work and he wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>a book called affective neuroscience,</v>

189
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:22.320
<v Speaker 1>would I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly,</v>

190
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>highly recommend.</v>

191
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I have a list of readings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommended readings on my website.</v>

192
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant book and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant psychologist.</v>

193
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Really one of the top top psychologist </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

194
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 1>both theoretically and experimentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A real genius,</v>

195
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:41.781
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who discovered that rats </v>

196
00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 1>laugh when you tickle them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They laugh ultrasonically.</v>

197
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.440
<v Speaker 1>So you can't actually hear them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you record it and slow it down,</v>

198
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 1>then you can hear them giggling away </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you take a look with an eraser,</v>

199
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like their mother's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue.</v>

200
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 1>It's often what lab people use as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substitute for the licking of the little</v>

201
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>wrapped by the mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

202
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.880
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he discovered the place circuit and </v>

203
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:01.880
<v Speaker 1>in mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a major deal,</v>

204
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should get a Nobel prize for that.</v>

205
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:07.431
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal to discover an entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational circuit whose existence no </v>

206
00:11:07.431 --> 00:11:09.030
<v Speaker 1>one had really predicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:12.410
<v Speaker 1>apart from the fact that obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals play and uh,</v>

208
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.480
<v Speaker 1>even lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of the more social lizard </v>

209
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:17.480
<v Speaker 1>seemed to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 1>so anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but panksepp observed,</v>

211
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a brilliant piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

212
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.520
<v Speaker 1>is that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>juvenile male routes in particular,</v>

213
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.050
<v Speaker 1>like too rough and tumble play.</v>

214
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 1>They like to wrestle and they actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>pin each other just like little kids do.</v>

215
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:36.831
<v Speaker 1>Or like adult wrestlers do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pin their shoulders down and that </v>

216
00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:37.110
<v Speaker 1>basically means you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

217
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.520
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>

218
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 1>But what's even cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think while there's three things,</v>

219
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:46.671
<v Speaker 1>one is the rats will work for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to get into an arena where </v>

220
00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:50.130
<v Speaker 1>they know that play might occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's one of the scientific ways</v>

221
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Speaker 1>of testing in animals motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

222
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:57.051
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you have a starving route and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it knows that it's got food down the end</v>

223
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.640
<v Speaker 1>of a corridor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put a little spring on its tail </v>

224
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.860
<v Speaker 1>and measure how hard it pulls and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you an indication of it's </v>

225
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.771
<v Speaker 1>motivational force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine the starving rat that's </v>

226
00:12:07.771 --> 00:12:11.221
<v Speaker 1>trying to get to some food and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little spring on his tail and you </v>

227
00:12:11.221 --> 00:12:11.221
<v Speaker 1>walked in some cat odor.</v>

228
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So now that route is starving and wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of there.</v>

229
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.270
<v Speaker 1>He's going to try to pull even farther </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the food.</v>

230
00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:21.130
<v Speaker 1>So getting away plus getting forward are</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate motivational systems and if you</v>

231
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 1>can add them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real potent.</v>

232
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason why in the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring exercise that you guys are </v>

233
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.851
<v Speaker 1>going to do as the class progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asked to outline the place you'd </v>

234
00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 1>like to end up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your desired future,</v>

235
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:38.491
<v Speaker 1>and also the place that you could end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you let everything fall apart is so </v>

236
00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:43.291
<v Speaker 1>that your anxiety chases you and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach systems pull you forward.</v>

237
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 1>You're maximally motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>

238
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:50.670
<v Speaker 1>and it's important because otherwise you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be afraid of pursuing the things </v>

239
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 1>that you want to pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

240
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the fear inhibits you as the</v>

241
00:12:55.421 --> 00:13:00.421
<v Speaker 1>promise pulls you forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes you weak because you're </v>

242
00:13:00.421 --> 00:13:00.421
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>

243
00:13:00.421 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 1>You want to get your fear behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing you.</v>

244
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.450
<v Speaker 1>And so what you want to be as afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more afraid of not pursuing your goals </v>

245
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.020
<v Speaker 1>than you are of pursuing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

246
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:11.020
<v Speaker 1>very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of times in life,</v>

247
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 1>and this is something really worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>

248
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:18.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the advantages to </v>

249
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 1>being an autonomous adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you don't get to pick the best thing.</v>

250
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:23.881
<v Speaker 1>You get to pick your poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have two bad choices and you get to </v>

251
00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:27.631
<v Speaker 1>pick which one you're willing to suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and every choice has a bit of </v>

252
00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:28.570
<v Speaker 1>that element in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you know that,</v>

253
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:32.230
<v Speaker 1>it's really freeing because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>you torture yourself by thinking,</v>

254
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:35.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a good solution to this.</v>

255
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:36.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the bad solution.</v>

256
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:37.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

257
00:13:37.221 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's just risky solution,</v>

258
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:44.581
<v Speaker 1>one and risky solution to and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them are really bad,</v>

259
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but you at least get to pick which one </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to suffer through and </v>

260
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:49.950
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

261
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.390
<v Speaker 1>That actually makes quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference because you're also facing it</v>

262
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:57.160
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily then instead of chasing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is an entire different entirely</v>

263
00:13:57.161 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 1>different psychophysiological response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Challenge versus threat.</v>

264
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if the magnitude of the problem is </v>

265
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.631
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so putting yourself in a </v>

266
00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:09.631
<v Speaker 1>challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it mind frame.</v>

267
00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:13.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't just do that by magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting yourself in a challenging </v>

268
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 1>mindframe is much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much easier on you cycle physiologically</v>

269
00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 1>because you don't produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't go into the generalized stress</v>

270
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:23.641
<v Speaker 1>response to the same degree and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>activating your exploratory and seeking </v>

271
00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:26.800
<v Speaker 1>systems which are dopaminergic mediated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that involved positive emotion.</v>

272
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:31.420
<v Speaker 1>So if you can face something voluntarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than having to chase you,</v>

273
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 1>it's way better for you cycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically.</v>

274
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

275
00:14:36.971 --> 00:14:41.971
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile to go find the dragon in</v>
<v Speaker 1>its layer instead of waiting for it to </v>

276
00:14:41.971 --> 00:14:41.980
<v Speaker 1>come and eat you.</v>

277
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So and especially when you also add the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that if you go find the dragon in </v>

278
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.511
<v Speaker 1>it's layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might find it when it's a baby </v>

279
00:14:51.511 --> 00:14:53.941
<v Speaker 1>instead of a full fledged bloody monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is definitely going to take you </v>

280
00:14:53.941 --> 00:14:55.430
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the reason why.</v>

281
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of things that,</v>

282
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that emerge out of that observation,</v>

283
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 1>like don't avoid small problems that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

284
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:08.861
<v Speaker 1>are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>face them because they'll grow into big </v>

285
00:15:08.861 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 1>problems all by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about,</v>

286
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 1>imagine the Tax Department sends you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>notification.</v>

287
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.100
<v Speaker 1>You owe them like $300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

288
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's annoying.</v>

289
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't even want to open the </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter or maybe if you do,</v>

290
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:25.721
<v Speaker 1>you just put it on the shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that damn thing doesn't just sit </v>

291
00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:25.721
<v Speaker 1>there like a piece of paper on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf,</v>

292
00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:28.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ignore that for five or six years.</v>

293
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:33.310
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be come attached to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of horrible things and if you </v>

294
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 1>ignore it long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the idea,</v>

295
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 1>it's going to turn into something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is completely unlike the little piece of</v>

296
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:42.290
<v Speaker 1>paper that it's written on and and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many problems in life are like that.</v>

297
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:47.291
<v Speaker 1>You'll see they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that they popped their ugly </v>

298
00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 1>little head up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might want to turn away,</v>

299
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.440
<v Speaker 1>might not want not want to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

300
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.390
<v Speaker 1>which is the easiest way of turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

301
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't attend to it.</v>

302
00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you repress it or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

303
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.440
<v Speaker 1>You just failed to attend to it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really as a longterm strategy.</v>

304
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:07.691
<v Speaker 1>It's dismal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also something that I think that's </v>

305
00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:10.361
<v Speaker 1>more characteristic of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>high in neuroticism and high in </v>

306
00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeable people don't like conflict and</v>

307
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:16.990
<v Speaker 1>people who were high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were high negative emotion are hit </v>

308
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.200
<v Speaker 1>harder per unit of uncertainty or </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>

309
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.010
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why in psychotherapy,</v>

310
00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times the people you see need </v>
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training,</v>

311
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:29.711
<v Speaker 1>so that would be the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness or they need to help get </v>

312
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:30.590
<v Speaker 1>their anxiety and emotional pain under </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

313
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.210
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are not the only reasons.</v>

314
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 1>There's antisocial behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't fix that in therapy.</v>

315
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.800
<v Speaker 1>In all likelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's alcoholism,</v>

316
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 1>there's lots and lots of other reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are two major reasons.</v>

317
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.580
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a that was all to tell you </v>

318
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:45.580
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

319
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.700
<v Speaker 1>back to the rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>

320
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:51.701
<v Speaker 1>The rats are pulling on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can measure rat motivation by how </v>

321
00:16:51.701 --> 00:16:52.550
<v Speaker 1>hard they pull on this on the spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

322
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 1>and they're more motivated if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running away and running towards,</v>

323
00:16:56.301 --> 00:17:01.301
<v Speaker 1>but let's go back to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can take juvenile routes who </v>

324
00:17:01.301 --> 00:17:04.511
<v Speaker 1>haven't been able to play for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they've been isolated or maybe </v>

325
00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:07.901
<v Speaker 1>they just haven't been able to engage in</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical activity like many school </v>

326
00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 1>children that you might be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

327
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither allowed to play nor allowed to </v>

328
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.261
<v Speaker 1>engage in physical activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason I'm telling you </v>

329
00:17:17.261 --> 00:17:17.261
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

330
00:17:17.261 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get one of these little rats and you</v>

331
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:19.460
<v Speaker 1>can measure all hardy wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard it,</v>

332
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 1>he'll pull the go out and play or how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many buttons he'll push,</v>

333
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that gives you an indication of his </v>

334
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:27.280
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

335
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you can see that the play deprived </v>
<v Speaker 1>juvenile route will fight harder to play</v>

336
00:17:30.231 --> 00:17:35.231
<v Speaker 1>than a non play deprived juvenile rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can infer that the rat wants </v>

337
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 1>to go play and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:44.021
<v Speaker 1>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the same measurement with </v>

339
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:44.021
<v Speaker 1>everyone around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they want to do something,</v>

340
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you're going to poke and prod out them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what sort of things they're </v>

341
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:49.010
<v Speaker 1>willing to overcome in order to go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

342
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.480
<v Speaker 1>You'll object even if you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>

343
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:56.481
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a measurement device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're willing to overcome a </v>

344
00:17:56.481 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 1>bunch of your objections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

345
00:17:57.121 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 1>oh well maybe they really want to.</v>

346
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing to really know </v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's something you want,</v>

347
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.600
<v Speaker 1>you need about five arguments about why </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted,</v>

348
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.900
<v Speaker 1>because the probability that the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is opposing you will have five </v>

349
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 1>arguments about why you shouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

350
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:17.691
<v Speaker 1>is very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just won't have thought it through </v>

351
00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:19.821
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing that happens in the </v>

352
00:18:19.821 --> 00:18:22.041
<v Speaker 1>future authoring exercises that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked to articulate the reasons for all </v>

353
00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:24.600
<v Speaker 1>the goals that come out of your vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the future.</v>

354
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So you're asked like why would it be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you?</v>

355
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be good for your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be good for broader </v>

356
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.791
<v Speaker 1>society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that gives you the three levels </v>

357
00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:35.580
<v Speaker 1>of argumentation right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have it articulated down into</v>

358
00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:38.190
<v Speaker 1>detail and it's related to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>important goals,</v>

359
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.520
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a hell of a thing to argue with </v>

360
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:43.520
<v Speaker 1>because people just aren't that deep.</v>

361
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.470
<v Speaker 1>By which I mean they just don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that many levels of explanation or </v>

362
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:53.000
<v Speaker 1>objection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also really useful in </v>

363
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.221
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your own mind because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do something that's </v>

364
00:18:55.221 --> 00:18:58.251
<v Speaker 1>difficult and that requires energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different subsystems in your </v>

365
00:18:58.251 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to throw up objections.</v>

366
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:00.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

367
00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:01.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe that isn't what you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing right now.</v>

368
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:06.711
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should be doing the dishes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacuuming or watching TV or looking at </v>

369
00:19:06.711 --> 00:19:07.890
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you're really sneaky,</v>

370
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.730
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to do something hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your brain does is give you </v>

371
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.461
<v Speaker 1>something else hard to do that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite as hard so that you can feel </v>

372
00:19:16.461 --> 00:19:19.461
<v Speaker 1>justified in not doing the thing you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to because you're doing </v>

373
00:19:19.461 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 1>something else useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you give into that temptation,</v>

374
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:23.580
<v Speaker 1>which you often will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it winds and because it winds,</v>

375
00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 1>it gets a little dopamine kick and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>grows stronger.</v>

376
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Every anything you let when the internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument grows and anything you let be </v>

377
00:19:32.491 --> 00:19:35.040
<v Speaker 1>defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrinks because it's punished.</v>

378
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:40.250
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get to have its way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing really to </v>

379
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.761
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't practice what you do not want to </v>

380
00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:45.420
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because those are their neurological</v>

381
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Speaker 1>circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build those things in there.</v>

382
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

383
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.940
<v Speaker 1>they're not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can build another little machine to </v>

384
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 1>inhibit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best you can do.</v>

385
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Once they're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get them out.</v>

386
00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.920
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the ones you build to inhibit </v>

387
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.320
<v Speaker 1>can be taken out by stress and the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>habits will come back up.</v>

388
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.320
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta be careful what you say and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do because you,</v>

389
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you build yourself that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

390
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:09.540
<v Speaker 1>back to the rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

391
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.360
<v Speaker 1>So the little rat gets to go out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and play.</v>

392
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine one little rat is paired </v>
<v Speaker 1>with another route,</v>

393
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:16.170
<v Speaker 1>but the little other little route is 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

394
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Finger can percent in juvenile rats is </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to obtain permanent dominant.</v>

395
00:20:21.731 --> 00:20:26.460
<v Speaker 1>So that 10 percent bigger wrap will win </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first wrestling contest.</v>

396
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens.</v>

397
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.040
<v Speaker 1>And then the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the little route gets pinned and </v>

398
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe they play a bit and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>done with it.</v>

399
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.331
<v Speaker 1>And so you separate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you let them play again and the </v>

400
00:20:38.331 --> 00:20:41.001
<v Speaker 1>next time what happens is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate rat does the invitation to </v>

401
00:20:41.001 --> 00:20:42.230
<v Speaker 1>play and that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

402
00:20:42.231 --> 00:20:47.231
<v Speaker 1>like a dog does when it wants to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can recognize that kind of displays </v>

403
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:50.110
<v Speaker 1>its feet apart and it up and looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in sort of dances around.</v>

404
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And you can do with any kid that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clue,</v>

405
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't been destroyed by adults.</v>

406
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 1>If you little three year old kid or four</v>
<v Speaker 1>year olds are better for this.</v>

407
00:20:58.481 --> 00:21:03.481
<v Speaker 1>If you go like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know exactly what's going to </v>

408
00:21:03.481 --> 00:21:06.061
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they're ready to dart back and </v>

409
00:21:06.061 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 1>forth and they'll usually smile and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kids love rough and tumble play,</v>

410
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.290
<v Speaker 1>which is now basically illegal in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>daycares.</v>

411
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seriously is it.</v>

412
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Kids need it so desperately because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaches them the limits of their body </v>

413
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and your body and it teaches them what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>painful and what isn't.</v>

414
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.410
<v Speaker 1>And it teaches them the dance of play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And without that they're just little </v>

415
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>disembodied blobs like they have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>finance.</v>

416
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:29.380
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're checking out when you</v>

417
00:21:29.381 --> 00:21:32.560
<v Speaker 1>dance with someone you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing if they have that,</v>

418
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:37.950
<v Speaker 1>that fluency and facility for mutual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reciprocal action in embodied in them,</v>

419
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:43.141
<v Speaker 1>and if they're kind of like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and just have no sense of </v>

420
00:21:43.141 --> 00:21:44.590
<v Speaker 1>rhythm and don't pay any attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and all of that.</v>

421
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.800
<v Speaker 1>You have reason to question whether they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually inhabit their body and whether </v>

422
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.590
<v Speaker 1>they can engage in a mutual interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical interaction that's going to</v>

423
00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:58.540
<v Speaker 1>be reciprocal and mutually satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to check out and a</v>

424
00:21:58.541 --> 00:22:00.160
<v Speaker 1>lot of that rough and tumble play.</v>

425
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Even interactions between a child and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mother.</v>

426
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:08.250
<v Speaker 1>If you have a happy mother and unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant and you videotape them and you </v>

427
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.360
<v Speaker 1>speed up the video tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that they're dancing.</v>

428
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 1>So one response than the other response </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the other responds.</v>

429
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:16.750
<v Speaker 1>It might just be with eye-gaze and </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and all of that,</v>

430
00:22:16.751 --> 00:22:20.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's a dynamic interplay which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see with depressed mothers and</v>

431
00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:23.500
<v Speaker 1>their infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

432
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:28.501
<v Speaker 1>so back to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the little rat who got is the </v>

433
00:22:28.501 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 1>subordinate one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to do the invitation and then the</v>

434
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:33.610
<v Speaker 1>big rat can allow agreed to play because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in the dominant position,</v>

435
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.290
<v Speaker 1>but if you pair them repeatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is really we're thinking about,</v>

436
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:43.291
<v Speaker 1>because see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality emerges out of repeated </v>

437
00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:43.960
<v Speaker 1>interactions because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

438
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:45.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're only interact with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants,</v>

439
00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>he might as well just take advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and run off.</v>

440
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what a psychopath does by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

441
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is room in an environmental niche </v>

442
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.611
<v Speaker 1>for psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have to keep moving around </v>

443
00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:02.220
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise people figure out who </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are so they just move around and </v>

444
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 1>they can take advantage of one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:04.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe five times or 10 times or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

446
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.780
<v Speaker 1>and then the reputation spreads and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta get the hell out of there.</v>

447
00:23:07.781 --> 00:23:12.550
<v Speaker 1>But so it's not a good longterm strategy</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you can't think of a better one.</v>

448
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you repeatedly pair these routes,</v>

449
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.460
<v Speaker 1>unless the big rat lets the little rat </v>
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>

450
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.820
<v Speaker 1>at least 30 percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little rat will not ask the big rat </v>

451
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

452
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:30.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a staggering discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a staggering discovery because </v>

453
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.691
<v Speaker 1>you've got the emergence there of a of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit morality essentially that's </v>

454
00:23:33.691 --> 00:23:37.300
<v Speaker 1>even incarnated in rats that emerges </v>
<v Speaker 1>across multiple play sessions.</v>

455
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

456
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:43.590
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what Piaget said about </v>

457
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.141
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same idea at the right </v>

458
00:23:46.141 --> 00:23:46.141
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's.</v>

459
00:23:46.141 --> 00:23:48.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a massively and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a circuit,</v>

460
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:53.921
<v Speaker 1>a separate neurophysiological circuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually specialized for that </v>

461
00:23:53.921 --> 00:23:55.220
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing is also a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

462
00:23:55.221 --> 00:24:00.221
<v Speaker 1>the other thing banks have figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you deprive juvenile rats </v>

463
00:24:00.221 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>have the opportunity to engage in rough </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tumble play,</v>

464
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:07.810
<v Speaker 1>their prefrontal cortex is don't develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly and they become impulsive and </v>

465
00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:12.071
<v Speaker 1>restless and then you can fix them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>methylphenidate or Ritalin and those are</v>

466
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:16.310
<v Speaker 1>the drugs that are used to fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperactive kids,</v>

467
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:18.860
<v Speaker 1>most of whom are male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because,</v>

468
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:21.560
<v Speaker 1>well really you're going to take your </v>
<v Speaker 1>six year old,</v>

469
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 1>your five year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

470
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.540
<v Speaker 1>put them in a desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get them to sit there </v>

471
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:28.540
<v Speaker 1>for six hours.</v>

472
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:28.580
<v Speaker 1>That's your plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

473
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid plan and there they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denied the opportunity to engage in play</v>

474
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 1>and that means that their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become social is being impaired.</v>

475
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:44.740
<v Speaker 1>It may cause neurological impairment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the evidence suggests and </v>

476
00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.881
<v Speaker 1>then you suppress that within fed means </v>
<v Speaker 1>because amphetamines actually don't </v>

477
00:24:48.881 --> 00:24:53.230
<v Speaker 1>activate the play circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They activate a different circuit which </v>

478
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.920
<v Speaker 1>will suppress the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>

479
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:59.921
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not very wise and I'm not going to </v>

480
00:24:59.921 --> 00:25:02.801
<v Speaker 1>go off on that tangent because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't tell you why this school </v>

481
00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:06.101
<v Speaker 1>systems were set up that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I probably will at some point </v>

482
00:25:06.101 --> 00:25:08.420
<v Speaker 1>because it's quite an interesting story </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and of itself and it's the reason all</v>

483
00:25:08.421 --> 00:25:13.020
<v Speaker 1>you guys are sitting in desks right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody laughingly referred to this one</v>

484
00:25:13.021 --> 00:25:18.021
<v Speaker 1>says Grade Fifteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was pretty funny given </v>

485
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:18.021
<v Speaker 1>the look at the bloody place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

486
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:23.520
<v Speaker 1>a hideous and so now this is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting thing.</v>

487
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.530
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the emergence of morality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

488
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:29.300
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the emergence of morality and</v>

489
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:34.301
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got the emergence of morality and </v>

490
00:25:34.301 --> 00:25:36.161
<v Speaker 1>rats and the morality governs sequential</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions or group interactions.</v>

491
00:25:36.591 --> 00:25:41.591
<v Speaker 1>They have to repeat because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's an emergent property of </v>

492
00:25:41.591 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 1>social or repetitive interactions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you can't just localize it in</v>

493
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:49.961
<v Speaker 1>one instance to repeat it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been computer simulations of </v>

494
00:25:49.961 --> 00:25:54.731
<v Speaker 1>this too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help you figure out how you might </v>

495
00:25:54.731 --> 00:25:56.681
<v Speaker 1>attain victory across games across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need a strategy and that </v>

496
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a very simple strategy which I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe is called modified tit for tat.</v>

497
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:06.461
<v Speaker 1>So if you're nice to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm nice back and if you do something </v>

498
00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:06.461
<v Speaker 1>bad to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do something bad back.</v>

499
00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:11.140
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine you run that out in </v>

500
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.010
<v Speaker 1>sequences of a behavior and see who who </v>
<v Speaker 1>does best with what strategy across time</v>

501
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 1>or an alternative strategy.</v>

502
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Here's the best strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trust you.</v>

503
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 1>You Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start interacting,</v>

504
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.550
<v Speaker 1>you screw up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I whack you and then I forgive you.</v>

505
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:25.220
<v Speaker 1>And we started getting that's modified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tit for tat.</v>

506
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there hasn't been an issue.</v>

507
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a very simple algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one has come up with a better </v>

508
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:32.680
<v Speaker 1>algorithm in computer game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

509
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.050
<v Speaker 1>in the computerized simulation of game </v>
<v Speaker 1>space that not particular strategy.</v>

510
00:26:36.051 --> 00:26:41.051
<v Speaker 1>So it's like trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't be a pushover if someone </v>

511
00:26:41.051 --> 00:26:41.690
<v Speaker 1>violates the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to nail them,</v>

512
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.960
<v Speaker 1>but then you don't hold grudge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He opened the door to further </v>

513
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.520
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pretty smart,</v>

514
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 1>pretty smart and okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

515
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 1>so what this means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because rats can't talk,</v>

516
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.760
<v Speaker 1>can't talk and chimpanzees can't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means,</v>

517
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 1>just as piaget suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the morality,</v>

518
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:05.541
<v Speaker 1>the development of the morality precedes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of the linguistic </v>

519
00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 1>ability to describe the rules for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>

520
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.520
<v Speaker 1>He said exactly the same thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

521
00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:13.521
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As they learn how to play games before </v>

522
00:27:13.521 --> 00:27:15.951
<v Speaker 1>they know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the rules are to the games and so </v>

523
00:27:15.951 --> 00:27:19.251
<v Speaker 1>you see that with your playing peekaboo </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a kid who they can pick that up </v>

524
00:27:19.251 --> 00:27:20.730
<v Speaker 1>like really young to get that right away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's.</v>

525
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
<v Speaker 1>You can play with kids almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately after they're born if you </v>

526
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.031
<v Speaker 1>play simple enough games and so they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got that deep and they're unbelievably </v>

527
00:27:29.031 --> 00:27:32.811
<v Speaker 1>playful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've got that circuitry ready to </v>

528
00:27:32.811 --> 00:27:37.041
<v Speaker 1>go right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that makes </v>

529
00:27:37.041 --> 00:27:37.320
<v Speaker 1>kids so much fun because they just liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play all the time.</v>

530
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the play circuit and you hasn't died,</v>

531
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.570
<v Speaker 1>which is a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can use that a lot with your </v>

532
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.691
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that helps </v>

533
00:27:50.691 --> 00:27:50.691
<v Speaker 1>you love them.</v>

534
00:27:50.691 --> 00:27:50.691
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

535
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.700
<v Speaker 1>so the point is that the dam morality </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges before the representation of the</v>

536
00:27:57.361 --> 00:28:00.530
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal to know that and that it</v>

537
00:28:00.531 --> 00:28:03.480
<v Speaker 1>emerges as a consequence of repeated </v>
<v Speaker 1>social interaction.</v>

538
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a top down thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bottom up thing.</v>

539
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Now with Piaget says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

540
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:13.941
<v Speaker 1>it's not just bottom up because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens with human beings is that they </v>

541
00:28:13.941 --> 00:28:17.511
<v Speaker 1>learn to play the games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His one of his experiments was watched </v>

542
00:28:17.511 --> 00:28:19.170
<v Speaker 1>seven year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the right age,</v>

543
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.800
<v Speaker 1>play marbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you notice that they can play </v>

544
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.260
<v Speaker 1>with each other and that they can follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules.</v>

545
00:28:25.261 --> 00:28:30.261
<v Speaker 1>But then if you take the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven year olds out of the game and you </v>

546
00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:30.261
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the rules?</v>

547
00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:33.270
<v Speaker 1>They give incoherent and incomplete </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations of the rules,</v>

548
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.930
<v Speaker 1>so what that means is they've it don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really represent the rules,</v>

549
00:28:36.931 --> 00:28:40.740
<v Speaker 1>but they can act them out and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a partial representation of what they're</v>

550
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:41.400
<v Speaker 1>acting out.</v>

551
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Now when they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rural representation starts to fall </v>

552
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.211
<v Speaker 1>into alignment with the actual rules of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game and you can imagine that's why </v>

553
00:28:50.211 --> 00:28:51.060
<v Speaker 1>because when they're playing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like marbles,</v>

554
00:28:51.061 --> 00:28:52.710
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have discussions like </v>
<v Speaker 1>your treat,</v>

555
00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:57.711
<v Speaker 1>your cheating or you're not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that because they're always going to </v>

556
00:28:57.711 --> 00:29:01.101
<v Speaker 1>be pushing the envelope a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the group is going to render a </v>

557
00:29:01.101 --> 00:29:02.820
<v Speaker 1>judgment on whether or not that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate and out of that,</v>

558
00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:07.821
<v Speaker 1>the rules are going to emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not rules to begin with </v>

559
00:29:07.821 --> 00:29:09.720
<v Speaker 1>their patterns of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing as a rule.</v>

560
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.470
<v Speaker 1>A rule describes a pattern of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a pattern of behavior.</v>

561
00:29:13.471 --> 00:29:15.840
<v Speaker 1>He has a pattern of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's acted out,</v>

562
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:21.410
<v Speaker 1>so there's the individual within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group and then the interactions of the </v>

563
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:26.301
<v Speaker 1>individuals within the groups produces a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical arrangement or multiple </v>

564
00:29:26.301 --> 00:29:26.400
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical arrangements.</v>

565
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Those are games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking or stories nested </v>

566
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 1>inside an overarching story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the fundamental culture,</v>

567
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's nested in a whole bunch </v>

568
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.341
<v Speaker 1>of competing cultures that have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonalities or they would just be at </v>

569
00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:41.530
<v Speaker 1>war all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

570
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:48.180
<v Speaker 1>to some degree they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you see that back to the movie,</v>

571
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:51.970
<v Speaker 1>you see that happening in this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's very,</v>

572
00:29:51.971 --> 00:29:53.900
<v Speaker 1>very quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

573
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue fairy terns the bug into the </v>

574
00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:01.981
<v Speaker 1>conscience and then the bug tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain to Pinocchio what the rules of </v>

575
00:30:01.981 --> 00:30:06.181
<v Speaker 1>morality are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is the bug doesn't know </v>

576
00:30:06.181 --> 00:30:06.181
<v Speaker 1>because he's just a bug and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

577
00:30:06.181 --> 00:30:07.460
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just not omniscient.</v>

578
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 1>So the best he can do is to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a propaganda stick,</v>

579
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.800
<v Speaker 1>semantic verbal representation that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>internally contradictory.</v>

580
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:22.531
<v Speaker 1>And when he tells Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio has no idea what he's talking </v>

581
00:30:22.531 --> 00:30:22.531
<v Speaker 1>about and neither does the bug.</v>

582
00:30:22.531 --> 00:30:24.130
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

583
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens is this,</v>

584
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 1>that the cricket says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well pinnock maybe you and I had better,</v>

585
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 1>have a little heart to heart talk and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet says y.</v>

586
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.770
<v Speaker 1>and the cricket says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you want to be a real boy,</v>

587
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.440
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

588
00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:42.570
<v Speaker 1>sit down son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you see the world is full of </v>

589
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:42.730
<v Speaker 1>temptations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Temptations,</v>

590
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Temptations.</v>

591
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.230
<v Speaker 1>There the wrong things that seem right </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>

592
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.980
<v Speaker 1>But even though the right things may </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem wrong sometimes,</v>

593
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:56.100
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong things maybe right at the </v>

594
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.810
<v Speaker 1>wrong time or vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

595
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

596
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.550
<v Speaker 1>And needed to cricket and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

597
00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.560
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually very nicely done in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that piece of the movie because as soon </v>

598
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.990
<v Speaker 1>as you just want to slap him as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts talking like that,</v>

599
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:15.991
<v Speaker 1>because while he gets up on his little </v>
<v Speaker 1>matchbox and lectures and he's dull and </v>

600
00:31:15.991 --> 00:31:16.990
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical both at the same time.</v>

601
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.840
<v Speaker 1>And so there's nothing genuine about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's saying.</v>

602
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.140
<v Speaker 1>He's sort of imitating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's imitating something that isn't him.</v>

603
00:31:23.141 --> 00:31:25.600
<v Speaker 1>So he's really acting like a puppet at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point too.</v>

604
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.480
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't work at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Pinocchio says,</v>

605
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to be a good boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cricket says,</v>

606
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:33.820
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the spirit son.</v>

607
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And then away they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

608
00:31:37.031 --> 00:31:41.200
<v Speaker 1>so then we're at the next day because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this all happens in one night.</v>

609
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:46.201
<v Speaker 1>We're at the next day and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice day and there's these birds </v>

610
00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:46.201
<v Speaker 1>flying around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually,</v>

611
00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:48.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a bit of foreshadowing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

612
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.640
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to remember when you watch </v>

613
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.541
<v Speaker 1>something like this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a single bit of it is random or </v>

614
00:31:57.541 --> 00:32:01.321
<v Speaker 1>accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of it because you know they had to </v>

615
00:32:01.321 --> 00:32:04.531
<v Speaker 1>draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how many frames per </v>

616
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:04.531
<v Speaker 1>second these things are 30.</v>

617
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a little less than that,</v>

618
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:09.751
<v Speaker 1>but it's high quality automation and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone had to paint 30 pictures to get </v>

619
00:32:09.751 --> 00:32:12.340
<v Speaker 1>a second of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing that accidentally.</v>

620
00:32:12.341 --> 00:32:17.341
<v Speaker 1>It's really expensive and everyone has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to agree on exactly what's going to </v>

621
00:32:17.341 --> 00:32:17.410
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

622
00:32:17.411 --> 00:32:21.130
<v Speaker 1>well do the people who are doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously know what they're doing?</v>

623
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:22.530
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

624
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.420
<v Speaker 1>sort of just like you do you know it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

625
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 1>they no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no they don't.</v>

626
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.670
<v Speaker 1>And they know because they're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart and gifted and all that,</v>

627
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:32.980
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know because it's not all</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated.</v>

628
00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:37.981
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working in a group so they know </v>

629
00:32:37.981 --> 00:32:41.191
<v Speaker 1>and don't know just like you do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching it and so and when you </v>

630
00:32:41.191 --> 00:32:44.891
<v Speaker 1>do anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now they're also guided by what you </v>

631
00:32:44.891 --> 00:32:48.671
<v Speaker 1>might call they're guided by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious in the in the Freudian and </v>

632
00:32:48.671 --> 00:32:53.460
<v Speaker 1>in the cognitive way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because your unconscious value </v>

633
00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.221
<v Speaker 1>structures determine the direction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>content of your perceptions and so it's </v>

634
00:32:57.221 --> 00:33:01.271
<v Speaker 1>built right into the way you move your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes because you tend to look at things </v>

635
00:33:01.271 --> 00:33:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you value right or things you're afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

636
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:07.931
<v Speaker 1>like you look at things with valence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the decision about what has </v>

637
00:33:07.931 --> 00:33:10.910
<v Speaker 1>value is dependent on the implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of your moral system,</v>

638
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:15.911
<v Speaker 1>your purse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because morality is about what's good </v>

639
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:17.981
<v Speaker 1>and what isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's been partly a conscious </v>

640
00:33:17.981 --> 00:33:18.350
<v Speaker 1>construction of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's partly something you've been.</v>

641
00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:23.550
<v Speaker 1>You've picked up by interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like mad ever since you were </v>

642
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.411
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know all the rules anymore </v>

643
00:33:26.411 --> 00:33:28.750
<v Speaker 1>than the damn cricket did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't and you can't because </v>

644
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:32.561
<v Speaker 1>you're too complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you act them out and then you also </v>

645
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.800
<v Speaker 1>have representations of how people act </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your imagination.</v>

646
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Dreams are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a dream is.</v>

647
00:33:38.301 --> 00:33:41.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what a fantasy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that little movie that plays</v>

648
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:43.520
<v Speaker 1>inside your head when you remember what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you did is,</v>

649
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:48.730
<v Speaker 1>and you only remember the just you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even the the images stick </v>

650
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 1>representation of your behavior in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

651
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:55.571
<v Speaker 1>which is basically your episodic memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already selecting and molding and </v>

652
00:33:55.571 --> 00:33:59.750
<v Speaker 1>turning it into a relatable story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't help but do that.</v>

653
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.740
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way you can represent it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't know how you do that or</v>

654
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:08.741
<v Speaker 1>why you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of it's governed by this </v>

655
00:34:08.741 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 1>implicit morality that's part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedural memory system.</v>

656
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Part of the way you act and part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way you move your eyes and listen to </v>

657
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.041
<v Speaker 1>things and focus on them and that's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>been instantiated inside of you because </v>

658
00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 1>of this immense social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your biology,</v>

659
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:24.191
<v Speaker 1>but also this immense social project </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're continually engaged in and </v>

660
00:34:24.191 --> 00:34:27.110
<v Speaker 1>so that informs what you remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It informs what you imagined.</v>

661
00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:32.350
<v Speaker 1>It informs what we collectively imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It informs what we can collectively </v>

662
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.520
<v Speaker 1>understand and partly what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

663
00:34:34.521 --> 00:34:39.521
<v Speaker 1>you become conscious of yourself is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>map the implicit structures that already</v>

664
00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:45.560
<v Speaker 1>constitute you from society into </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit representation.</v>

665
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what self understanding means and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you have that moment of </v>

666
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.431
<v Speaker 1>insight about something you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're watching your this </v>

667
00:34:54.431 --> 00:34:58.061
<v Speaker 1>repetitive behavior that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested probably that got you in </v>

668
00:34:58.061 --> 00:34:58.310
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's your characteristic way of</v>

669
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.840
<v Speaker 1>falling accidentally into chaos and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about your problems.</v>

670
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.840
<v Speaker 1>You talk about them with your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about them and maybe you have </v>

671
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.781
<v Speaker 1>dreams about them and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to relate them and you </v>

672
00:35:10.781 --> 00:35:13.211
<v Speaker 1>have memories about them that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of because they're negatively </v>

673
00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:15.911
<v Speaker 1>tones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you talk about them and then someone </v>

674
00:35:15.911 --> 00:35:16.220
<v Speaker 1>comes up with a little statement that </v>
<v Speaker 1>links them together,</v>

675
00:35:16.221 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 1>causley and he thank God that's what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

676
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.740
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you can stop doing it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>

677
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:27.050
<v Speaker 1>or at least maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can think of some strategies </v>

678
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.680
<v Speaker 1>for not doing it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like,</v>

679
00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're acting it out,</v>

680
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.560
<v Speaker 1>you know it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until that's until the </v>

681
00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.671
<v Speaker 1>representation matches that pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that click of insight doesn't occur and </v>

682
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:42.600
<v Speaker 1>that's like a revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good way of thinking about</v>

683
00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:47.601
<v Speaker 1>it because the knowledge is there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's implicit forum and all of a sudden </v>

684
00:35:47.601 --> 00:35:47.610
<v Speaker 1>bang.</v>

685
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 1>It's been made explicit as a fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe or also as a,</v>

686
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.450
<v Speaker 1>as a set of semantic statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

687
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a crush on someone and you </v>

688
00:35:59.660 --> 00:35:59.850
<v Speaker 1>don't notice it and maybe you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself having a fantasy about him.</v>

689
00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:00.540
<v Speaker 1>You Think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

690
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that means something that indicates </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

691
00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't want to know that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want.</v>

692
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:12.030
<v Speaker 1>But the fantasy will tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you suggested,</v>

693
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.870
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of out of the Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition of free associations,</v>

694
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:20.871
<v Speaker 1>is watch yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch your fantasies because they're </v>

695
00:36:20.871 --> 00:36:22.320
<v Speaker 1>always happening and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll tell you something.</v>

696
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.580
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I do when when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interacting with my clients is we'll</v>

697
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:31.581
<v Speaker 1>have a discussion and then they'll let </v>
<v Speaker 1>their eyes will drift a little bit and </v>

698
00:36:31.581 --> 00:36:35.181
<v Speaker 1>I'll know that there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that something's flitted through their </v>

699
00:36:35.181 --> 00:36:35.181
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

700
00:36:35.181 --> 00:36:37.050
<v Speaker 1>and that means we've touched on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that has multiple,</v>

701
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.460
<v Speaker 1>a multiplicity of elements.</v>

702
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:39.600
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll stop and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

703
00:36:39.601 --> 00:36:44.601
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that you maybe you tear it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing to really watch </v>

704
00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:45.840
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you laugh or you drifted.</v>

705
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:50.841
<v Speaker 1>At least it's like it's because some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other thought has entered your field of </v>

706
00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:54.081
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you can get the person to </v>

707
00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:54.081
<v Speaker 1>grab those thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to notice them,</v>

708
00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:59.060
<v Speaker 1>then you can often figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>avenues along which that particular </v>

709
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.870
<v Speaker 1>conversation might unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a complex,</v>

710
00:37:00.871 --> 00:37:03.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a union complex or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic complex.</v>

711
00:37:03.511 --> 00:37:08.511
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's an emotional core that</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces a whole range of associated </v>

712
00:37:08.511 --> 00:37:12.981
<v Speaker 1>ideas and that thing's got a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a micro personality and it </v>

713
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 1>might have resentment and it might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger.</v>

714
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:19.610
<v Speaker 1>It's often negative emotion tinge </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the negative emotion tinge </v>

715
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:25.010
<v Speaker 1>episodes are still problems and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will emerge automatically because your </v>

716
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:29.211
<v Speaker 1>threat detection systems force them onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness essentially so you </v>

717
00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:34.311
<v Speaker 1>watch and where when you drift you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>drift and the fantasy is partly a </v>

718
00:37:34.311 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 1>representation of the problem space.</v>

719
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.600
<v Speaker 1>You know that happens when you wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>at three in the morning and you're </v>

720
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:41.600
<v Speaker 1>worried about things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

721
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Because actually what happens is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up during threat processing and if </v>

722
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.520
<v Speaker 1>you're depressed actually that gets so </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense you can't sleep,</v>

723
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.470
<v Speaker 1>so then you just lay there all night </v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying,</v>

724
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:54.770
<v Speaker 1>not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are fantasies about the </v>

725
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:55.140
<v Speaker 1>negative elements of your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present and future,</v>

726
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Speaker 1>and the fantasies can also breed </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>

727
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why Freud regarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams as wish fulfillment.</v>

728
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 1>It's partly that and he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was where he stopped.</v>

729
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

730
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:14.150
<v Speaker 1>it's partially correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fantasy will provide you </v>

731
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:17.961
<v Speaker 1>with a problem and a potential solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're more like problem </v>

732
00:38:17.961 --> 00:38:22.131
<v Speaker 1>identification mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fantasies with the possibility of a </v>

733
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.280
<v Speaker 1>solution built in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a way of thinking about that is </v>

734
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.281
<v Speaker 1>that you can generate potential futures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're like each segregated </v>

735
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 1>environments according to the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fantasy.</v>

736
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Then you can generate little avatars of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that didn't have at each of </v>

737
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.401
<v Speaker 1>those little universes and you can run </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as simulations and then you can </v>

738
00:38:44.401 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 1>watch what happens in the simulation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a catastrophe,</v>

739
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:50.290
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly not exactly.</v>

740
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.230
<v Speaker 1>That's akin to what you're doing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go watch a movie,</v>

741
00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:56.800
<v Speaker 1>except that is much more coherent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well thought through.</v>

742
00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And then just a dream which is often </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite fragmentary.</v>

743
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:06.121
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because of the dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>is willing to sacrifice coherence to </v>

744
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:08.650
<v Speaker 1>play with category structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

745
00:39:08.651 --> 00:39:11.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's why in dreams things can </v>
<v Speaker 1>change from one thing into another.</v>

746
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Really weirdly or scenes can change from</v>
<v Speaker 1>one scene to another without a logic.</v>

747
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:20.760
<v Speaker 1>The logic gets loosened so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of your thinking can widen </v>

748
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.350
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

749
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.680
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous to do that.</v>

750
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're asleep and paralyzed,</v>

751
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't run around and act out your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your suit,</v>

752
00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:36.110
<v Speaker 1>a puddle fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where you're stretching </v>

753
00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:36.110
<v Speaker 1>yourself out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no risk.</v>

754
00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Exactly and so although it can be bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so you'll wake up in terror,</v>

755
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:44.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's better than being in a </v>

756
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.210
<v Speaker 1>crocodile's mouth by a large margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

757
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.820
<v Speaker 1>back to these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these birds,</v>

758
00:39:45.821 --> 00:39:50.200
<v Speaker 1>these are used later in the movie as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of the holy spirit,</v>

759
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:55.230
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that's a standard </v>

760
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Christian symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although as I mentioned,</v>

761
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:59.551
<v Speaker 1>the dove often represents the holy </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit and we'll talk about that later,</v>

762
00:39:59.651 --> 00:40:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but this movie has very strong pagan </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements in it,</v>

763
00:40:04.121 --> 00:40:09.121
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to a strictly Christian </v>

764
00:40:09.121 --> 00:40:09.210
<v Speaker 1>symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

765
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:14.910
<v Speaker 1>but that's a foreshadowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it foreshadows is that while a </v>

766
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.821
<v Speaker 1>new day has dawned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the emergence of new consciousness </v>

767
00:40:17.821 --> 00:40:19.300
<v Speaker 1>and everything last night went well </v>
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>

768
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Everything in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the unconscious say,</v>

769
00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:24.760
<v Speaker 1>after time stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all went well and so the new day is</v>

770
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:28.000
<v Speaker 1>full of promise and so the birds are </v>
<v Speaker 1>singing in,</v>

771
00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:32.920
<v Speaker 1>the sun is shining and like hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's exactly so that sets.</v>

772
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.540
<v Speaker 1>This is the next scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

773
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:38.230
<v Speaker 1>So it sets the tenor for that scene just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the introductory song does.</v>

774
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>

775
00:40:40.451 --> 00:40:45.451
<v Speaker 1>Then you see all these kids playing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic so they're off to school </v>

776
00:40:45.451 --> 00:40:49.800
<v Speaker 1>which is presented in a positive light </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's where you get socialized </v>

777
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.020
<v Speaker 1>is Pinocchio is ready to go beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries of the familial home and he's</v>

778
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:59.791
<v Speaker 1>ready because his father prepared amend </v>
<v Speaker 1>because his mother prepared and so he </v>

779
00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:02.890
<v Speaker 1>goes off and he's not going off alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going with his conscience and which</v>

780
00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:07.891
<v Speaker 1>is sort of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think about it again as the </v>

781
00:41:07.891 --> 00:41:09.931
<v Speaker 1>internalized representation of nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and society and so he's not going out </v>

782
00:41:09.931 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 1>there alone even though he's not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at it.</v>

783
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.460
<v Speaker 1>And he's pretty excited about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so is Japan.</v>

784
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.680
<v Speaker 1>See Japan is standing there paralyzed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with terror and the kid isn't phobic of </v>

785
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.750
<v Speaker 1>the outside world and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

786
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 1>he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's treating it as an adventure.</v>

787
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though,</v>

788
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an adventure,</v>

789
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:30.970
<v Speaker 1>but adventure's can be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the other,</v>

790
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially one who's like high in </v>

791
00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.461
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who hasn't been encouraged sufficiently </v>

792
00:41:38.461 --> 00:41:42.260
<v Speaker 1>to overcome that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say their primary idea might be,</v>

793
00:41:42.261 --> 00:41:43.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if the other kids don't like me?</v>

794
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the teachers don't like me?</v>

795
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:47.630
<v Speaker 1>What if the other kids won't play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

796
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:48.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

797
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.240
<v Speaker 1>what if that's rough man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

798
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're not a playful kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could easily be the case.</v>

799
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not Pinocchio.</v>

800
00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:59.510
<v Speaker 1>He's like spinning out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to go.</v>

801
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

802
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 1>He's got naive but enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

803
00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:06.560
<v Speaker 1>well that at least gets the ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling.</v>

804
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got these two evil creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

805
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.540
<v Speaker 1>the Fox and the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

806
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I think this one's based on one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marx brothers,</v>

807
00:42:15.111 --> 00:42:17.840
<v Speaker 1>actually Harpo Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I believe never said anything,</v>

808
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but be that as it may.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are these Ne'er do well </v>

809
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:23.170
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

810
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.610
<v Speaker 1>the Fox in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now fox is a standard trickster animal,</v>

811
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

812
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

813
00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a classic animal.</v>

814
00:42:30.741 --> 00:42:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because it's good at hiding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good at hunting.</v>

815
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

816
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.710
<v Speaker 1>and coyotes are like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're classic trickster animals.</v>

817
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's Kinda like Wiley Coyote,</v>

818
00:42:42.531 --> 00:42:43.370
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

819
00:42:43.371 --> 00:42:44.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

820
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:49.150
<v Speaker 1>the warner brothers character whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>genius at large and of course whose </v>

821
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:53.870
<v Speaker 1>arrogance continually gets him walloped </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this character has a lot of features</v>

822
00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

823
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he feigns being,</v>

824
00:42:56.691 --> 00:43:01.691
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an English gentleman of the 18 nineties </v>

825
00:43:01.691 --> 00:43:02.090
<v Speaker 1>and pretends to be educated and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

826
00:43:02.091 --> 00:43:07.091
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has our kind of high blown way of </v>

827
00:43:07.091 --> 00:43:07.091
<v Speaker 1>talking and he's a fraud through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and he's got,</v>

828
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.380
<v Speaker 1>he's got this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

829
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.440
<v Speaker 1>sidekick who is barely there at all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't treat him that well,</v>

830
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.870
<v Speaker 1>but he's got someone to Lord it over.</v>

831
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.540
<v Speaker 1>So that keeps his dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing going well.</v>

832
00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:25.541
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that he's like a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate companion while he never really </v>

833
00:43:25.541 --> 00:43:29.921
<v Speaker 1>noticed is that although he'll treat him</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemptuously whenever he gets a </v>

834
00:43:29.921 --> 00:43:29.921
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

835
00:43:29.921 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 1>they're walking down the street and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

836
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

837
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Fox is bragging away about some crooked </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that he's done and how he pulled </v>

838
00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:41.081
<v Speaker 1>the wool over someone's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he confuses that with a wisdom and </v>

839
00:43:41.081 --> 00:43:45.221
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you see this </v>

840
00:43:45.221 --> 00:43:48.431
<v Speaker 1>is worth knowing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're preyed upon by a </v>

841
00:43:48.431 --> 00:43:50.240
<v Speaker 1>psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you will be to some degree at some</v>

842
00:43:50.241 --> 00:43:55.241
<v Speaker 1>point in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychopath who will be narcissistic </v>

843
00:43:55.241 --> 00:43:57.390
<v Speaker 1>will presume that you're stupid and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

844
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:02.530
<v Speaker 1>and that you deserve to be taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of because you're naive and </v>

845
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.381
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually a good thing that he's </v>

846
00:44:05.381 --> 00:44:05.381
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

847
00:44:05.381 --> 00:44:05.381
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

848
00:44:05.381 --> 00:44:05.990
<v Speaker 1>his proof for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm saying he,</v>

849
00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:08.550
<v Speaker 1>because there are more male psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

850
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:10.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

851
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.060
<v Speaker 1>the proof that you're stupid naive is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can take advantage of you.</v>

852
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And so like if you were wiser you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be,</v>

853
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd,</v>

854
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.130
<v Speaker 1>you'd know his tricks and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be morally necessary for him to</v>

855
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.770
<v Speaker 1>show you just exactly who knows what </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what.</v>

856
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:30.190
<v Speaker 1>And so the psychopath will use his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to fool you as proof of his own </v>

857
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:34.500
<v Speaker 1>grandiose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandiose omnipotence,</v>

858
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:39.530
<v Speaker 1>omniscience and narcissism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that you </v>

859
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.700
<v Speaker 1>can be fooled by a psychopath and </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually anybody can.</v>

860
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 1>So that Robert Hare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

861
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 1>who studied psychopaths for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and interviewed a lot of them,</v>

862
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:52.730
<v Speaker 1>like hundreds of them and videotape many</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the interviews he said when he was </v>

863
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:56.571
<v Speaker 1>talking to the psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he always believed what they were </v>

864
00:44:56.571 --> 00:44:58.611
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd watched the video </v>

865
00:44:58.611 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and see where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation went off the rails.</v>

866
00:44:58.621 --> 00:45:01.420
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pro,</v>

867
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.210
<v Speaker 1>the proclivity to be polite in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation is very strong.</v>

868
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:11.600
<v Speaker 1>And if you're polite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't object to the way that the </v>

869
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 1>person unfolds their strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

870
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:17.120
<v Speaker 1>And psychopaths are pretty good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to manipulate </v>

871
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.750
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to manipulate people and the </v>

872
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:21.420
<v Speaker 1>probability that you will be immune to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is extraordinarily low.</v>

873
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Go Watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by policemen on,</v>

874
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bloody.</v>

875
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.300
<v Speaker 1>That's enlightening man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Bernardo,</v>

876
00:45:30.301 --> 00:45:32.880
<v Speaker 1>he's like the CEO of a meeting in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

877
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gives the cops hell.</v>

878
00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:36.900
<v Speaker 1>It gives lawyers hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He protested his innocence.</v>

879
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:41.901
<v Speaker 1>He basically tells them that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>rude and untrustworthy because they </v>

880
00:45:41.901 --> 00:45:46.671
<v Speaker 1>don't trust him because he did a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>little things 17 years ago and he gets </v>

881
00:45:46.671 --> 00:45:47.550
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few little things,</v>

882
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:48.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

883
00:45:48.031 --> 00:45:53.031
<v Speaker 1>he killed a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the sister of his girlfriend </v>

884
00:45:53.031 --> 00:45:56.691
<v Speaker 1>at the time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a repeat sexual offender and </v>

885
00:45:56.691 --> 00:45:56.691
<v Speaker 1>murderer.</v>

886
00:45:56.691 --> 00:45:56.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he basically goes,</v>

887
00:45:56.701 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

888
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're,</v>

889
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 1>we're past that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't we?</v>

890
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a discussion with you.</v>

891
00:46:03.481 --> 00:46:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to solve help you solve some </v>
<v Speaker 1>crimes,</v>

892
00:46:05.761 --> 00:46:07.020
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I committed,</v>

893
00:46:07.021 --> 00:46:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but we won't bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

894
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:09.350
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

895
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:11.220
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're accusing me of being a liar,</v>

896
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 1>like you're not playing fair what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with you?</v>

897
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.990
<v Speaker 1>And then when they answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks at his fingernails,</v>

898
00:46:15.991 --> 00:46:20.991
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lovely little manipulative </v>

899
00:46:20.991 --> 00:46:23.571
<v Speaker 1>thing because it basically means </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens to be under my </v>

900
00:46:23.571 --> 00:46:26.871
<v Speaker 1>fingernail at the moment is much higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority than listening to your story </v>

901
00:46:26.871 --> 00:46:31.371
<v Speaker 1>and you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see people do that to you and </v>

902
00:46:31.371 --> 00:46:31.371
<v Speaker 1>then you get a little insight into what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up to.</v>

903
00:46:31.371 --> 00:46:34.390
<v Speaker 1>He's very good at that and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or he looks outside or,</v>

904
00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.990
<v Speaker 1>or are you just looking at his hands?</v>

905
00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 1>He looks out the window immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dismissive and his nonverbal behavior </v>

906
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.190
<v Speaker 1>pr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant that the courts were </v>

907
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:46.440
<v Speaker 1>forced to release that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look it up,</v>

908
00:46:46.441 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Paul Bernardo on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

909
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just mind boggling.</v>

910
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:55.700
<v Speaker 1>It's he's so good at what he does and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's good looking and he's charismatic </v>

911
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.511
<v Speaker 1>and he can really pull it off and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't tell what's happening with the </v>

912
00:46:59.511 --> 00:47:00.990
<v Speaker 1>cops and the lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're just letting him play as</v>

913
00:47:00.991 --> 00:47:05.991
<v Speaker 1>a routine to get some information from </v>
<v Speaker 1>them or whether he's actually setting </v>

914
00:47:05.991 --> 00:47:07.290
<v Speaker 1>them back on his heels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect it's a bit of both,</v>

915
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:12.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's a masterful performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't know who he was and you </v>

916
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:16.620
<v Speaker 1>were watching it without the audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd think he's the CEO of some company</v>

917
00:47:16.621 --> 00:47:19.320
<v Speaker 1>given its employees hell for not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to scratch.</v>

918
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.590
<v Speaker 1>That's all his body language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his eye contact,</v>

919
00:47:22.591 --> 00:47:24.150
<v Speaker 1>everything just speaks to that.</v>

920
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.520
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

921
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 1>you've got these two bit hoods here who </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they're really something.</v>

922
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:33.070
<v Speaker 1>They also think they're tough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and and they're not.</v>

923
00:47:33.071 --> 00:47:36.700
<v Speaker 1>They're just cowardly and cornered </v>
<v Speaker 1>dwellers.</v>

924
00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:41.701
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they confuse their unwillingness to </v>

925
00:47:41.701 --> 00:47:44.350
<v Speaker 1>abide by reasonable rules as indication </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their heroic courage,</v>

926
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:46.780
<v Speaker 1>which is something else that low rent </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoods like to do.</v>

927
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:51.810
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because lots of people </v>

928
00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 1>who just attend to the law do do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're cowardly,</v>

929
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:55.690
<v Speaker 1>which is a Nietzschean observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you good?</v>

930
00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Are you just afraid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with afraid first before we </v>

931
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.891
<v Speaker 1>proceed to good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the reason that you follow the </v>

932
00:48:04.891 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 1>rules is because you're afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting caught.</v>

933
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

934
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kids who I often university kids </v>

935
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.791
<v Speaker 1>who are in like a hockey riot and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up breaking windows and stealing </v>

936
00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:18.451
<v Speaker 1>things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get nailed for it and afterwards </v>

937
00:48:18.451 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 1>they're really blown away by their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

938
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're in that camp.</v>

939
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like they think they're good </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

940
00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:29.011
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just never anywhere where you </v>

941
00:48:29.011 --> 00:48:31.021
<v Speaker 1>could be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you put them somewhere </v>

942
00:48:31.021 --> 00:48:31.021
<v Speaker 1>where they could be bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

943
00:48:31.021 --> 00:48:32.350
<v Speaker 1>would it comes just like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

944
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.890
<v Speaker 1>that's really worth thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of you,</v>

945
00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:41.220
<v Speaker 1>many of you but not all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect have never really been </v>

946
00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:44.440
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that you could be really bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get away with it.</v>

947
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

948
00:48:45.761 --> 00:48:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

949
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but people do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

950
00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:57.541
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about some exploits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they see that this character named </v>

951
00:48:57.541 --> 00:48:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Stromboli who's a Marionette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a puppet show,</v>

952
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:00.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

953
00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:04.060
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of a wheeler dealer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember you.</v>

954
00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I showed you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mask that was glaring out Pinocchio</v>

955
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.360
<v Speaker 1>when he got his voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Stromboli isn't one of his </v>

956
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 1>manifestations.</v>

957
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:17.430
<v Speaker 1>These Fox here is another one of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations and all of the negative </v>

958
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:20.110
<v Speaker 1>characters throughout the movie are </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of the same thing.</v>

959
00:49:20.111 --> 00:49:25.111
<v Speaker 1>It's partly the adversarial individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly the theoretical aspect </v>

960
00:49:25.111 --> 00:49:26.970
<v Speaker 1>of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the negative masculine that's,</v>

961
00:49:26.971 --> 00:49:29.290
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

962
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:30.880
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when men go bad,</v>

963
00:49:30.881 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 1>they often go bad by being antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tyrannical.</v>

964
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:37.630
<v Speaker 1>So where there's way more antisocial men</v>
<v Speaker 1>than are anti social women,</v>

965
00:49:37.631 --> 00:49:40.420
<v Speaker 1>which is why there's 20 times as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>men in jail as there are women.</v>

966
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So each gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say each sex has its own path,</v>

967
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.640
<v Speaker 1>characteristic pathologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are some antisocial women,</v>

968
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

969
00:49:49.391 --> 00:49:52.240
<v Speaker 1>and there are some high neuroticism guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>

970
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:54.880
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some guys who are really agreeable as</v>

971
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:56.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

972
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.870
<v Speaker 1>but they're rarer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

973
00:49:58.871 --> 00:50:03.871
<v Speaker 1>he sees this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this a poster advertising strombolis </v>

974
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.320
<v Speaker 1>puppet show.</v>

975
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:10.380
<v Speaker 1>So strombolis a puppet master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's really worth thinking about </v>

976
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:15.001
<v Speaker 1>because that's an archetypal theme or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's at least attached to an </v>

977
00:50:15.001 --> 00:50:19.561
<v Speaker 1>architectural theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things behind the scenes pulling </v>

978
00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:24.001
<v Speaker 1>the strings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody always wonders what that </v>

979
00:50:24.001 --> 00:50:24.001
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

980
00:50:24.001 --> 00:50:25.150
<v Speaker 1>What's actually going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's actually going on with trump?</v>

981
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Who's actually in control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Putin?</v>

982
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

983
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fantasies of the left.</v>

984
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It's potent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

985
00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:38.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question always is what's going on </v>

986
00:50:38.051 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 1>behind the seed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

987
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:40.520
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case,</v>

988
00:50:40.521 --> 00:50:43.430
<v Speaker 1>certainly on the political landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business landscape,</v>

989
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.910
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

990
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:50.050
<v Speaker 1>what are you really up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's always wondering that right </v>

991
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:53.291
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're watching your eyes </v>

992
00:50:53.291 --> 00:50:55.720
<v Speaker 1>because your eyes pointed things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can infer what you're interested </v>

993
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:56.510
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what you're up to by looking at</v>

994
00:50:56.511 --> 00:51:01.511
<v Speaker 1>what you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why your eyes have whites is </v>

995
00:51:01.511 --> 00:51:03.200
<v Speaker 1>so that we can see where you're pointing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because gorillas don't.</v>

996
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.130
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what that means roughly speaking,</v>

997
00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:11.870
<v Speaker 1>is that all of your ancestors whose eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be reliably tracked were either</v>

998
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:16.871
<v Speaker 1>killed or didn't mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal for us to see where </v>

999
00:51:16.871 --> 00:51:20.951
<v Speaker 1>people's eyes are pointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're always watching each </v>

1000
00:51:20.951 --> 00:51:20.951
<v Speaker 1>other's eyes constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you up to?</v>

1001
00:51:20.951 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 1>What are you up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you looking at?</v>

1002
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:27.610
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want to know because if I know </v>

1003
00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:27.610
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can predict how you're going to behave</v>

1004
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:33.190
<v Speaker 1>and that also means I can cooperate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you or I can compete with you or I can </v>

1005
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:36.911
<v Speaker 1>lie to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the information is in the eyes </v>

1006
00:51:36.911 --> 00:51:37.850
<v Speaker 1>of surrounded by the facial display,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1007
00:51:37.851 --> 00:51:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Because that's also an indication of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and emotion.</v>

1008
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.700
<v Speaker 1>And so we're trying like our eyes are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at that.</v>

1009
00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 1>But for you guys sitting there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1010
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:51.550
<v Speaker 1>I can tell if you're looking at my eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>or at my Chin and the deviation in your </v>

1011
00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:53.360
<v Speaker 1>eyes is so tiny that it's.</v>

1012
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:58.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of miracle that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of making that perceptual </v>

1013
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:59.510
<v Speaker 1>observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so really important to us.</v>

1014
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.220
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have really good eyes.</v>

1015
00:52:01.221 --> 00:52:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1016
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Speaker 1>what's going on behind the scenes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1017
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.350
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Stromboli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be thinking it's not clear he,</v>

1018
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 1>someone you'd want to have pulling your </v>
<v Speaker 1>strings,</v>

1019
00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 1>like there's a little bit of forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm,</v>

1020
00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:20.930
<v Speaker 1>let's say there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's just not a very savory look and</v>

1021
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:23.300
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1022
00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:27.080
<v Speaker 1>the Fox knows them and they start </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Stromboli.</v>

1023
00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:32.081
<v Speaker 1>That'll joker and then what they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they could possibly involve hidden </v>

1024
00:52:32.081 --> 00:52:36.171
<v Speaker 1>in him in some sort of scam because he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in town and then they see the </v>

1025
00:52:36.171 --> 00:52:39.800
<v Speaker 1>puppet and the Fox does his equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking,</v>

1026
00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:40.510
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1027
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.530
<v Speaker 1>pretty sad but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nasty,</v>

1028
00:52:42.531 --> 00:52:47.531
<v Speaker 1>but that's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they see this puppet with no </v>

1029
00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:47.780
<v Speaker 1>strings and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1030
00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:53.050
<v Speaker 1>a puppet master would pay a lot for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is capable of semi </v>

1031
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 1>autonomous movement like that.</v>

1032
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It would be kind of a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they decided that they're going </v>

1033
00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.391
<v Speaker 1>to take them to Stromboli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they grab them and he's,</v>

1034
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.520
<v Speaker 1>he's got an apple to take to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher,</v>

1035
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:07.970
<v Speaker 1>which I think it's the cat promptly eats</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1036
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:14.290
<v Speaker 1>that the FARC saw acts out this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>false enthusiasm about what Pinocchio is</v>

1037
00:53:14.931 --> 00:53:19.931
<v Speaker 1>up to and pretends that he's his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course what your typical </v>

1038
00:53:19.931 --> 00:53:23.591
<v Speaker 1>pedophile will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is in the same kind of </v>

1039
00:53:23.591 --> 00:53:26.501
<v Speaker 1>category and it truly is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that's to know </v>

1040
00:53:26.501 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 1>about pedophiles and is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory,</v>

1041
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:33.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they don't go after kids that are</v>

1042
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:38.690
<v Speaker 1>assertive and likely to be noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They watch and they watch to see if they</v>

1043
00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:44.361
<v Speaker 1>can find a kid who's defeated and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>good enough who's defeated and who is </v>

1044
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Speaker 1>going to need a friend and who's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to object.</v>

1045
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.680
<v Speaker 1>And so when they check out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the ones who do the stranger </v>

1046
00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:54.680
<v Speaker 1>abductions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

1047
00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.270
<v Speaker 1>by the way extraordinarily rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look for a victim type.</v>

1048
00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.970
<v Speaker 1>They look for a kid who's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to take down.</v>

1049
00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

1051
00:54:04.351 --> 00:54:09.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that was really big </v>

1052
00:54:09.351 --> 00:54:10.620
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably even worse now when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a parent of young children,</v>

1053
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:13.680
<v Speaker 1>was to teach your kids how to be afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of strangers.</v>

1054
00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:18.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like a no wrong id.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not what you teach them because </v>

1055
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:24.510
<v Speaker 1>all you do is teach the men to be timid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fearful and the real predatory types</v>

1056
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:29.511
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are pretty much thrilled about </v>

1057
00:54:29.511 --> 00:54:29.640
<v Speaker 1>that because you'll also make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheltered and naive,</v>

1058
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:32.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that is you make your kids courageous</v>

1059
00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:37.431
<v Speaker 1>and you get the damn eyes open and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best thing you can do to </v>

1060
00:54:37.431 --> 00:54:38.370
<v Speaker 1>protect them against people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly dangerous.</v>

1061
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:43.730
<v Speaker 1>So none of that terrifying that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good idea.</v>

1062
00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1063
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Fox befriends the puppet,</v>

1064
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 1>and then they come up with this evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme to get them off to Stromboli,</v>

1065
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:56.871
<v Speaker 1>the puppet master and the way they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they sing a little song about being </v>

1066
00:54:56.871 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 1>an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actor's life.</v>

1067
00:54:57.601 --> 00:55:02.601
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this took me a long time to figure </v>

1068
00:55:02.601 --> 00:55:05.361
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they're taking Pinocchio away </v>

1069
00:55:05.361 --> 00:55:08.900
<v Speaker 1>to be an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now why in the world are actors getting </v>

1070
00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.640
<v Speaker 1>such a rough time in this movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a Hollywood movie,</v>

1071
00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's acting obviously the voiceovers and</v>

1072
00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:18.120
<v Speaker 1>all that are acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why.</v>

1073
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.700
<v Speaker 1>What is this thing about being an actor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>

1074
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1075
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I see what's going on that they seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio about the delights of unearned</v>

1076
00:55:28.321 --> 00:55:29.970
<v Speaker 1>celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

1077
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.950
<v Speaker 1>he's doesn't have to go and get an </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

1078
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:33.660
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have to take the difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>route.</v>

1079
00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:38.810
<v Speaker 1>He can take the easy way to dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to success,</v>

1080
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:44.420
<v Speaker 1>two dominant success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can circumvent all the hard work and </v>

1081
00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:44.420
<v Speaker 1>go right to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1082
00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:49.401
<v Speaker 1>and when you think about phenomena like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kardashians family and how popular </v>

1083
00:55:49.411 --> 00:55:54.411
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that is this desire that people </v>

1084
00:55:54.411 --> 00:55:57.651
<v Speaker 1>have for unearned celebrity because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get to the top without any </v>

1085
00:55:57.651 --> 00:56:00.210
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices and without any work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really cynical,</v>

1086
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that the people at the top are</v>

1087
00:56:02.431 --> 00:56:05.370
<v Speaker 1>just there by accident anyways and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might as well be you.</v>

1088
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:08.070
<v Speaker 1>And of course there's a lot of naivety </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that as well.</v>

1089
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.660
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a fair bit of,</v>

1090
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a fair lack of wisdom and all of </v>

1091
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:15.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actor idea here is that you can,</v>

1092
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you can pretend to be something you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not and that that's the proper route of </v>

1093
00:56:21.391 --> 00:56:23.340
<v Speaker 1>anyone wise to success.</v>

1094
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:28.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate and cynicism and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a nihilistic perspective as well and </v>

1095
00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.790
<v Speaker 1>that's how they interact and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1096
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 1>why are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you bothering to go to school?</v>

1097
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:36.220
<v Speaker 1>That's going to take 18 years with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your talents.</v>

1098
00:56:36.221 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 1>You can just go on the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your name will be up in lights,</v>

1099
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 1>you'll be out the top and no time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is the puppet?</v>

1100
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:44.350
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And plus he does have some talents.</v>

1101
00:56:44.351 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 1>He is after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a semi autonomous puppet.</v>

1102
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Now he doesn't exactly know how special </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes them,</v>

1103
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:54.721
<v Speaker 1>but the Fox can obviously see something </v>
<v Speaker 1>in him and he's good at playing that,</v>

1104
00:56:55.081 --> 00:56:57.760
<v Speaker 1>naive it often in offering these false </v>
<v Speaker 1>promises.</v>

1105
00:56:57.761 --> 00:57:01.780
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is one of the things that Carl</v>

1106
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Jung said that I thought was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting when he was talking about </v>

1107
00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:07.360
<v Speaker 1>the whole situation and families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never forgot this,</v>

1108
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:12.720
<v Speaker 1>so the eatables situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is when I'll lay out </v>

1109
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.550
<v Speaker 1>the classic story is when a child is </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously overprotected,</v>

1110
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.250
<v Speaker 1>usually a male child by his mother.</v>

1111
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Now the reverse can be the case and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be a female child by the mother and </v>

1112
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:26.581
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll just talk about the classic </v>

1113
00:57:26.581 --> 00:57:28.831
<v Speaker 1>case to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what Freud observed was that there </v>

1114
00:57:28.831 --> 00:57:32.521
<v Speaker 1>were usually not very good boundaries in</v>
<v Speaker 1>families like that and so the </v>

1115
00:57:32.521 --> 00:57:36.421
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the husband and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife was either strange or nonexistent </v>

1116
00:57:36.421 --> 00:57:40.410
<v Speaker 1>and the wife would often turn to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child to be what she isn't getting from </v>

1117
00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:44.791
<v Speaker 1>the husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a great south park </v>

1118
00:57:44.791 --> 00:57:47.521
<v Speaker 1>episode about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wonderful south park episode where </v>

1119
00:57:47.521 --> 00:57:51.301
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that horrible little </v>

1120
00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:51.301
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

1121
00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:51.301
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1122
00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:52.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1123
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:57.270
<v Speaker 1>And his mother brings in the dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>whisperer to train him and it's </v>

1124
00:57:57.550 --> 00:57:59.020
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant episode.</v>

1125
00:57:59.021 --> 00:58:02.400
<v Speaker 1>If you want to learn about Freudian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freudian eatable situation,</v>

1126
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:03.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch that.</v>

1127
00:58:03.941 --> 00:58:07.150
<v Speaker 1>You've got it down cold because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings in this expert who then she wants</v>

1128
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:07.990
<v Speaker 1>to have an affair with.</v>

1129
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:12.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's a boundary issue and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically separates her son from him </v>

1130
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:12.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1131
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and imposes the same discipline on him </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would do impose on a bad dog,</v>

1132
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:23.550
<v Speaker 1>although he also trains the dogs owners </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time because maybe it's not the </v>

1133
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:24.370
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the owner.</v>

1134
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:29.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a horse whisperer movie too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the original horse whisperer that </v>

1135
00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:32.911
<v Speaker 1>does a beautiful job of laying that out </v>
<v Speaker 1>too because he's very good at fixing </v>

1136
00:58:32.911 --> 00:58:36.721
<v Speaker 1>problem horses and unbelievably good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosing psychopathology on the part </v>

1137
00:58:37.271 --> 00:58:38.430
<v Speaker 1>of the owner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's his,</v>

1138
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:41.020
<v Speaker 1>he's got a gift for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

1139
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:46.021
<v Speaker 1>what happens in this South Park episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the dog whisperer gets cartland </v>

1140
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:51.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightened out and he starts like </v>

1141
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:51.240
<v Speaker 1>dressing properly and doing his </v>
<v Speaker 1>homework.</v>

1142
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:55.741
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mother is pursuing an affair </v>

1143
00:58:55.741 --> 00:58:58.561
<v Speaker 1>with the dog whisperer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's professionally keeps his </v>

1144
00:58:58.561 --> 00:58:58.561
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he keeps boundaries around them.</v>

1145
00:58:58.561 --> 00:59:00.280
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he leaves.</v>

1146
00:59:00.281 --> 00:59:05.281
<v Speaker 1>And then the first thing that she does </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he leaves his bride cartman </v>

1147
00:59:05.281 --> 00:59:09.550
<v Speaker 1>basically out of doing his homework so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can accompany her to know a fast</v>

1148
00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:14.551
<v Speaker 1>food restaurant or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason she does that is </v>

1149
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:16.240
<v Speaker 1>because she's lonesome and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have anybody else around and you know,</v>

1150
00:59:16.241 --> 00:59:18.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe she's also deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply,</v>

1151
00:59:18.311 --> 00:59:21.130
<v Speaker 1>deeply terrified that if she helps that </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy grow,</v>

1152
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:25.130
<v Speaker 1>he will leave and she'll have nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1153
00:59:25.131 --> 00:59:29.510
<v Speaker 1>And so mothers who don't have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>say outside their infants,</v>

1154
00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 1>not merely their children are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to fall into that.</v>

1155
00:59:32.721 --> 00:59:33.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1156
00:59:33.771 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you got to think that through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of women really,</v>

1157
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:40.490
<v Speaker 1>most women really fall in love with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their babies,</v>

1158
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:45.580
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even if they start growing into </v>

1159
00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 1>larger children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be threatening because,</v>

1160
00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:48.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>

1161
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:53.470
<v Speaker 1>when the child turns into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the infant turns into a toddler </v>

1162
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 1>that the infant is dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the toddler is there now and you</v>

1163
00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:58.970
<v Speaker 1>can radically interfere with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

1164
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 1>That happens all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1165
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the classic Freudian eatable </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>

1166
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:06.710
<v Speaker 1>And that episode is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bloody brilliant.</v>

1167
01:00:06.711 --> 01:00:11.711
<v Speaker 1>It just nails it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of you have been in my </v>

1168
01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>personality class and watched crumb the </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary crum.</v>

1169
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's another staggering exposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>of exactly that kind of pathology.</v>

1170
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things young pointed out,</v>

1171
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:25.690
<v Speaker 1>so I knew this guy wants who had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother who basically was trying that </v>

1172
01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:30.431
<v Speaker 1>trick and she had lots of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was very smart and had lots of </v>

1173
01:00:30.431 --> 01:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>tricks up our sleeves and there's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>no way he was going to go for it.</v>

1174
01:00:31.581 --> 01:00:34.580
<v Speaker 1>He rebelled at every possible moment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he basically became,</v>

1175
01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat hypermasculine in response,</v>

1176
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:42.730
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an interesting lesson with </v>

1177
01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:44.741
<v Speaker 1>regards to the hypermasculinity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys often develop if they're raised by </v>

1178
01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:48.191
<v Speaker 1>single mothers because they tend to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of two ways and he just fought her </v>

1179
01:00:48.191 --> 01:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>at every step of the way and it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1180
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.570
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I loved,</v>

1181
01:00:53.571 --> 01:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>and you can really see this in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chrome documentary,</v>

1182
01:00:55.501 --> 01:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>is that the oedipal mother basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>entices.</v>

1183
01:00:58.911 --> 01:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>The child says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1184
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do anything but you </v>

1185
01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.091
<v Speaker 1>don't get to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't leave and you don't do </v>

1186
01:01:10.091 --> 01:01:10.091
<v Speaker 1>these difficult things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll take care of you.</v>

1187
01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.620
<v Speaker 1>And the child has a choice all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>along there.</v>

1188
01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously he's outclassed in some sense,</v>

1189
01:01:15.711 --> 01:01:20.711
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as obvious as you'd think </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kids are tough and they make </v>

1190
01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:24.671
<v Speaker 1>decisions all the time and so young </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it more as a conspiracy </v>

1191
01:01:24.671 --> 01:01:26.030
<v Speaker 1>than as something imposed on the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the mother.</v>

1192
01:01:26.031 --> 01:01:31.031
<v Speaker 1>And I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a conspiracy between </v>

1193
01:01:31.031 --> 01:01:31.031
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>father and child actually.</v>

1194
01:01:31.031 --> 01:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a good way of looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it even though it's really rough </v>

1195
01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>because said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1196
01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>should you hold a child responsible?</v>

1197
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1198
01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.900
<v Speaker 1>but judiciously and not completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then if you deal with someone </v>

1199
01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>like that as an adult and they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to escape from it,</v>

1200
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>you have to go all the way back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how the hell it happened.</v>

1201
01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:53.141
<v Speaker 1>And then they have to adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to figure out where they </v>

1202
01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>opened the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like inviting a vampire in because they </v>

1203
01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:56.660
<v Speaker 1>can't come in unless you invite them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1204
01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>so don't invite them in because once </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in,</v>

1205
01:02:00.381 --> 01:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>they're really hard to get rid of and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take all your blood.</v>

1206
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's a cautionary tale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1207
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio doesn't know any better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got the egotism of,</v>

1208
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of youth and he's offered the easy way </v>

1209
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>to success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what the Fox tells them</v>

1210
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and off they go to see Stromboli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the song,</v>

1211
01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to read it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great to be a celebrity and actor's</v>

1212
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>life for me.</v>

1213
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1214
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>sleep till after to you promenade a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigar,</v>

1215
01:02:32.811 --> 01:02:37.811
<v Speaker 1>you tour the world in a private car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dine on chicken and caviar and </v>

1216
01:02:37.811 --> 01:02:39.200
<v Speaker 1>actor's life for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all this idea of,</v>

1217
01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:44.350
<v Speaker 1>of wealth and public exposure and zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention whatsoever to anything </v>

1218
01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.660
<v Speaker 1>regarding responsibility or discipline </v>
<v Speaker 1>or learning.</v>

1219
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:50.390
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a dual attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1220
01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.790
<v Speaker 1>You get everything we want and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do anything.</v>

1221
01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a deal.</v>

1222
01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what the act or </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents.</v>

1223
01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.650
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a liar.</v>

1224
01:02:57.651 --> 01:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's someone who's acting out a,</v>

1225
01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:03.500
<v Speaker 1>a deception there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a persona in the union sense.</v>

1226
01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>So the persona is the mask you wear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public that you might even think you </v>

1227
01:03:09.321 --> 01:03:10.940
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not.</v>

1228
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:14.030
<v Speaker 1>It's this mask and that's the act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the persona.</v>

1229
01:03:14.031 --> 01:03:19.031
<v Speaker 1>So the Fox and the cat or inviting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet to only become a persona and and </v>

1230
01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:23.090
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's see for young,</v>

1231
01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>you start as a persona and then when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to investigate the parts of you </v>

1232
01:03:28.941 --> 01:03:31.640
<v Speaker 1>that don't really fit in that persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the shadow.</v>

1233
01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Then you start understanding who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are and that's shocking because </v>

1234
01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:41.560
<v Speaker 1>the persona contains everything roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking that you think is good and </v>

1235
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.461
<v Speaker 1>maybe even that your immediate culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks is good and then the shadow </v>

1236
01:03:45.461 --> 01:03:48.290
<v Speaker 1>contains everything that's not part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and some of that's really bad,</v>

1237
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:52.130
<v Speaker 1>but some of it is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disguised as bad,</v>

1238
01:03:52.131 --> 01:03:57.131
<v Speaker 1>and you can't break out of the persona </v>
<v Speaker 1>and transcended until you incorporate a </v>

1239
01:03:57.131 --> 01:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>lot of what's in the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

1240
01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.610
<v Speaker 1>if you're an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate person,</v>

1241
01:04:01.611 --> 01:04:06.611
<v Speaker 1>let's say 98th percentile will say </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be sacrificing yourself </v>

1242
01:04:07.041 --> 01:04:12.041
<v Speaker 1>to other people all the time and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are people who will find that </v>

1243
01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:14.570
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily endearing and it will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>under some circumstances.</v>

1244
01:04:14.571 --> 01:04:19.571
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice yourself and that's a really </v>

1245
01:04:19.571 --> 01:04:20.270
<v Speaker 1>bad attitude to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1246
01:04:20.271 --> 01:04:23.030
<v Speaker 1>towards adult males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great thing for infants,</v>

1247
01:04:23.031 --> 01:04:28.031
<v Speaker 1>but for adult males it is the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach and so you will get taken </v>

1248
01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:32.861
<v Speaker 1>advantage of continually by people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are looking for someone like you until </v>

1249
01:04:32.861 --> 01:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>you grow some teeth and you'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1250
01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.390
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1251
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the opposite of compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being able to bite hard is the opposite </v>

1252
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:41.930
<v Speaker 1>of compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it is,</v>

1253
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.260
<v Speaker 1>and so you'll have that pushed into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory category.</v>

1254
01:04:45.261 --> 01:04:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting angry.</v>

1255
01:04:47.121 --> 01:04:52.121
<v Speaker 1>I don't like conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like until you bring that out of </v>

1256
01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.510
<v Speaker 1>the depths and put it on so you can use </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1257
01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.540
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be in trouble and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of niches,</v>

1258
01:04:56.541 --> 01:04:58.700
<v Speaker 1>idea of the reevaluation of good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

1259
01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a sense of what's good in a </v>

1260
01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>sense of what isn't with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

1261
01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's not very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got things in the wrong boxes and a</v>

1262
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.900
<v Speaker 1>lot of the things that even nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

1263
01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.370
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the things that you accept as </v>
<v Speaker 1>untrammeled goods like compassion,</v>

1264
01:05:13.371 --> 01:05:18.371
<v Speaker 1>let's say have a very dark side first of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all and are not enough to get you </v>

1265
01:05:18.701 --> 01:05:23.701
<v Speaker 1>through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need the opposite virtues to and so </v>

1266
01:05:23.701 --> 01:05:27.121
<v Speaker 1>you have to develop them and so you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the persona to do that,</v>

1267
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.760
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio was invited to be a false </v>

1268
01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.301
<v Speaker 1>persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the gains of celebrity without </v>

1269
01:05:36.301 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>having to do anything to be educated.</v>

1270
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:41.670
<v Speaker 1>He's just going to go right to the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>from right where he is and you know </v>

1271
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>people are kind of fascinated by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1272
01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:47.280
<v Speaker 1>That's why you watch America's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent or the x factor with your shows.</v>

1273
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I actually love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way you.</v>

1274
01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>You never see narcissism in its pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>

1275
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Then you see it when you watch people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who display an absolute lack of talent </v>

1276
01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:01.270
<v Speaker 1>and become homicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone dares pointed out,</v>

1277
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accusatory and homicidal instantly,</v>

1278
01:06:04.451 --> 01:06:09.451
<v Speaker 1>it's really something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then now and then you do see one of </v>

1279
01:06:09.451 --> 01:06:13.051
<v Speaker 1>these people who's so introverted and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of society and have this </v>

1280
01:06:13.481 --> 01:06:18.481
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable gift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also something really </v>

1281
01:06:18.481 --> 01:06:19.630
<v Speaker 1>remarkable to see and it's no wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are so popular,</v>

1282
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.620
<v Speaker 1>they're psychologically stored nearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1283
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:29.250
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the actor first of the nokias </v>

1284
01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:29.410
<v Speaker 1>temptations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it's the first one because</v>

1285
01:06:29.411 --> 01:06:34.411
<v Speaker 1>he's entering the social world and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temptation in the social world is to be </v>

1286
01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:38.461
<v Speaker 1>exactly what other people want you to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing that's cool about that is </v>

1287
01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:39.880
<v Speaker 1>that is what you should be doing right?</v>

1288
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.880
<v Speaker 1>When you go out in your peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be not subjugating your </v>

1289
01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.020
<v Speaker 1>individuality to your peers because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly right.</v>

1290
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.510
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of based on an inhibition </v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

1291
01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.580
<v Speaker 1>You know you've got aggression that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got bad habits.</v>

1292
01:06:51.581 --> 01:06:56.581
<v Speaker 1>They have to be inhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn that by interacting with your </v>

1293
01:06:56.581 --> 01:06:56.710
<v Speaker 1>peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right model.</v>

1294
01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.480
<v Speaker 1>PSJ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a Freudian model.</v>

1295
01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:03.481
<v Speaker 1>Piaget was was correct about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He basically pointed out that what </v>

1296
01:07:03.481 --> 01:07:06.570
<v Speaker 1>should happen is let's say with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression and hopefully you have some,</v>

1297
01:07:06.571 --> 01:07:10.360
<v Speaker 1>is that it gets socialized and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to play games,</v>

1298
01:07:10.361 --> 01:07:15.361
<v Speaker 1>but you don't drop your drive to when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you integrate that in the games and so </v>

1299
01:07:15.361 --> 01:07:16.900
<v Speaker 1>you try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you try to play hard,</v>

1300
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.540
<v Speaker 1>but if you're defeated or you hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>something negative,</v>

1301
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:24.541
<v Speaker 1>you don't respond negatively and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that all bounded within being a </v>

1302
01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:25.180
<v Speaker 1>fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good player,</v>

1303
01:07:25.181 --> 01:07:26.440
<v Speaker 1>a fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair player,</v>

1304
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:31.860
<v Speaker 1>and that means what's happening is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just learn how to play a game or a set </v>

1305
01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:35.791
<v Speaker 1>of games that also includes the darker </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of you and they actually become </v>

1306
01:07:35.791 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 1>part of your force of character.</v>

1307
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.250
<v Speaker 1>It's way better if you can pull that </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1308
01:07:39.251 --> 01:07:44.251
<v Speaker 1>It's and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you definitely want to </v>

1309
01:07:44.251 --> 01:07:44.251
<v Speaker 1>do as an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all you people are going to have to</v>

1310
01:07:44.251 --> 01:07:47.710
<v Speaker 1>learn to negotiate on your own behalf </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's really hard.</v>

1311
01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:49.570
<v Speaker 1>It means that you have to know what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

1312
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:55.540
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to communicate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be able to say no and to</v>

1313
01:07:55.541 --> 01:08:00.541
<v Speaker 1>say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be built on a solid </v>

1314
01:08:00.541 --> 01:08:00.541
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have options,</v>

1315
01:08:00.541 --> 01:08:05.160
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to remember that as you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through your life is like if you don't </v>

1316
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:08.971
<v Speaker 1>have options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't negotiate with someone and if </v>

1317
01:08:08.971 --> 01:08:08.971
<v Speaker 1>you're not willing to use them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they win period,</v>

1318
01:08:08.971 --> 01:08:11.350
<v Speaker 1>because if you're asking your boss for </v>
<v Speaker 1>more money,</v>

1319
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:16.800
<v Speaker 1>say the answer is no because he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any spare money lying around that </v>

1320
01:08:17.601 --> 01:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>he can just give to you and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people are asking,</v>

1321
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>so some of that zero some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1322
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:28.540
<v Speaker 1>not all of it because often you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperate with people in the whole pot </v>

1323
01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:31.481
<v Speaker 1>can grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of it's zero sum and so you </v>

1324
01:08:31.481 --> 01:08:31.481
<v Speaker 1>better have a case made.</v>

1325
01:08:31.481 --> 01:08:33.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why I should.</v>

1326
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Here's how much money I should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's why.</v>

1327
01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's the benefit to you that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>accrue if you don't,</v>

1328
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.360
<v Speaker 1>if you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the consequences that you don't.</v>

1329
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>They're actually real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will cost you and I will do them.</v>

1330
01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like then you can negotiate and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that rudely,</v>

1331
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.250
<v Speaker 1>but those arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better have them in order like so.</v>

1332
01:08:52.251 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to negotiate for a raise</v>

1333
01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:58.360
<v Speaker 1>or a or a status shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better have your resume out,</v>

1334
01:08:58.361 --> 01:09:03.361
<v Speaker 1>hand all polished up and nowhere else </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to look for a job and you </v>

1335
01:09:03.361 --> 01:09:05.240
<v Speaker 1>better be able to get one because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're just.</v>

1336
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 1>You're weak and you will not win the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiation,</v>

1337
01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:11.720
<v Speaker 1>and if you're too agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your conflict avoidant,</v>

1338
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:16.910
<v Speaker 1>you will make less money across time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's already been well established and</v>

1339
01:09:16.911 --> 01:09:20.120
<v Speaker 1>that's because you don't have teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enough,</v>

1340
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:24.890
<v Speaker 1>and so in the little micro contests that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have every day,</v>

1341
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.150
<v Speaker 1>you're going to incrementally lose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are more aggressive,</v>

1342
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:32.750
<v Speaker 1>who have bigger teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happens so,</v>

1343
01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.110
<v Speaker 1>so don't let that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>

1344
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you place yourself so you can negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise</v>

1345
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.970
<v Speaker 1>you're just a facade and when a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle of facade is just torn down right</v>

1346
01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

1347
01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.310
<v Speaker 1>well say no more.</v>

1348
01:09:55.530 --> 01:09:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cricket,</v>

1349
01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:58.440
<v Speaker 1>he's supposed to be helping to pop it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1350
01:09:58.441 --> 01:09:59.970
<v Speaker 1>but he overslept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1351
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:03.660
<v Speaker 1>that's just another indication that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everything he could be yet,</v>

1352
01:10:03.661 --> 01:10:08.661
<v Speaker 1>and that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that took me a long time to puzzle out </v>

1353
01:10:08.661 --> 01:10:10.080
<v Speaker 1>with regards to interpreting this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not figure out,</v>

1354
01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you this,</v>

1355
01:10:11.281 --> 01:10:16.281
<v Speaker 1>if the bug is the person who opens the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero narrative and who can guide the </v>

1356
01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:19.410
<v Speaker 1>transformations of time and who has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same initials as Jesus Christ,</v>

1357
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:23.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like knighted by nature herself.</v>

1358
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Why is he such an idiot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult thing to figure </v>

1359
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.790
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1360
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:31.140
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that the conscience isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>omniscient,</v>

1361
01:10:31.141 --> 01:10:33.540
<v Speaker 1>even though it has that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that voice of,</v>

1362
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:35.920
<v Speaker 1>of let's say common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1363
01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.690
<v Speaker 1>and that fits very nicely in with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freudian idea of the Super Ego.</v>

1364
01:10:39.691 --> 01:10:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Super Ego can be flawed,</v>

1365
01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:43.860
<v Speaker 1>it can be too harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can not be,</v>

1366
01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:45.720
<v Speaker 1>it can not be properly developed.</v>

1367
01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:48.390
<v Speaker 1>You see that often with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>

1368
01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 1>so they're high in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness fragments into </v>

1369
01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.290
<v Speaker 1>industriousness and orderliness orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like willpower,</v>

1370
01:10:55.350 --> 01:11:00.350
<v Speaker 1>they're very judgmental and they like </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to be exactly where they're </v>

1371
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also very self punitive.</v>

1372
01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:05.480
<v Speaker 1>So conservatives are much more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be orderly by the way it's.</v>

1373
01:11:05.481 --> 01:11:10.481
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best predictors of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative low openness is the best </v>

1374
01:11:10.481 --> 01:11:11.670
<v Speaker 1>predictor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right after that is high,</v>

1375
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 1>high orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1376
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's associated with disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>

1377
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:20.610
<v Speaker 1>which is really an amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that later.</v>

1378
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cricket.</v>

1379
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he falls down on his first day on the </v>

1380
01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:28.950
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not as conscientious a conscious.</v>

1381
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.180
<v Speaker 1>He's not as conscientious a conscience </v>
<v Speaker 1>as he should be.</v>

1382
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So he's feeling pretty stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his little millionaire clothes </v>

1383
01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:38.690
<v Speaker 1>on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's really not living up to them.</v>

1384
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:43.530
<v Speaker 1>So he does catch up to the Fox and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet however,</v>

1385
01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:48.740
<v Speaker 1>and tries to dissuade Pinocchio from </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down this road hand.</v>

1386
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Of course the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can see what the cat is doing.</v>

1387
01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Mary's going to big hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big Mellott and he's gonna.</v>

1388
01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.340
<v Speaker 1>He also shows you just exactly how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a clue he has.</v>

1389
01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>He's going to wall up the bug who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on the foxes hat,</v>

1390
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.070
<v Speaker 1>which I think he actually does and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1391
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:08.280
<v Speaker 1>then the farcs can't get out of his hat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and has to talk through his hat,</v>

1392
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:10.110
<v Speaker 1>which basically is what he's doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>

1393
01:12:10.111 --> 01:12:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this I really like.</v>

1394
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:19.290
<v Speaker 1>So you see on the left here that cricket</v>
<v Speaker 1>is speaking inside this flower,</v>

1395
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:21.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like I said,</v>

1396
01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing accidental in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these representations.</v>

1397
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:29.070
<v Speaker 1>So these are artists who are coming up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these compositions and they fantasy</v>

1398
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:33.480
<v Speaker 1>has a structure and so the cricket is </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking out of this flower that has.</v>

1399
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it as,</v>

1400
01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:37.320
<v Speaker 1>it has a sexualized element.</v>

1401
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:42.320
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about that as a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and not part of the feminine part of </v>

1402
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:42.320
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1403
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.420
<v Speaker 1>they are flowers after all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the sex organs of plants.</v>

1404
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's very much the same over here </v>

1405
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:51.330
<v Speaker 1>as this is the Yoni and lingam misses </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1406
01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.230
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1407
01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:53.820
<v Speaker 1>from Hindu cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1408
01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.010
<v Speaker 1>and they see there's a snake wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>

1409
01:12:56.011 --> 01:13:01.011
<v Speaker 1>And so that's masculine and feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a snake wrapped around it and </v>

1410
01:13:01.011 --> 01:13:02.520
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a wholly representation,</v>

1411
01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacred representation and it represents,</v>

1412
01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:09.270
<v Speaker 1>it represents the deepest reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>

1413
01:13:09.271 --> 01:13:11.490
<v Speaker 1>like chaos and order surrounded by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>

1414
01:13:11.491 --> 01:13:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the same idea.</v>

1415
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:18.360
<v Speaker 1>And so the cricket speaks out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>already know that because the cricket is</v>

1416
01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:21.690
<v Speaker 1>the conscience and he's been awakened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>part by by Japan,</v>

1417
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Eto and the good father and awakened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part by the good fairy and nature.</v>

1418
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 1>And so he speaks with those voices and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's also a manifestation of,</v>

1419
01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:36.420
<v Speaker 1>of the underlying chaos itself because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and culture spring out of chaos.</v>

1420
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:42.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already showed you that schematic </v>

1421
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.290
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1422
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:46.430
<v Speaker 1>So I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just end this scene and then we'll </v>

1423
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:47.760
<v Speaker 1>have like a 15 minute break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1424
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cricket tries to make a case for why</v>

1425
01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio shouldn't go off to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity,</v>

1426
01:13:55.021 --> 01:13:58.830
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard case to make because the Fox</v>

1427
01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:04.070
<v Speaker 1>is very manipulative and Pinocchio is </v>
<v Speaker 1>naive and it sounds like a good offer.</v>

1428
01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:06.600
<v Speaker 1>And also the Fox is actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>forceful,</v>

1429
01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he basically takes them by the hand.</v>

1430
01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:12.880
<v Speaker 1>So the temptation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something else I liked about</v>

1431
01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just say,</v>

1432
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:19.291
<v Speaker 1>well the puppet gets what he deserves </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's little naive and what he's </v>

1433
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.080
<v Speaker 1>facing is really malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly malevolent and physically </v>

1434
01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.191
<v Speaker 1>overpowering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the movie does a nice job of not </v>

1435
01:14:29.191 --> 01:14:31.180
<v Speaker 1>minimizing the threat that's posed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular temptation.</v>

1436
01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of what makes it art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1437
01:14:34.151 --> 01:14:35.260
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll stop there.</v>

1438
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:38.140
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a break for 15 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll start with the stage.</v>

1439
01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1440
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:44.520
<v Speaker 1>So here we are at the big event in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio is off to be a celebrity.</v>

1441
01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.120
<v Speaker 1>And the cricket is watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a Pinocchio basically.</v>

1442
01:14:56.190 --> 01:14:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Well he's got some natural talent </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's,</v>

1443
01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:03.740
<v Speaker 1>he's a puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have strings and he goes on </v>

1444
01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.721
<v Speaker 1>stage and with strings and then he drops</v>
<v Speaker 1>his strings and the whole crowd was </v>

1445
01:15:05.721 --> 01:15:09.501
<v Speaker 1>amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the crowds should be amazed when </v>

1446
01:15:09.501 --> 01:15:09.501
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1447
01:15:09.501 --> 01:15:13.490
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine when a kid goes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>school and show some independence that </v>

1448
01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:15.660
<v Speaker 1>that's actually gonna.</v>

1449
01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:21.950
<v Speaker 1>People are gonna notice that he's his </v>
<v Speaker 1>peers are gonna notice that the teachers</v>

1450
01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:24.920
<v Speaker 1>are going to notice that maybe it's too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much independence even.</v>

1451
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still a.</v>

1452
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:29.660
<v Speaker 1>It is a remarkable thing to like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting.</v>

1453
01:15:29.661 --> 01:15:31.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see marked signs of independence</v>

1454
01:15:31.851 --> 01:15:33.640
<v Speaker 1>and children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1455
01:15:33.650 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 1>right from the time they're born </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically because what's one of the </v>

1456
01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 1>things that's really funny about infants</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

1457
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:40.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're crying you always say,</v>

1458
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:43.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby's while you're crying.</v>

1459
01:15:43.401 --> 01:15:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1460
01:15:44.871 --> 01:15:49.871
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the time that maybe is angry </v>

1461
01:15:49.871 --> 01:15:53.230
<v Speaker 1>and the way that we know that is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do facial expression coding on</v>

1462
01:15:53.751 --> 01:15:58.751
<v Speaker 1>infants just like on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on adults and you can tell what emotion </v>

1463
01:15:58.751 --> 01:16:02.921
<v Speaker 1>they're expressing and very frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when the kid starts to recognize </v>

1464
01:16:02.921 --> 01:16:06.791
<v Speaker 1>his mom explicitly because he or she </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows the smell right away pretty much </v>

1465
01:16:06.951 --> 01:16:07.850
<v Speaker 1>in the sound of the voice.</v>

1466
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:12.590
<v Speaker 1>But visually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes in and it isn't who the</v>

1467
01:16:12.591 --> 01:16:15.170
<v Speaker 1>baby wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so generally it isn't mom,</v>

1468
01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.660
<v Speaker 1>the baby will start to cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not [inaudible] the baby.</v>

1469
01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:22.661
<v Speaker 1>Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally it's because it's angry that </v>

1470
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:23.360
<v Speaker 1>mom didn't show up and that's an early </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign of will.</v>

1471
01:16:23.361 --> 01:16:28.361
<v Speaker 1>It's like this kid has this kid wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like and it's perfectly willing </v>

1472
01:16:28.361 --> 01:16:33.160
<v Speaker 1>to tell you about that and of course a </v>
<v Speaker 1>two year old who's having a temper </v>

1473
01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.130
<v Speaker 1>tantrum is in some sense doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1474
01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:37.520
<v Speaker 1>It's poorly integrated will and </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence obviously,</v>

1475
01:16:37.521 --> 01:16:40.220
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly runs contrary to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

1476
01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.400
<v Speaker 1>You don't want your two year old having </v>
<v Speaker 1>a temper tantrum in the middle of the </v>

1477
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.041
<v Speaker 1>toy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily embarrassing for </v>

1478
01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:51.071
<v Speaker 1>you and while for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also embarrassing for the two </v>

1479
01:16:51.071 --> 01:16:54.491
<v Speaker 1>year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons I think that </v>

1480
01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:56.261
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing should be carefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialized rapidly because it's actually</v>

1481
01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:02.320
<v Speaker 1>humiliating for the kid because other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like that and they're very </v>

1482
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:02.960
<v Speaker 1>judgemental about like they won't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything usually,</v>

1483
01:17:02.961 --> 01:17:07.961
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not happy about the fact </v>

1484
01:17:07.961 --> 01:17:09.080
<v Speaker 1>that that's happening and they will </v>
<v Speaker 1>judge the child negatively.</v>

1485
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:14.470
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want your child to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaving in a way in public that makes </v>

1486
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:17.600
<v Speaker 1>other people think badly of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

1487
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:22.790
<v Speaker 1>it's really not good and so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're part of your job as a parent is </v>

1488
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:25.820
<v Speaker 1>to not expose your child to that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

1489
01:17:25.821 --> 01:17:30.821
<v Speaker 1>especially not repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard on them or they get </v>

1490
01:17:30.821 --> 01:17:32.660
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also really hard on them.</v>

1491
01:17:32.661 --> 01:17:37.661
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot longer to manifest </v>

1492
01:17:37.661 --> 01:17:37.661
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1493
01:17:37.661 --> 01:17:40.900
<v Speaker 1>he's off on stage and Stromboli </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduces him and talks about how </v>

1494
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:45.311
<v Speaker 1>wonderful this is going to be and Nokia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes out on stage with the strings </v>

1495
01:17:45.311 --> 01:17:47.920
<v Speaker 1>on and drops them and then he falls down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steps and put his nose in the whole.</v>

1496
01:17:47.921 --> 01:17:52.921
<v Speaker 1>It makes a fool out of himself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when Stromboli first time </v>

1497
01:17:52.921 --> 01:17:55.961
<v Speaker 1>Stromboli shows his true character </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he just really yells and screams</v>

1498
01:17:56.511 --> 01:18:01.511
<v Speaker 1>at him and he has his back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience Stromboli while he's doing </v>

1499
01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:01.511
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1500
01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:03.260
<v Speaker 1>So he's not noticing how the audience is</v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting.</v>

1501
01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Typical to radical parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1502
01:18:05.211 --> 01:18:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Who's not noticing that society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting a different way than in him and</v>

1503
01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:14.801
<v Speaker 1>he's not happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Pinocchio of course is dazed and </v>

1504
01:18:14.801 --> 01:18:17.270
<v Speaker 1>feels like a fool and he is a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's appropriate.</v>

1505
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:21.050
<v Speaker 1>But then Stromboli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the crowd laughing,</v>

1506
01:18:21.051 --> 01:18:23.420
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as he turns around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like all smiles again,</v>

1507
01:18:23.421 --> 01:18:28.421
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the first time you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>insight into what sort of puppet master </v>

1508
01:18:28.421 --> 01:18:32.081
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's there to please the crowd and that </v>

1509
01:18:32.081 --> 01:18:32.081
<v Speaker 1>all and he's there to look good in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

1510
01:18:32.081 --> 01:18:34.040
<v Speaker 1>But fundamentally he's a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1511
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:37.610
<v Speaker 1>and I guess that's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with false celebrity is that</v>

1512
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:40.970
<v Speaker 1>the negative spirit of the crowd becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>your master,</v>

1513
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because to be a celebrity you have to be</v>

1514
01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:46.100
<v Speaker 1>a crowd pleaser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're pleasing the kind of crowd</v>

1515
01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:49.250
<v Speaker 1>who likes a celebrity like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1516
01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and there's not much reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's not exactly like you're </v>

1517
01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:57.490
<v Speaker 1>appealing to the proper side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd and you've become,</v>

1518
01:18:57.491 --> 01:19:00.850
<v Speaker 1>it's puppet one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's rewarding you with wealth</v>

1519
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:05.880
<v Speaker 1>perhaps and with attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fundamentally it's not.</v>

1520
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:12.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not something I would recommend if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to stay reasonably </v>

1521
01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:13.270
<v Speaker 1>psychologically healthy for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable amount of time,</v>

1522
01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sell yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean not in any casual way,</v>

1523
01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:17.740
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1524
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:20.450
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1525
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Stromboli changes from the tyrant to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good father in half a second,</v>

1526
01:19:25.521 --> 01:19:30.521
<v Speaker 1>He gives Pinocchio Pat on the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that he's made a </v>

1527
01:19:30.521 --> 01:19:31.580
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks all kind and the show continues.</v>

1528
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cricket is not very happy about </v>

1529
01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:36.700
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sitting in the stage watching.</v>

1530
01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:40.970
<v Speaker 1>He's very angry and let's say disgusted </v>
<v Speaker 1>by what's happening,</v>

1531
01:19:40.971 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>partly because Pinocchio was making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fool of himself.</v>

1532
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Now that's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1533
01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:49.640
<v Speaker 1>human beings blush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1534
01:19:49.641 --> 01:19:52.340
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name Adam,</v>

1535
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Adam and eve is related to the </v>

1536
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 1>capacity to blush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that,</v>

1537
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:59.450
<v Speaker 1>that comes from something I read a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago,</v>

1538
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:04.451
<v Speaker 1>and that might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Adam does manifest shame in the </v>

1539
01:20:04.451 --> 01:20:04.730
<v Speaker 1>sight of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

1540
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:07.160
<v Speaker 1>there is a relationship there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

1541
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:11.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do make fools of themselves for,</v>

1542
01:20:11.171 --> 01:20:16.171
<v Speaker 1>for public display.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell you've done that in </v>

1543
01:20:16.171 --> 01:20:18.621
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not always if you blush because you've </v>

1544
01:20:18.621 --> 01:20:20.580
<v Speaker 1>either said something you shouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1545
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more like you've,</v>

1546
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.620
<v Speaker 1>you've tried to be funny and gotten a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit too far.</v>

1547
01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:29.730
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that can be really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you said something that you know,</v>

1548
01:20:29.731 --> 01:20:32.700
<v Speaker 1>to be false,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulative,</v>

1549
01:20:32.701 --> 01:20:35.820
<v Speaker 1>deceitful beneath you or any of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1550
01:20:35.821 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 1>and you'll have an automatic response to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1551
01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:43.130
<v Speaker 1>It'd be ashamed and blush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one theory about that is that you </v>

1552
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:46.431
<v Speaker 1>can trust people who blush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because you know that their </v>

1553
01:20:46.431 --> 01:20:48.870
<v Speaker 1>conscience will be trade that and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that even if they are lying,</v>

1554
01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:51.720
<v Speaker 1>they tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's an interesting theory,</v>

1555
01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because blush is definitely like,</v>

1556
01:20:54.061 --> 01:20:55.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a facial display,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1557
01:20:55.441 --> 01:20:57.150
<v Speaker 1>it's right out there where people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>

1558
01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1559
01:20:59.281 --> 01:21:00.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it isn't,</v>

1560
01:21:00.601 --> 01:21:02.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

1561
01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:04.230
<v Speaker 1>The cricket is not happy with what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1562
01:21:04.231 --> 01:21:09.231
<v Speaker 1>He's not happy boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stromboli and he's not happy about the </v>

1563
01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:12.621
<v Speaker 1>willingness of Pinocchio to make a fool </v>
<v Speaker 1>of himself to support this false </v>

1564
01:21:12.621 --> 01:21:12.870
<v Speaker 1>celebrity.</v>

1565
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:18.470
<v Speaker 1>And so I actually think that's why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity types like that often get </v>

1566
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.060
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic and arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1567
01:21:21.061 --> 01:21:25.320
<v Speaker 1>it's because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they aren't paying attention,</v>

1568
01:21:26.010 --> 01:21:28.950
<v Speaker 1>they're not paying attention really to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening inside of them.</v>

1569
01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:33.951
<v Speaker 1>They drowned it out because the glory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the money and all that is so </v>

1570
01:21:34.111 --> 01:21:36.420
<v Speaker 1>attractive and enticing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't notice.</v>

1571
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:41.480
<v Speaker 1>They refuse to notice what price they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying for it and they magnify up their </v>

1572
01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.620
<v Speaker 1>grandiosity and their arrogance to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff all under control.</v>

1573
01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.080
<v Speaker 1>And then of course they get surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>by sycophants,</v>

1574
01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:47.670
<v Speaker 1>which is a really bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1575
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get surrounded by people who will </v>

1576
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.191
<v Speaker 1>tell them exactly what they want to hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really bad if what you want </v>

1577
01:21:55.191 --> 01:21:58.320
<v Speaker 1>to hear from other people is not good </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to surround yourself with people</v>

1578
01:21:58.321 --> 01:22:03.240
<v Speaker 1>who won't offer you genuine criticism or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even genuine reward.</v>

1579
01:22:03.241 --> 01:22:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing like you want for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1580
01:22:05.311 --> 01:22:10.311
<v Speaker 1>that I differentially reward and punish </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in approximately the way that the </v>

1581
01:22:10.311 --> 01:22:11.970
<v Speaker 1>good part of the crowd will.</v>

1582
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:17.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want from all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends because then your interactions </v>

1583
01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:19.770
<v Speaker 1>with them can generalize out to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader community in a productive way.</v>

1584
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:21.570
<v Speaker 1>And so a good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1585
01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:26.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean your friends tend to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive side and perhaps that's </v>

1586
01:22:26.571 --> 01:22:27.210
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming there's reciprocity,</v>

1587
01:22:27.211 --> 01:22:30.900
<v Speaker 1>but a good friend will also tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when one way or another,</v>

1588
01:22:30.901 --> 01:22:35.901
<v Speaker 1>when your behavior is starting to tilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a direction that's going to make you </v>

1589
01:22:35.901 --> 01:22:37.560
<v Speaker 1>unpopular with them and likely unpopular</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people,</v>

1590
01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:39.630
<v Speaker 1>and of course that's what a parent is </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed.</v>

1591
01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:42.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the prime job of a parent in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>

1592
01:22:42.241 --> 01:22:44.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

1593
01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Other people will hurt you if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that by exclusion,</v>

1594
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:53.460
<v Speaker 1>by threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by failure to offer you an opportunity,</v>

1595
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:56.760
<v Speaker 1>bad things will happen to you so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do that,</v>

1596
01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.810
<v Speaker 1>and then you're a representative of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social situation,</v>

1597
01:23:00.811 --> 01:23:03.300
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a friend,</v>

1598
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:08.870
<v Speaker 1>so or at least not precisely a friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make you an enemy.</v>

1599
01:23:10.810 --> 01:23:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It makes you better than a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1600
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:18.421
<v Speaker 1>so minimal cues on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a fool of himself and then he </v>

1601
01:23:18.421 --> 01:23:19.570
<v Speaker 1>gets all tangled up in other puppet </v>
<v Speaker 1>strings.</v>

1602
01:23:19.571 --> 01:23:24.571
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to them and the and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it all ends rather badly with </v>

1603
01:23:24.571 --> 01:23:26.470
<v Speaker 1>everything being a tangled mess on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>

1604
01:23:26.471 --> 01:23:28.600
<v Speaker 1>but it also turns out to be rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

1605
01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:33.580
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because he's surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry Russians know,</v>

1606
01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:38.610
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could kind of view that as a </v>

1607
01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:40.471
<v Speaker 1>potential lesson is that if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet on a stage and you mess around </v>

1608
01:23:40.471 --> 01:23:44.401
<v Speaker 1>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just might get tangled up with a </v>

1609
01:23:44.401 --> 01:23:44.401
<v Speaker 1>bunch of angry Russians and these are </v>
<v Speaker 1>costs acts.</v>

1610
01:23:44.401 --> 01:23:47.170
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1611
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:48.820
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1612
01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.310
<v Speaker 1>that's not what's happening here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still funny.</v>

1613
01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:52.390
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1614
01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Stromboli is not happy with the tangled </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass,</v>

1615
01:23:57.131 --> 01:24:02.131
<v Speaker 1>but then the crowd reacts very </v>
<v Speaker 1>positively and then that confuses the </v>

1616
01:24:02.131 --> 01:24:02.131
<v Speaker 1>conscience because he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

1617
01:24:02.131 --> 01:24:03.460
<v Speaker 1>this is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a tyrant,</v>

1618
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:05.710
<v Speaker 1>like Pinocchio's making a fool of </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

1619
01:24:05.711 --> 01:24:10.711
<v Speaker 1>Everything turns into a tangled mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the crowd goes crazy and well being </v>

1620
01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:14.080
<v Speaker 1>a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be entertaining,</v>

1621
01:24:14.081 --> 01:24:16.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to tell when the crowd,</v>

1622
01:24:16.961 --> 01:24:21.961
<v Speaker 1>especially at a spectacle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's this crowd is at a </v>

1623
01:24:21.961 --> 01:24:24.691
<v Speaker 1>spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know exactly why it is </v>

1624
01:24:24.691 --> 01:24:26.170
<v Speaker 1>that they're responding positively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've definitely give them what you</v>

1625
01:24:26.171 --> 01:24:31.171
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see this look on strombolis </v>

1626
01:24:31.171 --> 01:24:31.171
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this false.</v>

1627
01:24:31.171 --> 01:24:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this false kindness and generosity,</v>

1628
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:38.190
<v Speaker 1>public facing and oh well anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscience is very confused and I </v>

1629
01:24:38.351 --> 01:24:41.560
<v Speaker 1>really think this is an important thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've often thought I spent a lot</v>

1630
01:24:41.561 --> 01:24:43.450
<v Speaker 1>of time thinking about Hitler and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

1631
01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:46.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get into a state like that?</v>

1632
01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you think?</v>

1633
01:24:48.251 --> 01:24:53.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a dictator and he led his people </v>

1634
01:24:53.251 --> 01:24:53.251
<v Speaker 1>down a bad path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1635
01:24:53.251 --> 01:24:54.880
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not what happened.</v>

1636
01:24:56.350 --> 01:25:00.610
<v Speaker 1>They had a conspiracy together and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>down a bad path.</v>

1637
01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Now think about it this way.</v>

1638
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1639
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:06.440
<v Speaker 1>If one person thinks something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1640
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:08.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1641
01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.360
<v Speaker 1>But if five people tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1642
01:25:11.361 --> 01:25:16.361
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then then to start to start not taken </v>

1643
01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:16.580
<v Speaker 1>that seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of narcissistic.</v>

1644
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it isn't five,</v>

1645
01:25:17.991 --> 01:25:22.991
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's 15 people tell you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing or act the same way towards </v>

1646
01:25:22.991 --> 01:25:24.920
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like probably you should clue in,</v>

1647
01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.040
<v Speaker 1>well what if you're a politician and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying out a bunch of different </v>

1648
01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.050
<v Speaker 1>ideas and you're good at interacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the crowd,</v>

1649
01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.240
<v Speaker 1>you're charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch the crowd,</v>

1650
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:38.060
<v Speaker 1>but you're not necessarily all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate.</v>

1651
01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:39.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't have your values all </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightened out,</v>

1652
01:25:39.671 --> 01:25:43.010
<v Speaker 1>but you're kind of angry too and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because you spent a bunch of time</v>

1653
01:25:43.011 --> 01:25:48.011
<v Speaker 1>in World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world war one in the trenches which was </v>

1654
01:25:48.011 --> 01:25:49.190
<v Speaker 1>like no joke and all your friends got </v>
<v Speaker 1>blown up.</v>

1655
01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:54.660
<v Speaker 1>You had when you were unemployed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you tried to be an artist and that </v>

1656
01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.671
<v Speaker 1>didn't work out even though you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderately talented and then maybe the </v>

1657
01:25:57.671 --> 01:26:00.881
<v Speaker 1>economy fell apart completely on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperinflation and then maybe there was </v>

1658
01:26:00.881 --> 01:26:05.561
<v Speaker 1>a communist menace coming in from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>east and they're genuinely was and so </v>

1659
01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:10.210
<v Speaker 1>you're not the world's happiest clam at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point and you're talking to people </v>

1660
01:26:10.210 --> 01:26:14.770
<v Speaker 1>who aren't that happy either because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were also badly defeated in world </v>

1661
01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:14.770
<v Speaker 1>war one.</v>

1662
01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:16.130
<v Speaker 1>And then they had a terrible treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had decided they lost part of their</v>

1663
01:26:16.131 --> 01:26:20.240
<v Speaker 1>territory and so the crowd's not happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and neither are you.</v>

1664
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.450
<v Speaker 1>And there's reason for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you start talking to them,</v>

1665
01:26:23.451 --> 01:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're upset about </v>
<v Speaker 1>and neither does the crowd,</v>

1666
01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:30.770
<v Speaker 1>so you start to articulate some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about why you might be upset and some of</v>

1667
01:26:30.771 --> 01:26:35.771
<v Speaker 1>them fall flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're paying attention to the </v>

1668
01:26:35.771 --> 01:26:37.100
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you stop saying those things and some</v>

1669
01:26:37.101 --> 01:26:40.070
<v Speaker 1>of the things make the crowd really wake</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and listen.</v>

1670
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And so you start seeing more of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1671
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>

1672
01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.520
<v Speaker 1>It's an unconscious dialectic between </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and the crowd.</v>

1673
01:26:46.521 --> 01:26:51.521
<v Speaker 1>It's mediated by consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like you're sitting there </v>

1674
01:26:51.521 --> 01:26:51.521
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you might be,</v>

1675
01:26:51.521 --> 01:26:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell this crowd more what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wants to hear.</v>

1676
01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It's more sophisticated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you do that thousand times and </v>

1677
01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:03.371
<v Speaker 1>you do that to ever increasing crowds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the crowd really starts to go mad </v>

1678
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:07.310
<v Speaker 1>and they basically tell you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the savior of the nation.</v>

1679
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like at what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many bloody people have to tell you </v>

1680
01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.810
<v Speaker 1>that before you start to believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1681
01:27:14.811 --> 01:27:17.620
<v Speaker 1>I would say with a typical person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,</v>

1682
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:19.830
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll get you going,</v>

1683
01:27:19.831 --> 01:27:24.831
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a hundred people tell you </v>

1684
01:27:24.831 --> 01:27:25.010
<v Speaker 1>specifically why you're special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be thinking,</v>

1685
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.840
<v Speaker 1>even if you're kind of humbled to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1686
01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:27.800
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gees,</v>

1687
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:31.850
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be something to this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a million people and they're</v>

1688
01:27:31.851 --> 01:27:34.610
<v Speaker 1>roaring their approval,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1689
01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:40.210
<v Speaker 1>and then when it's a whole nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like good luck with standing that </v>

1690
01:27:40.210 --> 01:27:42.350
<v Speaker 1>there's just not a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to withstand that?</v>

1691
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Now you could be like Gandhi and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have taken that into account </v>

1692
01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:50.870
<v Speaker 1>beforehand because he did he read </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy by the way,</v>

1693
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:55.990
<v Speaker 1>he was a student of tolstoy and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting because tolstoy </v>

1694
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:59.681
<v Speaker 1>was the person who developed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques of nonviolence that Gandhi </v>

1695
01:27:59.681 --> 01:27:59.681
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>

1696
01:27:59.681 --> 01:28:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And tolstoy was also a deeply religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer apart from his novels,</v>

1697
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:09.640
<v Speaker 1>which are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say really in the religious </v>

1698
01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:09.640
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they're profound,</v>

1699
01:28:09.730 --> 01:28:14.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy stressed humility with </v>

1700
01:28:15.651 --> 01:28:17.240
<v Speaker 1>nonviolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really stressed that.</v>

1701
01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Gandhi took to heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he lived a very,</v>

1702
01:28:20.121 --> 01:28:20.780
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1703
01:28:20.781 --> 01:28:23.690
<v Speaker 1>very simple bare bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ascetic life.</v>

1704
01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.680
<v Speaker 1>And that was to kind of see if he could </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep his damn ego tamp down.</v>

1705
01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the groundswell was building behind him,</v>

1706
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he dressed really simply and he </v>

1707
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.421
<v Speaker 1>didn't own much and he ate very simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just tried to stay away from the </v>

1708
01:28:37.421 --> 01:28:41.351
<v Speaker 1>whole materialistic success element that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be an element of what would turn </v>

1709
01:28:41.351 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 1>them into an actor and also inflate his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ego and you know,</v>

1710
01:28:42.621 --> 01:28:45.110
<v Speaker 1>he seemed to do that pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1711
01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:47.360
<v Speaker 1>he certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1712
01:28:47.361 --> 01:28:50.350
<v Speaker 1>he led a nonviolent revolution that </v>
<v Speaker 1>resulted in the,</v>

1713
01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:55.680
<v Speaker 1>in the independence of India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also produced a terrible civil war </v>

1714
01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.681
<v Speaker 1>and the separate separation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim Indians from the Hindu Indians </v>

1715
01:28:59.681 --> 01:29:02.080
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think you can precisely</v>

1716
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.730
<v Speaker 1>laid out at the feet of Gandhi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1717
01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:08.760
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is that you have to </v>

1718
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.130
<v Speaker 1>be an extraordinary person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be extraordinarily wise and </v>

1719
01:29:11.130 --> 01:29:14.191
<v Speaker 1>you have to take ridiculous precautions </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to put yourself in the </v>

1720
01:29:14.191 --> 01:29:17.911
<v Speaker 1>public sphere like that and expose </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to that kind of adulation </v>

1721
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:20.920
<v Speaker 1>without becoming a puppet of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened to Hitler.</v>

1722
01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like he wasn't also a conscious</v>

1723
01:29:23.351 --> 01:29:26.620
<v Speaker 1>manipulator and surrounded himself by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were propagandists.</v>

1724
01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.960
<v Speaker 1>And all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was a conscious element,</v>

1725
01:29:28.961 --> 01:29:33.961
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to think these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and see how that dialectic </v>

1726
01:29:33.961 --> 01:29:38.581
<v Speaker 1>develops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he learned how to appeal to the </v>

1727
01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:39.190
<v Speaker 1>darkest fantasies of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really,</v>

1728
01:29:39.191 --> 01:29:42.700
<v Speaker 1>really good at it and that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialectic process,</v>

1729
01:29:42.701 --> 01:29:47.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crowd told them what they wanted to </v>

1730
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:47.701
<v Speaker 1>hear and it's the crowds a mob at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1731
01:29:47.770 --> 01:29:52.770
<v Speaker 1>So I don't have to take responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the fact that I'm screaming my </v>

1732
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:56.281
<v Speaker 1>approval when I'm surrounded by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people so I can scream my </v>

1733
01:29:56.281 --> 01:30:00.691
<v Speaker 1>approval for whatever I want forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever dark revengeful fantasy might </v>

1734
01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:04.060
<v Speaker 1>be playing out in my imagination because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be held accountable for</v>

1735
01:30:04.061 --> 01:30:04.180
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

1736
01:30:07.150 --> 01:30:10.000
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crickets confused and it's no wonder</v>

1737
01:30:10.001 --> 01:30:14.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like the public has rendered its </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment and the judgment is positive.</v>

1738
01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:19.030
<v Speaker 1>So when I wrote the book on which this </v>
<v Speaker 1>course is based,</v>

1739
01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to judge success?</v>

1740
01:30:22.121 --> 01:30:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1741
01:30:22.811 --> 01:30:26.950
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a two by two matrix of success.</v>

1742
01:30:26.951 --> 01:30:30.220
<v Speaker 1>You could say it's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one reads it.</v>

1743
01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.170
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you,</v>

1744
01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:37.200
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Nietzsche and sold virtually </v>

1745
01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:37.200
<v Speaker 1>nothing in his lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1746
01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's happened to lots of artists.</v>

1747
01:30:38.741 --> 01:30:42.040
<v Speaker 1>So then it's a terrible book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone loves it.</v>

1748
01:30:42.190 --> 01:30:47.190
<v Speaker 1>That happens too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a great book and everyone </v>

1749
01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:47.890
<v Speaker 1>loves it and then it's a terrible book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone hates it.</v>

1750
01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.230
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a better category </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1751
01:30:50.231 --> 01:30:52.960
<v Speaker 1>that like it's a terrible book that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone loves it.</v>

1752
01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't pick a terrible book that </v>

1753
01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.691
<v Speaker 1>everyone hates if you had a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least the quality and the </v>

1754
01:31:00.691 --> 01:31:02.890
<v Speaker 1>response match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least it's truthful light,</v>

1755
01:31:02.891 --> 01:31:04.810
<v Speaker 1>great book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good response.</v>

1756
01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:10.290
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with those four </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories is you can't really tell </v>

1757
01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:11.110
<v Speaker 1>which category your production falls </v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

1758
01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:13.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because how do you know?</v>

1759
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:16.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should assume horrible book,</v>

1760
01:31:16.421 --> 01:31:20.230
<v Speaker 1>bad response because that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely of all four of those categories.</v>

1761
01:31:20.231 --> 01:31:22.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that's most likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

1762
01:31:22.031 --> 01:31:27.031
<v Speaker 1>but just purely on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on actuarial ground foot say so.</v>

1763
01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1764
01:31:28.601 --> 01:31:31.060
<v Speaker 1>the cricket wanders away because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1765
01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:36.120
<v Speaker 1>not only was he late for work that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he turned out to be wrong about </v>

1766
01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:36.120
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

1767
01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:40.421
<v Speaker 1>let's Pinocchio go off and his adventure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Stromboli puts them in this little </v>

1768
01:31:40.421 --> 01:31:40.800
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1769
01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:41.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1770
01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:44.140
<v Speaker 1>traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touring wagon,</v>

1771
01:31:44.141 --> 01:31:47.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and away they go.</v>

1772
01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.000
<v Speaker 1>And the cricket thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1773
01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:53.500
<v Speaker 1>he is an of the conscience isn't needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore on this journey towards unearned</v>

1774
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:54.310
<v Speaker 1>celebrity.</v>

1775
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:58.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meanwhile,</v>

1776
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 1>back at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they say,</v>

1777
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.780
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1778
01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:04.770
<v Speaker 1>the puppet is supposed to come home </v>
<v Speaker 1>after school,</v>

1779
01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:11.910
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't show up.</v>

1780
01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:17.570
<v Speaker 1>And the kitten and the fish and Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were all waiting there for him,</v>

1781
01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:23.760
<v Speaker 1>ready to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

1782
01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:30.920
<v Speaker 1>But he doesn't show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Japan goes out into the rain to </v>

1783
01:32:32.010 --> 01:32:34.230
<v Speaker 1>look for him and he can't find them.</v>

1784
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And then we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see the inside of the traveling show </v>

1785
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:45.280
<v Speaker 1>cart and Stromboli is having a snack and</v>
<v Speaker 1>counting all the money that he's made </v>

1786
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:51.790
<v Speaker 1>from tonight's performance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically dividing it up with a </v>

1787
01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:54.911
<v Speaker 1>puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got this little stack of gold </v>

1788
01:32:54.911 --> 01:32:54.911
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it's false.</v>

1789
01:32:54.911 --> 01:32:57.080
<v Speaker 1>So somebody paid with a looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little Washer,</v>

1790
01:32:57.081 --> 01:32:59.270
<v Speaker 1>like a mechanical Washer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's bent,</v>

1791
01:32:59.690 --> 01:33:04.690
<v Speaker 1>and so he curses about that for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's interesting because </v>

1792
01:33:05.061 --> 01:33:07.070
<v Speaker 1>he's made all this money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been really successful.</v>

1793
01:33:07.071 --> 01:33:10.910
<v Speaker 1>But this one little error is enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enrage him,</v>

1794
01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:14.060
<v Speaker 1>which is very ungrateful and tyrannical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1795
01:33:14.061 --> 01:33:16.580
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got 100 gold pieces.</v>

1796
01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Someone slipped you a fake one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could have had 101.</v>

1797
01:33:22.821 --> 01:33:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It's still a pretty good day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All things considered,</v>

1798
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to make a bit of allowance </v>

1799
01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:30.370
<v Speaker 1>for error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something a tyrant does not do.</v>

1800
01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:35.260
<v Speaker 1>So and that's perfect because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make allowance for error at all,</v>

1801
01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:41.260
<v Speaker 1>then people are always guilty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and if you're a tyrant that's </v>

1802
01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:44.330
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you want and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always guilty of something.</v>

1803
01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So the tyrant who's willing to exploit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is always on solid ground.</v>

1804
01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:50.570
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1805
01:33:52.770 --> 01:33:57.770
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't share with Pinocchio and he </v>

1806
01:33:57.770 --> 01:34:01.911
<v Speaker 1>puts them in a birdcage jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he also shows them this other </v>

1807
01:34:01.911 --> 01:34:05.151
<v Speaker 1>puppet that has an ax through him that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the previous puppet who didn't </v>

1808
01:34:05.610 --> 01:34:10.610
<v Speaker 1>precisely perform as he was supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a big threat there.</v>

1809
01:34:12.141 --> 01:34:14.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like you stay in that jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do exactly what I want,</v>

1810
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:19.100
<v Speaker 1>or it's off to the woodpile for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be burned.</v>

1811
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
<v Speaker 1>And so well that that's just we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about because that's kind of </v>

1812
01:34:25.181 --> 01:34:30.181
<v Speaker 1>what happens with tyrants and so and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and literally not just metaphorically </v>

1813
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:31.090
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1814
01:34:35.650 --> 01:34:39.970
<v Speaker 1>So the cricket is basically wondering </v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the world he should do.</v>

1815
01:34:39.971 --> 01:34:43.770
<v Speaker 1>And then the cart rolls by and he gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>an inkling or is.</v>

1816
01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:48.780
<v Speaker 1>And I don't quite remember this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Pinocchio is in there and might be </v>

1817
01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:49.480
<v Speaker 1>in trouble or he thinks that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

1818
01:34:49.481 --> 01:34:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he ends up anyways.</v>

1819
01:34:51.161 --> 01:34:56.161
<v Speaker 1>He ends up inside the car and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds the traveling part and he goes </v>

1820
01:34:56.161 --> 01:34:59.371
<v Speaker 1>inside and then he tries to pick the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lock because he's a bug you can climb </v>

1821
01:34:59.371 --> 01:34:59.990
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tries to pick the lock.</v>

1822
01:34:59.991 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 1>He tries to get Pinocchio out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail that he's been.</v>

1823
01:35:02.650 --> 01:35:04.910
<v Speaker 1>And he sort of collaborated himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

1824
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1825
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:09.980
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because if you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1826
01:35:09.981 --> 01:35:12.170
<v Speaker 1>if you read Solzhenitsyn's Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 1>archipelago,</v>

1827
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:17.200
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you find is that if </v>

1828
01:35:18.951 --> 01:35:22.490
<v Speaker 1>you were arrested by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the KGB,</v>

1829
01:35:22.491 --> 01:35:25.010
<v Speaker 1>by the secret police and in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union,</v>

1830
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:26.150
<v Speaker 1>and you were</v>

1831
01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.160
<v Speaker 1>hauled off to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1832
01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.230
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1833
01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tribunal,</v>

1834
01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.920
<v Speaker 1>a Jew before a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted you to admit that you were </v>

1835
01:35:37.041 --> 01:35:39.650
<v Speaker 1>guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to,</v>

1836
01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they torture you until you confessed,</v>

1837
01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:45.770
<v Speaker 1>or you could just confess and that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always found that so mysterious.</v>

1838
01:35:45.771 --> 01:35:50.771
<v Speaker 1>It's like the kick down your door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know perfectly well that they </v>

1839
01:35:50.771 --> 01:35:52.190
<v Speaker 1>haven't got any more on you than they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got on anyone else.</v>

1840
01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.720
<v Speaker 1>And yet you have to go through the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>trial and you have to admit that they're</v>

1841
01:35:56.721 --> 01:35:57.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1842
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:59.150
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they even bother with that?</v>

1843
01:35:59.151 --> 01:36:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they just throw your sorry ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the camp,</v>

1844
01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:04.490
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen anyways.</v>

1845
01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Why do they need your collaboration?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1846
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I've never quite figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's partly because they're not </v>

1847
01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.611
<v Speaker 1>willing to let you stand in opposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the rules because the mere fact that </v>

1848
01:36:18.611 --> 01:36:23.561
<v Speaker 1>you will do that means that you exist as</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is allowed to exist </v>

1849
01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 1>outside the rules and they're not having</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that,</v>

1850
01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:28.970
<v Speaker 1>so that's part of it,</v>

1851
01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:33.650
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more to it than that.</v>

1852
01:36:33.651 --> 01:36:38.651
<v Speaker 1>It's like the drama of collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I learned about </v>

1853
01:36:38.651 --> 01:36:42.401
<v Speaker 1>societies like the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is true of all tyrannical </v>

1854
01:36:42.401 --> 01:36:45.520
<v Speaker 1>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the idea that that's top down </v>

1855
01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:45.650
<v Speaker 1>and that people are just following </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders.</v>

1856
01:36:45.651 --> 01:36:47.570
<v Speaker 1>They're good people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're just following orders.</v>

1857
01:36:47.571 --> 01:36:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can forget about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid theory.</v>

1858
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:53.240
<v Speaker 1>When a society becomes tyrannical like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1859
01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:56.390
<v Speaker 1>the tyranny exists at every single level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the society.</v>

1860
01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:00.140
<v Speaker 1>You tyrannized your own conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're a true believer.</v>

1861
01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:02.600
<v Speaker 1>You're a true believer in Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Utopia,</v>

1862
01:37:02.601 --> 01:37:05.360
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or national socialist third,</v>

1863
01:37:05.361 --> 01:37:10.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to last a thousand years </v>

1864
01:37:10.361 --> 01:37:12.071
<v Speaker 1>and be racially pure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really believed that and that's </v>

1865
01:37:12.071 --> 01:37:14.270
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be a perfect state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's already been delivered to you.</v>

1866
01:37:14.271 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that in so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're a true believer,</v>

1867
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:22.151
<v Speaker 1>your own suffering becomes heretical </v>
<v Speaker 1>because to the degree that you're </v>

1868
01:37:22.151 --> 01:37:26.411
<v Speaker 1>suffering and you're living proof of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that the system is not delivering </v>

1869
01:37:26.411 --> 01:37:27.830
<v Speaker 1>what it promised to deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to suppress that.</v>

1870
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:32.830
<v Speaker 1>You have to become your own tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't admit that anything's gone </v>

1871
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:36.491
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course you can't talk about a </v>

1872
01:37:36.491 --> 01:37:36.500
<v Speaker 1>tier family because one out of three of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them are government informers,</v>

1873
01:37:36.670 --> 01:37:41.670
<v Speaker 1>just like one out of three of everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're certainly not going to </v>

1874
01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:44.771
<v Speaker 1>mention it in the workplace because </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a devout communist party </v>

1875
01:37:44.771 --> 01:37:45.170
<v Speaker 1>member,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going anywhere.</v>

1876
01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.550
<v Speaker 1>And if any of your ancestors were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>land owners or or bourgeoisie,</v>

1877
01:37:49.551 --> 01:37:52.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're done class guilt,</v>

1878
01:37:52.251 --> 01:37:54.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going anywhere.</v>

1879
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:58.680
<v Speaker 1>And then every single level of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy is exactly the same as that.</v>

1880
01:37:58.681 --> 01:38:01.770
<v Speaker 1>And on the top there is a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the tyrant is everywhere,</v>

1881
01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.540
<v Speaker 1>everywhere from the peak to the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all tyranny.</v>

1882
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And everyone participates in that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>lying about everything.</v>

1883
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you see what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

1884
01:38:12.931 --> 01:38:13.740
<v Speaker 1>In the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie,</v>

1885
01:38:13.741 --> 01:38:18.741
<v Speaker 1>So Pinocchio was in jail and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's there because he was naive and he </v>

1886
01:38:19.231 --> 01:38:24.231
<v Speaker 1>allowed himself to be enticed to because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did something that would've run </v>

1887
01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:25.860
<v Speaker 1>contrary to his conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the movie doesn't put up Straw man,</v>

1888
01:38:25.861 --> 01:38:30.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor damn puppet got tangled into </v>

1889
01:38:30.861 --> 01:38:30.861
<v Speaker 1>this is conscience wasn't even around.</v>

1890
01:38:30.861 --> 01:38:33.450
<v Speaker 1>So you have to have some sympathy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them but doesn't matter.</v>

1891
01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter because he ends up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail and he can't get out.</v>

1892
01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:45.060
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that it in some ways wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fault,</v>

1893
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:48.360
<v Speaker 1>doesn't change the fact that he's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail and he can't get out.</v>

1894
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:53.220
<v Speaker 1>And then his is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching Louis c k the other night</v>

1895
01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:59.420
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about children lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about his nine year old </v>

1896
01:38:59.420 --> 01:38:59.430
<v Speaker 1>daughter lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1897
01:38:59.431 --> 01:39:00.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no,</v>

1898
01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:05.690
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder your children lie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder it's impossible for you </v>

1899
01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:10.041
<v Speaker 1>to stop them because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to someone who's his head</v>

1900
01:39:10.561 --> 01:39:15.561
<v Speaker 1>would scrape the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weigh like three times as much as </v>

1901
01:39:15.561 --> 01:39:18.441
<v Speaker 1>you and they're capable of force and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're intimidating and they say to you</v>

1902
01:39:18.901 --> 01:39:20.190
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you,</v>

1903
01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:23.460
<v Speaker 1>could you take that last cookie after I </v>
<v Speaker 1>told you not to?</v>

1904
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.560
<v Speaker 1>And you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1905
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I took a cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do?</v>

1906
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:29.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1907
01:39:29.931 --> 01:39:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you get a genius idea in your head which</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

1908
01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:37.970
<v Speaker 1>smarter children learn to lie earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children with high Iq is learned to lie </v>

1909
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:39.450
<v Speaker 1>younger and and Ck says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1910
01:39:39.451 --> 01:39:41.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like you've just been handed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>magic.</v>

1911
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Get out of jail free card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just say,</v>

1912
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:47.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take that cookie and worse than</v>

1913
01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:50.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works in every single situation.</v>

1914
01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:55.300
<v Speaker 1>If you get away with it and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to learn not to do that.</v>

1915
01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well great.</v>

1916
01:39:57.481 --> 01:39:59.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing about Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1917
01:39:59.671 --> 01:40:04.671
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you the underlying truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why people think they're so </v>

1918
01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:05.700
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the gesture and it King's court,</v>

1919
01:40:05.701 --> 01:40:10.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the only one who's allowed to tell </v>

1920
01:40:10.701 --> 01:40:10.701
<v Speaker 1>the king the truth because he's beneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt.</v>

1921
01:40:10.701 --> 01:40:10.890
<v Speaker 1>That's what comedians do.</v>

1922
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:12.750
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1923
01:40:12.751 --> 01:40:13.920
<v Speaker 1>so what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1924
01:40:13.921 --> 01:40:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio Pinocchio's not very happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

1925
01:40:15.721 --> 01:40:20.721
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really breaking them up and the </v>

1926
01:40:20.721 --> 01:40:21.180
<v Speaker 1>blue fairy appears again from the star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same Way.</v>

1927
01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:26.181
<v Speaker 1>So what this means is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I think this is right,</v>

1928
01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:31.610
<v Speaker 1>this is something you've talked about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was also extraordinarily </v>

1929
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:34.521
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that it's one thing to break a </v>

1930
01:40:34.521 --> 01:40:37.620
<v Speaker 1>rule when you don't really know the rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1931
01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:41.040
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem to get a bit of a free pass for</v>

1932
01:40:41.041 --> 01:40:46.041
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if then you know the rule and then </v>

1933
01:40:46.041 --> 01:40:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you break it anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get hit a lot harder.</v>

1934
01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:53.090
<v Speaker 1>And I know that's true and I even think </v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured out why it was true at one </v>

1935
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:53.740
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't remember the moment,</v>

1936
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.350
<v Speaker 1>but there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about,</v>

1937
01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:01.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like the severity of a moral error </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't quite as massive if you're </v>

1938
01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:05.610
<v Speaker 1>genuinely ignorant and unconscious about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rule and maybe it's because you're </v>

1939
01:41:05.610 --> 01:41:09.220
<v Speaker 1>not violating your own belief system as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much when you engage in the activity.</v>

1940
01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1941
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.040
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio is in there and he,</v>

1942
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:19.270
<v Speaker 1>he's partly at fault at least because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's naive and,</v>

1943
01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:24.800
<v Speaker 1>and he's very desperate about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also because his conscience </v>

1944
01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.161
<v Speaker 1>isn't functioning very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he has his reasons and so whatever </v>

1945
01:41:29.161 --> 01:41:32.740
<v Speaker 1>the blue fairy shows up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother nature steps in to aid him.</v>

1946
01:41:33.190 --> 01:41:38.190
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is true I would say because </v>

1947
01:41:38.190 --> 01:41:41.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you get walloped or killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you make a mistake,</v>

1948
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1949
01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:45.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of interesting.</v>

1950
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:49.560
<v Speaker 1>And especially that's the case with kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like we have more leeway from,</v>

1951
01:41:49.630 --> 01:41:51.430
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether nature does,</v>

1952
01:41:51.431 --> 01:41:54.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say yes because you know,</v>

1953
01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:57.130
<v Speaker 1>kids are really cute and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing and so,</v>

1954
01:41:57.370 --> 01:42:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're naive and they're kind of </v>

1955
01:42:02.370 --> 01:42:04.621
<v Speaker 1>helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have those motions even that </v>

1956
01:42:04.621 --> 01:42:04.690
<v Speaker 1>indicate helplessness and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the natural apprehension</v>

1957
01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:05.650
<v Speaker 1>of cuteness.</v>

1958
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cuteness is big eyes,</v>

1959
01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:11.830
<v Speaker 1>small knows symmetrical features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby like features.</v>

1960
01:42:12.130 --> 01:42:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm helpless movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1961
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:18.910
<v Speaker 1>that elicits sympathy and compassion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't cross species.</v>

1962
01:42:18.911 --> 01:42:23.140
<v Speaker 1>And so does the cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my roommate when I was in college,</v>

1963
01:42:23.141 --> 01:42:27.370
<v Speaker 1>had a niece who is quite young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boat year and half old,</v>

1964
01:42:27.371 --> 01:42:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had a cat wildcat and uh,</v>

1965
01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:37.150
<v Speaker 1>and it was really fighty cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because of me because I would </v>

1966
01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:38.140
<v Speaker 1>always play with it and it would let him</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight with me quite a lot.</v>

1967
01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:39.720
<v Speaker 1>So was a fighty cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1968
01:42:39.730 --> 01:42:40.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1969
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:43.210
<v Speaker 1>that little girl would come over and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1970
01:42:43.211 --> 01:42:48.211
<v Speaker 1>maybe she'd cry that cat was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are right now trying to figure out </v>

1971
01:42:48.211 --> 01:42:49.930
<v Speaker 1>what was wrong and the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cat would use its claws on me,</v>

1972
01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:52.390
<v Speaker 1>but it would never use its claws on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid,</v>

1973
01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:53.740
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1974
01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.920
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's indication of that cross species </v>

1975
01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:58.920
<v Speaker 1>cuteness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1976
01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:00.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're all attracted to that more or</v>

1977
01:43:00.011 --> 01:43:00.400
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>

1978
01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And the more maternal you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you're attracted to such </v>

1979
01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:05.400
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1980
01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.250
<v Speaker 1>you see something on Youtube and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

1981
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so cute.</v>

1982
01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:08.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1983
01:43:08.741 --> 01:43:09.250
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1984
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:13.270
<v Speaker 1>it appeals to exactly this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1985
01:43:13.271 --> 01:43:14.710
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it appeals to this,</v>

1986
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:19.330
<v Speaker 1>couldn't commentation of infantile </v>
<v Speaker 1>features.</v>

1987
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1988
01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:25.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it brings out compassion unless you're </v>

1989
01:43:25.861 --> 01:43:26.620
<v Speaker 1>psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a good thing,</v>

1990
01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:29.170
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be manipulated,</v>

1991
01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:34.200
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women actually manipulate it with </v>

1992
01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:34.200
<v Speaker 1>makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite,</v>

1993
01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:37.960
<v Speaker 1>quite sneaky and go to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1994
01:43:40.450 --> 01:43:42.460
<v Speaker 1>so the blue fairy shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's nature.</v>

1995
01:43:42.461 --> 01:43:47.461
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is that nature will </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut kids a break if you think of nature </v>

1996
01:43:47.461 --> 01:43:49.030
<v Speaker 1>in the guise of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well their mother for example,</v>

1997
01:43:49.031 --> 01:43:54.031
<v Speaker 1>but even the biology of other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're wired to accept behavior </v>

1998
01:43:54.501 --> 01:43:56.600
<v Speaker 1>from children that we wouldn't accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>from other people.</v>

1999
01:43:56.990 --> 01:44:01.990
<v Speaker 1>So nature will forgive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she shows up in your heavenly guys </v>

2000
01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:07.430
<v Speaker 1>and says what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Pinocchio again,</v>

2001
01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:09.890
<v Speaker 1>because he's not youth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because he's not good.</v>

2002
01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.000
<v Speaker 1>He's not evil either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2003
01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 1>he's neither or both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you look at it.</v>

2004
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:19.990
<v Speaker 1>And he also has no idea how smart he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how smart he isn't or how smart the </v>

2005
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:21.960
<v Speaker 1>person he's talking to his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2006
01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:26.030
<v Speaker 1>instead of admitting what he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lies about it.</v>

2007
01:44:26.031 --> 01:44:31.031
<v Speaker 1>And that's interesting because it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest that he understands at some </v>

2008
01:44:31.161 --> 01:44:34.660
<v Speaker 1>level that he set himself up for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2009
01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:36.620
<v Speaker 1>he could just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could have just told the truth,</v>

2010
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:41.950
<v Speaker 1>this horrible Fox kidnap me and sold me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this slave holder,</v>

2011
01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:49.360
<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more true than the story he </v>

2012
01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:49.790
<v Speaker 1>tells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tells a story about some monster,</v>

2013
01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:51.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fictional monster.</v>

2014
01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:55.550
<v Speaker 1>He coulda told even three quarters of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth and how it work.</v>

2015
01:44:55.551 --> 01:44:58.610
<v Speaker 1>But he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just obscures the story entirely.</v>

2016
01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And this is the part of the movie that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people remember.</v>

2017
01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.120
<v Speaker 1>And I'd edited this out for years when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about this movie.</v>

2018
01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I forgot why it was so significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nose grows right and it grows </v>

2019
01:45:12.111 --> 01:45:15.740
<v Speaker 1>too ridiculous length.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

2020
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Mark Twain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samuel Clemens,</v>

2021
01:45:22.861 --> 01:45:27.861
<v Speaker 1>I think who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the advantages to telling the </v>

2022
01:45:27.861 --> 01:45:31.101
<v Speaker 1>truth is that you don't have to remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you said and that God that's worth </v>

2023
01:45:31.101 --> 01:45:31.920
<v Speaker 1>listening to because.</v>

2024
01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:40.680
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of things I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned as a clinician and one of them </v>

2025
01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:44.761
<v Speaker 1>is because you're often in really weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations with people if you're a </v>

2026
01:45:44.761 --> 01:45:46.150
<v Speaker 1>clinician because things happen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't happen normally and you don't know</v>

2027
01:45:46.151 --> 01:45:51.151
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I've learned is I just say </v>

2028
01:45:51.151 --> 01:45:51.151
<v Speaker 1>what I just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening,</v>

2029
01:45:51.151 --> 01:45:52.450
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what it is,</v>

2030
01:45:52.451 --> 01:45:57.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just try to describe it as </v>

2031
01:45:57.451 --> 01:45:57.670
<v Speaker 1>accurately as I can and not worry about </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

2032
01:45:57.671 --> 01:45:59.530
<v Speaker 1>not worried about the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2033
01:45:59.531 --> 01:46:01.360
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not going out of my way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause trouble.</v>

2034
01:46:01.361 --> 01:46:06.361
<v Speaker 1>But if you're in a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm telling you this can save your </v>

2035
01:46:06.361 --> 01:46:09.241
<v Speaker 1>life at times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're dealing with </v>

2036
01:46:09.241 --> 01:46:09.241
<v Speaker 1>someone who's paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's really paranoid,</v>

2037
01:46:09.241 --> 01:46:11.690
<v Speaker 1>you do not lie to someone who's paranoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>and violet.</v>

2038
01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aligned with the forces that are </v>

2039
01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:20.551
<v Speaker 1>persecuting them and they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>because paranoid it makes people </v>

2040
01:46:20.551 --> 01:46:20.830
<v Speaker 1>hypervigilant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're on amphetamines.</v>

2041
01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:26.160
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make people paranoid by giving </v>

2042
01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.561
<v Speaker 1>them enough amphetamines and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make paranoid people more paranoid by </v>

2043
01:46:28.561 --> 01:46:30.150
<v Speaker 1>giving them amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're hypervigilant.</v>

2044
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Because they feel that everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory and against them,</v>

2045
01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:38.460
<v Speaker 1>and so they're watching you like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would not believe way more than you're </v>

2046
01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:42.001
<v Speaker 1>watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you flicker ally while you're </v>

2047
01:46:42.001 --> 01:46:43.570
<v Speaker 1>talking to them and they're really on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge,</v>

2048
01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

2049
01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:50.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to really know if you're </v>

2050
01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:51.390
<v Speaker 1>ever in a really bad situation and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what to do,</v>

2051
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.680
<v Speaker 1>you tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minimally you don't disclose too much.</v>

2052
01:46:55.681 --> 01:47:00.681
<v Speaker 1>That's just another lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell the truth minimally and </v>

2053
01:47:00.681 --> 01:47:04.290
<v Speaker 1>carefully and hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might get out of it,</v>

2054
01:47:04.350 --> 01:47:08.040
<v Speaker 1>you might get out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you falsify it,</v>

2055
01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:12.600
<v Speaker 1>look the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the truth is a real.</v>

2056
01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a real mechanism of protection in </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous situations.</v>

2057
01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:18.510
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if someone's trying to intimidate you</v>

2058
01:47:18.511 --> 01:47:20.290
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think they might get violent,</v>

2059
01:47:20.291 --> 01:47:25.200
<v Speaker 1>that they ask you if you're afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you tell them that you're terrified</v>

2060
01:47:25.201 --> 01:47:27.450
<v Speaker 1>and that you hope that things will go </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2061
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Or you say,</v>

2062
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time I was in an airport and uh,</v>

2063
01:47:36.810 --> 01:47:41.630
<v Speaker 1>we're in this lineup to fly back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada that said international flights.</v>

2064
01:47:41.631 --> 01:47:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And so as long line up like 50 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we got it,</v>

2065
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:50.530
<v Speaker 1>I got about three from the front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was still like 40 people behind me </v>

2066
01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:53.531
<v Speaker 1>and the guy behind the counter decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was just going to shut down the </v>

2067
01:47:53.531 --> 01:47:53.960
<v Speaker 1>line and that we could all go to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other line,</v>

2068
01:47:53.961 --> 01:47:58.961
<v Speaker 1>which was like 300 people long and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggested that he not do that because </v>

2069
01:47:58.961 --> 01:48:03.911
<v Speaker 1>we'd been standing there for half an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and that he could just deal with </v>

2070
01:48:03.911 --> 01:48:05.780
<v Speaker 1>the 20 of us that were less than and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like have a clue.</v>

2071
01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:10.840
<v Speaker 1>So he called the sheriff right away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was down in Florida and it wasn't </v>

2072
01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:15.551
<v Speaker 1>that long after nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these guys came up and they were </v>

2073
01:48:15.551 --> 01:48:18.791
<v Speaker 1>armed and they came and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at me because of course he told </v>

2074
01:48:18.791 --> 01:48:20.780
<v Speaker 1>them that I was causing trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I wasn't.</v>

2075
01:48:20.781 --> 01:48:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to not</v>

2076
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:24.420
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

2077
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:30.790
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An arrogant bureaucratic scum rat take </v>

2078
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:34.601
<v Speaker 1>advantage of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So which is not the same as causing </v>

2079
01:48:34.601 --> 01:48:34.601
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

2080
01:48:34.601 --> 01:48:35.630
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the cops came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2081
01:48:35.631 --> 01:48:39.110
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do exactly what you tell me</v>

2082
01:48:39.111 --> 01:48:42.080
<v Speaker 1>to do right now and I'm not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause any trouble,</v>

2083
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.570
<v Speaker 1>but I would like you to hear what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened.</v>

2084
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example of a situation </v>

2085
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:49.990
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if someone's got,</v>

2086
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:52.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bravo Bravado,</v>

2087
01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:56.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a very bad idea and I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do exactly what they told me because you</v>

2088
01:48:56.991 --> 01:48:57.230
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2089
01:48:58.590 --> 01:49:01.890
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know who I was and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what they had been told.</v>

2090
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with lying is that it's a </v>

2091
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:11.871
<v Speaker 1>hydro and kids find this out very early </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you tell one lie and what </v>

2092
01:49:12.181 --> 01:49:14.850
<v Speaker 1>happens is it has one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences that you expect.</v>

2093
01:49:14.851 --> 01:49:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'd get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has three or four others that you</v>

2094
01:49:17.191 --> 01:49:19.860
<v Speaker 1>don't expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like it grows some,</v>

2095
01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:25.340
<v Speaker 1>some complexity and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tack a lie on each of those little </v>

2096
01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:29.331
<v Speaker 1>complexity outcrops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they grow three more </v>

2097
01:49:29.331 --> 01:49:31.680
<v Speaker 1>complexities and soon this little light </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into great big ball of lies.</v>

2098
01:49:31.681 --> 01:49:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And at some point it becomes painfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>evident to everyone,</v>

2099
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:40.070
<v Speaker 1>and by that time you're in such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this with politicians like that </v>

2100
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.550
<v Speaker 1>guy who was sexting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2101
01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Wiener.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:49:42.301 --> 01:49:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Perfect name for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2103
01:49:43.651 --> 01:49:44.340
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

2104
01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't make that comment because </v>

2105
01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:50.060
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still funny,</v>

2106
01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:50.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2107
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:52.330
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what happened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2108
01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even so much the event because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are stupid.</v>

2109
01:49:56.711 --> 01:50:01.711
<v Speaker 1>They make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually the public is somewhat </v>

2110
01:50:01.711 --> 01:50:01.810
<v Speaker 1>forgiving if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2111
01:50:01.811 --> 01:50:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a real moron and you know,</v>

2112
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:06.400
<v Speaker 1>like really seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could I do that?</v>

2113
01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 1>But I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I'll try not to do it again.</v>

2114
01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:14.700
<v Speaker 1>But what happens with politicians is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not speaking specifically of </v>

2115
01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:19.081
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they'll make an error and it gets </v>

2116
01:50:19.081 --> 01:50:19.540
<v Speaker 1>exposed and then they make three others </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to cover it up.</v>

2117
01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Happened with Nixon for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole thing just turns into</v>

2118
01:50:22.391 --> 01:50:27.391
<v Speaker 1>a complete scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe they could have got out of it </v>

2119
01:50:27.391 --> 01:50:28.690
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning by just telling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

2120
01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:29.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2121
01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2122
01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll try not to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that isn't what happens in this </v>

2123
01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:41.791
<v Speaker 1>case in Pinocchio grows this elaborate </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of lies and the ferry is willing </v>

2124
01:50:43.421 --> 01:50:48.421
<v Speaker 1>to be a little generous to him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's little and cute and he's still a </v>

2125
01:50:48.421 --> 01:50:49.540
<v Speaker 1>puppet and she tells him</v>

2126
01:50:50.670 --> 01:50:55.200
<v Speaker 1>not to do that and that she's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give them a pass this time,</v>

2127
01:50:55.230 --> 01:50:59.100
<v Speaker 1>but that she isn't going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervene on his behalf again.</v>

2128
01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:04.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite interesting about people </v>

2129
01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:04.560
<v Speaker 1>who have roots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soliah and ideas about children.</v>

2130
01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:07.740
<v Speaker 1>So children are all good and they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted by society,</v>

2131
01:51:08.130 --> 01:51:13.130
<v Speaker 1>which is half true because they're also </v>
<v Speaker 1>not good and they get shaped and,</v>

2132
01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:17.310
<v Speaker 1>and discipline by society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there were so many types.</v>

2133
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Softer are very interesting when their </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids hit teenage years or when they're </v>

2134
01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:25.620
<v Speaker 1>judging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say criminal teenagers.</v>

2135
01:51:25.621 --> 01:51:28.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like the child is perfect until </v>
<v Speaker 1>they hit like 11.</v>

2136
01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Then they turned into a teenager and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're like thugs.</v>

2137
01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:34.200
<v Speaker 1>So they go from good to thug in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

2138
01:51:34.230 --> 01:51:34.830
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2139
01:51:35.250 --> 01:51:40.250
<v Speaker 1>and you often see that in families too </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have treated especially their </v>

2140
01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:40.680
<v Speaker 1>daughters like a princess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2141
01:51:40.681 --> 01:51:45.681
<v Speaker 1>and then they hit puberty and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents who have princess them to death </v>

2142
01:51:45.681 --> 01:51:49.470
<v Speaker 1>have no idea what to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then they become demonized and so</v>

2143
01:51:49.471 --> 01:51:54.471
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overly good that child turns into </v>

2144
01:51:54.471 --> 01:51:57.711
<v Speaker 1>the overly wicked teenager and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lack that out to one of the things </v>

2145
01:51:57.711 --> 01:51:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I've seen with girls who are</v>

2146
01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:05.780
<v Speaker 1>held in princess esteem when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>little and their parents have too tight </v>

2147
01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:07.440
<v Speaker 1>of a grip on them and too much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand for good behaviors,</v>

2148
01:52:07.441 --> 01:52:11.220
<v Speaker 1>they'll find some nasty character to </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate with who will tear them out of</v>

2149
01:52:11.221 --> 01:52:12.430
<v Speaker 1>the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2150
01:52:12.450 --> 01:52:14.310
<v Speaker 1>bikers are really good for that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2151
01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:17.490
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you have some vengeful</v>

2152
01:52:17.491 --> 01:52:22.491
<v Speaker 1>thoughts towards your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice biker is your perfect solution to </v>

2153
01:52:22.491 --> 01:52:22.491
<v Speaker 1>that problem.</v>

2154
01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go through this scene and then I </v>

2155
01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:35.340
<v Speaker 1>think we'll call it a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2156
01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:37.720
<v Speaker 1>So now Pinocchio was gone free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been united with his conscience.</v>

2157
01:52:37.721 --> 01:52:42.550
<v Speaker 1>He's learned a couple of lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be an actor and don't lie.</v>

2158
01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:44.630
<v Speaker 1>And those things are quite similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2159
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 1>And especially once you're caught in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actor trap,</v>

2160
01:52:48.111 --> 01:52:50.510
<v Speaker 1>don't lie to get out because that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>just make it worse.</v>

2161
01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:55.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first of his trials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his moral trials on the road to becoming</v>

2162
01:52:55.851 --> 01:52:57.110
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right now,</v>

2163
01:52:57.111 --> 01:52:59.210
<v Speaker 1>now here we are at a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're at this,</v>

2164
01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called the red lobster in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a shadowy place,</v>

2165
01:53:03.081 --> 01:53:04.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cave like,</v>

2166
01:53:04.431 --> 01:53:09.431
<v Speaker 1>so it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an underground entrance to </v>

2167
01:53:09.431 --> 01:53:09.710
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2168
01:53:10.230 --> 01:53:12.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's a foggy night and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really see.</v>

2169
01:53:12.471 --> 01:53:15.050
<v Speaker 1>So everything's murky and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gloomy.</v>

2170
01:53:15.051 --> 01:53:20.051
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so inside we see the coachman and </v>

2171
01:53:20.051 --> 01:53:24.290
<v Speaker 1>the Fox and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had an acat and the coachman.</v>

2172
01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.430
<v Speaker 1>The coachman is a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's that mask that we saw.</v>

2173
01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:31.580
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the archetype of that mask that was</v>

2174
01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:33.980
<v Speaker 1>judgmental about Pinocchio having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

2175
01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And it's like one of the things you said</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the shadow,</v>

2176
01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:43.060
<v Speaker 1>and this is I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the primary impediments to </v>

2177
01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:45.080
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment is that if you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at your motives for,</v>

2178
01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:46.920
<v Speaker 1>for misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2179
01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:49.580
<v Speaker 1>and I mean by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something very specific.</v>

2180
01:53:49.581 --> 01:53:54.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that you're misbehaving by </v>

2181
01:53:54.581 --> 01:53:54.581
<v Speaker 1>someone else's standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that.</v>

2182
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you know by your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards that you're doing something </v>

2183
01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that's devious or malevolent or </v>
<v Speaker 1>underhanded,</v>

2184
01:54:00.801 --> 01:54:05.801
<v Speaker 1>you know it and you still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's your own judgment you're </v>

2185
01:54:05.801 --> 01:54:09.140
<v Speaker 1>bringing to bear on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at why you're doing that,</v>

2186
01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.710
<v Speaker 1>the longer you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deeper hole you dig.</v>

2187
01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And so this is the Motif of Dante's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inferno fundamentally.</v>

2188
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:20.790
<v Speaker 1>So Dante is inferno is a story about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2189
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

2190
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:25.670
<v Speaker 1>might be Dante,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

2191
01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:28.610
<v Speaker 1>although I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's led into hell by Virgil,</v>

2192
01:54:28.670 --> 01:54:30.050
<v Speaker 1>who's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an ancient,</v>

2193
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:35.470
<v Speaker 1>who was an ancient philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinker and hell has levels.</v>

2194
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:39.860
<v Speaker 1>And so the outer level is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a Christianized version of hell.</v>

2195
01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's hells of all sorts,</v>

2196
01:54:42.531 --> 01:54:47.531
<v Speaker 1>but this is a christianized version </v>
<v Speaker 1>version and so the on the outermost </v>

2197
01:54:47.531 --> 01:54:51.430
<v Speaker 1>levels of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like normal life are </v>

2198
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:54.851
<v Speaker 1>the ancient philosophers and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>still in hell because they weren't </v>

2199
01:54:54.851 --> 01:54:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of like,</v>

2200
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:59.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like cheap motel hell instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the full pip thing,</v>

2201
01:54:59.751 --> 01:55:04.520
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then Dante goes deeper and deeper</v>

2202
01:55:04.521 --> 01:55:06.770
<v Speaker 1>into hell until it gets right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of it.</v>

2203
01:55:06.771 --> 01:55:09.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's been a while since I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I remember correctly,</v>

2204
01:55:09.771 --> 01:55:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Satan himself is encased in ice at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of hell,</v>

2205
01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:15.590
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by people who betray others.</v>

2206
01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And so Dante,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his notion was that the worst of all </v>

2207
01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:23.801
<v Speaker 1>possible violations of moral behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>was betrayal and that they're in the </v>

2208
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:25.980
<v Speaker 1>deepest levels of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2209
01:55:25.981 --> 01:55:30.981
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's true because if you trust </v>

2210
01:55:30.981 --> 01:55:34.571
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're manifesting the necessary </v>

2211
01:55:34.571 --> 01:55:34.571
<v Speaker 1>courage that put someone through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2212
01:55:34.571 --> 01:55:36.980
<v Speaker 1>if you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't trust me cause you're naive.</v>

2213
01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:41.060
<v Speaker 1>You Trust me knowing that I've full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes and so are you.</v>

2214
01:55:41.061 --> 01:55:45.000
<v Speaker 1>But maybe we could cooperate and move </v>
<v Speaker 1>things along nicely,</v>

2215
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:50.030
<v Speaker 1>we know and we could reduce each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the word to our word and we could </v>

2216
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:51.030
<v Speaker 1>cooperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're awake,</v>

2217
01:55:51.650 --> 01:55:56.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'd be trey that then I'm </v>

2218
01:55:56.650 --> 01:55:59.391
<v Speaker 1>undermining your necessary faith in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life and humanity and you can really </v>

2219
01:56:00.421 --> 01:56:03.780
<v Speaker 1>hurt someone that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the sometimes it's self betrayal,</v>

2220
01:56:04.230 --> 01:56:06.000
<v Speaker 1>but you can really do someone in that.</v>

2221
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.000
<v Speaker 1>We can really traumatize them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can so that they can't recover and </v>

2222
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.601
<v Speaker 1>so it's a really terrible thing to do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and maybe it's the worst thing </v>

2223
01:56:14.601 --> 01:56:18.171
<v Speaker 1>and that was don idea and it's tied in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes very interesting reading.</v>

2224
01:56:18.361 --> 01:56:21.870
<v Speaker 1>If you read it at the same time as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton's paradise lost because those are</v>

2225
01:56:21.871 --> 01:56:25.020
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical explorations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they are.</v>

2226
01:56:25.021 --> 01:56:30.021
<v Speaker 1>They're metaphysical explorations of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible places you can end up and that </v>

2227
01:56:30.021 --> 01:56:34.731
<v Speaker 1>people do end up and also a metaphysical</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation of what spirit takes you </v>

2228
01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:37.320
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because you might ask,</v>

2229
01:56:37.321 --> 01:56:42.321
<v Speaker 1>well why do you be traced someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a deep question and so </v>

2230
01:56:43.021 --> 01:56:48.021
<v Speaker 1>you'll have your specific reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But under that there'll be some other </v>

2231
01:56:48.021 --> 01:56:48.021
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And under that,</v>

2232
01:56:48.021 --> 01:56:52.041
<v Speaker 1>there'll be some other reasons and under</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there'll be some other reasons and </v>

2233
01:56:52.041 --> 01:56:55.431
<v Speaker 1>if you go all the way to the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come up with the ultimate reasons </v>

2234
01:56:55.431 --> 01:56:55.431
<v Speaker 1>why you'd be trade someone.</v>

2235
01:56:55.431 --> 01:56:57.570
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will not be pretty.</v>

2236
01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:02.960
<v Speaker 1>That's when your proclivity for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you nights with the general </v>

2237
01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:07.341
<v Speaker 1>human proclivity for evil and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover just exactly what you're </v>

2238
01:57:07.341 --> 01:57:09.690
<v Speaker 1>capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so young's notion was that,</v>

2239
01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:11.760
<v Speaker 1>well that was a full encounter with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow,</v>

2240
01:57:11.761 --> 01:57:16.761
<v Speaker 1>which is I suppose partly what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>course is about because one of the </v>

2241
01:57:16.761 --> 01:57:18.660
<v Speaker 1>things that I believe I told you at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning was that I was going to try to</v>

2242
01:57:18.661 --> 01:57:23.661
<v Speaker 1>help you understand how it might be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be in Auschwitz guard and to </v>

2243
01:57:25.381 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 1>really understand that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrifying thing to understand.</v>

2244
01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.220
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to grow some teeth,</v>

2245
01:57:32.850 --> 01:57:34.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

2246
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:38.250
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about your capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to negotiate before.</v>

2247
01:57:38.490 --> 01:57:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Like if you aren't a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot negotiate.</v>

2248
01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:46.830
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got that under control,</v>

2249
01:57:47.730 --> 01:57:49.740
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to be a monster.</v>

2250
01:57:50.130 --> 01:57:52.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really paradoxical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're just naive,</v>

2251
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:58.040
<v Speaker 1>well you end up in jail and marionette </v>
<v Speaker 1>master has control over you.</v>

2252
01:57:58.590 --> 01:58:01.140
<v Speaker 1>That's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not good.</v>

2253
01:58:01.141 --> 01:58:03.600
<v Speaker 1>That just means you're useless and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be manipulated,</v>

2254
01:58:03.601 --> 01:58:05.700
<v Speaker 1>won't go out of your way to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent.</v>

2255
01:58:05.701 --> 01:58:08.060
<v Speaker 1>But it's mostly because you just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the skills,</v>

2256
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:12.030
<v Speaker 1>the organizational skills or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even the depth to do that.</v>

2257
01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:14.640
<v Speaker 1>You know you're good because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmless.</v>

2258
01:58:14.641 --> 01:58:17.820
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's easily manipulated.</v>

2259
01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how do you get out of that?</v>

2260
01:58:20.341 --> 01:58:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly you watch people because you know</v>

2261
01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:26.370
<v Speaker 1>what their light because you know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like and that,</v>

2262
01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:30.270
<v Speaker 1>but you also know what you could do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do if you were pushed.</v>

2263
01:58:30.271 --> 01:58:35.271
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't have to show much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you're negotiating with </v>

2264
01:58:35.271 --> 01:58:35.970
<v Speaker 1>someone for them to take you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

2265
01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:39.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's a strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2266
01:58:39.210 --> 01:58:44.210
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you pointed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>too was that what you most need to know </v>

2267
01:58:44.210 --> 01:58:46.270
<v Speaker 1>will be found where you least want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

2268
01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:51.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's because you haven't already </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked there and so it's a little </v>

2269
01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:51.540
<v Speaker 1>different for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2270
01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:56.521
<v Speaker 1>Because you're a particular place you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to look isn't going to be the same </v>

2271
01:58:56.521 --> 01:58:59.581
<v Speaker 1>as your replace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a place you </v>

2272
01:58:59.581 --> 01:58:59.710
<v Speaker 1>don't want to look and what you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>

2273
01:58:59.711 --> 01:59:04.711
<v Speaker 1>That's where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly going to be </v>

2274
01:59:04.711 --> 01:59:06.010
<v Speaker 1>discovered by you looking at what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of,</v>

2275
01:59:06.011 --> 01:59:08.380
<v Speaker 1>what you're truly capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2276
01:59:08.770 --> 01:59:11.630
<v Speaker 1>people especially on the Compassionate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

2277
01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:16.680
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never be like brutal like that </v>

2278
01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:17.290
<v Speaker 1>and that could be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can kill people with compassion.</v>

2279
01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.690
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

2280
01:59:18.691 --> 01:59:23.691
<v Speaker 1>That's the Freudian eatable situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about working in a nursing </v>

2281
01:59:23.691 --> 01:59:23.691
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

2282
01:59:23.691 --> 01:59:28.560
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually a rule it's thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I also use to guide my </v>

2283
01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:29.170
<v Speaker 1>interactions with children and also with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my clients.</v>

2284
01:59:29.171 --> 01:59:34.171
<v Speaker 1>And I would say with people in general </v>
<v Speaker 1>do not do anything for anyone that they </v>

2285
01:59:34.171 --> 01:59:36.700
<v Speaker 1>can do themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you do is steal.</v>

2286
01:59:36.930 --> 01:59:41.930
<v Speaker 1>You just steal it from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're working with really </v>

2287
01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:41.930
<v Speaker 1>elderly people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know they have Alzheimer's.</v>

2288
01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:44.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like really easy to do things for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because while it isn't,</v>

2289
01:59:44.890 --> 01:59:49.890
<v Speaker 1>because it's really a hard job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be easier to do something </v>

2290
01:59:49.890 --> 01:59:51.640
<v Speaker 1>for them then to let them struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>

2291
01:59:52.330 --> 01:59:54.130
<v Speaker 1>but you just speed their device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2292
01:59:54.131 --> 01:59:59.131
<v Speaker 1>By taking away the last vestiges of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their independence and you do the same </v>

2293
01:59:59.131 --> 01:59:59.980
<v Speaker 1>thing with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like struggle through it.</v>

2294
01:59:59.981 --> 02:00:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see my left foot?</v>

2295
02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about this author whose name </v>

2296
02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>escapes me at the moment.</v>

2297
02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant movie and the person who </v>

2298
02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>who played the part is Daniel Day Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he went to academy award for it,</v>

2299
02:00:16.721 --> 02:00:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's about this author in Ireland </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was.</v>

2300
02:00:20.290 --> 02:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>I think he had cerebral palsy and all he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could really do was use his left foot.</v>

2301
02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of him was pretty spastic and </v>

2302
02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>not in not controllable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was there.</v>

2303
02:00:30.251 --> 02:00:35.251
<v Speaker 1>He was very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was with it and his dad would not </v>

2304
02:00:35.251 --> 02:00:38.761
<v Speaker 1>help him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to drag himself up the damn </v>

2305
02:00:38.761 --> 02:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>stairs with his left foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just would not help him.</v>

2306
02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was he learned how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>

2307
02:00:42.610 --> 02:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually,</v>

2308
02:00:43.810 --> 02:00:47.140
<v Speaker 1>he could function and the movie does the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

2309
02:00:47.650 --> 02:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>which is called my left foot and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie does a lovely job of laying that </v>

2310
02:00:52.650 --> 02:00:55.411
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be one hardhearted son </v>

2311
02:00:55.411 --> 02:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>of a bitch to let your son crawl up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs with his left foot over and over.</v>

2312
02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>You think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's the alternative,</v>

2313
02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:02.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he would have been.</v>

2314
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>And of course he lays this out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

2315
02:01:04.151 --> 02:01:09.151
<v Speaker 1>if he would have been catered to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have ended up just like you'd </v>

2316
02:01:10.241 --> 02:01:15.241
<v Speaker 1>expect someone who is always catered to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very nice lesson in the </v>

2317
02:01:18.551 --> 02:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>triumph of fostering independence over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2318
02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.600
<v Speaker 1>over to casual compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would say.</v>

2319
02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you look at the coachman here kind of</v>

2320
02:01:28.241 --> 02:01:30.280
<v Speaker 1>looks like a demented Santa Claus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2321
02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.930
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a beard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

2322
02:01:32.130 --> 02:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice touch on the animators </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties.</v>

2323
02:01:34.330 --> 02:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Even got the pipe and the red suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's listening to the Fox and the</v>

2324
02:01:38.561 --> 02:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>cat brag about how much money they made </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling Pinocchio to the puppet master.</v>

2325
02:01:43.041 --> 02:01:48.041
<v Speaker 1>And how evil and terrible they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're bragging way and he's the </v>

2326
02:01:48.041 --> 02:01:48.041
<v Speaker 1>real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2327
02:01:48.041 --> 02:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the real thing.</v>

2328
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And he can see through their little </v>
<v Speaker 1>petty,</v>

2329
02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:57.340
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandiose tales of criminality and has </v>

2330
02:01:57.340 --> 02:02:01.301
<v Speaker 1>nothing but contempt for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that in his facial </v>

2331
02:02:01.301 --> 02:02:04.661
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you sitting back a bit </v>

2332
02:02:04.661 --> 02:02:04.661
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep talking.</v>

2333
02:02:04.661 --> 02:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Bucko pretty soon I'm going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right where I want you.</v>

2334
02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:10.630
<v Speaker 1>And so the Fox and the cat are drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>beer and smoking cigarettes and talking </v>

2335
02:02:10.630 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>about how evil they are and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bragging about how they got one over</v>

2336
02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:17.591
<v Speaker 1>on the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a four year old real impressive </v>

2337
02:02:17.591 --> 02:02:18.350
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real impressive.</v>

2338
02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:20.650
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2339
02:02:20.730 --> 02:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coachman is thinking up his own </v>

2340
02:02:25.730 --> 02:02:27.611
<v Speaker 1>nefarious schemes right now for what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>might do with that puppet if he got his </v>

2341
02:02:27.611 --> 02:02:28.610
<v Speaker 1>hands on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what he reveals himself,</v>

2342
02:02:28.611 --> 02:02:33.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you see filmmakers just do it </v>

2343
02:02:33.611 --> 02:02:33.611
<v Speaker 1>for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an archetype.</v>

2344
02:02:33.611 --> 02:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Old trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've got the Fox in the cat,</v>

2345
02:02:35.930 --> 02:02:38.930
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of petty examples of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of criminality and evil.</v>

2346
02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:41.270
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got the coachman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the real thing,</v>

2347
02:02:41.271 --> 02:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>but he's not really shown anybody who he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2348
02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And then at one scene in the bar he lets</v>
<v Speaker 1>his guard down and he lets them see what</v>

2349
02:02:47.901 --> 02:02:52.901
<v Speaker 1>he's really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you see this all teeth and </v>

2350
02:02:52.901 --> 02:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>predatory eyes and glee all at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2351
02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad combination.</v>

2352
02:02:57.650 --> 02:03:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat you and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make me very happy.</v>

2353
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>That's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do not want to see that look on </v>

2354
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>someone's face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the look.</v>

2355
02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:10.160
<v Speaker 1>And the Fox is traumatized by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just like,</v>

2356
02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:13.850
<v Speaker 1>he thinks he's a bad guy and he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

2357
02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>he just can't be a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't got the talent to be a bad </v>

2358
02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2359
02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>And then he's talking to the coach when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bragging and the coach was,</v>

2360
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:24.170
<v Speaker 1>had enough of it and shows his real face</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

2361
02:03:25.190 --> 02:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Fox gets a real glimpse into hell </v>

2362
02:03:30.190 --> 02:03:30.780
<v Speaker 1>and that just terrifies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's and,</v>

2363
02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>and then a coach when the other thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the coachman does is reveal his plans </v>

2364
02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:38.810
<v Speaker 1>and his plans are to kidnap Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with a bunch of other boys,</v>

2365
02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:43.730
<v Speaker 1>had to take them to this place called </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure island and the Fox knows what's</v>

2366
02:03:43.731 --> 02:03:45.950
<v Speaker 1>going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

2367
02:03:46.190 --> 02:03:50.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the foreshadowing of the next stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the adventure.</v>

2368
02:03:55.660 --> 02:04:00.660
<v Speaker 1>And so after the Fox and the cat or </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified the coachman who takes you </v>

2369
02:04:02.291 --> 02:04:07.291
<v Speaker 1>along with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a little chat with them and they </v>

2370
02:04:07.291 --> 02:04:10.741
<v Speaker 1>described exactly what they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do next and the Fox and the cat know </v>

2371
02:04:10.741 --> 02:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well that they're over their </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2372
02:04:12.010 --> 02:04:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But at this point in their misadventures</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no pulling back and I think </v>

2373
02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.800
<v Speaker 1>we'll stop there even though it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little early because that was a lot of </v>

2374
02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>material and this is a really good place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop.</v>

2375
02:04:23.890 --> 02:04:28.890
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd be happy to take some </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions if you guys have some </v>

2376
02:04:28.890 --> 02:04:32.581
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could take questions for like 10 </v>

2377
02:04:32.581 --> 02:04:34.820
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then we'll call it a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2378
02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:38.840
<v Speaker 1>And you can me a question about anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

2379
02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:42.500
<v Speaker 5>It's the beginning of the lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how do,</v>

2380
02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:45.210
<v Speaker 5>how does morality from</v>

2381
02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>stronger and weaker to what's good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

2382
02:04:51.010 --> 02:04:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends to some degree on </v>

2383
02:04:56.010 --> 02:04:58.051
<v Speaker 1>what you mean by stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So physical strength is one element and </v>

2384
02:04:58.051 --> 02:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at mythological heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that the stories of heroes are </v>

2385
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>fragmented elements of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2386
02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:11.910
<v Speaker 1>of the archetype and so one kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal hero obviously as someone </v>

2387
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>who's physically strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2388
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>you see that there's a great movie that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could watch about this.</v>

2389
02:05:16.301 --> 02:05:21.301
<v Speaker 1>It's called Hitman Hart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best documentaries I've </v>

2390
02:05:21.301 --> 02:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>ever seen and it's about this guy named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bret Harte.</v>

2391
02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Bret Harte was for a while the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous Canadian on the planet and he was</v>

2392
02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>a worldwide wrestling foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2393
02:05:30.131 --> 02:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>What do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wwf?</v>

2394
02:05:32.410 --> 02:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was there like lead good guy.</v>

2395
02:05:35.770 --> 02:05:40.770
<v Speaker 1>And so he and wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the documentary because when I </v>

2396
02:05:40.770 --> 02:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like four or five,</v>

2397
02:05:41.321 --> 02:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch his father whose name </v>
<v Speaker 1>was Stu Hart,</v>

2398
02:05:44.110 --> 02:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>who ran this channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wrestling confederation in Alberta.</v>

2399
02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>And Stu Hart had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think eight boys and he trained all of</v>

2400
02:05:52.931 --> 02:05:57.931
<v Speaker 1>them to be pro wrestlers and part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie is extraordinarily funny because </v>

2401
02:05:57.931 --> 02:06:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Stu Hart is in it and he's really old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like 85 and he's just barely.</v>

2402
02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like a pro wrestler for 40 years,</v>

2403
02:06:04.091 --> 02:06:09.091
<v Speaker 1>like every joint is broken and he still </v>
<v Speaker 1>big but he's just barely moving and this</v>

2404
02:06:10.330 --> 02:06:15.330
<v Speaker 1>is this kid and another kid come over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stu is telling the story about how </v>

2405
02:06:16.391 --> 02:06:18.820
<v Speaker 1>it used to take his boys into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement and toughen them up.</v>

2406
02:06:18.821 --> 02:06:22.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think Brent called that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey to pain or something like that.</v>

2407
02:06:22.921 --> 02:06:27.921
<v Speaker 1>His father would take all these kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>down there and wrestle with them and </v>

2408
02:06:27.921 --> 02:06:28.780
<v Speaker 1>push them right to the edge of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain tolerance constantly.</v>

2409
02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grew up tough.</v>

2410
02:06:31.181 --> 02:06:33.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2411
02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:35.620
<v Speaker 1>all his daughters married pro wrestlers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2412
02:06:35.621 --> 02:06:37.270
<v Speaker 1>and I think he had seven daughters.</v>

2413
02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:40.600
<v Speaker 1>So he's quite the character anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two kids,</v>

2414
02:06:40.601 --> 02:06:45.601
<v Speaker 1>they're like their late adolescence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early adulthood come over and one of </v>

2415
02:06:45.601 --> 02:06:47.560
<v Speaker 1>them is pretty damn cocky and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to Stewart.</v>

2416
02:06:47.561 --> 02:06:49.180
<v Speaker 1>He says something smart like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2417
02:06:49.181 --> 02:06:50.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were pretty,</v>

2418
02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:51.880
<v Speaker 1>you were pretty tough with the old days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2419
02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:53.560
<v Speaker 1>and stew looks at them and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2420
02:06:53.561 --> 02:06:58.561
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you come down to the basement </v>

2421
02:06:58.561 --> 02:06:58.561
<v Speaker 1>with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

2422
02:06:58.561 --> 02:06:58.720
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hurt you old man.</v>

2423
02:06:58.750 --> 02:07:03.750
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the filmmakers follow them into the </v>

2424
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:06.901
<v Speaker 1>basement day and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like they're kind of standing there </v>

2425
02:07:06.901 --> 02:07:08.920
<v Speaker 1>and the old guy grabs him in a headlock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes him like,</v>

2426
02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>he's like a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2427
02:07:10.210 --> 02:07:15.210
<v Speaker 1>he's got her in a headlock like so fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the kid doesn't know what to </v>

2428
02:07:15.210 --> 02:07:15.210
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

2429
02:07:15.210 --> 02:07:16.120
<v Speaker 1>So stew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2430
02:07:16.210 --> 02:07:17.740
<v Speaker 1>who knows how to put a headlock on </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

2431
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:19.810
<v Speaker 1>He's flexing his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his uh,</v>

2432
02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:22.030
<v Speaker 1>his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his forearm.</v>

2433
02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is still not so bad.</v>

2434
02:07:24.161 --> 02:07:26.830
<v Speaker 1>A forearm and he's got this guy's face </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just,</v>

2435
02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:28.300
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2436
02:07:28.301 --> 02:07:33.301
<v Speaker 1>he's stepped in a bear trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus he's absolutely shocked that this </v>

2437
02:07:33.301 --> 02:07:34.600
<v Speaker 1>old guy got him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's kind of gasping.</v>

2438
02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Stu says something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch,</v>

2439
02:07:37.031 --> 02:07:42.031
<v Speaker 1>if I flex this muscle just right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see this vein on his </v>

2440
02:07:42.031 --> 02:07:43.240
<v Speaker 1>forehead start to pop out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily funny,</v>

2441
02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>20 ways Bret Hart plays out the good guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype and Brett's like,</v>

2442
02:07:49.001 --> 02:07:50.600
<v Speaker 1>he's a solid guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

2443
02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I would say he's not particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and I'm not being cruel </v>

2444
02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:59.431
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had a great career and he's </v>

2445
02:07:59.431 --> 02:08:00.220
<v Speaker 1>tough as a boot and so good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he plays out this,</v>

2446
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:03.790
<v Speaker 1>this good guy archetype and he gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangled up in it.</v>

2447
02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:07.780
<v Speaker 1>And now I don't remember your damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>question but I am trying to answer it.</v>

2448
02:08:08.130 --> 02:08:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Tell me the question again.</v>

2449
02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2450
02:08:16.511 --> 02:08:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2451
02:08:17.291 --> 02:08:22.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things I really liked </v>

2452
02:08:22.291 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 1>about this movie was it showed me why </v>
<v Speaker 1>people watched wrestling and I couldn't,</v>

2453
02:08:22.930 --> 02:08:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't because certainly they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not appealing and I'm not being.</v>

2454
02:08:27.970 --> 02:08:32.970
<v Speaker 1>There are different strata of conception</v>
<v Speaker 1>of abstraction that any entertainment </v>

2455
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.650
<v Speaker 1>process has to appeal to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2456
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:41.670
<v Speaker 1>most people don't go to movies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually because it really is </v>

2457
02:08:41.670 --> 02:08:43.800
<v Speaker 1>because movies operate at a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophistication that are too high,</v>

2458
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:46.600
<v Speaker 1>that is too high for many people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like novels.</v>

2459
02:08:46.601 --> 02:08:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean hardly anyone reads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2460
02:08:49.001 --> 02:08:54.001
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you about 15 percent of the </v>

2461
02:08:54.001 --> 02:08:56.341
<v Speaker 1>population might be 20 percent cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>read well enough to follow written </v>

2462
02:08:56.341 --> 02:08:59.140
<v Speaker 1>instructions and so [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are,</v>

2463
02:08:59.350 --> 02:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's 15 percent of the population </v>
<v Speaker 1>or 10 percent have never finished a </v>

2464
02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

2465
02:09:04.450 --> 02:09:06.250
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is that high,</v>

2466
02:09:06.930 --> 02:09:09.310
<v Speaker 1>but you still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still,</v>

2467
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>the archetypes still needs to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself at different levels and so it </v>

2468
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:17.881
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even there where it is physical </v>

2469
02:09:17.881 --> 02:09:19.120
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just physical force like it's a</v>

2470
02:09:19.121 --> 02:09:24.121
<v Speaker 1>drama between good and evil and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see this so clearly and in there Brett </v>

2471
02:09:24.121 --> 02:09:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Hart documentary because he's the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and you know,</v>

2472
02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:28.300
<v Speaker 1>the bad guys are really over the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2473
02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a real drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's good versus evil in the </v>

2474
02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:36.331
<v Speaker 1>rain every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully good winds but good often </v>

2475
02:09:36.331 --> 02:09:36.331
<v Speaker 1>gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2476
02:09:36.331 --> 02:09:40.621
<v Speaker 1>maybe the bad wrestler brings two of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends in and they bring in chairs and </v>

2477
02:09:40.621 --> 02:09:40.930
<v Speaker 1>they bashed the hell out of the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2478
02:09:40.931 --> 02:09:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And the whole audience is just outraged </v>
<v Speaker 1>by this.</v>

2479
02:09:43.631 --> 02:09:47.200
<v Speaker 1>And and the documentary does a lovely </v>
<v Speaker 1>job of showing that,</v>

2480
02:09:47.230 --> 02:09:50.500
<v Speaker 1>but so even at the level of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat,</v>

2481
02:09:50.501 --> 02:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>let's say you can't reduce what's good </v>
<v Speaker 1>to what strong,</v>

2482
02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>it's just one element of it better to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong than to be weak and so you can </v>

2483
02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:02.650
<v Speaker 1>have a strong hero because it's better </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be strong than to be weak,</v>

2484
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:07.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's better to be strong and kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>than to be strong and it's better to be </v>

2485
02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:10.060
<v Speaker 1>strong and kind and wise than to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong and kind.</v>

2486
02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:10.870
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

2487
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's true not only for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings but it's even true,</v>

2488
02:10:14.381 --> 02:10:19.381
<v Speaker 1>let's say at the wolf for the chimpanzee</v>
<v Speaker 1>level because one of the things you see </v>

2489
02:10:19.381 --> 02:10:22.420
<v Speaker 1>with the chimp dominance hierarchies if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I mentioned this before,</v>

2490
02:10:22.421 --> 02:10:27.421
<v Speaker 1>is if the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominant male is really good at </v>

2491
02:10:27.421 --> 02:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>fostering social relations and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>reciprocal in acts like grooming and </v>

2492
02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:33.890
<v Speaker 1>also paying attention to the females and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their offspring.</v>

2493
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:39.280
<v Speaker 1>His dynasty will be much more stable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so strong might be good for one battle.</v>

2494
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:44.780
<v Speaker 1>It might be good for two battles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for 50 battles it's not optimized.</v>

2495
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Especially because no law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how strong you are,</v>

2496
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:50.970
<v Speaker 1>someone can take you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2497
02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:56.360
<v Speaker 1>so what happens is the idea of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal becomes increasingly complex </v>

2498
02:10:56.391 --> 02:10:57.950
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multifaceted,</v>

2499
02:10:58.010 --> 02:10:59.990
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so strength,</v>

2500
02:10:59.991 --> 02:11:01.160
<v Speaker 1>wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

2501
02:11:01.161 --> 02:11:06.161
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things are amalgamated into a </v>

2502
02:11:06.161 --> 02:11:08.561
<v Speaker 1>single B and we'll talk a lot about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to show you how that </v>

2503
02:11:08.561 --> 02:11:13.061
<v Speaker 1>happened in Mesopotamia because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first places where we have </v>

2504
02:11:13.061 --> 02:11:13.820
<v Speaker 1>documentation about how that ideally </v>
<v Speaker 1>merged.</v>

2505
02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:18.980
<v Speaker 1>They have a god called Marduk and Martin</v>
<v Speaker 1>had 50 names and as far as I can tell,</v>

2506
02:11:18.981 --> 02:11:23.981
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that was that Martech was</v>
<v Speaker 1>an amalgam of the tribal deities of at </v>

2507
02:11:23.981 --> 02:11:28.331
<v Speaker 1>least 50 tribes and and when the tribes </v>
<v Speaker 1>were brought together and civilized,</v>

2508
02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:34.090
<v Speaker 1>each of their gods who were ideals had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a male debated in something that </v>

2509
02:11:34.090 --> 02:11:37.991
<v Speaker 1>was a single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single dramatized representation of </v>

2510
02:11:37.991 --> 02:11:42.911
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or there was no way that all those </v>

2511
02:11:42.911 --> 02:11:42.911
<v Speaker 1>people could have lived together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2512
02:11:42.911 --> 02:11:46.800
<v Speaker 1>There are different value structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have fragmented them and they </v>

2513
02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:47.570
<v Speaker 1>would have stated in a state of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is,</v>

2514
02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:51.920
<v Speaker 1>what's the question you're asking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not strength than what is it?</v>

2515
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Well straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an element,</v>

2516
02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:58.600
<v Speaker 1>but the Egyptians figured out that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was vision is actually the capacity to </v>

2517
02:11:59.271 --> 02:12:02.570
<v Speaker 1>pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was paramount and the Mesopotamians</v>

2518
02:12:02.571 --> 02:12:07.571
<v Speaker 1>have that figured out more or less too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're god Marduk had eyes all </v>

2519
02:12:07.571 --> 02:12:08.120
<v Speaker 1>the way around his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could see everywhere.</v>

2520
02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:12.260
<v Speaker 1>So seeing was a critical element of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be on top.</v>

2521
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:15.350
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing for the Mrs Heyman's</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the ability to speak.</v>

2522
02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:20.860
<v Speaker 1>So by the time of Mesopotamia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had already dramatized the idea </v>

2523
02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:25.331
<v Speaker 1>that the cardinal human attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our vision and the ability to speak so </v>

2524
02:12:25.851 --> 02:12:27.770
<v Speaker 1>and that'd be the ability to speak the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

2525
02:12:27.771 --> 02:12:32.600
<v Speaker 1>to not just speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other questions</v>

2526
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:41.310
<v Speaker 6>mean that wasn't really aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So is that why we sort of considered,</v>

2527
02:12:47.890 --> 02:12:52.890
<v Speaker 6>because we were talking earlier that </v>
<v Speaker 6>different levels of obstruction of </v>

2528
02:12:52.890 --> 02:12:54.850
<v Speaker 6>celebrity perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more like reality TV.</v>

2529
02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:59.620
<v Speaker 6>Incredible being lower than a match than</v>
<v Speaker 6>a theater actor.</v>

2530
02:12:59.630 --> 02:13:00.710
<v Speaker 6>Then like a novelist.</v>

2531
02:13:01.630 --> 02:13:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly why.</v>

2532
02:13:03.731 --> 02:13:08.731
<v Speaker 1>Because you see the less sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>the genre,</v>

2533
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:18.510
<v Speaker 1>the more the genre is like real life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more sophisticated it is,</v>

2534
02:13:19.870 --> 02:13:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the more it has abstracted out across </v>
<v Speaker 1>instances of real life,</v>

2535
02:13:24.341 --> 02:13:28.060
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes something profound</v>

2536
02:13:28.061 --> 02:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>and deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's abstracted from multiple.</v>

2537
02:13:31.530 --> 02:13:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And that applies across multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions because that's what you want.</v>

2538
02:13:35.530 --> 02:13:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's why.</v>

2539
02:13:37.170 --> 02:13:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are,</v>

2540
02:13:41.070 --> 02:13:43.890
<v Speaker 1>you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the problem.</v>

2541
02:13:44.070 --> 02:13:48.930
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that there are problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is a Meta problem.</v>

2542
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:53.340
<v Speaker 1>There are problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a solution to that.</v>

2543
02:13:53.370 --> 02:13:58.370
<v Speaker 1>That's not a solution to a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a medical solution to the class </v>

2544
02:13:58.370 --> 02:13:58.920
<v Speaker 1>of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2545
02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what people have been trying </v>

2546
02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:04.340
<v Speaker 1>to figure out ever since we were able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually figure things out.</v>

2547
02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:07.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not how do you solve a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it's,</v>

2548
02:14:07.171 --> 02:14:11.610
<v Speaker 1>how do you act so that you solve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of problems and that's basically</v>

2549
02:14:11.670 --> 02:14:16.290
<v Speaker 1>at least the complexity of life and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you're mortal and vulnerable.</v>

2550
02:14:16.770 --> 02:14:17.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2551
02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:22.660
<v Speaker 6>so follow up question from your book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have this sort of strata from play </v>

2552
02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:28.180
<v Speaker 6>all the way up to religion and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>beyond that sort of looking back </v>

2553
02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:29.220
<v Speaker 6>practically with philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 6>irrationality.</v>

2554
02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:30.730
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Israel is.</v>

2555
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2556
02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:39.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good.</v>

2557
02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

2558
02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:48.060
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to think this </v>

2559
02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:49.471
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to do that is to read </v>

2560
02:14:49.471 --> 02:14:49.471
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche and Dostoevsky at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2561
02:14:49.471 --> 02:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm sure there's other ways of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2562
02:14:50.321 --> 02:14:55.321
<v Speaker 1>but Nisha was actually quite heavily </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by Dostoevsky more than </v>

2563
02:14:55.321 --> 02:14:59.071
<v Speaker 1>people knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there are thought runs very </v>

2564
02:14:59.071 --> 02:15:00.790
<v Speaker 1>parallel and so Dostoevsky is like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate dramatist,</v>

2565
02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:05.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He embodies his ideas and he has them </v>

2566
02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:08.371
<v Speaker 1>act out in a dramatic space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's literary whereas niche has taken </v>

2567
02:15:08.371 --> 02:15:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that up one level of abstraction to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>semantic.</v>

2568
02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:11.290
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2569
02:15:11.291 --> 02:15:13.720
<v Speaker 1>here's what's going on in an articulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2570
02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:16.180
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't embody it in the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>

2571
02:15:16.181 --> 02:15:17.650
<v Speaker 1>well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's higher,</v>

2572
02:15:17.651 --> 02:15:22.651
<v Speaker 1>but it's only hire in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more abstract in that it's more </v>

2573
02:15:22.651 --> 02:15:27.211
<v Speaker 1>like words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas what Dostoevsky does is half </v>

2574
02:15:27.211 --> 02:15:27.211
<v Speaker 1>words and half images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2575
02:15:27.211 --> 02:15:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Because when you read a novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that people say,</v>

2576
02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:32.800
<v Speaker 1>and the postmodernist say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2577
02:15:32.801 --> 02:15:34.570
<v Speaker 1>where the hell's the meaning in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>novel?</v>

2578
02:15:34.570 --> 02:15:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the word,</v>

2579
02:15:35.891 --> 02:15:37.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the sentence.</v>

2580
02:15:37.751 --> 02:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not in the paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2581
02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:42.070
<v Speaker 1>where do you localize the meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great question.</v>

2582
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Their answers sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the questions great.</v>

2583
02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:50.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happens partly when you're </v>

2584
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:53.161
<v Speaker 1>reading a book is that a novel is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the words trigger representations in </v>

2585
02:15:53.981 --> 02:15:58.810
<v Speaker 1>your imagination and a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information from which a lot of what you</v>

2586
02:15:58.811 --> 02:16:02.620
<v Speaker 1>extract the information from is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>your images,</v>

2587
02:16:02.621 --> 02:16:07.621
<v Speaker 1>stick representation of the words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that image is to representation is </v>

2588
02:16:07.621 --> 02:16:11.851
<v Speaker 1>richer than the words because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>informed by all of your knowledge about </v>

2589
02:16:11.851 --> 02:16:12.770
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

2590
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:17.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens because you go to a movie </v>

2591
02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:17.790
<v Speaker 1>like the Harry Potter movies and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2592
02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:19.120
<v Speaker 1>that's not how I imagined it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2593
02:16:19.121 --> 02:16:24.121
<v Speaker 1>The probability that there'll be a one </v>
<v Speaker 1>to one correspondence between your </v>

2594
02:16:24.121 --> 02:16:25.540
<v Speaker 1>internal representation of the book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie is zero,</v>

2595
02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:28.540
<v Speaker 1>and usually the movie is less rich than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book.</v>

2596
02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love movies.</v>

2597
02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:32.590
<v Speaker 1>And they have their own place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>

2598
02:16:32.591 --> 02:16:37.591
<v Speaker 1>but they're well mini series or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>series now are more approaching the </v>

2599
02:16:37.930 --> 02:16:41.650
<v Speaker 1>complexity and depth of literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can extend across 20 hours,</v>

2600
02:16:42.130 --> 02:16:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2601
02:16:44.430 --> 02:16:49.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to compress a 12 hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading experience into two hours of </v>

2602
02:16:49.430 --> 02:16:49.870
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

2603
02:16:49.871 --> 02:16:54.871
<v Speaker 1>And so what I was trying to do with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy was to show how the knowledge </v>

2604
02:16:54.871 --> 02:16:55.570
<v Speaker 1>moved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like first of all,</v>

2605
02:16:56.260 --> 02:17:01.260
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of implicit in your biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's distributed into society </v>

2606
02:17:01.330 --> 02:17:06.330
<v Speaker 1>and then by imitating society you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it part of your procedures and then you </v>

2607
02:17:06.330 --> 02:17:08.680
<v Speaker 1>watch your own procedures and start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a representation of them.</v>

2608
02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:11.170
<v Speaker 1>And then you can articulate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

2609
02:17:11.530 --> 02:17:14.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bootstrapping process too because</v>

2610
02:17:14.830 --> 02:17:19.150
<v Speaker 1>once you've made the representation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can affect the way you behave.</v>

2611
02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:20.950
<v Speaker 1>And so they start to loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like.</v>

2612
02:17:20.951 --> 02:17:22.450
<v Speaker 1>So here's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one idea.</v>

2613
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:27.870
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that there's a type of male who </v>

2614
02:17:28.511 --> 02:17:32.200
<v Speaker 1>tends to win dominance hierarchy contest</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to merge at the top.</v>

2615
02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:34.660
<v Speaker 1>While that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the case.</v>

2616
02:17:34.661 --> 02:17:39.661
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you're the way you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happened among human </v>

2617
02:17:39.661 --> 02:17:39.970
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so cool,</v>

2618
02:17:39.971 --> 02:17:44.640
<v Speaker 1>is that human females are choosy maters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So about twice as many men,</v>

2619
02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:48.280
<v Speaker 1>men fail in their reproductive efforts </v>
<v Speaker 1>as females fail.</v>

2620
02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the man who succeed are more </v>

2621
02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:53.820
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women are on average,</v>

2622
02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:57.910
<v Speaker 1>more successful and men are on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more failures and more successful.</v>

2623
02:17:57.940 --> 02:18:00.190
<v Speaker 1>And I'm talking strictly about </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction here,</v>

2624
02:18:00.191 --> 02:18:03.580
<v Speaker 1>although it generalizes to other areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking about reproduction.</v>

2625
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:07.240
<v Speaker 1>So how does it work exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2626
02:18:07.690 --> 02:18:10.390
<v Speaker 1>the women have a real trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real problem with mate selection.</v>

2627
02:18:10.391 --> 02:18:12.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like who the hell are you going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have as a mate?</v>

2628
02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's too complex to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women in their genius don't they let </v>

2629
02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:19.090
<v Speaker 1>the men compete and then they peel from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top,</v>

2630
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:23.890
<v Speaker 1>acting out the assumption that the man </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wins is the best man.</v>

2631
02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:27.220
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good assumption because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a bunch of men competing,</v>

2632
02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:32.280
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're competing across </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitions and someone pops up at the </v>

2633
02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:33.160
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think,</v>

2634
02:18:33.161 --> 02:18:34.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may not be worth much,</v>

2635
02:18:34.481 --> 02:18:37.390
<v Speaker 1>but they're better than anyone else at </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that they're doing,</v>

2636
02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:42.600
<v Speaker 1>and that makes men at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy is very attractive </v>

2637
02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:45.811
<v Speaker 1>to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the women accelerate that so </v>

2638
02:18:45.811 --> 02:18:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine they're more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduce.</v>

2639
02:18:46.630 --> 02:18:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity to emerge at the top of the </v>

2640
02:18:51.630 --> 02:18:54.850
<v Speaker 1>set of dominance hierarchies becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>inbuilt into the biology across time.</v>

2641
02:18:55.030 --> 02:19:00.030
<v Speaker 1>And the women exaggerate that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentially allowing them then to </v>

2642
02:19:00.030 --> 02:19:00.280
<v Speaker 1>reproduce.</v>

2643
02:19:00.550 --> 02:19:04.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's also why their mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really are mother nature.</v>

2644
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:06.130
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a metaphor.</v>

2645
02:19:06.610 --> 02:19:11.610
<v Speaker 1>And so then the representation and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology start to tangle together and </v>

2646
02:19:11.801 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2647
02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:14.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the difference between a meme in </v>
<v Speaker 1>an archetype,</v>

2648
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A meme is this idea that propagates </v>

2649
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.761
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an archetype is an idea that has </v>

2650
02:19:23.761 --> 02:19:26.071
<v Speaker 1>propagated itself across such as massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>span of time that it's actually shaped </v>

2651
02:19:26.261 --> 02:19:28.730
<v Speaker 1>the course of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Man,</v>

2652
02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:33.780
<v Speaker 1>you can tell you already how this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't necessarily that you even have </v>

2653
02:19:35.121 --> 02:19:40.121
<v Speaker 1>to compete with other men in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see who wins as soon as you admire </v>

2654
02:19:40.121 --> 02:19:42.800
<v Speaker 1>someone and that'll happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously.</v>

2655
02:19:42.801 --> 02:19:44.420
<v Speaker 1>You won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we won't be able to stop yourself.</v>

2656
02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 1>You've already elevated them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy contest.</v>

2657
02:19:47.810 --> 02:19:52.810
<v Speaker 1>The act of admiration is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition that you've met someone </v>

2658
02:19:52.941 --> 02:19:57.941
<v Speaker 1>who's better at what ever it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to be driving your admiration </v>

2659
02:19:57.941 --> 02:19:57.941
<v Speaker 1>than you are.</v>

2660
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:59.120
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part,</v>

2661
02:19:59.150 --> 02:20:02.480
<v Speaker 1>that's partly the manifestation of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea as the,</v>

2662
02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:03.800
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2663
02:20:04.130 --> 02:20:06.980
<v Speaker 1>what would you say as the representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2664
02:20:07.050 --> 02:20:10.310
<v Speaker 1>as the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And kids do that all the time.</v>

2665
02:20:10.311 --> 02:20:15.311
<v Speaker 1>They hear a worship other kids usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a four year old will latch onto </v>

2666
02:20:15.311 --> 02:20:17.380
<v Speaker 1>some six year old who will just follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>her show photo everywhere,</v>

2667
02:20:17.410 --> 02:20:19.280
<v Speaker 1>do exactly what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2668
02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:21.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2669
02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that person reps represents to </v>

2670
02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:28.880
<v Speaker 1>that child their next ideal there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their conceptualization of the,</v>

2671
02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:30.800
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the place forward.</v>

2672
02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:33.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

2673
02:20:33.890 --> 02:20:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other questions or should we maybe </v>

2674
02:20:38.890 --> 02:20:39.460
<v Speaker 1>call it a day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2675
02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:45.700
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you said that the guy who was the </v>

2676
02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:48.400
<v Speaker 6>other thing was predatory bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is insanity.</v>

2677
02:20:48.430 --> 02:20:49.670
<v Speaker 6>How do you define a Saturday in this?</v>

2678
02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

2679
02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:57.360
<v Speaker 1>let's call it what you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter alone in an alley at midnight </v>

2680
02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:01.600
<v Speaker 1>and leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is what I mean in this context.</v>

2681
02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:06.790
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then not only is the person they're </v>

2682
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:09.720
<v Speaker 1>waiting for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're looking forward to whatever </v>

2683
02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:09.720
<v Speaker 1>might happen.</v>

2684
02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:13.270
<v Speaker 6>I just mean like in a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 6>contract using that word safe because </v>

2685
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:14.050
<v Speaker 6>like as little connotation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I was thinking straddling.</v>

2686
02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:17.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the movie provides the,</v>

2687
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:22.510
<v Speaker 1>the frame for the interpretation in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular situation and so he's the </v>

2688
02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:25.150
<v Speaker 1>thing that hauls naive young boys off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their doom.</v>

2689
02:21:25.570 --> 02:21:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's bounded.</v>

2690
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:29.740
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>

2691
02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:34.840
<v Speaker 7>If you can elaborate a bit on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You mentioned,</v>

2692
02:21:34.841 --> 02:21:39.760
<v Speaker 7>you talked about this mental process </v>
<v Speaker 7>where people do the thing that's hard,</v>

2693
02:21:39.761 --> 02:21:41.590
<v Speaker 7>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's start,</v>

2694
02:21:41.591 --> 02:21:46.591
<v Speaker 7>but still facing the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's actually a really productive way </v>

2695
02:21:46.591 --> 02:21:51.441
<v Speaker 7>of procrastinating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Although it comes with its own problems </v>

2696
02:21:51.441 --> 02:21:52.740
<v Speaker 7>of rationalization,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so reinforces certain circuits.</v>

2697
02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:56.590
<v Speaker 7>I'll put it in a way that says that </v>
<v Speaker 7>those can go away,</v>

2698
02:21:56.591 --> 02:22:01.591
<v Speaker 7>so you need to bring up the the other </v>
<v Speaker 7>inhibitory circuits and they're just </v>

2699
02:22:01.591 --> 02:22:02.730
<v Speaker 7>wondering if you could elaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2700
02:22:02.731 --> 02:22:07.731
<v Speaker 7>I can sure is in the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 7>possibility around their understanding </v>

2701
02:22:07.731 --> 02:22:08.430
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2702
02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:13.290
<v Speaker 7>I've derived out partly from my study of</v>
<v Speaker 7>addiction and also from my study of a</v>

2703
02:22:15.290 --> 02:22:17.660
<v Speaker 1>recovery from posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

2704
02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:22.690
<v Speaker 1>but let's talk about addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a series of actions that </v>

2705
02:22:23.481 --> 02:22:28.470
<v Speaker 1>occur before you take your cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those are local.</v>

2706
02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:30.960
<v Speaker 1>They are the things that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately before and some of those are</v>

2707
02:22:30.961 --> 02:22:35.961
<v Speaker 1>distal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're farther back in the chain of </v>

2708
02:22:35.961 --> 02:22:36.980
<v Speaker 1>events and when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a hit of cocaine,</v>

2709
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:40.260
<v Speaker 1>it produces a dopaminergic burst and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that feels really good,</v>

2710
02:22:40.261 --> 02:22:44.670
<v Speaker 1>but it also makes the circuits that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately active before that grow.</v>

2711
02:22:45.570 --> 02:22:49.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what reinforcement is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the growth is proportionate,</v>

2712
02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:54.680
<v Speaker 1>not linearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's proportionate to how long </v>

2713
02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:56.280
<v Speaker 1>before that event occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closer it is,</v>

2714
02:22:56.281 --> 02:23:01.281
<v Speaker 1>the stronger they're going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even the ones that are somewhat </v>

2715
02:23:01.281 --> 02:23:02.040
<v Speaker 1>distal gets some reinforcement because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

2716
02:23:02.041 --> 02:23:03.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you do before?</v>

2717
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:07.320
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you found your latest fix and the answer</v>

2718
02:23:07.321 --> 02:23:08.400
<v Speaker 1>is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long before?</v>

2719
02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the closer,</v>

2720
02:23:10.021 --> 02:23:13.350
<v Speaker 1>the more reward and so what happens then</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

2721
02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:16.250
<v Speaker 1>so if you take that person out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal environment,</v>

2722
02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:19.550
<v Speaker 1>you put them into a treatment center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're off.</v>

2723
02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:24.560
<v Speaker 1>There are physical addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a weird thing in the case of </v>

2724
02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:26.760
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like not that long a week.</v>

2725
02:23:26.761 --> 02:23:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it two weeks for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even heroin and alcohol for sure,</v>

2726
02:23:30.901 --> 02:23:35.901
<v Speaker 1>if you can get them through the seizure </v>
<v Speaker 1>part without dying and so they're done.</v>

2727
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.970
<v Speaker 1>They're done on physiologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent anymore.</v>

2728
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:43.360
<v Speaker 1>But you let that person go and the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that happens is,</v>

2729
02:23:43.390 --> 02:23:47.310
<v Speaker 1>is an old friend who he's always out </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing drugs with shows up and bang,</v>

2730
02:23:47.311 --> 02:23:52.311
<v Speaker 1>he's craving like mad and that's because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing is in an area is not dead at </v>

2731
02:23:52.381 --> 02:23:56.780
<v Speaker 1>all and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's activated by the q and it's a.</v>

2732
02:23:56.860 --> 02:23:58.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2733
02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:01.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only wants one thing at once.</v>

2734
02:24:01.951 --> 02:24:06.951
<v Speaker 1>Cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to suppress any non related </v>

2735
02:24:06.951 --> 02:24:08.220
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and it'll use lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no problem.</v>

2736
02:24:08.221 --> 02:24:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Especially if lies have been reinforced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they certainly have.</v>

2737
02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Where are you off to sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you'll have a live for that and</v>

2738
02:24:15.871 --> 02:24:20.310
<v Speaker 1>then 10 minutes later you have your drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that little lie has just grown or</v>

2739
02:24:20.311 --> 02:24:25.311
<v Speaker 1>maybe you think you've tried to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think to hell with it and every </v>

2740
02:24:25.311 --> 02:24:26.640
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes before you take your drug,</v>

2741
02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:29.490
<v Speaker 1>you think to hell with it and you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a thousand times.</v>

2742
02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me that to hell with it circuit,</v>

2743
02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:37.220
<v Speaker 1>that sucker is strong and so it's alive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like it just disappears.</v>

2744
02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:39.930
<v Speaker 1>It can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you.</v>

2745
02:24:39.931 --> 02:24:44.931
<v Speaker 1>It's grown in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can build another circuit to </v>

2746
02:24:44.931 --> 02:24:49.071
<v Speaker 1>shut it down and you can help it </v>
<v Speaker 1>decompose across time by not giving it </v>

2747
02:24:49.071 --> 02:24:53.361
<v Speaker 1>what it wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have to not give it </v>

2748
02:24:53.361 --> 02:24:56.091
<v Speaker 1>what it wants and all of the multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>contexts that you've already associated </v>

2749
02:24:56.091 --> 02:24:56.091
<v Speaker 1>with the drug.</v>

2750
02:24:56.091 --> 02:25:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Some of you have probably smoked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then tried to quit smoking and what </v>

2751
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:01.620
<v Speaker 1>you'll see is you get a craving when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2752
02:25:01.621 --> 02:25:03.870
<v Speaker 1>when you have a cup of coffee or when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're finished dinner,</v>

2753
02:25:03.871 --> 02:25:08.871
<v Speaker 1>when you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a phone call or when you first </v>

2754
02:25:08.871 --> 02:25:09.570
<v Speaker 1>get up in the morning or whenever you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly had the drug,</v>

2755
02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:13.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever you had the drug in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to even complex things like</v>

2756
02:25:13.711 --> 02:25:18.711
<v Speaker 1>ending a conversation will produce a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cute craving and so then that can </v>

2757
02:25:18.711 --> 02:25:23.301
<v Speaker 1>extinguish overtime if you punish it by </v>
<v Speaker 1>either punishing it or not letting it </v>

2758
02:25:23.301 --> 02:25:28.230
<v Speaker 1>what it's wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot you have to build another </v>

2759
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:30.220
<v Speaker 1>circuit to just shut it down and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that circuits kind of fragile and stress</v>

2760
02:25:30.221 --> 02:25:32.230
<v Speaker 1>can often disrupt it so</v>

2761
02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:37.110
<v Speaker 7>that can be read about quitting smoking </v>
<v Speaker 7>or things like,</v>

2762
02:25:38.170 --> 02:25:43.170
<v Speaker 1>oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well part of it while I begins a whole </v>

2763
02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:43.630
<v Speaker 1>different thing because it seems to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a direct physiological effect,</v>

2764
02:25:43.631 --> 02:25:45.460
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2765
02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:48.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the addiction has a cognitive component.</v>

2766
02:25:48.071 --> 02:25:51.100
<v Speaker 1>It's full of thoughts and desires and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants and you know,</v>

2767
02:25:51.101 --> 02:25:56.101
<v Speaker 1>you may have to build a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have may have to rebuild your whole </v>

2768
02:25:56.101 --> 02:25:57.550
<v Speaker 1>personality in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get that thing cornered.</v>

2769
02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Religious conversion for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in a really effective treatment for </v>

2770
02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:06.481
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why alcoholic alcoholics </v>

2771
02:26:06.481 --> 02:26:07.480
<v Speaker 1>anonymous works for the people for whom </v>
<v Speaker 1>it does work,</v>

2772
02:26:07.540 --> 02:26:11.140
<v Speaker 1>but religious conversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is total personality conversion is</v>

2773
02:26:11.141 --> 02:26:16.141
<v Speaker 1>actually one of the few things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know of that's an effective treatment </v>

2774
02:26:16.141 --> 02:26:16.840
<v Speaker 1>for alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to induce it,</v>

2775
02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:22.380
<v Speaker 1>but although that's not exactly true </v>
<v Speaker 1>either because I'm in the early work </v>

2776
02:26:22.661 --> 02:26:27.661
<v Speaker 1>with Lsd was lsd was quite promising as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a treatment for for an alcohol addiction</v>

2777
02:26:28.390 --> 02:26:32.470
<v Speaker 1>and there's recent work with psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and showing that if you.</v>

2778
02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:37.740
<v Speaker 1>If people have a mystical experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you give them suicide and their </v>

2779
02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:38.710
<v Speaker 1>success rate and quitting smoking is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 80 percent,</v>

2780
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:42.210
<v Speaker 1>which is way higher than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacological intervention for smoking</v>

2781
02:26:42.211 --> 02:26:43.840
<v Speaker 1>has ever beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2782
02:26:44.490 --> 02:26:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should probably call it a day,</v>

2783
02:26:46.450 --> 02:26:48.280
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see you in a week.</v>
