1
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.310
<v Speaker 2>So I hope we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My plan is to finish this today.</v>

2
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.330
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll go into the more concrete</v>

3
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:24.331
<v Speaker 2>details now that you've got some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the way that a narrative like this </v>

4
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 2>can unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you remember,</v>

5
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.830
<v Speaker 2>we were just leaving this terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bar,</v>

6
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 2>which I think was called the red lobster</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that where the Fox and</v>

7
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:38.731
<v Speaker 2>the cat had met the coachman and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coachman is obviously someone who takes </v>

8
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 2>you somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

9
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 2>it takes you on a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the coachman basically revealed </v>

10
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 2>himself first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of looks like a,</v>

11
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 2>I guess a somewhat jolly old man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although his expression doesn't </v>

12
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 2>precisely read as Jolie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he reveals himself as something</v>

13
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 2>positively say tannic and that's enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>to terrify these two bit thugs,</v>

14
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 2>the Fox and the cat who think they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough but really are tough at all.</v>

15
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 2>And so they see at some point what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really tangled up in.</v>

16
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:15.541
<v Speaker 2>And I think I mentioned to you that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was something akin young had this idea </v>

17
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 2>that people's shadows reach all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to hell,</v>

18
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 2>which is a very frightening concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he meant by that is,</v>

19
00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 2>is that if you take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulses that drive you,</v>

20
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 2>that are actually malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can admit to such impulses that </v>

21
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 2>if you basically follow those all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way down to their origin,</v>

22
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:39.721
<v Speaker 2>you find some very nasty things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you find down there basically </v>

23
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:42.991
<v Speaker 2>is what allies you with people who've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done terrible things and that that's not</v>

24
00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 2>a very pleasant experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

25
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:53.431
<v Speaker 2>Although one thing that's worth thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about is that it is something that can </v>

26
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 2>protect you against being very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very badly hurt.</v>

27
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterizes people who develop </v>

28
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.931
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic stress disorder is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're often naive and then they </v>

29
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:09.430
<v Speaker 2>encounter something that's really not </v>
<v Speaker 2>within their framework of thinking.</v>

30
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 2>And it's usually something bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because there,</v>

31
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 2>there isn't anything in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>

32
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.110
<v Speaker 2>their way of looking at the world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has prepared them for that,</v>

33
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 2>they ended up fragmented and devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's actually protective to you.</v>

34
00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:28.411
<v Speaker 2>If you can figure out what your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your full range of capabilities is,</v>

35
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 2>because that can help you understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people a lot better.</v>

36
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

37
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:38.821
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be wiser and more careful in your </v>

38
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:38.821
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also useful,</v>

39
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:43.381
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to convince yourself to act </v>

40
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 2>properly because if you regard yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>as harmless,</v>

41
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 2>which is a big mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then nothing you can do is really that </v>

42
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.640
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

43
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Because you're harmless after all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you understand that you're </v>

44
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.641
<v Speaker 2>seriously not harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that can make you a lot more </v>

45
00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:00.870
<v Speaker 2>careful with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that,</v>

46
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 2>that that's especially true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe when you're dealing,</v>

47
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>when you have kids and you start dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your kids.</v>

48
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 2>If you know that what you're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're human,</v>

49
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.390
<v Speaker 2>then that can motivate you to be much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more careful with what you say and do.</v>

50
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean timid.</v>

51
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean any of that.</v>

52
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I just mean that you want to keep things</v>
<v Speaker 2>pristine between you and your children,</v>

53
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:28.921
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that way they're on your good </v>

54
00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:31.561
<v Speaker 2>side and you want them on your good side</v>
<v Speaker 2>because children who get on their </v>

55
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 2>parents bad side suffer very badly for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

56
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it's because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally abused,</v>

57
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 2>but more often it's because they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while they get abused,</v>

58
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or neglected in much more subtle ways.</v>

59
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 2>And you're definitely capable of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all you have to do is think about</v>

60
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.060
<v Speaker 2>the way that you've interacted with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that you've decided to not like </v>

61
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 2>or maybe someone you genuinely don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

62
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:59.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that can range from just not paying </v>

63
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:02.131
<v Speaker 2>any attention to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're doing something </v>

64
00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 2>good to really pursuing them and making </v>
<v Speaker 2>their life miserable.</v>

65
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:07.741
<v Speaker 2>And you can certainly do that with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>family members and you can do that with </v>

66
00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 2>your intimate partners and you can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with your friends and you can do it</v>

67
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 2>with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's really worth knowing that.</v>

68
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the Fox thinks he's a royal rule </v>

69
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.641
<v Speaker 2>breaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's really just a two bit thug and </v>

70
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:23.641
<v Speaker 2>this is where he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he learns that.</v>

71
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:28.500
<v Speaker 2>So sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a new phone and I'm kind of </v>

72
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 2>stupid with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still so.</v>

73
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically,</v>

74
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>that'll work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it probably won't.</v>

75
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coach ones got these guys in his </v>

76
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.140
<v Speaker 2>grasp now regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And partly because they're already down </v>

77
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.801
<v Speaker 2>this road and they can't back off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because he also offers them more </v>

78
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 2>money than they've seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as bad as they are,</v>

79
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of you,</v>

80
00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:02.101
<v Speaker 2>I presume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have seen breaking bad and that's a </v>

81
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:05.131
<v Speaker 2>really good example of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the incorporation at least in part or</v>

82
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe the possession by the shadow from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Union perspective,</v>

83
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:13.201
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you have this ordinary high </v>

84
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>school teacher who really thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an ax and his family as well.</v>

85
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your typical persona,</v>

86
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a normal guy.</v>

87
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 2>But part of the reason that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal guy is because he actually hasn't</v>

88
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 2>been put in abnormal circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden he is.</v>

89
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 2>And he has a genuine moral conundrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

90
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 2>He's going to die of lung cancer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>

91
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.790
<v Speaker 2>He has a son who's got a lot of health </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and he's terrified that he's </v>

92
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 2>going to leave his wife and his child </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind with nothing.</v>

93
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.910
<v Speaker 2>And then of course as the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he decides to do something that </v>

94
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.630
<v Speaker 2>temporarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he regards as what they would </v>

95
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 2>normally regard as reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course he just gets tangled up in</v>

96
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then as the story unfolds,</v>

97
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:57.331
<v Speaker 2>you see that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more complicated because it's not </v>

98
00:05:57.331 --> 00:05:57.331
<v Speaker 2>that he was just innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

99
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.350
<v Speaker 2>and he decided to turn bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also very resentful and angry and </v>

100
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.401
<v Speaker 2>it's partly because he's a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushover at the beginning or maybe more </v>

101
00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:09.790
<v Speaker 2>than a bit of a pushover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also that he didn't really fulfill </v>

102
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.810
<v Speaker 2>his own potential and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.860
<v Speaker 2>he had friends who walk down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial path and maybe they </v>

104
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>weren't quite fair to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

105
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 2>He ends up not very successful as a high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school teacher.</v>

106
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:26.531
<v Speaker 2>So he's really angry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's more motivation for him </v>

107
00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:30.790
<v Speaker 2>opening up the door to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the terrible elements of his </v>

108
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 2>personality than just the fact that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>got good motivations to do so.</v>

109
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that unfolds,</v>

110
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you see that warps and twists and</v>

111
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:43.271
<v Speaker 2>is resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Character increasingly manifest </v>

112
00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 2>themselves as he walks down this road to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really total brutality.</v>

113
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

114
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite good.</v>

115
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a book called ordinary men </v>

116
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've mentioned that to you</v>

117
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ordinary men is a book about,</v>

118
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 2>it's the best book of it's type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's the only book of its type.</v>

119
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 2>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's plotted much like breaking bad </v>

120
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.601
<v Speaker 2>in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a story about these German </v>

121
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:10.841
<v Speaker 2>policemen in early stages of World War </v>
<v Speaker 2>II and they were guys who were old </v>

122
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:16.841
<v Speaker 2>enough to be raised in Germany really </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the hitlarian propaganda came out</v>

123
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 2>in full force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:23.021
<v Speaker 2>if you were a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in the 19 thirties you are going to </v>

125
00:07:23.021 --> 00:07:25.541
<v Speaker 2>be pulled right into the propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine and maybe you were part of the </v>

126
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:25.541
<v Speaker 2>Hitler youth and like you were raised in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

127
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:30.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you were older than you were </v>

128
00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 2>raised before that and you're not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>amenable to propaganda once you're older</v>

129
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:32.470
<v Speaker 2>than about.</v>

130
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 2>While I would say about 22 or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

131
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty young actually.</v>

132
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.910
<v Speaker 2>If you're gonna make a soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get a soldier young because </v>

133
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.160
<v Speaker 2>once people are in their early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say they're kind of,</v>

134
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 2>they already have their personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed.</v>

135
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these policemen were sent into Poland </v>

136
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 2>after the Germans marched through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

137
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:59.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was wartime and there is this </v>

138
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis in Germany that the Jews in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

139
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:05.381
<v Speaker 2>we're operating as a fifth column and </v>
<v Speaker 2>undermining the German war effort </v>

140
00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:08.471
<v Speaker 2>because of course the Germans blamed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews and a variety of other people for </v>

141
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 2>actually setting up the conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>made the war necessary.</v>

142
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 2>And so when the police were sent into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Poland,</v>

143
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 2>they were also required to make peace </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

144
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:21.581
<v Speaker 2>And so they started up by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started out by rounding up all the </v>

145
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:26.140
<v Speaker 2>Jewish men between 18 and 65 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering them in in stadiums and then </v>

146
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 2>shipping them off on the trains.</v>

147
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't where they ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ended in,</v>

148
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 2>in very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dark place.</v>

149
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:36.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys were going out in the field </v>

150
00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:39.161
<v Speaker 2>with naked pregnant women and shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the back of the head by the end </v>

151
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 2>of their training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's really interesting about that</v>

152
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:45.191
<v Speaker 2>is that is that their commander told </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that they could go home at any </v>

153
00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

154
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.630
<v Speaker 2>this is not one of those examples of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people following orders and the reason </v>

155
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 2>they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

156
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:58.841
<v Speaker 2>there's many reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the reasons they didn't is </v>

157
00:08:58.841 --> 00:08:58.841
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't think it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>comradely,</v>

158
00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:03.550
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to leave their guys they were working </v>

159
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 2>with to do all the dirty work and run </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

160
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.420
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really,</v>

161
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 2>that's really an interesting fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 2>because you in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in different circumstances,</v>

163
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't think about that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible,</v>

164
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd think,</v>

165
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:18.081
<v Speaker 2>well that's part of teamwork and under </v>
<v Speaker 2>rough circumstances and that's at least </v>

166
00:09:18.081 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 2>in part how they viewed it.</v>

167
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.900
<v Speaker 2>And they were also made physically ill </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple times physically and </v>

168
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 2>psychologically ill by the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to do.</v>

169
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 2>But they kept doing them anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's one step at a time.</v>

170
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing is that you end up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in very bad places one step at a time.</v>

171
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 2>So you got to watch those steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

172
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio has now decided after his </v>
<v Speaker 2>latest misadventure to return to the </v>

173
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.190
<v Speaker 2>proper pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's off to school again and uh,</v>

174
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.630
<v Speaker 2>he's still pretty naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although perhaps not as much so as he </v>

175
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.181
<v Speaker 2>was before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he decides that he's going to do </v>

176
00:09:56.181 --> 00:09:56.181
<v Speaker 2>things right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to go get educated,</v>

177
00:09:56.181 --> 00:10:00.191
<v Speaker 2>he's going back to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to take the conventional </v>

178
00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 2>route to discipline and do and be a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy roughly speaking.</v>

179
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.820
<v Speaker 2>And so he's off to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Fox waylay them.</v>

180
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a really interesting scene.</v>

181
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Took me quite a long time to unpack this</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

182
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:17.241
<v Speaker 2>And so the Fox first of all starts out </v>
<v Speaker 2>by acting like he's sympathetic again,</v>

183
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic towards Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's empathetic,</v>

184
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:26.721
<v Speaker 2>you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is an interesting analysis </v>

185
00:10:26.721 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 2>of empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is,</v>

186
00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:33.591
<v Speaker 2>is the Fox Convinces Pinocchio through a</v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of maneuvers that he's actually </v>

187
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 2>not feeling very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's sick.</v>

188
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 2>He really convinces him that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>victim.</v>

189
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.820
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a graduate student named Maya </v>

190
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.450
<v Speaker 2>chicken who who had worked with the UN </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in Bosnia and she had toured some of</v>

191
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:53.991
<v Speaker 2>the mass grave sites there and we wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>a paper one time called you can either </v>

192
00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 2>remember nor forget what you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

193
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 2>and it was a paper about the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

194
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:05.361
<v Speaker 2>it was partly about the idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should never forget the Holocaust and </v>

195
00:11:05.361 --> 00:11:08.590
<v Speaker 2>that the idea there is that what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should never forget it and we shouldn't </v>

196
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.590
<v Speaker 2>repeat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>

197
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 2>if you don't understand how those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>come about,</v>

198
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 2>you can't really remember them.</v>

199
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about them as a set of </v>

200
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.741
<v Speaker 2>historical facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the kind of remembering </v>

201
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:22.611
<v Speaker 2>that actually makes any difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand the causal </v>

202
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:25.881
<v Speaker 2>pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand how a society </v>

203
00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:26.370
<v Speaker 2>would transform in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And more importantly,</v>

204
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:30.150
<v Speaker 2>you have to understand the role of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals within that society.</v>

205
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're going to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so completely unlike you,</v>

206
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:38.541
<v Speaker 2>that there's no connection whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In which case you haven't remembered it </v>

207
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:42.201
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't learned anything at all </v>

208
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:44.361
<v Speaker 2>because the right lesson from what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in the 20th century is this is </v>

209
00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:48.321
<v Speaker 2>what human beings are like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the correct blessing and you can </v>

210
00:11:48.321 --> 00:11:48.690
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

211
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 2>not me,</v>

212
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 2>but you should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but probably you too.</v>

213
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing probably and probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to at least under normal </v>

214
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

215
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 2>the Fox Convinces Pinocchio that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick.</v>

216
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.920
<v Speaker 2>He performs a lot of tricks to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say that Pinocchio is </v>

217
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to this because maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still part of him that's looking</v>

218
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 2>for the easy way out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so one of the things that Maya and I</v>

219
00:12:22.181 --> 00:12:27.181
<v Speaker 2>found when we were writing this paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were looking at the discourse that </v>

220
00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:30.241
<v Speaker 2>precedes genocide in genocidal states </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the enhancement of a sense of </v>

221
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 2>victimization on the part of one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>

222
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Usually the group that's going to commit</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genocide.</v>

223
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:36.810
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their senses,</v>

224
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.120
<v Speaker 2>their sense of being victims is much </v>
<v Speaker 2>heightened by the demagogues who are </v>

225
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 2>trying to stir up this sort of hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they basically say,</v>

226
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:48.751
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been oppressed in a variety of </v>

227
00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:51.001
<v Speaker 2>ways and these are the people who did it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not going to stop doing it </v>

228
00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:51.580
<v Speaker 2>and this time we're going to get them </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they get us.</v>

229
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.300
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's something very </v>

230
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 2>pathological about the enhancement of </v>
<v Speaker 2>victimization,</v>

231
00:12:57.731 --> 00:12:58.980
<v Speaker 2>which is well,</v>

232
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:10.170
<v Speaker 2>see that the problem as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned with it is it's not.</v>

233
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not thought through very well </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's.</v>

234
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 2>There's a point that's being made and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point is that people have been </v>

235
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.840
<v Speaker 2>oppressed and they suffer and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true that point,</v>

236
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.950
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then the proper framework from </v>

237
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:34.561
<v Speaker 2>within which to interpret that I believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that that's characteristic of life.</v>

238
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.950
<v Speaker 2>You can't take it personally in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense and you can divide the world </v>

239
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.541
<v Speaker 2>neatly into perpetrators and victims and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you certainly can't divide the world </v>

240
00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:48.810
<v Speaker 2>neatly into perpetrators and victims and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then assume that you're only in the </v>

241
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.411
<v Speaker 2>victim class and then assume that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you certain access to certain </v>

242
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 2>forms of redress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it gets dangerous very rapidly</v>

243
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:59.530
<v Speaker 2>if you do that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

244
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.380
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that characterized the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union,</v>

245
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.110
<v Speaker 2>and this was particularly true in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>

246
00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:10.111
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but afterwards is so the Soviets were </v>

247
00:14:10.111 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>very much enamored of the idea of class </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilt.</v>

248
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.970
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it wasn't only about 40 years </v>

249
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 2>previously that the serfs had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>emancipated,</v>

250
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 2>they weren't much more than slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

251
00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 2>And so that was the bulk of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

252
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.700
<v Speaker 2>They were bought and sold along with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

253
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.200
<v Speaker 2>So they had been emancipated and some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

254
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:37.410
<v Speaker 2>many of them had turned into independent</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers and some of them had become </v>

255
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.210
<v Speaker 2>reasonably prosperous because at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>in principle I presumed a certain </v>

256
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.651
<v Speaker 2>proportion of them from being crooked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I presume a larger proportion from </v>

257
00:14:46.651 --> 00:14:50.281
<v Speaker 2>actually being able to raise food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course at that time the bulk of </v>

258
00:14:50.281 --> 00:14:55.140
<v Speaker 2>the Russian food was produced by these </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively successful peasant farmers </v>

259
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.870
<v Speaker 2>and relatively successful would mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they had a brick house or </v>

260
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.111
<v Speaker 2>something and maybe they had a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cows and maybe they were able to hire a </v>

261
00:15:05.111 --> 00:15:05.111
<v Speaker 2>few people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

262
00:15:05.111 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like they were massive land </v>

263
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 2>owners or anything.</v>

264
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 2>But I've talked to you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the preto principle and the notion</v>

265
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:18.191
<v Speaker 2>that in any domain of activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small proportion of people ended up </v>

266
00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 2>producing most of what's in that domain </v>
<v Speaker 2>of activity.</v>

267
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:23.510
<v Speaker 2>The same was true in Russia with regards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these peasant farmers.</v>

268
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient and they produced most of </v>

269
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Russia's food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the communists came in,</v>

270
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.740
<v Speaker 2>they described those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those land holders as parasites </v>

271
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.241
<v Speaker 2>essentially predicated on the Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that if someone had extracted </v>

272
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:45.641
<v Speaker 2>profit from an enterprise that they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically stolen that profit from from,</v>

273
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.530
<v Speaker 2>from the people say that they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>employed or otherwise oppressed.</v>

274
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 2>And so you could be a member of the Ku </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack,</v>

275
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.610
<v Speaker 2>k u,</v>
<v Speaker 2>l a,</v>

276
00:15:52.611 --> 00:15:53.570
<v Speaker 2>c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a k,</v>

277
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 2>k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>u l a k.</v>

278
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:59.801
<v Speaker 2>You can be a member of the Kulak class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then because you were a member of </v>

279
00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:01.400
<v Speaker 2>that class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are automatically guilty.</v>

280
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:06.430
<v Speaker 2>And so what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you got to think this through to </v>

281
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.921
<v Speaker 2>really understand what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened was the intellectual </v>

282
00:16:08.921 --> 00:16:12.820
<v Speaker 2>communists were sent out in cadres out </v>
<v Speaker 2>into these little towns to find people </v>

283
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:18.371
<v Speaker 2>who would help them round up the Kulaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got to think about what a </v>

284
00:16:18.371 --> 00:16:22.241
<v Speaker 2>small town is like because so imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a town and there's three or </v>

285
00:16:22.241 --> 00:16:26.561
<v Speaker 2>four people or maybe 10 people or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that who are a little </v>

286
00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:28.480
<v Speaker 2>more successful than everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a certain number of people are going</v>

287
00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:31.370
<v Speaker 2>to be fine with that and maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy about it because they regard those</v>

288
00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:33.320
<v Speaker 2>people as particularly productive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:36.680
<v Speaker 2>as stalwart members of the community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of their flaws.</v>

290
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.690
<v Speaker 2>But there's gonna be some people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not happy about it at all that are going</v>

291
00:16:40.691 --> 00:16:42.860
<v Speaker 2>to be very resentful about that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>jealous.</v>

292
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:48.310
<v Speaker 2>And so those are going to be people </v>
<v Speaker 2>whose characters I would say are of the </v>

293
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.851
<v Speaker 2>less positive type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when the intellectuals came in </v>

294
00:16:51.851 --> 00:16:55.601
<v Speaker 2>and described the reason that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people should be treated as parasites </v>

295
00:16:55.601 --> 00:16:59.861
<v Speaker 2>and profiteers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it was the resentful minority in </v>

296
00:16:59.861 --> 00:17:02.891
<v Speaker 2>those towns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would be the kind of guy that </v>

297
00:17:02.891 --> 00:17:04.661
<v Speaker 2>hangs around in the bar all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>is completely unconscientious and fails </v>

298
00:17:04.661 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 2>at everything and then blames everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else for it.</v>

299
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:11.120
<v Speaker 2>The intellectuals came in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's this is unfair that this happened</v>

300
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:16.121
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've actually been victimized and now </v>

301
00:17:16.121 --> 00:17:16.121
<v Speaker 2>it's your opportunity to go have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>revenge.</v>

302
00:17:16.121 --> 00:17:19.280
<v Speaker 2>And so that's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in some of the villages,</v>

303
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.700
<v Speaker 2>some of sometimes the peasants would </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually surround the that the,</v>

304
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the farmsteads have these more </v>

305
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:28.760
<v Speaker 2>successful people and try to defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

306
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.810
<v Speaker 2>But that never worked out for very long.</v>

307
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:34.810
<v Speaker 2>And so then these mobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these angry mobs would go into the farm </v>

308
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.040
<v Speaker 2>houses and strip the place right down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

309
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.340
<v Speaker 2>And they pack these people up and sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>them on trains with no food at out to </v>

310
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Siberia where there was no place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

311
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.120
<v Speaker 2>And so that they were packed into </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses,</v>

312
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they had a square meter each to </v>

313
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.160
<v Speaker 2>live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all the children died of typhoid.</v>

314
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.280
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

315
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 2>and many of them froze to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>

316
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:55.740
<v Speaker 2>many people died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millions of people died.</v>

317
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.890
<v Speaker 2>As a consequence of the Deq lack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ization had least in,</v>

318
00:17:59.891 --> 00:18:04.580
<v Speaker 2>in as a consequence of its total effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened then was that a,</v>

319
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't any food produced and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>then 6 million Ukrainian starve to death</v>

320
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:15.300
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something you never hear about,</v>

321
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never hear about that.</v>

322
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Why do you never hear about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a question worth asking.</v>

323
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an absolute catastrophe.</v>

324
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 2>They used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these people were starving.</v>

325
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Break to the point of cannibalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

326
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:33.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was ugly as anything you could </v>

327
00:18:33.141 --> 00:18:33.250
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine if you were a mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

328
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.660
<v Speaker 2>And so you're supposed to handle your </v>
<v Speaker 2>grain into the central committee,</v>

329
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 2>mostly for distribution into the cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't get to keep any for yourself.</v>

330
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.450
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe then afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were a mother,</v>

331
00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:47.451
<v Speaker 2>you'd go out in the fields that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>already been harvested and you pick up </v>

332
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:51.030
<v Speaker 2>individual grains of wheat and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't turn those in nature,</v>

333
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 2>that was death for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's how far it was pushed so.</v>

334
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a little story about how </v>

335
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.261
<v Speaker 2>victimization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the idea of victimization and </v>

336
00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:06.960
<v Speaker 2>perpetration can get out of hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily rapidly.</v>

337
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>And so whenever people are beating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>victim drum,</v>

338
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll cover that up with,</v>

339
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.100
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

340
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 2>empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking,</v>

341
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.010
<v Speaker 2>we're speaking on behalf of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed.</v>

342
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:25.011
<v Speaker 2>It's like maybe you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you're no saint because you </v>

343
00:19:25.011 --> 00:19:29.031
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so sure that you're a saint and </v>

344
00:19:29.031 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 2>you're only speaking from the position </v>
<v Speaker 2>of good.</v>

345
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>It's highly unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

346
00:19:31.101 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Speaker 2>so Pinocchio is enticed into believing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's a victim.</v>

347
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:39.381
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the logical part of that is that it is </v>

348
00:19:39.381 --> 00:19:43.141
<v Speaker 2>the case that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make a very strong case that </v>

349
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.720
<v Speaker 2>every human being is in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in a tragic enterprise,</v>

350
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're biologically vulnerable.</v>

351
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.570
<v Speaker 2>You're not what you could be as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological specimen,</v>

352
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're full of imperfections and plus </v>

353
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.060
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be sick and those you </v>
<v Speaker 2>love are going to be sick and everything</v>

354
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:02.061
<v Speaker 2>ends up in death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that there's a very tragic </v>

355
00:20:02.061 --> 00:20:02.640
<v Speaker 2>element to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then by the same token,</v>

356
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you're also subject to the theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of your culture,</v>

357
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

358
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Because it's forcing you to be a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>way all the time,</v>

359
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.880
<v Speaker 2>it socialization does that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>required to modify your own intrinsic </v>

360
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.521
<v Speaker 2>nature in order to come into conformity </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the broader community and you can </v>

361
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:25.100
<v Speaker 2>think about that from the Piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

362
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:29.180
<v Speaker 2>which is the socialization makes you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more sophisticated person and,</v>

363
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 2>and there's some truth in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can also be subject just to </v>

364
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 2>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

365
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 2>and you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see people in my practice,</v>

366
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:41.601
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who've had very tyrannical fathers for </v>

367
00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:44.451
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they have to radical mothers </v>

368
00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:45.000
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not so much encouraged to,</v>

369
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:50.150
<v Speaker 2>to integrate properly into social </v>
<v Speaker 2>community as they are harassed and </v>

370
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.090
<v Speaker 2>abused and made to feel insufficient and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

371
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 2>basically subject to tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's quite an.</v>

372
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's true of everyone to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

373
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:59.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

374
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.010
<v Speaker 2>you come to university and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical aspect to it.</v>

375
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:08.070
<v Speaker 2>You're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially in a big institution like </v>

376
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.351
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really marked out as an </v>

377
00:21:10.351 --> 00:21:10.351
<v Speaker 2>individual in any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

378
00:21:10.351 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a number along with 60,000</v>

379
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:17.791
<v Speaker 2>other people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there there's something cold and </v>

380
00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:21.091
<v Speaker 2>impersonal about that which is well </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented in the design of this </v>

381
00:21:21.091 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 2>classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say and,</v>

382
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:26.580
<v Speaker 2>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that the university provides </v>

383
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 2>you with an identity while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploring an intellectual landscape.</v>

384
00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:34.081
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of freedom compared to </v>

385
00:21:34.081 --> 00:21:37.741
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps you don't have as much freedom </v>

386
00:21:37.741 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 2>as you might if you compared it to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>utopia notion of freedom,</v>

387
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:45.841
<v Speaker 2>but in any real world sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're unbelievably well protected by </v>

388
00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:49.621
<v Speaker 2>the university partly because it stamps </v>
<v Speaker 2>you with the identity student,</v>

389
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.200
<v Speaker 2>which is a respectable identity and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go off and educate yourself as </v>

390
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.200
<v Speaker 2>much as you can.</v>

391
00:21:55.570 --> 00:22:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone in society says that's </v>

392
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.731
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They carve out a protected space for </v>

393
00:22:02.731 --> 00:22:04.711
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the same time as you're being </v>

394
00:22:04.711 --> 00:22:04.711
<v Speaker 2>tyrannized by the institution and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

395
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.890
<v Speaker 2>and forced in some ways also to adopt </v>
<v Speaker 2>the viewpoints,</v>

396
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 2>say of the professors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on the professor,</v>

397
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 2>you're also the beneficiary of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like you're the beneficiary of this</v>

398
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:17.530
<v Speaker 2>huge industrial infrastructure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlies everything.</v>

399
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 2>We do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

400
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.870
<v Speaker 2>the fact that your life is tragic </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily and that you are subject to </v>

401
00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:29.110
<v Speaker 2>oppression makes the victimization story</v>
<v Speaker 2>really easy to swallow,</v>

402
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:34.950
<v Speaker 2>but then there's dark side of that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is actually what happens with </v>

403
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.851
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens here is that he's told </v>

404
00:22:38.851 --> 00:22:43.670
<v Speaker 2>that he's ill and convinced that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ill and they do use trickery and and and</v>

405
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:48.810
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could look at him in some sense as </v>

406
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 2>an innocent victim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the innocence,</v>

407
00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.820
<v Speaker 2>the filmmakers do a good job of hedging </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the innocent interpretation </v>

408
00:22:55.871 --> 00:23:00.871
<v Speaker 2>because what he's offered and accepts </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these ale is an easy way out and</v>

409
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 2>so what the Fox basically tells him is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he needs to have a vacation because</v>

410
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:08.920
<v Speaker 2>he's sick and he can go off to pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 2>island,</v>

411
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.840
<v Speaker 2>which is this place of impulsivity.</v>

412
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking in and whim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like reversion to being two years </v>

413
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.501
<v Speaker 2>old in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that he really needs that because </v>

414
00:23:19.501 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 2>otherwise he's not going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live property.</v>

415
00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:22.540
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to be able to recover his</v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

416
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:27.541
<v Speaker 2>And so what Pinocchio is offered is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to abandoned responsibility.</v>

417
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.420
<v Speaker 2>As a reward for adopting the guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>victim and that's really worth thinking </v>

418
00:23:36.671 --> 00:23:41.671
<v Speaker 2>about because one of the things I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about for a long time is that </v>

419
00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives people's lives meaning and tragedy</v>

420
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:48.950
<v Speaker 2>gives life its negative meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody disputes that.</v>

421
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:53.951
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to dispute the fact </v>

422
00:23:53.951 --> 00:23:53.951
<v Speaker 2>that tragedy gives life negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

423
00:23:53.951 --> 00:23:55.850
<v Speaker 2>So when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's say that life is meaningless.</v>

424
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 2>That isn't exactly what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mean that life is suffering,</v>

425
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:02.690
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't anything transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it that you could set against that</v>

426
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 2>suffering that's nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that life is meaningless,</v>

427
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:11.410
<v Speaker 2>that would just be neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like no one believes that and they </v>

428
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:11.930
<v Speaker 2>certainly don't act like they believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

429
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.330
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it technically and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>will as we progress through this class,</v>

430
00:24:20.331 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 2>that in order to have any positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning in your life,</v>

431
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:28.300
<v Speaker 2>you have to identify the goal and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be working towards it and there </v>

432
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.600
<v Speaker 2>is a technical reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the technical reason,</v>

433
00:24:30.601 --> 00:24:35.601
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuitry that produces the kind of </v>

434
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:38.921
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion that people really like</v>
<v Speaker 2>is only activated when you noticed that </v>

435
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:44.051
<v Speaker 2>your peers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're proceeding towards a goal </v>

436
00:24:44.051 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 2>that you value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that means that if you don't have</v>

437
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:48.600
<v Speaker 2>a goal that you value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have any positive emotion.</v>

438
00:24:48.601 --> 00:24:53.601
<v Speaker 2>So technically that's the incentive </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward system and it's the underlying </v>

439
00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 2>circuitry is dopaminergic and would not </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuitry is activated.</v>

440
00:24:56.331 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Then it's part of the exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuit.</v>

441
00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 2>It makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives you the sense of being actively</v>

442
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:04.830
<v Speaker 2>engaged in something worthwhile and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's you know,</v>

443
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.800
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tend to think of positive emotion is</v>

444
00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:11.801
<v Speaker 2>something produced by reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's two kinds of positive </v>

445
00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:11.801
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>

446
00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:15.790
<v Speaker 2>One is the reward that's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>satiation and that's conservatory </v>

447
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.020
<v Speaker 2>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the reward you get when </v>

448
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.671
<v Speaker 2>you're hungry and you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about eating when you're </v>

449
00:25:21.671 --> 00:25:24.140
<v Speaker 2>hungry is that it destroys the framework</v>
<v Speaker 2>within which you are operating,</v>

450
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:29.141
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's time to eat what you eat and then </v>

451
00:25:29.141 --> 00:25:31.751
<v Speaker 2>that frameworks no longer relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the consumer story reward eliminates </v>

452
00:25:31.751 --> 00:25:32.780
<v Speaker 2>the value of framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're stuck with what,</v>

453
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:37.781
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the conservatory reward has with </v>

454
00:25:37.781 --> 00:25:41.600
<v Speaker 2>its own problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the incentive reward is constantly </v>

455
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.861
<v Speaker 2>what keeps you moving forward and </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentive reward because it's still </v>

456
00:25:44.861 --> 00:25:45.860
<v Speaker 2>open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack also is analgesic,</v>

457
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.890
<v Speaker 2>literally analgesics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in pain,</v>

458
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.530
<v Speaker 2>you take opiates and that will cut the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>

459
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:56.531
<v Speaker 2>but so well psychomotor stimulants like </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine or amphetamines and so it's </v>

460
00:25:56.781 --> 00:26:00.410
<v Speaker 2>literally the case that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in something that's engaging and</v>

461
00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:03.200
<v Speaker 2>you're working towards a goal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel less pain.</v>

462
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.660
<v Speaker 2>And you can see this happening with </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes who you know,</v>

463
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:10.690
<v Speaker 2>they'll break their thumb or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe sometimes even the rankl and </v>

464
00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.691
<v Speaker 2>they'll keep playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course afterwards they're suffering </v>

465
00:26:13.691 --> 00:26:14.210
<v Speaker 2>like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they're so filled with</v>

466
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.240
<v Speaker 2>goal directed enthusiasm means that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether pain systems are in some sense </v>

467
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:24.431
<v Speaker 2>shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an interesting thing because </v>

468
00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:26.210
<v Speaker 2>what it suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean then you could imagine,</v>

469
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how happy you are you that you've </v>

470
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 2>made a certain amount of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you think about it,</v>

471
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:33.500
<v Speaker 2>what you'd say is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

472
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:38.501
<v Speaker 2>it depends on how much progress and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to what so hypothetically </v>

473
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:43.931
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be happier if you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>made quite a bit of progress towards a </v>

474
00:26:43.931 --> 00:26:46.721
<v Speaker 2>really important goal and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to think through what it means for a </v>

475
00:26:46.721 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 2>goal to be really important because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not obvious.</v>

476
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say you're in this class </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're listening to some information</v>

477
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:59.210
<v Speaker 2>and maybe there's two reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might find the information </v>

478
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:03.081
<v Speaker 2>interesting per se,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's forget about that for a </v>

479
00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:03.690
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to listen to the information so</v>

480
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 2>that you can do well on the assignment </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you can do well in the class.</v>

481
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 2>You need to do well in your classes so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can finish up your degree.</v>

482
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:16.070
<v Speaker 2>You need to finish up your degree so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can find your place in the </v>

483
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.651
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to do that so that you're </v>

484
00:27:18.651 --> 00:27:20.601
<v Speaker 2>financially stable and maybe you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>start a family and have a life and </v>

485
00:27:20.601 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 2>that's all part of being a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

486
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.320
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a hierarchy of goals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say that being a good person </v>

487
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 2>would be the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however vaguely thought through.</v>

488
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:36.230
<v Speaker 2>That's at the top of that hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're doing things that </v>

489
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.100
<v Speaker 2>serve that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ultimate purpose,</v>

490
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.280
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to find those more </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and that meaning is actually </v>

491
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.131
<v Speaker 2>produced as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>engagement of this exploratory circuit </v>

492
00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 2>that's nested write down in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus.</v>

493
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:49.230
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really old.</v>

494
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.720
<v Speaker 2>It's as old as thirst and it's as old as</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunger.</v>

495
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:56.750
<v Speaker 2>It's really an old system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you want to have that thing </v>

496
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.840
<v Speaker 2>activated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at least from a,</v>

497
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.590
<v Speaker 2>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a a while.</v>

498
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:03.480
<v Speaker 2>It isn't only from it he dominic point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of view,</v>

499
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:05.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't a matter of being happy.</v>

500
00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:07.980
<v Speaker 2>It's the wrong way of thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more complicated than that.</v>

501
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

502
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.840
<v Speaker 3>that was actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just about to ask that.</v>

503
00:28:11.841 --> 00:28:14.060
<v Speaker 3>Let's bring up like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

504
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.890
<v Speaker 3>because I'm just trying to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

505
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I guess not relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the differentiation between hedonism</v>

506
00:28:23.921 --> 00:28:28.921
<v Speaker 3>and satiation and you like going back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you mentioned that it's not that </v>

507
00:28:29.721 --> 00:28:32.240
<v Speaker 3>life is meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't.</v>

508
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:37.310
<v Speaker 3>Them isn't exactly like it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>satiation because at that point people </v>

509
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.080
<v Speaker 3>are just doing what they're doing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sake of doing.</v>

510
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not just for activation of the dove</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the dove into men are just started </v>

511
00:28:45.351 --> 00:28:46.220
<v Speaker 3>dumping them in their job</v>

512
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

513
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.790
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just trying to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

514
00:28:51.791 --> 00:28:56.791
<v Speaker 2>what I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go into that a lot once </v>

515
00:28:56.791 --> 00:28:58.130
<v Speaker 2>we're done this like a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll,</v>

516
00:28:58.131 --> 00:28:59.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go over it briefly.</v>

517
00:28:59.561 --> 00:29:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not merely hedonism because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an analgesic and,</v>

518
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.960
<v Speaker 2>and also a fear reducing element to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuing the proper path.</v>

519
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's control of negative emotion,</v>

520
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 2>but there's not just control of negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion and generation of positive </v>

521
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.571
<v Speaker 2>emotion in the immediate future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of what you'd think about </v>

522
00:29:18.571 --> 00:29:18.571
<v Speaker 2>with regards to hedonism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

523
00:29:18.571 --> 00:29:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio takes a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he dawning route next.</v>

524
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.870
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the he dornoch route is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

525
00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.720
<v Speaker 2>So the pursuit of pure happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

526
00:29:25.721 --> 00:29:30.721
<v Speaker 2>is that what makes you happy in the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute might not be something that will </v>

527
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:32.050
<v Speaker 2>make you happy in the next hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

528
00:29:32.051 --> 00:29:35.170
<v Speaker 2>you know that there's this car comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>

529
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.470
<v Speaker 2>They called them Katie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one liners you talked about drinking</v>

530
00:29:38.471 --> 00:29:39.310
<v Speaker 2>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

531
00:29:39.311 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 2>don't you know that's going to cause a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hangover?</v>

532
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:41.650
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

533
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:46.710
<v Speaker 2>at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the beginning of middle are </v>

534
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Speaker 2>excellent and so that's really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with hedonism,</v>

535
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:52.441
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that to pursue something that makes </v>

536
00:29:52.441 --> 00:29:56.491
<v Speaker 2>you happy in the immediate present risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificing your well many things,</v>

537
00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:00.870
<v Speaker 2>but at least let's say your hedonism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the medium to longterm.</v>

538
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 2>And of course that is one of the major </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with drug use.</v>

539
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.730
<v Speaker 2>And alcohol is a really good example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because whatever he don't it kick </v>

540
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.481
<v Speaker 2>you might get from it that moment at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night you're going to pay for almost </v>

541
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.880
<v Speaker 2>completely or maybe even more so because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day you're much more jittery </v>

542
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:23.341
<v Speaker 2>and anxious and that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a direct consequence of </v>

543
00:30:23.341 --> 00:30:23.341
<v Speaker 2>withdrawing from the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're in,</v>

544
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.870
<v Speaker 2>when you have a hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in alcohol withdrawal,</v>

545
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 2>so that's how fast you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get roughly speaking,</v>

546
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:35.730
<v Speaker 2>addicted to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you take another drink when </v>

547
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:35.730
<v Speaker 2>you're hung over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll cure it,</v>

548
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:39.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a very useful care because </v>
<v Speaker 2>all you do is push the inevitable </v>

549
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 2>hangover one more step into the future.</v>

550
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.720
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hedonic answer is happy when exactly and</v>

551
00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:51.811
<v Speaker 2>over what period of time and also who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy because maybe something makes you </v>

552
00:30:51.811 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but makes your family miserable.</v>

553
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

554
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:56.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do care if you have to live with</v>

555
00:30:56.231 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 2>your family because they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it out on you.</v>

556
00:30:58.271 --> 00:30:59.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

557
00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 2>the impulsive hedonism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also fostered,</v>

558
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:08.671
<v Speaker 2>say by a positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tends to put people into a state of </v>

559
00:31:08.671 --> 00:31:12.300
<v Speaker 2>the pursuit of short term hedonism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good longterm or medium to </v>

560
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:17.371
<v Speaker 2>longterm solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that's why people </v>

561
00:31:17.371 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 2>evolved conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

562
00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:23.341
<v Speaker 2>Because conscientiousness is not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conscientious people aren't </v>

563
00:31:23.341 --> 00:31:24.940
<v Speaker 2>conscientious because it makes them </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

564
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.050
<v Speaker 2>We're starting to think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious because they actually feel</v>

565
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:31.030
<v Speaker 2>terrible if they're just sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing nothing,</v>

566
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:35.320
<v Speaker 2>and so it's a way of staving off stress.</v>

567
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.810
<v Speaker 2>The stress that's related to enforce </v>
<v Speaker 2>leisure,</v>

568
00:31:37.811 --> 00:31:38.920
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

569
00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:42.100
<v Speaker 2>you if you know industrious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of you will have,</v>

570
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:47.220
<v Speaker 2>some of you are industrious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of you will have industrious </v>

571
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.740
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just can't sit around and do </v>

572
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:49.740
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be working.</v>

573
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:49.740
<v Speaker 2>They don't feel good unless they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

574
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:55.170
<v Speaker 2>So what thing about conscientiousness is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it involves continual sacrifice,</v>

575
00:31:55.481 --> 00:32:00.481
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing difficult things in the </v>

576
00:32:00.481 --> 00:32:01.921
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically to make the future </v>

577
00:32:01.921 --> 00:32:01.921
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not driven by hedonism,</v>

578
00:32:01.921 --> 00:32:06.511
<v Speaker 2>by any stretch of the imagination and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is actually a pretty </v>

579
00:32:06.511 --> 00:32:09.661
<v Speaker 2>good predictor of longterm life success </v>
<v Speaker 2>in stable societies because there's also</v>

580
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:13.720
<v Speaker 2>no point in being conscientious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>saving things up and storing things.</v>

581
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.750
<v Speaker 2>If a bunch of thugs are going to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in randomly and and take it all </v>

582
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.380
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So conscientiousness actually only works</v>

583
00:32:20.381 --> 00:32:23.920
<v Speaker 2>intelligently and societies that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some medium to longterm stability,</v>

584
00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can get wiped out by </v>

585
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.751
<v Speaker 2>hyperinflation too because </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperinflation kills off the </v>

586
00:32:30.751 --> 00:32:30.751
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people.</v>

587
00:32:30.751 --> 00:32:32.680
<v Speaker 2>The people who accrue debts are thrilled</v>
<v Speaker 2>with hyperinflation,</v>

588
00:32:32.681 --> 00:32:34.300
<v Speaker 2>kicks in because it wipes out their </v>
<v Speaker 2>debts.</v>

589
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:39.301
<v Speaker 2>But of course those debts are the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>they owed to people who were </v>

590
00:32:39.301 --> 00:32:40.310
<v Speaker 2>conscientious enough to save.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

591
00:32:40.311 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio was transformed into a victim </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's offered this,</v>

592
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:47.540
<v Speaker 2>he's offered this identity and he takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

593
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly because he's deceived and </v>

594
00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.910
<v Speaker 2>manipulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also partly because the fox </v>

595
00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.761
<v Speaker 2>offers him the abandonment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility as payment for as payment</v>

596
00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:04.661
<v Speaker 2>for adopting the victim identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is where his own lack of </v>

597
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:05.840
<v Speaker 2>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

598
00:33:05.841 --> 00:33:10.841
<v Speaker 2>because this is all about Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Development as a character plays a role </v>

599
00:33:10.841 --> 00:33:15.041
<v Speaker 2>in his demise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm a victim than everyone else </v>

600
00:33:15.261 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 2>owes me something and I don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take any responsibility.</v>

601
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:22.250
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things I've wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's something to think about.</v>

602
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.480
<v Speaker 2>It might be that the sense of meaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>that life can provide to you is </v>

603
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 2>proportionate to the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility you decide to take on.</v>

604
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Not that'd be very strange if it was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

605
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:38.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because responsibility of course is a </v>

606
00:33:38.831 --> 00:33:40.541
<v Speaker 2>kind of weight obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's difficult to take on </v>

607
00:33:40.541 --> 00:33:43.571
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if any positive emotion that you </v>

608
00:33:43.571 --> 00:33:48.071
<v Speaker 2>feel and your control of anxiety and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>control over pain is dependent on the </v>

609
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:53.240
<v Speaker 2>activation of these systems that watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>you move towards a desired goal,</v>

610
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:57.950
<v Speaker 2>then the more complete and weighty the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal is,</v>

611
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:03.250
<v Speaker 2>the more kicked there's going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the observation that you're moving </v>

612
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:03.250
<v Speaker 2>towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

613
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:07.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of already know this because </v>

614
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:10.290
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have observed in your own life </v>

615
00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:10.290
<v Speaker 2>that when you're engaged in something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you believe in,</v>

616
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.900
<v Speaker 2>that the time passes properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

617
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:19.990
<v Speaker 2>you can see this even if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're reading a paper and it's </v>

618
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:23.531
<v Speaker 2>actually related in some intelligible </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner to something that you want to </v>

619
00:34:23.531 --> 00:34:23.531
<v Speaker 2>learn.</v>

620
00:34:23.531 --> 00:34:26.150
<v Speaker 2>So even though it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get engaged in it,</v>

621
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:29.720
<v Speaker 2>you can remember it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can process it better and you don't.</v>

622
00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:34.900
<v Speaker 2>You're not so likely to fall asleep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not so likely to want to find </v>

623
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.081
<v Speaker 2>distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that you can get into it and it </v>

624
00:34:38.081 --> 00:34:41.891
<v Speaker 2>would be very interesting if that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportionate to the degree of </v>

625
00:34:41.891 --> 00:34:44.891
<v Speaker 2>responsibility that you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder and I think you can make a </v>

626
00:34:44.891 --> 00:34:45.770
<v Speaker 2>strong case for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've also often wondered,</v>

627
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:50.090
<v Speaker 2>imagine you could offer people a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the choice.</v>

628
00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:50.900
<v Speaker 2>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

629
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.920
<v Speaker 2>your life isn't meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denialists have got it right.</v>

630
00:34:54.921 --> 00:34:57.860
<v Speaker 2>There's no meaning in your life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>

631
00:34:57.861 --> 00:35:02.861
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason for you to accept any </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility so you can live a </v>

632
00:35:02.861 --> 00:35:06.650
<v Speaker 2>responsibility free life and maybe one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the impulsive pleasure seeking better</v>

633
00:35:06.651 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for free life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the price you pay is that it doesn't</v>

634
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:10.790
<v Speaker 2>get to be meaningful.</v>

635
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Or you could say to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

636
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:18.220
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to say you can live a </v>

637
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:18.220
<v Speaker 2>meaningful life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's only gonna.</v>

638
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Be as meaningful as the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility that you're willing to </v>

639
00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:23.270
<v Speaker 2>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>

640
00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:24.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would people choose?</v>

641
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Because everybody also always makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>noises about wanting to have a </v>

642
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 2>meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if the price you pay for that is the</v>

643
00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:36.911
<v Speaker 2>adoption of responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not so obvious that people </v>

644
00:35:36.911 --> 00:35:39.911
<v Speaker 2>would choose meaning over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no over pointless pursuits if they had </v>

645
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:44.340
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the benefit they got for choosing the</v>

646
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:49.341
<v Speaker 2>pointless pursuits was that they really </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to care about anything they </v>

647
00:35:49.341 --> 00:35:49.341
<v Speaker 2>ever did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

648
00:35:49.341 --> 00:35:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Snow responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's really what Pinocchio is </v>

649
00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:54.140
<v Speaker 2>offered and that's what the coachman </v>
<v Speaker 2>offers them.</v>

650
00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's interesting because know so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far it's been the Fox and the and the </v>

651
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.800
<v Speaker 2>cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were kind of to bid hoods and </v>

652
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.531
<v Speaker 2>so the pathological pathway that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer Pinocchio is not the worst of the </v>

653
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:11.931
<v Speaker 2>pathological pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here at least as far as the </v>

654
00:36:11.931 --> 00:36:15.381
<v Speaker 2>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the collective imagination that created </v>

655
00:36:15.381 --> 00:36:17.811
<v Speaker 2>this movie is concerned is this is where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to the most pathological form </v>

656
00:36:17.811 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it temptation,</v>

657
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:24.410
<v Speaker 2>and that's the temptation to engage in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to abandoned responsibility and to </v>

658
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:29.931
<v Speaker 2>engage in impulsive pleasure seeking </v>
<v Speaker 2>short term pleasure seeking.</v>

659
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:35.690
<v Speaker 2>So here's the Fox pretending to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Doctor Investigating Pinocchio's illness</v>

660
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:42.591
<v Speaker 2>and he makes some notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is all just meaningless scribble,</v>

661
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:49.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like white noise and it doesn't </v>

662
00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.091
<v Speaker 2>matter that the arguments that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>making is are completely incoherent and </v>

663
00:36:53.091 --> 00:36:54.180
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter that he actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know anything.</v>

664
00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:59.181
<v Speaker 2>He what he's selling is easy to buy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so Pinocchio buys it and by the end of </v>

665
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.920
<v Speaker 2>the conversation with the Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty convinced that he's useless </v>

666
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.250
<v Speaker 2>and it needs a vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

667
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.540
<v Speaker 2>this is anita postage inedible situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

668
00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Charlie touched on the other lecture </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean</v>

669
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.960
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>

670
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.680
<v Speaker 2>that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's imagine that you have a child that</v>

671
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.860
<v Speaker 2>is a little on the neurotic side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so high negative emotion and maybe one </v>

672
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.410
<v Speaker 2>that's also a little bit on the east </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

673
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:32.520
<v Speaker 2>so has a variety of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say relatively minor ailments,</v>

674
00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:37.521
<v Speaker 2>but the ailments nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that means as a parent will say,</v>

675
00:37:38.371 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this example,</v>

676
00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 2>because I want to use the eatable </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

677
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:47.180
<v Speaker 2>you have to make a decision all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>about exactly how you're going to treat </v>

678
00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.330
<v Speaker 2>that child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One decision is,</v>

679
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna.</v>

680
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to go to school today </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not feeling well.</v>

681
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

682
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.840
<v Speaker 2>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you make the same decision the next </v>

683
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.890
<v Speaker 2>day and do you make the same decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day and let's imagine that you </v>

684
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:09.210
<v Speaker 2>enable the child to avoid responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of capitalizing on </v>

685
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:13.251
<v Speaker 2>their illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then that's not going to be very </v>

686
00:38:13.251 --> 00:38:14.490
<v Speaker 2>good for the child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rule within a sickly child has to be</v>

687
00:38:14.491 --> 00:38:19.491
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to push you right to your </v>

688
00:38:19.491 --> 00:38:21.741
<v Speaker 2>limit because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is the person going to figure out </v>

689
00:38:21.741 --> 00:38:26.271
<v Speaker 2>what they can do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they can't figure out what they </v>

690
00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:26.271
<v Speaker 2>can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're not going to be able to make</v>

691
00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:29.790
<v Speaker 2>their way in the world at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that gets muddied very badly.</v>

692
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:32.850
<v Speaker 2>If you're not exactly sure that you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to make their way in the world.</v>

693
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:35.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're just as happy because you'd</v>

694
00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:40.321
<v Speaker 2>be sitting at home alone if your child </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there with you and maybe you'd be </v>

695
00:38:40.321 --> 00:38:44.851
<v Speaker 2>just as happy at some level if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>never grew up at all because then they </v>

696
00:38:44.851 --> 00:38:45.880
<v Speaker 2>won't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

697
00:38:45.881 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 2>and maybe that's because you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible marriage and your lonesome.</v>

698
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:54.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's an abusive marriage and your </v>

699
00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.191
<v Speaker 2>husband has chased away all your friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't have anything at all and </v>

700
00:38:56.191 --> 00:38:59.851
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's because he didn't stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>for yourself very well apart from the </v>

701
00:38:59.851 --> 00:38:59.851
<v Speaker 2>fact that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

702
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.860
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical and is central nature and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>then all those little warps in bands in </v>

703
00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 2>your psyche are going to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

704
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

705
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 2>In the background of every single one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those decisions.</v>

706
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:19.470
<v Speaker 2>My daughter had a lot of illnesses when </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was an adolescent and they were very</v>

707
00:39:19.471 --> 00:39:23.610
<v Speaker 2>serious and it was very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what to do about that because</v>

708
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.850
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't exactly applied normative </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

709
00:39:26.851 --> 00:39:31.851
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we always had to figure out if she </v>

710
00:39:31.851 --> 00:39:31.851
<v Speaker 2>was</v>

711
00:39:31.851 --> 00:39:35.150
<v Speaker 2>communicating her symptoms to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how seriously to take those.</v>

712
00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.990
<v Speaker 2>And the answer was the least amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious possible.</v>

713
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to do and she needed to know what</v>

714
00:39:44.871 --> 00:39:47.780
<v Speaker 2>she could do in spite of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she had problems.</v>

715
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.780
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I really tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>instill in her,</v>

716
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 2>and I think it worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you don't ever want to use it </v>

717
00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:57.290
<v Speaker 2>your illness as an excuse for not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

718
00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Not Consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

719
00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:01.100
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you might not know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not feeling well.</v>

720
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.900
<v Speaker 2>What can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you don't know,</v>

721
00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:07.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because sometimes when you're not </v>

722
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:07.901
<v Speaker 2>feeling well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do more than you think.</v>

723
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:08.510
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you can do less than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

724
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:11.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's obvious.</v>

725
00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.030
<v Speaker 2>You know this little temptation flits </v>
<v Speaker 2>through your mind and you think,</v>

726
00:40:14.031 --> 00:40:15.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really want to do what I'm doing</v>

727
00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:18.620
<v Speaker 2>today and I'm not feeling very well so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to do it.</v>

728
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 2>You do that 100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't know how sick you are </v>

729
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.561
<v Speaker 2>anymore and then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're in real trouble because not </v>

730
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:27.350
<v Speaker 2>only are you sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you actually have.</v>

731
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:32.410
<v Speaker 2>You've muddied the waters and so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have both problems then is you're </v>

732
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:36.971
<v Speaker 2>actually ill and you've betrayed </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself by using that as an excuse not </v>

733
00:40:38.511 --> 00:40:42.940
<v Speaker 2>to pursue your responsibilities and not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you do both of those,</v>

734
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.870
<v Speaker 2>both of those things happened to you at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

735
00:40:44.871 --> 00:40:49.871
<v Speaker 2>You're in real trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard not to have that </v>

736
00:40:49.871 --> 00:40:50.270
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

737
00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio gets enticed into believing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's the victim.</v>

738
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:59.170
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he's insufficient is used </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an excuse by the Fox and the and the </v>

739
00:40:59.601 --> 00:41:04.160
<v Speaker 2>cat to offer him a trip to pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 2>island,</v>

740
00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:09.220
<v Speaker 2>and this is I think where the movie gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly dark and so off they go </v>

741
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:09.220
<v Speaker 2>singing away.</v>

742
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:14.260
<v Speaker 2>They have to carry them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say in some sense he's </v>

743
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.030
<v Speaker 2>carried by societal pathology and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>own trouble.</v>

744
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.870
<v Speaker 2>He's carried like a puppet off to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure island.</v>

745
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:26.330
<v Speaker 2>And so the cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cricket is again left behind.</v>

746
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.880
<v Speaker 2>He's not the world's best conscience at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point,</v>

747
00:41:28.881 --> 00:41:33.881
<v Speaker 2>so we don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goes off to meet the coachman and the </v>

748
00:41:33.881 --> 00:41:37.211
<v Speaker 2>coachman has already said he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>collecting bad little boys and he's,</v>

749
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.040
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got them on the coach.</v>

750
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:45.041
<v Speaker 2>They're all delinquent types here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ticket on the coach was the ace of </v>

751
00:41:45.041 --> 00:41:49.181
<v Speaker 2>spades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what Pinocchio is holding and </v>

752
00:41:49.181 --> 00:41:50.570
<v Speaker 2>he's with this character here called </v>
<v Speaker 2>lamp wick.</v>

753
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's the,</v>

754
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.360
<v Speaker 2>he's the thing that Burns in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a light lamp wick and that's </v>

755
00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 2>interesting because it's a play on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lucifer.</v>

756
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Lucifer means bringer of light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so lamp wick is a play on that.</v>

757
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.910
<v Speaker 2>And lamb pork is really a nasty piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

758
00:42:07.911 --> 00:42:12.170
<v Speaker 2>He's got this false arrogance about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got this like cynical voice,</v>

759
00:42:12.171 --> 00:42:14.240
<v Speaker 2>really deeply cynical voice and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only,</v>

760
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how old he is supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in this,</v>

761
00:42:16.041 --> 00:42:20.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe 12 or something like that are 13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's one of those kids who's,</v>

762
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.670
<v Speaker 2>who's become prematurely cynical.</v>

763
00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a story about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I used to live in Montreal.</v>

764
00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in a poor neighborhood and uh,</v>

765
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:39.220
<v Speaker 2>one day I was out in the back alley </v>
<v Speaker 2>building a fence because I was putting </v>

766
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.771
<v Speaker 2>little fence around my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my little tiny backyard and there was a </v>

767
00:42:41.771 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 2>house across the alley down the street a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways where there is a lot of,</v>

768
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:48.890
<v Speaker 2>like not good partying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lot of bikers are hanging around there.</v>

769
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.860
<v Speaker 2>And I knew there was a little kid that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived there as well.</v>

770
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out there in the back alley,</v>

771
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:59.020
<v Speaker 2>pounding away on my fence and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>little kids came up and they were </v>

772
00:42:59.020 --> 00:42:59.020
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like three and four years old.</v>

773
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they spoke a Jew.</v>

774
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:06.161
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda a really heavily accented </v>

775
00:43:06.161 --> 00:43:09.911
<v Speaker 2>Quebecois French and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My French isn't good so I could hardly </v>

776
00:43:09.911 --> 00:43:11.390
<v Speaker 2>understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were what they were watching me</v>

777
00:43:11.391 --> 00:43:14.170
<v Speaker 2>hammer and they got a little closer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had one,</v>

778
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:17.360
<v Speaker 2>one kid who was clearly the leader had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real scowl on his face.</v>

779
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:22.990
<v Speaker 2>And so they were watching and I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>motioned to one of them that they could </v>

780
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:24.010
<v Speaker 2>use the hammer and that kid said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

781
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.400
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna mangle this,</v>

782
00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 2>but he says you have olay or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

783
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:31.580
<v Speaker 2>And what it meant is I'll steal that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought,</v>

784
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:36.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he came over and he tugged on </v>

785
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.201
<v Speaker 2>it and he wanted me to take it and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was quite angry and while I was wasn't </v>

786
00:43:38.201 --> 00:43:38.600
<v Speaker 2>gonna let them take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so,</v>

787
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.990
<v Speaker 2>so I couldn't engage them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get them to play,</v>

788
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:47.050
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his buddies were sort of hanging </v>

789
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 2>around behind him and they wouldn't come</v>
<v Speaker 2>and play because he wouldn't.</v>

790
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:52.480
<v Speaker 2>And so he was hostile right away to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so the finance piece was laying</v>

791
00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:58.010
<v Speaker 2>out in the La and these little monsters </v>
<v Speaker 2>started running across it,</v>

792
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.490
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was really remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

793
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:05.770
<v Speaker 2>But it was terrible at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were really little kids </v>

794
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.910
<v Speaker 2>that shouldn't be happening when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like three or four if that's happening </v>

795
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.910
<v Speaker 2>at that age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are not good.</v>

796
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.980
<v Speaker 2>And so that kid was already like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously not happy with the world and </v>

797
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:20.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been studying antisocial behavior </v>

798
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:23.530
<v Speaker 2>for a long time by that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I knew that the kids who are </v>

799
00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:26.591
<v Speaker 2>destined to jail later in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our kids who are rough and tough when </v>

800
00:44:26.591 --> 00:44:29.570
<v Speaker 2>they're two years old but then don't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialized or maybe worse,</v>

801
00:44:29.571 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 2>they get anti socialized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which exactly what happened to this kid.</v>

802
00:44:32.341 --> 00:44:37.341
<v Speaker 2>He'd obviously been ignored and abused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly no one had ever played with </v>

803
00:44:38.111 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 2>them in any real way because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't play.</v>

804
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:45.710
<v Speaker 2>And it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a kid is that little and you can't </v>

805
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:46.860
<v Speaker 2>get them to play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's gone seriously wrong because</v>

806
00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:49.290
<v Speaker 2>there are so playful at that age that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

807
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:51.310
<v Speaker 2>it's like 90 percent of them anyway.</v>

808
00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 2>So they were running back and forth on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fence.</v>

809
00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:54.950
<v Speaker 2>I thought stomping on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.790
<v Speaker 2>and I was right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

811
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

812
00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was remarkable,</v>

813
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 2>but I also thought it was absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrifying because,</v>

814
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense I could see where this kid</v>

815
00:45:05.131 --> 00:45:08.940
<v Speaker 2>was headed and why at that early stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his life it's really,</v>

816
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 2>it's not a pleasant thing to behold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

817
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:13.950
<v Speaker 2>like there was nothing that could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>done about it.</v>

818
00:45:13.951 --> 00:45:15.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's Kinda what this lamp wick is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

819
00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:20.991
<v Speaker 2>He's prematurely cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This kid was already cynical and he was </v>

820
00:45:20.991 --> 00:45:21.420
<v Speaker 2>like four years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

821
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.120
<v Speaker 2>most kids don't get cynical till they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>teenagers,</v>

822
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then often they don't get completely</v>

823
00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 2>cynical and usually they more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow out of it.</v>

824
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.070
<v Speaker 2>But he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened him much earlier.</v>

825
00:45:32.071 --> 00:45:33.660
<v Speaker 2>So this lamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what character he'd already,</v>

826
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 2>he's already decided that he knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that everyone else is.</v>

827
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:43.430
<v Speaker 2>His opinion is worth nothing and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing in culture society that </v>

828
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.770
<v Speaker 2>holds any use utility whatsoever for </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like him.</v>

829
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Now you can imagine developing that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were raised in a family where </v>

830
00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:56.810
<v Speaker 2>people were generally generally lying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and that they randomly treated you </v>

831
00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:01.041
<v Speaker 2>or neglected you and that you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>discern anything about them that was </v>

832
00:46:01.041 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 2>admirable or positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

833
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:07.790
<v Speaker 2>of course you'd assume that the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure is corrupt and that you had to</v>

834
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:10.230
<v Speaker 2>take care of yourself and no one else </v>
<v Speaker 2>will not.</v>

835
00:46:10.231 --> 00:46:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Of course not everyone assumes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>under those situations,</v>

836
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a.</v>

837
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:18.390
<v Speaker 2>But it's a logical set of conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

838
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:22.260
<v Speaker 2>and of course it's proportionate to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree to how much abuse you take.</v>

839
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Although there are lots of stories of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who've been terribly abused as </v>

840
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:27.930
<v Speaker 2>children who grew up to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

841
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.760
<v Speaker 2>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable,</v>

842
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:35.480
<v Speaker 2>responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughtful people who were absolutely </v>

843
00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.930
<v Speaker 2>opposed to abuse instead of propagating </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

844
00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no direct causal pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

845
00:46:40.471 --> 00:46:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Lamp Wick is pretty happy to be on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

846
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:47.910
<v Speaker 2>on this coach way to pleasure island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has heard about.</v>

847
00:46:47.911 --> 00:46:48.570
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

848
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.570
<v Speaker 2>it's all you can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all you can smoke if you don't have</v>

849
00:46:51.571 --> 00:46:53.550
<v Speaker 2>to do any work and you can do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

850
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.010
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

851
00:46:56.011 --> 00:47:01.011
<v Speaker 2>it's too good to be true like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gingerbread house in the Hansel and </v>

852
00:47:01.011 --> 00:47:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Gretel story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

853
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.360
<v Speaker 2>And kids are lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a gingerbread house,</v>

854
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a house which is something they </v>
<v Speaker 2>need and it's made out of cookies.</v>

855
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's a little bit too good</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be true.</v>

856
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.440
<v Speaker 2>And of course in the house there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the negative part of that,</v>

857
00:47:13.441 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 2>which is the old witch who wants to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

858
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:21.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's a story about what happens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people if they're offered more than they</v>

859
00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:23.910
<v Speaker 2>should be offered.</v>

860
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.960
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lamp wick is firing off a.</v>

861
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.340
<v Speaker 2>He has a little slingshot and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>firing off pebbles at the horses who are</v>

862
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.980
<v Speaker 2>pulling the carriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just kind of the guy that he </v>

863
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he takes Pinocchio under his wing and</v>

864
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.300
<v Speaker 2>the cricket is down there in the dust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's caught back up to the carriage,</v>

865
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:47.680
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

866
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:50.350
<v Speaker 2>he's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's having a rough time at this point.</v>

867
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.950
<v Speaker 2>This is also a story to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the transition into adolescence.</v>

868
00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:56.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because adolescence is a time people are</v>

869
00:47:56.801 --> 00:48:00.550
<v Speaker 2>still pretty impulsive and their view is</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite short term and they're more likely</v>

870
00:48:00.551 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 2>to pursue immediate pleasures and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>

871
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:07.450
<v Speaker 2>And now it can get really out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

872
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 2>they separate from the mainland and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a boat.</v>

873
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.070
<v Speaker 2>And so they're off to pleasure island </v>
<v Speaker 2>dark place.</v>

874
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:21.540
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coachman opens the gates and lets </v>

875
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:25.380
<v Speaker 2>the delinquents into pleasure island and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically have a riot.</v>

876
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:32.220
<v Speaker 2>And this is pleasure island here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

877
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.570
<v Speaker 2>it's full of amusement park rides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

878
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.200
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about horror movies you,</v>

879
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've noticed this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they're often sat at amusement </v>

880
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 2>parks and clowns are often characters of</v>
<v Speaker 2>horror.</v>

881
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:51.530
<v Speaker 2>We'll leave the clowns aside for now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the amusement park thing that's </v>

882
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:54.631
<v Speaker 2>pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like why in the world would an </v>

883
00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.551
<v Speaker 2>amusement park be a place of horror?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first question might be,</v>

884
00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:01.860
<v Speaker 2>well have you ever been to an amusement </v>
<v Speaker 2>park because there is something about </v>

885
00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.410
<v Speaker 2>them that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a dark side,</v>

886
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:09.480
<v Speaker 2>clear dark side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of it is that people with </v>

887
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.621
<v Speaker 2>nothing better to do or spending money </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupidly and they're being fleeced by </v>

888
00:49:13.621 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 2>the people who operate the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amusement park,</v>

889
00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:21.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have let's say a </v>

890
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.610
<v Speaker 2>stereotypically dark reputation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're moving around all the time,</v>

891
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:30.100
<v Speaker 2>which is also something that psychopaths</v>
<v Speaker 2>do and all they're doing is moving from </v>

892
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 2>community to community and taking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money from the rubes fundamentally.</v>

893
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:37.740
<v Speaker 2>And so the amusement park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you walk through an amusement </v>

894
00:49:38.711 --> 00:49:43.711
<v Speaker 2>park without sort of thing in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's also coloring your vision </v>

895
00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:46.420
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that you can see very</v>

896
00:49:46.421 --> 00:49:51.421
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something about them that's </v>

897
00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:51.421
<v Speaker 2>sort of deeply sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also that under,</v>

898
00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:55.681
<v Speaker 2>there's an underlying horror that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterizes them that it's easy for </v>

899
00:49:55.681 --> 00:49:58.840
<v Speaker 2>horror movie or horror novel writers to </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately expand upon.</v>

900
00:49:58.841 --> 00:50:01.870
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about it that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense to people.</v>

901
00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's.</v>

902
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.740
<v Speaker 2>And it's also all short term </v>
<v Speaker 2>gratification.</v>

903
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:11.590
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you spend your money very rapidly and</v>

904
00:50:11.591 --> 00:50:12.370
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

905
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

906
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:24.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the impulsive element that the </v>

907
00:50:24.361 --> 00:50:26.040
<v Speaker 2>comment was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a celebration of of meanings </v>

908
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:26.040
<v Speaker 2>divorced from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

909
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:26.040
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

910
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 2>it's also outside of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

911
00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:32.381
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's on an island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a separate universe and it's a </v>

912
00:50:32.381 --> 00:50:36.671
<v Speaker 2>universe where nothing that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>is connected to anything outside and </v>

913
00:50:36.671 --> 00:50:37.430
<v Speaker 2>you're spending your hard earned money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

914
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:41.450
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not an investment.</v>

915
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.370
<v Speaker 2>It's not that much different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>burning it.</v>

916
00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:46.280
<v Speaker 2>What is because of course you get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure out of it,</v>

917
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

918
00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:47.690
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

919
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.430
<v Speaker 2>it isn't going with their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyday is probably not the wisest move</v>

920
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:57.431
<v Speaker 2>that you could make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the animators do a good job of,</v>

921
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:00.630
<v Speaker 2>of</v>

922
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:05.730
<v Speaker 2>while I'm presenting the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

923
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.760
<v Speaker 2>The enforced hedonism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I would say of a place like </v>

924
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.551
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a place where you're going to </v>

925
00:51:13.551 --> 00:51:13.551
<v Speaker 2>have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's for.</v>

926
00:51:13.551 --> 00:51:15.420
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lamp wick,</v>

927
00:51:15.421 --> 00:51:19.500
<v Speaker 2>who's got this very arrogant look on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>face and this kind of structure.</v>

928
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bravado.</v>

929
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:24.480
<v Speaker 2>That's what that's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a false confidence and it's,</v>

930
00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:29.540
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the sort of thing that people do </v>

931
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.371
<v Speaker 2>when they're trying to impress upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>others that they're high in the </v>

932
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:31.470
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really they're not.</v>

933
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's a mimicry of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dominance,</v>

934
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:37.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be intimidating.</v>

935
00:51:37.501 --> 00:51:38.430
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>

936
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:39.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

937
00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

938
00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:46.490
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

939
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.470
<v Speaker 2>he didn't come to a good end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

940
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.560
<v Speaker 2>this person who was a real good friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mine when I was in junior high and </v>

941
00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.690
<v Speaker 2>high school and he was kind of crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

942
00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:01.210
<v Speaker 2>he was tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was about six foot seven and he was </v>

943
00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:02.630
<v Speaker 2>pretty thin and we used to go up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bar now and then.</v>

944
00:52:02.631 --> 00:52:05.350
<v Speaker 2>And in many of the bars that we were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in,</v>

945
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:10.390
<v Speaker 2>lived in this little town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were bullies and these were guys </v>

946
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:12.140
<v Speaker 2>and I worked in the bars and I used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch these guys and they'd basically,</v>

947
00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:15.440
<v Speaker 2>there was a handful of them in town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty psychopathic types,</v>

948
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:20.950
<v Speaker 2>and they'd go to the bar and all they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is sit there and wait for someone to </v>

949
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.801
<v Speaker 2>come in who they could beat up and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew who it was as soon as they walked </v>

950
00:52:23.801 --> 00:52:23.801
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

951
00:52:23.801 --> 00:52:23.990
<v Speaker 2>That's actually why they were at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bar.</v>

952
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.560
<v Speaker 2>And so they'd wait until someone came in</v>
<v Speaker 2>who didn't look very confident and who </v>

953
00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.040
<v Speaker 2>could likely be intimidated by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by this sort of thing.</v>

954
00:52:31.041 --> 00:52:34.520
<v Speaker 2>And then they'd tell him to come outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a fight.</v>

955
00:52:34.521 --> 00:52:39.521
<v Speaker 2>And if they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then they of course make fun of </v>

956
00:52:39.521 --> 00:52:39.521
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they did well,</v>

957
00:52:39.521 --> 00:52:41.960
<v Speaker 2>generally they beat them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend kind of caught onto this trick</v>

958
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:46.961
<v Speaker 2>and he started going to bars and every </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that someone like that came near </v>

959
00:52:46.961 --> 00:52:47.660
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd go outside and fight with them.</v>

960
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:52.780
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things he observed right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away is that almost inevitably when he </v>

961
00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.320
<v Speaker 2>went outside with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd shake hands and make friends.</v>

962
00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:00.340
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was really remarkable watching </v>

963
00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.681
<v Speaker 2>him because he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't a particularly physically </v>

964
00:53:02.681 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 2>powerful person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although he was extraordinarily tall,</v>

965
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:08.740
<v Speaker 2>but he had started to play this game and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did it for a long time and I don't </v>

966
00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.580
<v Speaker 2>remember him ever actually having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

967
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:16.090
<v Speaker 2>He just stared them down fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was very interesting thing to </v>

968
00:53:16.431 --> 00:53:17.320
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

969
00:53:17.321 --> 00:53:22.321
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an indication to me of exactly </v>

970
00:53:22.321 --> 00:53:23.300
<v Speaker 2>how shallow this kind of bravado </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullying actually is.</v>

971
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:28.870
<v Speaker 2>But people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't find that out because they </v>

972
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:29.270
<v Speaker 2>won't stand up and it's not surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

973
00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:37.740
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they load up on Food Pinocchio's </v>

974
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.380
<v Speaker 2>carrying a Pi and an ice cream cone </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously and then they're off to </v>

975
00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:44.130
<v Speaker 2>have a fight and lamp says something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

976
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:48.780
<v Speaker 2>it's good to punch someone in the nose </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes just for the heck of it.</v>

977
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 2>And so Pinocchio adopts this struct and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they go to the rough house.</v>

978
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.700
<v Speaker 2>And then in the next scene you see this </v>
<v Speaker 2>model home up for destruction.</v>

979
00:53:56.701 --> 00:53:59.160
<v Speaker 2>It's quite an interesting scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Symbolically.</v>

980
00:53:59.161 --> 00:53:59.520
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

981
00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:06.660
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of this house here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a stain glass window that has a </v>

982
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Mandela on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see it more clearly in a minute.</v>

983
00:54:08.771 --> 00:54:11.950
<v Speaker 2>And Amanda Mandela is a sacred symbol of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the self.</v>

984
00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.020
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the union interpretation.</v>

985
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to describe,</v>

986
00:54:16.661 --> 00:54:17.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a symbol.</v>

987
00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Music is a Mandela except it's played </v>
<v Speaker 2>out across time.</v>

988
00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:24.460
<v Speaker 2>So you could say that that thing is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as music,</v>

989
00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:26.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's Kinda like a slice of music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

990
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same idea.</v>

991
00:54:28.211 --> 00:54:33.211
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you see those slow motion or </v>

992
00:54:33.211 --> 00:54:35.830
<v Speaker 2>sped up motion videos of a flower </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfolding that's the same.</v>

993
00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:40.980
<v Speaker 2>It's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine that being set to music </v>

994
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.681
<v Speaker 2>and somehow that would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Mandela as like a symbol of the </v>

995
00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:47.041
<v Speaker 2>unfolding of being and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the source of meaning or something </v>

996
00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:49.120
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also a symbol of the self.</v>

997
00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:54.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm from the union perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there you see it more clearly.</v>

998
00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:57.500
<v Speaker 2>The kids are starting to burn this place</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

999
00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.070
<v Speaker 2>and trash it and they're dragging a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grand piano down the,</v>

1000
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.540
<v Speaker 2>down the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1001
00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:06.810
<v Speaker 2>the destruction of high culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about which they're nothing but cynical </v>

1002
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.080
<v Speaker 2>because they don't believe that hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and sacrifice can,</v>

1003
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:13.530
<v Speaker 2>can produce something of any value and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to bring it down and destroy </v>

1004
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:13.690
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because</v>

1005
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:18.700
<v Speaker 2>can see this in the story of Cain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abel.</v>

1006
00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Table is hard working and everyone likes</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and he makes the proper sacrifices.</v>

1007
00:55:23.981 --> 00:55:28.981
<v Speaker 2>And so his life goes really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of the reason that cain </v>

1008
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:30.100
<v Speaker 2>hates him and he's jealous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentful.</v>

1009
00:55:30.101 --> 00:55:32.410
<v Speaker 2>But worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're around someone,</v>

1010
00:55:32.411 --> 00:55:35.650
<v Speaker 2>if you're not doing very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if that's your own fault.</v>

1011
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:39.370
<v Speaker 2>If you're not doing very well and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>around someone who's doing very well,</v>

1012
00:55:39.371 --> 00:55:44.371
<v Speaker 2>it's very painful because the mere fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>of there being judges you and so it's </v>

1013
00:55:45.161 --> 00:55:50.161
<v Speaker 2>very easy to want to destroy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to destroy that ideal so that you don't </v>

1014
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:54.121
<v Speaker 2>have to live with the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of seeing it embodied in </v>

1015
00:55:54.121 --> 00:55:57.361
<v Speaker 2>front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the reason that people </v>

1016
00:55:57.361 --> 00:56:02.261
<v Speaker 2>want to tear things down is so that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have anything to contrast </v>

1017
00:56:02.261 --> 00:56:06.491
<v Speaker 2>themselves against and to feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what's happening </v>

1018
00:56:06.491 --> 00:56:09.251
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kids are destroying all of this </v>

1019
00:56:09.251 --> 00:56:12.160
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking because it judges them </v>

1020
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.110
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>judges them.</v>

1021
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:19.290
<v Speaker 2>And I've often thought this about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelangelo Statue of David,</v>

1022
00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.170
<v Speaker 2>which is this heroic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So David was a shepherd,</v>

1023
00:56:22.171 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>obviously it</v>

1024
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.610
<v Speaker 5>doesn't sound like much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but back in those times being a shepherd</v>

1025
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:32.611
<v Speaker 5>was a big deal because there were lions </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you had a slingshot and so like you </v>

1026
00:56:32.611 --> 00:56:35.200
<v Speaker 5>got to defend your sheep from lions with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a slingshot.</v>

1027
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:39.370
<v Speaker 5>So you weren't exactly this 19th century</v>
<v Speaker 5>English guy dressed in a,</v>

1028
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:41.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fairly blue suit.</v>

1029
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:46.530
<v Speaker 5>You were tough as a bloody well as </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who would go after lion with a </v>

1030
00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:47.830
<v Speaker 5>slingshot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's no joke.</v>

1031
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.350
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the statue is very heroic and you know,</v>

1032
00:56:50.351 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 5>when you look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think,</v>

1033
00:56:51.401 --> 00:56:54.160
<v Speaker 5>well that's the possibility of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of humankind.</v>

1034
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:56.620
<v Speaker 5>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also what you're not.</v>

1035
00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 5>And so as well as being an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a judge and every ideal is a judge.</v>

1036
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:02.590
<v Speaker 5>So yes.</v>

1037
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:08.050
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're,</v>

1038
00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:13.210
<v Speaker 5>you're using that as an example to </v>
<v Speaker 5>illustrate becoming fitter as a result </v>

1039
00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:18.000
<v Speaker 5>of not being able to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1040
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:24.010
<v Speaker 5>A status as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 5>success even faster as a result of hard </v>

1041
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:24.890
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in the example of Canaan,</v>

1042
00:57:24.891 --> 00:57:25.410
<v Speaker 5>April.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1043
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:30.710
<v Speaker 5>like one was a shepherd and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>farmer and the one who knows no one is.</v>

1044
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:31.470
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

1045
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:32.900
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who was the shepherd?</v>

1046
00:57:32.901 --> 00:57:34.680
<v Speaker 5>Was the one who was favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1047
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 5>Was that a result of the hard work or </v>
<v Speaker 5>was that a result of good question?</v>

1048
00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.280
<v Speaker 5>The stories as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>

1049
00:57:43.281 --> 00:57:48.281
<v Speaker 5>Those stories are very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very complicated and the story is very </v>

1050
00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:51.080
<v Speaker 5>ambivalent about whether Kane is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>rewarded because he makes bad sacrifices</v>

1051
00:57:51.081 --> 00:57:54.720
<v Speaker 5>are because God's just in a bad mood and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that.</v>

1052
00:57:55.130 --> 00:58:00.130
<v Speaker 5>If you read the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've read multiple translations of the </v>

1053
00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:02.210
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When cain comes to God to complain,</v>

1054
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:04.700
<v Speaker 5>God basically tells him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1055
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:10.030
<v Speaker 5>buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>before you go about criticizing the </v>

1056
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:13.511
<v Speaker 5>structure of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should look to your own </v>

1057
00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:13.511
<v Speaker 5>inadequacies.</v>

1058
00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:16.630
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sin Crouches at your door like a </v>

1059
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:19.301
<v Speaker 5>predatory sexually aroused animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you invited it in to have its way </v>

1060
00:58:19.301 --> 00:58:23.921
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And something has emerged as a </v>

1061
00:58:23.921 --> 00:58:26.111
<v Speaker 5>consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So be bothered me about my creation </v>

1062
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:29.141
<v Speaker 5>before you look to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a very strong hint that the </v>

1063
00:58:29.141 --> 00:58:33.851
<v Speaker 5>reason that God has not favored cane </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifices because they weren't a </v>

1064
00:58:33.851 --> 00:58:36.130
<v Speaker 5>particularly good quality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so but that,</v>

1065
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:41.190
<v Speaker 5>but it is ambivalent in the story and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there is the shepherd versus farmer </v>

1066
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:45.250
<v Speaker 5>Motif as well and of course that Motif </v>
<v Speaker 5>runs through the whole entire corpus of </v>

1067
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:47.090
<v Speaker 5>stories to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially the shepherd motif.</v>

1068
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:52.630
<v Speaker 5>So it's only about a paragraph long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that whole story and it packs all that </v>

1069
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.210
<v Speaker 5>into that tiny little amount of space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

1070
00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:00.500
<v Speaker 5>the idea that cain kills able to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 5>of his ideal and also to punish God.</v>

1071
00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:02.870
<v Speaker 5>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a brilliant story.</v>

1072
00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:08.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean these guys who go around shooting</v>
<v Speaker 5>up high schools are shooting up high </v>

1073
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:12.140
<v Speaker 5>schools in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are definitely out for revenge</v>

1074
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.200
<v Speaker 5>and what their revenging themselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>against or to who is not exactly clear </v>

1075
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.010
<v Speaker 5>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these kids are just tearing down this</v>

1076
00:59:19.011 --> 00:59:24.011
<v Speaker 5>model.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Home tearing Western civilization I </v>

1077
00:59:24.011 --> 00:59:26.030
<v Speaker 5>suppose is another way of looking at or </v>
<v Speaker 5>just tearing down civilization period.</v>

1078
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.280
<v Speaker 5>And Pinocchio Pinocchio's having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty good time.</v>

1079
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 5>He's got his ax and he's looking a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little malevolent level in there.</v>

1080
00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:34.190
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and happy to be destroying things,</v>

1081
00:59:34.191 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 5>which is of course a pretty simple thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>

1082
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:41.740
<v Speaker 5>So there's that image that I told you </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the Mandela that's a flower in </v>

1083
00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:44.540
<v Speaker 5>this image.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what happens is that,</v>

1084
00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:49.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's lamp life throws a brick </v>

1085
00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:50.080
<v Speaker 5>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what that means symbolically,</v>

1086
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:54.350
<v Speaker 5>this the self is a symbol of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>potential among very many other things.</v>

1087
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.070
<v Speaker 5>But by engaging in this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>impulsive,</v>

1088
00:59:58.071 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 5>destructive activity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lamp,</v>

1089
01:00:00.021 --> 01:00:00.830
<v Speaker 5>Wick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Pinocchio,</v>

1090
01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 5>or making it impossible for them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>further their development.</v>

1091
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:05.540
<v Speaker 5>And they're doing that to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciously,</v>

1092
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:10.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they basically say to hell with it and </v>

1093
01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:11.900
<v Speaker 5>toss a brick through this highest ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing through which light shines.</v>

1094
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.470
<v Speaker 5>So also that hearkens back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the stars.</v>

1095
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:19.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so anyways,</v>

1096
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:24.640
<v Speaker 5>the coachman is paying attention to all </v>
<v Speaker 5>this and he's actually pretty happy </v>

1097
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.941
<v Speaker 5>about the fact that these boys are so </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved in their stupid amusements </v>

1098
01:00:27.941 --> 01:00:28.280
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1099
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.060
<v Speaker 5>that they're not paying any attention to</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's actually going on.</v>

1100
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 5>And he calls these people out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>darkness,</v>

1101
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:37.520
<v Speaker 5>these creatures out of the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you get these black,</v>

1102
01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:42.610
<v Speaker 5>you can hardly see them there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are black cloak figures with </v>

1103
01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:43.880
<v Speaker 5>glowing eyes and there are shutting the </v>
<v Speaker 5>door of the,</v>

1104
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.040
<v Speaker 5>of the amusement park.</v>

1105
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:52.030
<v Speaker 5>That's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an extraordinarily interesting </v>

1106
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:52.030
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1107
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:53.240
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So all of a sudden the amusement park is</v>

1108
01:00:53.241 --> 01:00:58.241
<v Speaker 5>associate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We already know that the coachman is up </v>

1109
01:00:58.241 --> 01:01:00.161
<v Speaker 5>to no good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now he's got these minions that are </v>

1110
01:01:00.161 --> 01:01:02.860
<v Speaker 5>faceless and in some sense they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>clearly creatures of the night and </v>

1111
01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.010
<v Speaker 5>they're up to no good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you have the sense that,</v>

1112
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 5>that the boys are being offered bread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bread and circuses,</v>

1113
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:10.370
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's something,</v>

1114
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.360
<v Speaker 5>there's a real reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a manipulative reason for it.</v>

1115
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:16.280
<v Speaker 5>They're being enticed into a trap and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1116
01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:21.790
<v Speaker 5>the doors are closed and these </v>
<v Speaker 5>underground beings are involved in the </v>

1117
01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:22.300
<v Speaker 5>plot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1118
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:24.920
<v Speaker 5>and obviously the coach went understands</v>
<v Speaker 5>this perfectly well.</v>

1119
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:29.921
<v Speaker 5>And so one of the ways to understand </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is to think about what totalitarian</v>

1120
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:33.950
<v Speaker 5>states have to offer their populous and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they offered them.</v>

1121
01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:36.020
<v Speaker 5>And this happened particularly as Rome </v>
<v Speaker 5>declined.</v>

1122
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 5>Let's say that's where the term bread </v>
<v Speaker 5>and circuses originally came from,</v>

1123
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:44.651
<v Speaker 5>is that as the situation regenerates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then people have to be offered stupid </v>

1124
01:01:45.111 --> 01:01:50.111
<v Speaker 5>amusements more and more frequently in </v>
<v Speaker 5>order to for them to ignore what's </v>

1125
01:01:50.111 --> 01:01:54.701
<v Speaker 5>actually going on in the background and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know a war can be that kind of </v>

1126
01:01:54.701 --> 01:01:56.600
<v Speaker 5>stupid amusement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyways.</v>

1127
01:01:56.601 --> 01:02:01.601
<v Speaker 5>The next later that night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the entire place is completely </v>

1128
01:02:01.601 --> 01:02:04.271
<v Speaker 5>devastated and all we see as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wreckage of everything that was there </v>

1129
01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:08.111
<v Speaker 5>before and again in the cricket has got </v>
<v Speaker 5>separated from Pinocchio and so he's </v>

1130
01:02:08.111 --> 01:02:10.670
<v Speaker 5>trying to find a mentor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio ends up in this.</v>

1131
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.420
<v Speaker 5>This bar that's shaped like an eight </v>
<v Speaker 5>ball,</v>

1132
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 5>eight ball is kind of the random ball in</v>
<v Speaker 5>in pool and anyways,</v>

1133
01:02:19.591 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 5>he's inside</v>

1134
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:25.130
<v Speaker 2>the eight ball and he's shooting pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>with with lamp wick and that's just </v>

1135
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:27.950
<v Speaker 2>another indication of wasting his time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

1136
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:33.050
<v Speaker 2>You can see in the forefront there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some cards for gambling and so </v>

1137
01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:36.180
<v Speaker 2>he's engaged in these sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say pointless.</v>

1138
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.720
<v Speaker 2>He don't want it pursuits and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>enticing Pinocchio along the same route </v>

1139
01:02:42.511 --> 01:02:47.511
<v Speaker 2>and so he teaches him to smoke first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't go very well,</v>

1140
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
<v Speaker 2>so Pinocchio takes a huge drag on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigar and it just about kills them and </v>

1141
01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:56.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't amp quick asks him how he likes</v>

1142
01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:58.230
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shakes his head and says,</v>

1143
01:02:58.290 --> 01:02:59.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's really,</v>

1144
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:04.220
<v Speaker 2>it was really quite good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's so sick that he can hardly </v>

1145
01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.371
<v Speaker 2>stand up and he's hallucinating double </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls on the pool table and then the </v>

1146
01:03:07.371 --> 01:03:12.261
<v Speaker 2>cricket shows up and stands on the eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>ball and kind of gives one of those </v>

1147
01:03:12.261 --> 01:03:12.261
<v Speaker 2>declamatory speeches again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1148
01:03:12.261 --> 01:03:17.190
<v Speaker 2>because he still hasn't quite figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>out that standing up proud and spouting </v>

1149
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.870
<v Speaker 2>off the rules isn't exactly the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>way for the conscience to behave.</v>

1150
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:26.010
<v Speaker 2>And a lamp wick picks him up by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scruff of the neck,</v>

1151
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:28.110
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1152
01:03:28.111 --> 01:03:33.111
<v Speaker 2>I asked who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So obviously he's divorced from his own </v>

1153
01:03:33.111 --> 01:03:36.771
<v Speaker 2>conscience and then makes fun of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio for paying attention to this </v>

1154
01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:40.821
<v Speaker 2>little bug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of a nice indication of </v>

1155
01:03:40.821 --> 01:03:41.480
<v Speaker 2>what happens in adolescence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1156
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:45.480
<v Speaker 2>because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as children move away from their parents</v>

1157
01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:50.481
<v Speaker 2>and into their groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when the groups are </v>

1158
01:03:50.481 --> 01:03:53.601
<v Speaker 2>misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often what happens is that the other </v>

1159
01:03:53.601 --> 01:03:56.511
<v Speaker 2>members of the group will torture a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who isn't willing to try </v>

1160
01:03:56.511 --> 01:04:00.081
<v Speaker 2>something dangerous or foolish by making</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun of the fact that they're too </v>

1161
01:04:00.081 --> 01:04:05.040
<v Speaker 2>attached to their conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a positive element to that </v>

1162
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.340
<v Speaker 2>because you shouldn't take some risks </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a teenager and also later in</v>

1163
01:04:08.341 --> 01:04:10.650
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you won't take any risks,</v>

1164
01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:11.970
<v Speaker 2>there's actually something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1165
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 2>But there's a negative element in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1166
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:20.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teenagers do all sorts of stupid things </v>

1167
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:21.270
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps it's amazing that we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived through it actually,</v>

1168
01:04:21.271 --> 01:04:25.050
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people take extraordinary risks,</v>

1169
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:29.490
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't make it through at all.</v>

1170
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Or they end up in the permanently </v>
<v Speaker 2>antisocial population.</v>

1171
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:35.660
<v Speaker 2>And then they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1172
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.880
<v Speaker 2>basically career criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five percent of the criminals commit 95 </v>

1173
01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:44.190
<v Speaker 2>percent of the crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another prieto distribution.</v>

1174
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:49.850
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lamp isn't going to listen to Pinocchio </v>

1175
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:55.430
<v Speaker 2>or to the cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he laughs out of him with his kind of </v>

1176
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:56.000
<v Speaker 2>breaking laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is some foreshadowing and uh,</v>

1177
01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:01.610
<v Speaker 2>the cricket gets all upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts his coat on backwards and ends up </v>

1178
01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:04.980
<v Speaker 2>dumped down a pool table hole and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise abused.</v>

1179
01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:09.981
<v Speaker 2>And so he stomps on out of their details</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio that he can take care of </v>

1180
01:05:09.981 --> 01:05:10.170
<v Speaker 2>himself and he stomps on out of there.</v>

1181
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:15.410
<v Speaker 2>And so Pinocchio is left without the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guidance of conscience and the cricket </v>

1182
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:16.680
<v Speaker 2>is trying to figure out how to get off </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure island,</v>

1183
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 2>but he goes through the gates and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>sees what's actually going on.</v>

1184
01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:28.130
<v Speaker 2>And what's going on is that the coach </v>
<v Speaker 2>when has this like slave boat down in </v>

1185
01:05:28.601 --> 01:05:31.800
<v Speaker 2>the bowels of the island and he's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these,</v>

1186
01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:37.120
<v Speaker 2>these black suited minions with glowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes working for him and they're </v>

1187
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:41.581
<v Speaker 2>rounding up what looked like donkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there are beasts of burden,</v>

1188
01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:47.041
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's an idea here that if you </v>

1189
01:05:47.041 --> 01:05:49.681
<v Speaker 2>produce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pursue impulsive pleasure to the </v>

1190
01:05:49.681 --> 01:05:50.170
<v Speaker 2>detriment of the development of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

1191
01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.150
<v Speaker 2>you're going to end up a beast of </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden.</v>

1192
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:56.290
<v Speaker 2>You're going to end up a slave to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrant and that's exactly right,</v>

1193
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:59.080
<v Speaker 2>and so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other cricket doesn't.</v>

1194
01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:02.110
<v Speaker 2>You can see one of those black suited </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrors here,</v>

1195
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:08.190
<v Speaker 2>hauling donkeys out of this crate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them has a hat on and they looked</v>

1196
01:06:08.371 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 2>very sad and they're in different crates</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of them says,</v>

1197
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:14.290
<v Speaker 2>sold to the salt mines and one says sold</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the circus,</v>

1198
01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 2>and so they're shipped off to be to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>slaves roughly speaking,</v>

1199
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:23.610
<v Speaker 2>and they look very sad and then one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them gets hauled out of a crate and he's</v>

1200
01:06:23.611 --> 01:06:24.340
<v Speaker 2>still got a hat.</v>

1201
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:27.670
<v Speaker 2>He has a hat on and a sweater and he can</v>
<v Speaker 2>still talk.</v>

1202
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:33.090
<v Speaker 2>He's a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that's been half </v>

1203
01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.920
<v Speaker 2>transformed into a jackass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a jackass prior to being enslaved.</v>

1204
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:40.921
<v Speaker 2>And so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that's quite </v>

1205
01:06:40.921 --> 01:06:40.921
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1206
01:06:40.921 --> 01:06:40.921
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1207
01:06:40.921 --> 01:06:44.880
<v Speaker 2>It also makes the case that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>replace your voice with stupid brain,</v>

1208
01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:50.370
<v Speaker 2>that the probability that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to become enslaved by a tyrant is </v>

1209
01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:54.151
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily high and I always can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>help but think about idiot idiot logs in</v>

1210
01:06:55.121 --> 01:07:00.121
<v Speaker 2>that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Solzhenitsyn wrote about the radical </v>

1211
01:07:00.121 --> 01:07:02.020
<v Speaker 2>left ideologues that got thrown in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gulag archipelago,</v>

1212
01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they were part party stalwarts.</v>

1213
01:07:03.971 --> 01:07:08.971
<v Speaker 2>This happened to a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true believers who are vacuumed up by </v>

1214
01:07:08.971 --> 01:07:10.990
<v Speaker 2>this machine and thrown in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown into the Gulag anyways.</v>

1215
01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:16.410
<v Speaker 2>And he said that those people suffered </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways more than everyone else </v>

1216
01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:17.590
<v Speaker 2>because what did he say?</v>

1217
01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:20.020
<v Speaker 2>They were bit by the beloved hand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fed them.</v>

1218
01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.180
<v Speaker 2>And so the first while when they were in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the camps,</v>

1219
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn really didn't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with people like that because on the </v>

1220
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.821
<v Speaker 2>one hand while they were in the camps </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wasn't that awful and they'd been </v>

1221
01:07:29.821 --> 01:07:30.280
<v Speaker 2>torn away from their families and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1222
01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:34.330
<v Speaker 2>stripped of all their identity and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>status and so that's pretty rough.</v>

1223
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:37.090
<v Speaker 2>But on other hand they were writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>letters,</v>

1224
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:42.120
<v Speaker 2>protesting their innocence and assuming </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everyone else in the camp was </v>

1225
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.181
<v Speaker 2>guilty but they were innocent and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were still strident believers in the </v>

1226
01:07:45.181 --> 01:07:47.340
<v Speaker 2>communist process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

1227
01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:50.890
<v Speaker 2>it was a conundrum here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are being terribly punished,</v>

1228
01:07:50.891 --> 01:07:54.490
<v Speaker 2>but by the same token there are also the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetrators have their own device,</v>

1229
01:07:54.491 --> 01:07:57.910
<v Speaker 2>so how do you deal with them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they used to play comrades,</v>

1230
01:07:57.911 --> 01:08:02.050
<v Speaker 2>he said they used to play comrades with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like that and invite them into an</v>

1231
01:08:02.051 --> 01:08:07.051
<v Speaker 2>ideological discussion about the camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and the situation in the </v>

1232
01:08:07.051 --> 01:08:10.891
<v Speaker 2>country as a whole and let them rattle </v>
<v Speaker 2>out their ideological justification for </v>

1233
01:08:12.821 --> 01:08:17.210
<v Speaker 2>everything that had happened in trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make them parody themselves.</v>

1234
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a rough game and units and also </v>

1235
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.510
<v Speaker 2>concluded that</v>

1236
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:30.700
<v Speaker 2>there is no helping someone like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were still ensconced inside </v>

1237
01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:35.021
<v Speaker 2>that brain ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can predict everything they were </v>

1238
01:08:35.021 --> 01:08:35.450
<v Speaker 2>going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like someone had a crank,</v>

1239
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:38.960
<v Speaker 2>you could just crank it and out would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come the proper ideological formulas.</v>

1240
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.180
<v Speaker 2>But then he realized that as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1241
01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:47.640
<v Speaker 2>let's call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repented of that and started to realize </v>

1242
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.410
<v Speaker 2>they're their own role in it or the era </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the system,</v>

1243
01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:51.590
<v Speaker 2>then he would start communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1244
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if they were people who who you could</v>

1245
01:08:55.911 --> 01:08:57.500
<v Speaker 2>communicate with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1246
01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:00.020
<v Speaker 2>So that was very interesting as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned.</v>

1247
01:09:00.021 --> 01:09:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid is still a little bit human.</v>

1248
01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:07.631
<v Speaker 2>He starts to cry for his mom and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coachman basically throws them back into</v>

1249
01:09:07.671 --> 01:09:09.530
<v Speaker 2>the crate and says that he's not ready </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

1250
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.300
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that he could</v>
<v Speaker 2>still,</v>

1251
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.210
<v Speaker 2>he still had the power of independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

1252
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:19.630
<v Speaker 2>You remember right at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie when the mouth was painted on </v>

1253
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw that mask that was really glaring</v>

1254
01:09:22.521 --> 01:09:27.521
<v Speaker 2>at the process and I said that character</v>
<v Speaker 2>recurs continually throughout the movie </v>

1255
01:09:27.521 --> 01:09:31.631
<v Speaker 2>and is a good example of that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the coach is the enemy of anything that </v>

1256
01:09:31.631 --> 01:09:33.570
<v Speaker 2>has its own voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's the anti Japan.</v>

1257
01:09:33.571 --> 01:09:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

1258
01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.030
<v Speaker 2>He's the tyrannical aspect of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

1259
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.830
<v Speaker 2>But as in so far as one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly donkey's,</v>

1260
01:09:42.831 --> 01:09:47.630
<v Speaker 2>mostly Jack assets can still talk then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not completely fit for slavery.</v>

1261
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:53.410
<v Speaker 2>And you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this movie was also being made at about </v>

1262
01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:53.410
<v Speaker 2>the same time that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1263
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.150
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi transformation of Germany was </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking place.</v>

1264
01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:59.120
<v Speaker 2>And so all these terrible underground </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1265
01:09:59.180 --> 01:09:59.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1266
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:04.990
<v Speaker 2>this process whereby people were being </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduced to two ideological slave say and</v>

1267
01:10:06.771 --> 01:10:10.760
<v Speaker 2>in this terrible process that was all </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing out in Europe in a very big way.</v>

1268
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:14.510
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like people weren't aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

1269
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in there.</v>

1270
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:17.720
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1271
01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.280
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the donkey's,</v>

1272
01:10:23.281 --> 01:10:27.690
<v Speaker 2>the jackasses that can still talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her crying and complaining and repenting</v>

1273
01:10:27.691 --> 01:10:32.160
<v Speaker 2>and the coachman turns into a full Kyron</v>
<v Speaker 2>again and cracks the whip,</v>

1274
01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:33.540
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and says,</v>

1275
01:10:33.541 --> 01:10:35.640
<v Speaker 2>you've had your fun and now you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay for it.</v>

1276
01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:39.270
<v Speaker 2>So the cricket gets word of all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets wind of it.</v>

1277
01:10:39.271 --> 01:10:44.271
<v Speaker 2>He starts to understand what's happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that all these bad kids were enticed </v>

1278
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:46.170
<v Speaker 2>out onto this island so that they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be enslaved.</v>

1279
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:50.130
<v Speaker 2>And he's really taken aback by that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say the least,</v>

1280
01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:53.970
<v Speaker 2>but he realizes what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He runs back to find Pinocchio.</v>

1281
01:10:53.971 --> 01:10:58.971
<v Speaker 2>And then the scene switches back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight ball bar where I'm lamp wick is </v>

1282
01:11:00.511 --> 01:11:03.210
<v Speaker 2>drinking beer and complaining about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conscience said,</v>

1283
01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:05.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's kind of guilty and ashamed,</v>

1284
01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:07.440
<v Speaker 2>but he won't admit it because he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>admit anything.</v>

1285
01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 2>He knows everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to admit anything about </v>

1286
01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.481
<v Speaker 2>himself that isn't perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a real totalitarian training and he</v>

1287
01:11:14.851 --> 01:11:18.030
<v Speaker 2>drinks this beer and he's laughing about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conscience and putting them down.</v>

1288
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.710
<v Speaker 2>And then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1289
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:20.640
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

1290
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.110
<v Speaker 2>what does he say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly?</v>

1291
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.170
<v Speaker 2>What does he think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a jackass or something like that.</v>

1292
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's not the words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1293
01:11:26.551 --> 01:11:30.720
<v Speaker 2>And then he grows these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ears from Pinocchio,</v>

1294
01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:34.020
<v Speaker 2>sees that and immediately takes a look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the beer and stops drinking it.</v>

1295
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:38.130
<v Speaker 2>And then lamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick transforms one more time.</v>

1296
01:11:38.131 --> 01:11:40.230
<v Speaker 2>And his face turns into the face of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>donkey.</v>

1297
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:42.360
<v Speaker 2>And he's laughing still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then his,</v>

1298
01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.280
<v Speaker 2>his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

1299
01:11:44.281 --> 01:11:46.830
<v Speaker 2>He laughs suddenly starts to bray like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1300
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:49.050
<v Speaker 2>like a jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's horrified by that.</v>

1301
01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:53.580
<v Speaker 2>And then Pinocchio laughs and the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out as well.</v>

1302
01:11:53.581 --> 01:11:58.581
<v Speaker 2>And so now they're absolutely horrified </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lamp luck actually figures out </v>

1303
01:11:58.581 --> 01:11:58.581
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

1304
01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:02.810
<v Speaker 2>He figures out that he's been tricked </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that he's transforming and he's </v>

1305
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 2>completely horrified by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He becomes conscious of what's happening</v>

1306
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:09.951
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's one particularly I would </v>

1307
01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:12.291
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic scene where his hands have </v>

1308
01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:13.470
<v Speaker 2>transformed in hooves and he's kicking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1309
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.730
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1310
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:19.880
<v Speaker 2>and a leaping around the room and panic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he comes up to a mirror and sees </v>

1311
01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.471
<v Speaker 2>himself as a Jack Ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he turns around and breaks the </v>

1312
01:12:24.471 --> 01:12:24.471
<v Speaker 2>mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1313
01:12:24.471 --> 01:12:25.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's self conscious for a moment.</v>

1314
01:12:25.021 --> 01:12:30.021
<v Speaker 2>Then he destroys his capacity for self </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that he transforms </v>

1315
01:12:30.021 --> 01:12:33.531
<v Speaker 2>entirely into a jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's farther down the road than </v>

1316
01:12:33.531 --> 01:12:36.651
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio and he comes crawling to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio to save him and asks that the </v>

1317
01:12:36.651 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 2>conscience comes back so that he can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this.</v>

1318
01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:44.061
<v Speaker 2>But of course it's a bit too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then UN occhio grows jackass ears</v>

1319
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.000
<v Speaker 2>and he's absolutely terrified by it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1320
01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:51.710
<v Speaker 2>He knows what's coming and the cricut </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes back and,</v>

1321
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 2>and guides them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pleasure island.</v>

1322
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.860
<v Speaker 2>And so then they end up on a cliff </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is an island after all,</v>

1323
01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:03.980
<v Speaker 2>and they have to jump into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right out of this impulsive adolescent,</v>

1324
01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:09.570
<v Speaker 2>he dominic playground into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how they escape.</v>

1325
01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:12.660
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first time that Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to leave,</v>

1326
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:18.860
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is the first scene where he </v>

1327
01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.910
<v Speaker 2>has to jump into the water to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean break from something pathological.</v>

1328
01:13:20.911 --> 01:13:25.911
<v Speaker 2>So tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this echoed you see echoes of </v>

1329
01:13:25.911 --> 01:13:26.880
<v Speaker 2>this in the story of Moses leading his </v>
<v Speaker 2>people from,</v>

1330
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:30.240
<v Speaker 2>from Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Moses is a master of water,</v>

1331
01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:35.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he hits this rock with a stick and </v>

1332
01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:38.751
<v Speaker 2>water comes out of it and he's floating </v>
<v Speaker 2>on water when he's an infant and he </v>

1333
01:13:38.751 --> 01:13:42.771
<v Speaker 2>parts the Red Sea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's a master of water and </v>

1334
01:13:42.771 --> 01:13:42.771
<v Speaker 2>transformation.</v>

1335
01:13:42.771 --> 01:13:43.170
<v Speaker 2>And the Pharaoh is in the Pharaoh's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom,</v>

1336
01:13:43.171 --> 01:13:46.500
<v Speaker 2>is represented as a desert stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

1337
01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea there is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1338
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:53.580
<v Speaker 2>the kingdom is solid ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can be a tyranny.</v>

1339
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:57.390
<v Speaker 2>And the water is chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can be the thing that you have to</v>

1340
01:13:57.450 --> 01:13:59.610
<v Speaker 2>leap into to free yourself from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny.</v>

1341
01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:02.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not like in the Moses story that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes easy,</v>

1342
01:14:02.101 --> 01:14:07.101
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the the Hebrews leave Israel </v>

1343
01:14:07.101 --> 01:14:09.951
<v Speaker 2>with or leave Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a terrible tyranny and you </v>

1344
01:14:09.951 --> 01:14:09.951
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's good.</v>

1345
01:14:09.951 --> 01:14:11.500
<v Speaker 2>They've escaped from the tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't what happens.</v>

1346
01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>They escaped</v>

1347
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.780
<v Speaker 5>from the tyranny of the actually end up </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere,</v>

1348
01:14:13.781 --> 01:14:18.040
<v Speaker 5>arguably worse because they're wandering</v>
<v Speaker 5>around in the desert for 40 years.</v>

1349
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:23.550
<v Speaker 5>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a brilliant element of that story </v>

1350
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 5>because it states clearly that when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>go from a bad place to a better place,</v>

1351
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:29.290
<v Speaker 5>you go to a worst place first and that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a great.</v>

1352
01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:34.650
<v Speaker 5>It's a great thing to know because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>also tells you why you might be </v>

1353
01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:37.000
<v Speaker 5>unwilling to take the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you're aiming up,</v>

1354
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:42.030
<v Speaker 5>but in order to aim up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to let go of something you </v>

1355
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:43.930
<v Speaker 5>already have and then that'll put you </v>
<v Speaker 5>into a state of chaos.</v>

1356
01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.950
<v Speaker 5>And unless you're willing to undergo </v>
<v Speaker 5>that intermediary state of chaos and you</v>

1357
01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:50.830
<v Speaker 5>might not recover from it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to get to the next,</v>

1358
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:52.720
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to get to the next </v>
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>

1359
01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.240
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's rough.</v>

1360
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.170
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so Pinocchio,</v>

1361
01:14:56.171 --> 01:15:01.171
<v Speaker 5>he decides that chaos is better than </v>
<v Speaker 5>tyranny and guided by his conscience </v>

1362
01:15:01.171 --> 01:15:04.861
<v Speaker 5>jumps into the water and then we don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>see anything happening in the water in </v>

1363
01:15:04.861 --> 01:15:07.630
<v Speaker 5>this particular scene,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they come back to shore,</v>

1364
01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.320
<v Speaker 5>all half drowned and an exhausted by </v>
<v Speaker 5>their adventure and they go back home.</v>

1365
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.960
<v Speaker 5>And I think maybe we'll take a break </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

1366
01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.890
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a good time to take a break.</v>

1367
01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:22.720
<v Speaker 5>One 30.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect.</v>

1368
01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:25.210
<v Speaker 5>So let's break for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1369
01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.040
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

1370
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:35.100
<v Speaker 5>So Carl Jung talked about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomena.</v>

1371
01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.780
<v Speaker 5>He cried phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He</v>

1372
01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:50.440
<v Speaker 5>described as a retrogressive restoration</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the persona.</v>

1373
01:15:52.450 --> 01:15:57.450
<v Speaker 5>And so it's a complicated idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but basically what it means is that </v>

1374
01:15:57.450 --> 01:16:00.970
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you take a leap forward and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you learn some things,</v>

1375
01:16:00.971 --> 01:16:05.971
<v Speaker 5>but you can't catalyze a new identity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you try to go back and hide in your </v>

1376
01:16:05.971 --> 01:16:09.661
<v Speaker 5>old identity and that actually doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>work because while things have changed </v>

1377
01:16:11.711 --> 01:16:16.711
<v Speaker 5>and you've learned something and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't who you are anymore and so it's </v>

1378
01:16:16.711 --> 01:16:20.581
<v Speaker 5>like you have to cut part parts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself off in a destructive manner to </v>

1379
01:16:20.581 --> 01:16:25.171
<v Speaker 5>fit back into the person that you were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now What happens here is that Pinocchio </v>

1380
01:16:25.171 --> 01:16:29.610
<v Speaker 5>escapes from this tyrannical situation </v>
<v Speaker 5>and undergoes this descend into chaos,</v>

1381
01:16:30.971 --> 01:16:35.971
<v Speaker 5>but he tries to go back home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He tries to go back to what he was and </v>

1382
01:16:35.971 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 5>he can't do that anymore as far there </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't at home anymore.</v>

1383
01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:43.540
<v Speaker 5>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when he goes home,</v>

1384
01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.730
<v Speaker 5>he finds that there's no home there.</v>

1385
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:51.550
<v Speaker 5>Now this happens to people sometimes in </v>
<v Speaker 5>soft and a shock to them.</v>

1386
01:16:51.551 --> 01:16:55.660
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things I've noticed about </v>
<v Speaker 5>Peter Pan type,</v>

1387
01:16:57.070 --> 01:17:01.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to speak about men here </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I've observed it more in men,</v>

1388
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:06.460
<v Speaker 5>is that they often stay under the thumb </v>
<v Speaker 5>of their father and you think,</v>

1389
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:11.461
<v Speaker 5>well why would someone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it means they're subject to the </v>

1390
01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:15.911
<v Speaker 5>tyrannical judgment of their father.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're always concerned about what </v>

1391
01:17:15.911 --> 01:17:18.911
<v Speaker 5>their father would think or whether </v>
<v Speaker 5>their father approves of it and so </v>

1392
01:17:18.911 --> 01:17:19.880
<v Speaker 5>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you think,</v>

1393
01:17:19.881 --> 01:17:24.881
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's got to be an unpleasant place to </v>

1394
01:17:24.881 --> 01:17:26.120
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would you do that?</v>

1395
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.280
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that I've suggested to</v>
<v Speaker 5>my clients and to other people sometimes</v>

1396
01:17:31.281 --> 01:17:34.170
<v Speaker 5>is that here's a weird little exercise </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can undertake.</v>

1397
01:17:34.171 --> 01:17:39.171
<v Speaker 5>A little thought experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have your parents and of course </v>

1398
01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:45.521
<v Speaker 5>your parents have friends who are about </v>
<v Speaker 5>their age and maybe some of them are </v>

1399
01:17:45.521 --> 01:17:45.770
<v Speaker 5>people you only know peripherally.</v>

1400
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.840
<v Speaker 5>And I might ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1401
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:53.550
<v Speaker 5>do you care more about what your parents</v>
<v Speaker 5>think than you care about what these </v>

1402
01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:54.470
<v Speaker 5>peripheral people who know your parents </v>
<v Speaker 5>think?</v>

1403
01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:56.690
<v Speaker 5>And then the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1404
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:59.540
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the question that arises out of</v>

1405
01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:04.450
<v Speaker 5>that is why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1406
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:09.460
<v Speaker 5>for someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your parents are the peripheral people </v>

1407
01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:09.460
<v Speaker 5>and their parents are central.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1408
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:14.530
<v Speaker 5>why is it logical that your parents make</v>
<v Speaker 5>opinion makes any difference to you than</v>

1409
01:18:14.901 --> 01:18:16.220
<v Speaker 5>the appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>than the,</v>

1410
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:17.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1411
01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 5>the opinion of some randomly selected </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are approximately that age.</v>

1412
01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:27.520
<v Speaker 5>Why is it the case that you would </v>
<v Speaker 5>consider that they would know more than </v>

1413
01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:27.520
<v Speaker 5>someone else?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1414
01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.160
<v Speaker 5>I know they know you better and fair </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough,</v>

1415
01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:33.161
<v Speaker 5>but that that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then another point there is that to </v>

1416
01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:38.291
<v Speaker 5>the degree that your parents opinion </v>
<v Speaker 5>about you matters more than some </v>

1417
01:18:38.291 --> 01:18:39.950
<v Speaker 5>randomly selected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have approximately the same age.</v>

1418
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:41.510
<v Speaker 5>Young would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1419
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:46.930
<v Speaker 5>you haven't exactly separated out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>God the image from your parents and so </v>

1420
01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:49.160
<v Speaker 5>you're still under that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that combination.</v>

1421
01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:52.490
<v Speaker 5>It's like a complicated thing to talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

1422
01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:57.110
<v Speaker 5>but think about the Harry Potter series.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Harry has two sets of parents,</v>

1423
01:18:57.111 --> 01:19:02.111
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got the dearsley parents and then </v>

1424
01:19:02.111 --> 01:19:03.851
<v Speaker 5>he's got these like magical parents that</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of float behind and he should know </v>

1425
01:19:03.851 --> 01:19:05.930
<v Speaker 5>the difference between them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They shouldn't be one in the same.</v>

1426
01:19:05.931 --> 01:19:08.840
<v Speaker 5>They're not for him and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1427
01:19:08.841 --> 01:19:13.841
<v Speaker 5>you have your parents and you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature and culture as parents and you </v>

1428
01:19:13.841 --> 01:19:14.990
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be thinking that your parents </v>
<v Speaker 5>are nature and culture as well.</v>

1429
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:20.200
<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't have final dominion over </v>
<v Speaker 5>you means that you're not an individual </v>

1430
01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:20.270
<v Speaker 5>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that's the case.</v>

1431
01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:21.800
<v Speaker 5>Freud said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1432
01:19:21.801 --> 01:19:22.370
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1433
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.580
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one could be a man in les.</v>

1434
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:28.100
<v Speaker 5>His father had died and young said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1435
01:19:28.101 --> 01:19:30.320
<v Speaker 5>but that death can take place </v>
<v Speaker 5>symbolically.</v>

1436
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:33.020
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's that part of the idea,</v>

1437
01:19:33.021 --> 01:19:38.021
<v Speaker 5>and then another part of the idea is one</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the times in your life when you </v>

1438
01:19:38.571 --> 01:19:43.571
<v Speaker 5>actually realize that you're an </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual is when you'll go and ask </v>

1439
01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:47.291
<v Speaker 5>your parents something and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize they actually don't know any </v>

1440
01:19:47.291 --> 01:19:48.290
<v Speaker 5>more about what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you do,</v>

1441
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
<v Speaker 5>and that sucks and that's partly why </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are often willing to maintain a </v>

1442
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.550
<v Speaker 5>tyrant slave relationship with their </v>
<v Speaker 5>father.</v>

1443
01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:00.560
<v Speaker 5>It's like on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be inferior in a </v>

1444
01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.391
<v Speaker 5>relationship like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you've always got the judge </v>

1445
01:20:04.391 --> 01:20:04.391
<v Speaker 5>watching you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but another hand,</v>

1446
01:20:04.391 --> 01:20:05.900
<v Speaker 5>there's always someone who knows what to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

1447
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 5>There's always standing between you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the unknown that you can go ask,</v>

1448
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 5>what should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1449
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:16.911
<v Speaker 5>at some point you'll realize that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason you can't ask that anymore is </v>

1450
01:20:16.911 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 5>because they actually don't know any </v>
<v Speaker 5>more than you do,</v>

1451
01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:19.840
<v Speaker 5>and then that's a pain like that.</v>

1452
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.980
<v Speaker 5>That is a symbolic death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's also when you establish a more </v>

1453
01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:26.340
<v Speaker 5>individual relationship with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>parents,</v>

1454
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:31.430
<v Speaker 5>it's at that point that you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>conceivably start taking care of them </v>

1455
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:32.610
<v Speaker 5>instead of the reverse and that's a time</v>
<v Speaker 5>that should come,</v>

1456
01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:37.260
<v Speaker 5>but you have to let that image of </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfection go and that exposes you.</v>

1457
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:39.330
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what happens here.</v>

1458
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:44.480
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio goes home and he wants things </v>

1459
01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:48.261
<v Speaker 5>to be the way they were and he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 5>stay under the careful care of the </v>

1460
01:20:48.261 --> 01:20:51.090
<v Speaker 5>benevolent father,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's no longer possible.</v>

1461
01:20:51.091 --> 01:20:56.091
<v Speaker 5>He's past that point and that's why the </v>
<v Speaker 5>father has disappeared and so Japan has </v>

1462
01:20:57.031 --> 01:21:00.020
<v Speaker 5>gone off to look for Pinocchio because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he also needs the sun.</v>

1463
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:03.150
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in any case,</v>

1464
01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:08.151
<v Speaker 5>the house is abandoned and so then we </v>
<v Speaker 5>see inside the house that everything's </v>

1465
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 5>covered with cobwebs and everything's </v>
<v Speaker 5>gone in Pinocchio and the cricket sit on</v>

1466
01:21:12.661 --> 01:21:14.160
<v Speaker 5>the steps and they're very concerned.</v>

1467
01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.870
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wonder where he went.</v>

1468
01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.790
<v Speaker 5>So they're actually concerned that he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>gone,</v>

1469
01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:21.180
<v Speaker 5>but they also don't know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's just no going home.</v>

1470
01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:22.640
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1471
01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.000
<v Speaker 5>that's also the case that once you hit a</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain point in your development,</v>

1472
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:33.050
<v Speaker 5>well it's the same thing we already </v>
<v Speaker 5>talked about the answers that you're </v>

1473
01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:34.050
<v Speaker 5>looking for are not going to be found in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your parents house.</v>

1474
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:37.560
<v Speaker 5>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you could artificially maintain your</v>

1475
01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.260
<v Speaker 5>dependency,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1476
01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.720
<v Speaker 5>if you do that for too long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things get pretty ugly.</v>

1477
01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.470
<v Speaker 5>So you get pretty stale and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1478
01:21:46.471 --> 01:21:48.720
<v Speaker 5>you're like bread that's been on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>shelf for too long.</v>

1479
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.680
<v Speaker 5>So now they're wondering what to do and </v>
<v Speaker 5>where he could be.</v>

1480
01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:55.050
<v Speaker 5>And then there's something very strange </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens.</v>

1481
01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:00.080
<v Speaker 5>The star shows up again and it turns </v>
<v Speaker 5>into a dove and the dove flies down and </v>

1482
01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:06.200
<v Speaker 5>puts a piece of paper bathed in light </v>
<v Speaker 5>with gold writing on it in front of the </v>

1483
01:22:10.831 --> 01:22:14.790
<v Speaker 5>cricket and the puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what in the world's going on there?</v>

1484
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:16.680
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know what the star is.</v>

1485
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:18.120
<v Speaker 5>We've seen it multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1486
01:22:18.121 --> 01:22:21.420
<v Speaker 5>It's also the place that the blue fairy </v>
<v Speaker 5>came from,</v>

1487
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.840
<v Speaker 5>but it's this transcendent place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this place that occurs sort of as </v>

1488
01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.210
<v Speaker 5>the ultimate ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this time it delivers a message.</v>

1489
01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:32.220
<v Speaker 5>So what's happening here is</v>

1490
01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:41.080
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio is fundamentally oriented by </v>
<v Speaker 5>the wish that his father made so long </v>

1491
01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:41.150
<v Speaker 5>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1492
01:22:41.151 --> 01:22:44.450
<v Speaker 5>And the wish was that he would become a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fully functioning individual.</v>

1493
01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:50.320
<v Speaker 5>And so that's that transcendent place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And young would say when you,</v>

1494
01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:59.600
<v Speaker 5>when you orient your vision,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different things appear to you in the </v>

1495
01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.691
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So and I mean this literally so because </v>

1496
01:23:02.691 --> 01:23:07.150
<v Speaker 5>you can't see everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your vision calculates what's necessary.</v>

1497
01:23:07.151 --> 01:23:12.151
<v Speaker 5>Your brain calculates what's necessary </v>
<v Speaker 5>for you to see so that you get to the </v>

1498
01:23:12.151 --> 01:23:13.420
<v Speaker 5>point that you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't mean that metaphorically.</v>

1499
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:18.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean it literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Things that aren't relevant to what </v>

1500
01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:23.511
<v Speaker 5>you're seeking won't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You won't see them unless they get in </v>

1501
01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:29.751
<v Speaker 5>your way and they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to really block your pathway </v>

1502
01:23:29.751 --> 01:23:33.891
<v Speaker 5>before there'll be literally visible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you orient yourself towards something</v>

1503
01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 5>and that makes some things visible that </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't be visible.</v>

1504
01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:40.240
<v Speaker 5>It makes other things invisible that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>might've seen.</v>

1505
01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:45.540
<v Speaker 5>And so when you change your orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what manifests itself in the world also </v>

1506
01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:48.640
<v Speaker 5>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know Pinocchio is in despair here.</v>

1507
01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:53.800
<v Speaker 5>And he asks himself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where could my father have gone?</v>

1508
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:59.790
<v Speaker 5>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what exactly is he asking under those </v>

1509
01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:02.650
<v Speaker 5>circumstances?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what he's asking is something like,</v>

1510
01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:09.630
<v Speaker 5>I had a structure that was orienting me </v>
<v Speaker 5>properly in relationship to the world</v>

1511
01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:14.980
<v Speaker 5>and as far as it was embodied in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>actual father,</v>

1512
01:24:14.981 --> 01:24:19.981
<v Speaker 5>it's now gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there any possibility that I can find</v>

1513
01:24:20.441 --> 01:24:22.870
<v Speaker 5>that again?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that is what you want.</v>

1514
01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:25.000
<v Speaker 5>You see like if you're in a chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumstance,</v>

1515
01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:30.001
<v Speaker 5>maybe you've escaped,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say from a bad relationship or </v>

1516
01:24:30.001 --> 01:24:30.001
<v Speaker 5>something like that and you're out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1517
01:24:30.001 --> 01:24:34.531
<v Speaker 5>but now you don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you're hoping is that you can get </v>

1518
01:24:35.021 --> 01:24:37.300
<v Speaker 5>your life back together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1519
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.730
<v Speaker 5>That you can put the pieces that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>fallen apart,</v>

1520
01:24:39.731 --> 01:24:44.731
<v Speaker 5>back together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so you're automatically going to </v>

1521
01:24:44.731 --> 01:24:44.770
<v Speaker 5>generate a fantasy about producing </v>
<v Speaker 5>another.</v>

1522
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:49.980
<v Speaker 5>Let's call it stable state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be looking for this </v>

1523
01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:52.741
<v Speaker 5>spirit that would enable that stable </v>
<v Speaker 5>state to be generated because really </v>

1524
01:24:52.741 --> 01:24:53.380
<v Speaker 5>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in some senses,</v>

1525
01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:56.140
<v Speaker 5>your new personality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in chaos.</v>

1526
01:24:56.141 --> 01:24:58.720
<v Speaker 5>You have to become something new in </v>
<v Speaker 5>order to get out of chaos.</v>

1527
01:24:58.721 --> 01:25:01.570
<v Speaker 5>And so you're hoping for that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're hoping that you'll see it,</v>

1528
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:03.010
<v Speaker 5>and so</v>

1529
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:08.480
<v Speaker 5>that's going to make certain things </v>
<v Speaker 5>visible to you.</v>

1530
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:13.550
<v Speaker 5>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the proper way of thinking about </v>

1531
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.550
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1532
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:15.380
<v Speaker 5>when you get curious about something and</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you're curious about something and</v>

1533
01:25:15.381 --> 01:25:20.381
<v Speaker 5>you walk into a bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that curiosity is going to guide you to </v>

1534
01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:23.951
<v Speaker 5>a certain set of books.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that you have the question in </v>

1535
01:25:23.951 --> 01:25:25.580
<v Speaker 5>mind is going to open your eyes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain kinds of possibilities.</v>

1536
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000
<v Speaker 5>And so if your goal is to reestablish </v>
<v Speaker 5>your union with the positive father,</v>

1537
01:25:31.341 --> 01:25:36.341
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then certain things are going to appear </v>

1538
01:25:36.341 --> 01:25:37.280
<v Speaker 5>in other things aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's really what this represents.</v>

1539
01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:42.620
<v Speaker 5>A transcendent star is the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is this developmental process.</v>

1540
01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.930
<v Speaker 5>It's capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1541
01:25:44.931 --> 01:25:49.931
<v Speaker 5>delivering a message to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some sense that's what's happening when </v>

1542
01:25:49.931 --> 01:25:49.970
<v Speaker 5>you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1543
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:52.340
<v Speaker 5>because you have a problem you want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>solve,</v>

1544
01:25:52.341 --> 01:25:54.200
<v Speaker 5>you have somewhere you want to go with </v>
<v Speaker 5>your thoughts,</v>

1545
01:25:54.201 --> 01:25:59.201
<v Speaker 5>and as a consequence of that information</v>
<v Speaker 5>reveals itself to you.</v>

1546
01:25:59.330 --> 01:26:02.390
<v Speaker 5>In the interior landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very strange thing.</v>

1547
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:08.230
<v Speaker 5>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it feels as if you're producing the </v>

1548
01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:08.450
<v Speaker 5>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it could equally be said that you're</v>

1549
01:26:08.451 --> 01:26:13.451
<v Speaker 5>watching the thoughts revealed </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves and which of those is the </v>

1550
01:26:13.451 --> 01:26:14.360
<v Speaker 5>more accurate description is by no means</v>
<v Speaker 5>obvious.</v>

1551
01:26:14.361 --> 01:26:16.790
<v Speaker 5>You can certainly have thoughts that </v>
<v Speaker 5>surprise you,</v>

1552
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.820
<v Speaker 5>which is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're your thoughts.</v>

1553
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:23.780
<v Speaker 5>How in the world can they surprise you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they do so it's like you didn't know</v>

1554
01:26:23.781 --> 01:26:25.880
<v Speaker 5>them before you thought them up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then the question is,</v>

1555
01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:26.840
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where did they come from?</v>

1556
01:26:26.841 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 5>If you didn't know them before you </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought them up,</v>

1557
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:32.780
<v Speaker 5>they sort of spring out of the void.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

1558
01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:38.250
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a holy ghost symbol.</v>

1559
01:26:38.251 --> 01:26:43.251
<v Speaker 5>This dove as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that puts some Christian imagery in </v>

1560
01:26:43.251 --> 01:26:43.251
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1561
01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:48.010
<v Speaker 5>you could think of it as a manifestation</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the spirit of transformation.</v>

1562
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:50.020
<v Speaker 5>That's another way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyways.</v>

1563
01:26:50.110 --> 01:26:52.240
<v Speaker 5>It's the conscience that interprets the </v>
<v Speaker 5>letter,</v>

1564
01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:55.180
<v Speaker 5>so it's sort of figuring out what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>next thing should be,</v>

1565
01:26:55.181 --> 01:27:00.181
<v Speaker 5>and weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the letter says is that Japan was </v>

1566
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:03.580
<v Speaker 5>out looking for Pinocchio and he got </v>
<v Speaker 5>swallowed by a whale,</v>

1567
01:27:03.970 --> 01:27:08.520
<v Speaker 5>which makes very little sense to put it </v>
<v Speaker 5>bluntly.</v>

1568
01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.240
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to search for Pinocchio and now </v>

1569
01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.180
<v Speaker 5>he's at the bottom of the sea in a giant</v>
<v Speaker 5>whale and</v>

1570
01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:23.060
<v Speaker 5>we bright over that tremendous gap in </v>
<v Speaker 5>logic and follow the story nonetheless.</v>

1571
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.600
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what's the idea here?</v>

1572
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:32.410
<v Speaker 5>The idea is that if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you fall into a chaotic state and </v>

1573
01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:36.251
<v Speaker 5>everything falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the possibility that</v>

1574
01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:44.630
<v Speaker 5>things can come back together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including what you've just learned in a </v>

1575
01:27:46.291 --> 01:27:51.291
<v Speaker 5>new state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so you can conceptualize that </v>

1576
01:27:51.291 --> 01:27:54.441
<v Speaker 5>symbolically as the existence of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dead father at the bottom of the,</v>

1577
01:27:56.490 --> 01:27:58.320
<v Speaker 5>of the chaotic landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

1578
01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:01.080
<v Speaker 5>That's the proper way as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell,</v>

1579
01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:06.100
<v Speaker 5>to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's something down there </v>

1580
01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:06.420
<v Speaker 5>that's capable of reforming and </v>
<v Speaker 5>reemerging.</v>

1581
01:28:06.421 --> 01:28:10.590
<v Speaker 5>That's that incorporates the previous </v>
<v Speaker 5>state,</v>

1582
01:28:10.591 --> 01:28:15.591
<v Speaker 5>but that takes it farther and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to find that unless you descend </v>

1583
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:19.681
<v Speaker 5>into this chaotic place where it feels </v>
<v Speaker 5>like all order is gone while you </v>

1584
01:28:19.681 --> 01:28:24.561
<v Speaker 5>generate order.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be akin to the order that </v>

1585
01:28:24.561 --> 01:28:26.841
<v Speaker 5>you had before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's going to be something new </v>

1586
01:28:26.841 --> 01:28:28.701
<v Speaker 5>about it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's down to the bottom of the </v>

1587
01:28:28.701 --> 01:28:30.861
<v Speaker 5>chaotic state to bring up what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>missing and that's one level of </v>

1588
01:28:32.701 --> 01:28:34.680
<v Speaker 5>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another level of analysis you think is,</v>

1589
01:28:34.681 --> 01:28:35.910
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's also what you're doing.</v>

1590
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:41.390
<v Speaker 5>That's what you should be doing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>principle when you're going to </v>

1591
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.750
<v Speaker 5>university,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you're.</v>

1592
01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:46.070
<v Speaker 5>You come to university in roughly the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same status.</v>

1593
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:51.100
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you're a bit of a puppet and </v>

1594
01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:51.420
<v Speaker 5>you're kind of a jackass and what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hell do you know?</v>

1595
01:28:51.690 --> 01:28:55.230
<v Speaker 5>And it's chaotic because you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>found your place in the world properly.</v>

1596
01:28:55.470 --> 01:29:00.470
<v Speaker 5>And I don't mean merely for career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that that's not relevant because it </v>

1597
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:01.680
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's more than that.</v>

1598
01:29:01.681 --> 01:29:06.681
<v Speaker 5>It's because you're a historical </v>
<v Speaker 5>creature because you are a product of </v>

1599
01:29:06.681 --> 01:29:11.091
<v Speaker 5>history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless you are inculturated properly,</v>

1600
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:16.160
<v Speaker 5>which means you understand your past and</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the sense that the humanities can </v>

1601
01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:18.340
<v Speaker 5>allow for that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then</v>

1602
01:29:20.710 --> 01:29:25.710
<v Speaker 5>you haven't been able to incorporate the</v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom of your ancestors into your day </v>

1603
01:29:26.891 --> 01:29:29.050
<v Speaker 5>to day pursuits and that's gonna make </v>
<v Speaker 5>you weak.</v>

1604
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:32.440
<v Speaker 5>That's the idea anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so when you come to university,</v>

1605
01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:37.740
<v Speaker 5>this is what university is for it so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can go into the chaos and you </v>

1606
01:29:39.191 --> 01:29:44.191
<v Speaker 5>can pull something out of it that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>truly a value and you can incorporate </v>

1607
01:29:44.191 --> 01:29:45.790
<v Speaker 5>that in your own personality and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes you much,</v>

1608
01:29:45.791 --> 01:29:49.000
<v Speaker 5>much stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like literally stronger.</v>

1609
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:53.590
<v Speaker 5>Not more educated but not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you know more facts.</v>

1610
01:29:54.150 --> 01:29:59.150
<v Speaker 5>It's that you literally are a better </v>
<v Speaker 5>person and better means you can do far </v>

1611
01:29:59.150 --> 01:29:59.790
<v Speaker 5>more things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can articulate your.</v>

1612
01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:04.960
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's something that's of crucial </v>

1613
01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:04.960
<v Speaker 5>importance is that you can articulate </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself properly,</v>

1614
01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.930
<v Speaker 5>which is more useful than anything else </v>
<v Speaker 5>you could possibly manage.</v>

1615
01:30:07.931 --> 01:30:12.931
<v Speaker 5>Like if you guys come out of university </v>
<v Speaker 5>capable of making coherent arguments and</v>

1616
01:30:14.621 --> 01:30:18.790
<v Speaker 5>using language properly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're so powerful that it's ridiculous.</v>

1617
01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:20.860
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you always,</v>

1618
01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:28.100
<v Speaker 5>you can lay out a strategy and pursue it</v>
<v Speaker 5>successfully and maybe the strategy is </v>

1619
01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.010
<v Speaker 5>actually oriented towards something </v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

1620
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:34.040
<v Speaker 5>Something that will actually work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>work for you and work for other people </v>

1621
01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.040
<v Speaker 5>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't really understand why people</v>

1622
01:30:35.041 --> 01:30:37.340
<v Speaker 5>aren't taught,</v>
<v Speaker 5>told this when they come to university,</v>

1623
01:30:37.341 --> 01:30:42.341
<v Speaker 5>is that your goal is to make yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 5>articulate in writing and thinking and </v>

1624
01:30:44.851 --> 01:30:49.851
<v Speaker 5>speaking as you possibly can because </v>
<v Speaker 5>that opens the door to everything that </v>

1625
01:30:49.851 --> 01:30:52.470
<v Speaker 5>you'll want to do in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No matter what it is,</v>

1626
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:58.070
<v Speaker 5>the more articulate person always rises </v>
<v Speaker 5>always because they lay out strategies </v>

1627
01:31:02.911 --> 01:31:07.911
<v Speaker 5>more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They they lay out the reasons for doing </v>

1628
01:31:07.911 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 5>something or for not doing something </v>
<v Speaker 5>more particularly.</v>

1629
01:31:09.121 --> 01:31:14.121
<v Speaker 5>They convinced people and properly so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they can grapple with potentials </v>

1630
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:21.350
<v Speaker 5>that lies ahead effectively and they can</v>
<v Speaker 5>defend themselves when they're </v>

1631
01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:26.570
<v Speaker 5>challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so all of that is going into the </v>

1632
01:31:27.241 --> 01:31:29.310
<v Speaker 5>past,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the chaos of the past.</v>

1633
01:31:29.311 --> 01:31:34.311
<v Speaker 5>You could even say and pulling up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>spirit that inhabits that from the </v>

1634
01:31:34.311 --> 01:31:37.650
<v Speaker 5>bottom and uniting with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't do that well,</v>

1635
01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:45.520
<v Speaker 5>you're defenseless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the case of in the face of the </v>

1636
01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:49.031
<v Speaker 5>tragedy of life and and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then that's not so good because if </v>

1637
01:31:49.191 --> 01:31:51.890
<v Speaker 5>you're defenseless in the face of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tragedy of life,</v>

1638
01:31:52.190 --> 01:31:57.190
<v Speaker 5>then you get way more hurt than you </v>
<v Speaker 5>would otherwise get and some of the </v>

1639
01:31:57.190 --> 01:32:00.401
<v Speaker 5>people around you and then the </v>
<v Speaker 5>probability that you're going to be </v>

1640
01:32:00.401 --> 01:32:03.281
<v Speaker 5>resentful and about that is really high </v>
<v Speaker 5>because no one likes to fail continually</v>

1641
01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:10.080
<v Speaker 5>and then you get bitter and resentful </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then once you're bitter and </v>

1642
01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:10.150
<v Speaker 5>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well being,</v>

1643
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:12.820
<v Speaker 5>being vengeful and mean is the next </v>
<v Speaker 5>step.</v>

1644
01:32:13.290 --> 01:32:17.380
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't take much of a transformation</v>
<v Speaker 5>to move you from place to the next.</v>

1645
01:32:18.970 --> 01:32:23.970
<v Speaker 5>So now Pinocchio has to face the thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he's afraid of most and that's a </v>

1646
01:32:25.271 --> 01:32:26.080
<v Speaker 5>complicated</v>

1647
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:32.450
<v Speaker 5>idea as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you had this phrase that he liked,</v>

1648
01:32:32.451 --> 01:32:37.451
<v Speaker 5>that he took from the alchemists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was in stir wiliness infinite </v>

1649
01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:38.810
<v Speaker 5>tour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what it meant was what you most want</v>

1650
01:32:38.811 --> 01:32:41.060
<v Speaker 5>to find will be found where you least </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to look.</v>

1651
01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:44.540
<v Speaker 5>There's this old story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's from King Arthur.</v>

1652
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:46.400
<v Speaker 5>King Arthur has these nights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1653
01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:49.670
<v Speaker 5>They all sit around a round table,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means they're roughly equal.</v>

1654
01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:54.730
<v Speaker 5>That's what the round table means and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're off to find the holy grail and </v>

1655
01:32:54.730 --> 01:32:56.540
<v Speaker 5>the holy grail is the most valuable </v>
<v Speaker 5>object that that's what it means.</v>

1656
01:32:56.690 --> 01:32:58.850
<v Speaker 5>So they're off to find the most valuable</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

1657
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.040
<v Speaker 5>but they don't know what it is and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know where it is,</v>

1658
01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.460
<v Speaker 5>but they know that there's a most </v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable thing.</v>

1659
01:33:03.461 --> 01:33:08.461
<v Speaker 5>So in some sense it's akin to them </v>
<v Speaker 5>orienting themselves by the star and </v>

1660
01:33:08.461 --> 01:33:12.221
<v Speaker 5>they don't know where to look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what they decide is they have the</v>

1661
01:33:12.711 --> 01:33:14.240
<v Speaker 5>castle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the middle of a forest.</v>

1662
01:33:14.241 --> 01:33:19.241
<v Speaker 5>And so each night decides to start </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking for the holy grail by entering </v>

1663
01:33:19.241 --> 01:33:20.600
<v Speaker 5>the forest at the point that looks </v>
<v Speaker 5>darkest to him.</v>

1664
01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.900
<v Speaker 5>And so what's the idea there?</v>

1665
01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:32.200
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine there are things that come easy </v>

1666
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.791
<v Speaker 5>to you and that you're fond of pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that you're happy about pursuing.</v>

1667
01:33:33.831 --> 01:33:37.730
<v Speaker 5>So you found those and pursued them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've mastered them.</v>

1668
01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:43.480
<v Speaker 5>So you know all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there's another place that you </v>

1669
01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:46.961
<v Speaker 5>don't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you haven't gone there and you </v>

1670
01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:50.021
<v Speaker 5>haven't mastered it and you're a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>small in comparison to it because you </v>

1671
01:33:50.021 --> 01:33:54.341
<v Speaker 5>haven't mastered it and so it has this </v>
<v Speaker 5>monstrous aspect and but it has if what </v>

1672
01:33:55.761 --> 01:33:59.930
<v Speaker 5>you're working where you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if what you're doing isn't working,</v>

1673
01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:03.260
<v Speaker 5>it's where you haven't gone that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>need to go.</v>

1674
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:06.080
<v Speaker 5>And so I can give you another example of</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1675
01:34:06.081 --> 01:34:11.081
<v Speaker 5>So let's say you're an agreeable person </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so you don't like conflict and you </v>

1676
01:34:12.321 --> 01:34:17.321
<v Speaker 5>won't stand up for yourself and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>regard anger and the proclivity to </v>

1677
01:34:17.321 --> 01:34:21.110
<v Speaker 5>provoke and to engage in conflict as </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's positively terrible.</v>

1678
01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.940
<v Speaker 5>It's not only that you're not good at </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1679
01:34:22.941 --> 01:34:27.080
<v Speaker 5>it's actually that it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's where you have to go.</v>

1680
01:34:27.081 --> 01:34:32.081
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to learn how to stand up</v>
<v Speaker 5>for yourself and imagine that you're </v>

1681
01:34:32.081 --> 01:34:35.411
<v Speaker 5>afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you have something like Agora </v>

1682
01:34:35.411 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 5>Phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's a whole bunch of things </v>

1683
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 5>that you're afraid of and you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 5>to go there.</v>

1684
01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.920
<v Speaker 5>But if you want to put yourself </v>
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>

1685
01:34:39.921 --> 01:34:41.900
<v Speaker 5>then that's exactly where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>go.</v>

1686
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:47.120
<v Speaker 5>And so it's frequently the case that </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you want to find is to be found</v>

1687
01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.760
<v Speaker 5>were you least want to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that idea is echoed in the</v>

1688
01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:59.000
<v Speaker 5>prominent stories of dragons and gold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's exactly the same idea,</v>

1689
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.160
<v Speaker 5>is that the dragon is this terrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1690
01:35:01.161 --> 01:35:04.220
<v Speaker 5>It's this terrible predatory thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>lives forever and is very,</v>

1691
01:35:04.221 --> 01:35:08.300
<v Speaker 5>very wise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It lives underground and it'll kill you,</v>

1692
01:35:08.301 --> 01:35:12.470
<v Speaker 5>it'll burn you up in a second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it hoards gold,</v>

1693
01:35:13.330 --> 01:35:18.330
<v Speaker 5>and so you have to go there into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dragon's layer if you're going to get </v>

1694
01:35:18.330 --> 01:35:21.161
<v Speaker 5>the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's a representation of people's </v>

1695
01:35:21.161 --> 01:35:24.430
<v Speaker 5>paradoxical relationship with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you have to go out there and </v>

1696
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:26.870
<v Speaker 5>confronted in order to incorporate what </v>
<v Speaker 5>it has to offer to you,</v>

1697
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:32.350
<v Speaker 5>but the probability that that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be intensely dangerous and push you </v>

1698
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:34.040
<v Speaker 5>right to the limit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1699
01:35:34.041 --> 01:35:37.730
<v Speaker 5>those are actually the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it didn't push you to the limit,</v>

1700
01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:39.740
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't gain anything valuable from</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1701
01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:45.580
<v Speaker 5>So you don't get one without the other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't get the gold without the </v>

1702
01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:46.490
<v Speaker 5>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a very strange,</v>

1703
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:47.930
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very strange idea,</v>

1704
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:53.600
<v Speaker 5>but it seems to be accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so all of that's lurking underneath this</v>

1705
01:35:53.601 --> 01:35:58.370
<v Speaker 5>in this imagery of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing that's at the bottom of now,</v>

1706
01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:01.790
<v Speaker 5>the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can think of the story of Jonah.</v>

1707
01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 5>What happens with Jonah is that roughly </v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking,</v>

1708
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:10.630
<v Speaker 5>he's a prophet and God tells him that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>has to,</v>

1709
01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:15.640
<v Speaker 5>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God tells them in the house to go to </v>

1710
01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:16.640
<v Speaker 5>this city and straighten it out because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

1711
01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:21.770
<v Speaker 5>It's veered off the path and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's heading towards doom and Jonah </v>

1712
01:36:21.921 --> 01:36:26.921
<v Speaker 5>thinks I'm not going to that city to </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell those people anything like that </v>

1713
01:36:26.921 --> 01:36:30.221
<v Speaker 5>because they're not going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 5>happy with me just showing up there and </v>

1714
01:36:30.221 --> 01:36:33.440
<v Speaker 5>telling them everything they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong and so he hops on a boat and tries</v>

1715
01:36:33.441 --> 01:36:37.520
<v Speaker 5>to get out of there and then God </v>
<v Speaker 5>conjures up this huge storm and the boat</v>

1716
01:36:37.521 --> 01:36:42.521
<v Speaker 5>is about to be swamped and the sailors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're worried about making the boat </v>

1717
01:36:43.851 --> 01:36:45.080
<v Speaker 5>lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>

1718
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:50.410
<v Speaker 5>They all draw a lot to see who gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>tossed overboard and Jonah admits that </v>

1719
01:36:50.410 --> 01:36:55.001
<v Speaker 5>it's actually his fault because God's </v>
<v Speaker 5>upset with him because he got this </v>

1720
01:36:55.001 --> 01:36:58.031
<v Speaker 5>direct command to go straighten out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>city and he ran off and so the sailors </v>

1721
01:36:58.031 --> 01:36:59.360
<v Speaker 5>throat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not happy about this,</v>

1722
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:04.361
<v Speaker 5>but they throw Jonah overboard and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>CS and great fish comes up and swallows </v>

1723
01:37:04.361 --> 01:37:09.041
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then he's down in the fish for three </v>

1724
01:37:09.041 --> 01:37:10.010
<v Speaker 5>days and it throws up on the dry land </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he's learned his lesson by that</v>

1725
01:37:10.011 --> 01:37:15.011
<v Speaker 5>time and he goes off to have this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pursue the proper destiny to pursue his </v>

1726
01:37:15.011 --> 01:37:17.090
<v Speaker 5>proper destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's echoed in this story as well,</v>

1727
01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:18.030
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

1728
01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:23.950
<v Speaker 5>if you don't follow the pathway that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to follow,</v>

1729
01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:30.840
<v Speaker 5>that this cs will become stormy for you </v>
<v Speaker 5>and something will come up and pull you </v>

1730
01:37:31.281 --> 01:37:36.281
<v Speaker 5>down and you'll be in a terrible place </v>
<v Speaker 5>for some length of time until you learn </v>

1731
01:37:36.281 --> 01:37:40.391
<v Speaker 5>your lesson and if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll get spit back up on shore and </v>

1732
01:37:40.391 --> 01:37:41.210
<v Speaker 5>then you can go do what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1733
01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's not less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody needs to have interpreted.</v>

1734
01:37:44.451 --> 01:37:49.190
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody understands that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

1735
01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 5>the Cricket Tells Pinocchio what he has </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do and then something of paradoxical </v>

1736
01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.981
<v Speaker 5>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio decides he's going to go do </v>

1737
01:38:00.981 --> 01:38:03.561
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the cricket is got this weird </v>

1738
01:38:03.561 --> 01:38:03.930
<v Speaker 5>paradoxical response to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On the one hand,</v>

1739
01:38:03.931 --> 01:38:06.180
<v Speaker 5>he's he sort pulling Pinocchio back </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

1740
01:38:06.181 --> 01:38:06.870
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1741
01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:11.460
<v Speaker 5>this is foolhardy that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>go all the way down to the ocean.</v>

1742
01:38:11.461 --> 01:38:13.140
<v Speaker 5>You're going to confront this terrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>whale.</v>

1743
01:38:13.141 --> 01:38:14.640
<v Speaker 5>This is really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really dangerous,</v>

1744
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:18.660
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time when Pinocchio is </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the edge of the cliff,</v>

1745
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.490
<v Speaker 5>the cricket helps him tie his tail </v>
<v Speaker 5>around a rock and he.</v>

1746
01:38:22.690 --> 01:38:25.860
<v Speaker 5>He holds his finger in place so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio can tie the knot.</v>

1747
01:38:25.861 --> 01:38:28.680
<v Speaker 5>It's like the conscience is conflicted </v>
<v Speaker 5>about this.</v>

1748
01:38:28.681 --> 01:38:33.681
<v Speaker 5>It's really dangerous and foolhardy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also necessary and so he plays </v>

1749
01:38:33.681 --> 01:38:35.850
<v Speaker 5>this dual role,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Pinocchio is leading at this point,</v>

1750
01:38:35.851 --> 01:38:37.560
<v Speaker 5>so into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1751
01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:47.230
<v Speaker 5>I guess partly what this means is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're not oriented properly in the </v>

1752
01:38:47.230 --> 01:38:50.471
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should take your doubts and you </v>

1753
01:38:50.471 --> 01:38:50.690
<v Speaker 5>should take your doubts and the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're involved in.</v>

1754
01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:53.810
<v Speaker 5>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he should face it and think it through.</v>

1755
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:58.870
<v Speaker 5>You should go into it as far as you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>go into it because maybe you'll find </v>

1756
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:59.210
<v Speaker 5>something at the bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1757
01:38:59.211 --> 01:39:01.430
<v Speaker 5>the alternative is to pretend that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't exist,</v>

1758
01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:09.380
<v Speaker 5>so then Pinocchio is at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the water.</v>

1759
01:39:09.381 --> 01:39:11.300
<v Speaker 5>He can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can actually breathe down there.</v>

1760
01:39:11.301 --> 01:39:14.240
<v Speaker 5>It turns out so you could think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's gone into the unknown.</v>

1761
01:39:14.241 --> 01:39:18.170
<v Speaker 5>He's outside of dry land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's in the unconscious.</v>

1762
01:39:18.171 --> 01:39:22.970
<v Speaker 5>All of those things are true and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>might think,</v>

1763
01:39:22.971 --> 01:39:27.971
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would it be the world outside of </v>

1764
01:39:27.971 --> 01:39:28.310
<v Speaker 5>what's known and the unconscious at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same time,</v>

1765
01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.940
<v Speaker 5>this weird intermingling of those two </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and as far as I can tell,</v>

1766
01:39:31.941 --> 01:39:32.530
<v Speaker 5>that's because</v>

1767
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:36.920
<v Speaker 5>when you're in chaos and you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on,</v>

1768
01:39:36.921 --> 01:39:41.921
<v Speaker 5>then you start imagining what might be </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on and that imagination is partly </v>

1769
01:39:41.991 --> 01:39:46.991
<v Speaker 5>the world as it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also partly the structure of </v>

1770
01:39:46.991 --> 01:39:48.410
<v Speaker 5>your unconscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is producing the fantasies.</v>

1771
01:39:48.890 --> 01:39:53.890
<v Speaker 5>And so when you're truly in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the distinction between your </v>

1772
01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:56.150
<v Speaker 5>fantasies and reality isn't clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's actually part of what constitutes</v>

1773
01:39:56.151 --> 01:39:58.340
<v Speaker 5>the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So imagine this,</v>

1774
01:39:58.341 --> 01:40:03.341
<v Speaker 5>so you're in a relationship and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person betrays you and you knew who they</v>

1775
01:40:04.251 --> 01:40:06.380
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least you thought you did before that</v>

1776
01:40:06.381 --> 01:40:11.381
<v Speaker 5>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now you're looking at them and you </v>

1777
01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:15.731
<v Speaker 5>don't know who they are and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know what the past was and you don't </v>

1778
01:40:15.731 --> 01:40:17.660
<v Speaker 5>know what the present is and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know what the future's going to be.</v>

1779
01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:21.710
<v Speaker 5>All of that's been thrown up into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>air in a major way that's traumatic.</v>

1780
01:40:21.711 --> 01:40:24.260
<v Speaker 5>So much has fallen apart that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>traumatic.</v>

1781
01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.800
<v Speaker 5>So what do you start to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You start to imagine what might be the </v>

1782
01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.150
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then the reality,</v>

1783
01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:33.970
<v Speaker 5>the reality is your imagination and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality.</v>

1784
01:40:33.971 --> 01:40:35.980
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not pulled apart at all.</v>

1785
01:40:35.981 --> 01:40:37.870
<v Speaker 5>You cannot distinguish between them.</v>

1786
01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:40.240
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

1787
01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:47.560
<v Speaker 5>it was a young an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could say that's the snitch that Harry</v>

1788
01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:48.640
<v Speaker 5>Potter is chasing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

1789
01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.110
<v Speaker 5>I know what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a terrible leap,</v>

1790
01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:55.620
<v Speaker 5>but that is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that weird intermingling potential </v>

1791
01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:59.470
<v Speaker 5>in reality that that can manifest itself</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the world if you pursue it.</v>

1792
01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:05.040
<v Speaker 5>It's roughly that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Pinocchio is in this situation that's</v>

1793
01:41:05.461 --> 01:41:09.030
<v Speaker 5>half fantasy and half reality in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>chaotic state,</v>

1794
01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:11.640
<v Speaker 5>and he had us to go down to find the </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that he leased,</v>

1795
01:41:11.641 --> 01:41:14.220
<v Speaker 5>wants to find,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's hoping that it.</v>

1796
01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:17.520
<v Speaker 5>He's got this intuition that in facing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing,</v>

1797
01:41:17.521 --> 01:41:20.310
<v Speaker 5>that chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that life really is that chaos,</v>

1798
01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:24.720
<v Speaker 5>that he's going to find his father and </v>
<v Speaker 5>reunite with them.</v>

1799
01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:32.030
<v Speaker 5>So you could also say that in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a decision of faith,</v>

1800
01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:33.740
<v Speaker 5>I suppose because</v>

1801
01:41:35.630 --> 01:41:36.620
<v Speaker 5>you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1802
01:41:36.621 --> 01:41:39.830
<v Speaker 5>why bother confronted chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chaos is the ultimate reality.</v>

1803
01:41:39.831 --> 01:41:44.831
<v Speaker 5>Then what the hell uses they're in </v>
<v Speaker 5>facing it because it's just going to </v>

1804
01:41:44.831 --> 01:41:46.700
<v Speaker 5>reveal itself as the ultimate reality </v>
<v Speaker 5>and drown you,</v>

1805
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:49.460
<v Speaker 5>but the myths always say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>

1806
01:41:49.461 --> 01:41:49.820
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1807
01:41:49.821 --> 01:41:51.890
<v Speaker 5>If you confront what's really disturbing</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1808
01:41:51.891 --> 01:41:54.050
<v Speaker 5>if you really confronted you do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>voluntarily,</v>

1809
01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:56.120
<v Speaker 5>you're going to find order in it </v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually,</v>

1810
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:59.120
<v Speaker 5>or at least that's the only way you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to find order.</v>

1811
01:41:59.450 --> 01:42:04.450
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like these stories are </v>

1812
01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:05.210
<v Speaker 5>optimistic and it's not as if they give </v>
<v Speaker 5>you a sure guide to success.</v>

1813
01:42:05.211 --> 01:42:10.211
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they're unerringly </v>

1814
01:42:10.211 --> 01:42:12.880
<v Speaker 5>accurate because you can be subsumed by </v>
<v Speaker 5>chaos that so total that even if you </v>

1815
01:42:14.421 --> 01:42:16.880
<v Speaker 5>face it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to prevail.</v>

1816
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:19.220
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why people die.</v>

1817
01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:24.170
<v Speaker 5>That's one way of looking at it anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the mythology basically says this is</v>

1818
01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:29.171
<v Speaker 5>your best bet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there is a process that's going to </v>

1819
01:42:29.171 --> 01:42:29.450
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is it,</v>

1820
01:42:30.690 --> 01:42:32.700
<v Speaker 5>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you might think,</v>

1821
01:42:32.701 --> 01:42:33.630
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the better you do it,</v>

1822
01:42:33.631 --> 01:42:37.590
<v Speaker 5>the better the chance of success,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or the more consistently you do it,</v>

1823
01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:42.980
<v Speaker 5>the better the chances of success are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that that's a perfectly </v>

1824
01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:42.980
<v Speaker 5>reasonable way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1825
01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:47.691
<v Speaker 5>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio's down at the bottom of the </v>

1826
01:42:47.691 --> 01:42:50.100
<v Speaker 5>ocean and every time he says he's trying</v>
<v Speaker 5>to find out where monster is</v>

1827
01:42:51.490 --> 01:42:53.740
<v Speaker 5>and they ask questions to the fish that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are down there,</v>

1828
01:42:53.741 --> 01:42:57.370
<v Speaker 5>but every time they mentioned monster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's name all the fish disappeared.</v>

1829
01:42:58.130 --> 01:42:59.470
<v Speaker 5>It's like Voldemort,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1830
01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:03.820
<v Speaker 5>He's the guy whose name you cannot say </v>
<v Speaker 5>and monster we is precisely that.</v>

1831
01:43:03.821 --> 01:43:08.821
<v Speaker 5>It's the thing that frightens everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so asking questions down there isn't</v>

1832
01:43:10.481 --> 01:43:12.160
<v Speaker 5>helping very much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Pinocchio,</v>

1833
01:43:12.161 --> 01:43:17.161
<v Speaker 5>what he does is he's calling for his </v>
<v Speaker 5>father and he keeps going deeper and </v>

1834
01:43:17.161 --> 01:43:18.820
<v Speaker 5>deeper into the depths and we're in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>scene.</v>

1835
01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:19.840
<v Speaker 5>There's a scene where</v>

1836
01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:26.740
<v Speaker 5>the darkness of the ocean turns into an </v>
<v Speaker 5>even more profound darkness and that's </v>

1837
01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:27.260
<v Speaker 5>what okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well disappears into.</v>

1838
01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:31.400
<v Speaker 5>And then we see monster always in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of foggy representation,</v>

1839
01:43:31.401 --> 01:43:36.401
<v Speaker 5>this huge thing that lies very much at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the bottom and there's no life or </v>

1840
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:38.960
<v Speaker 5>anything around him except I think these</v>
<v Speaker 5>are macro,</v>

1841
01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:42.140
<v Speaker 5>but maybe their tuna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their animated anyway,</v>

1842
01:43:42.141 --> 01:43:45.020
<v Speaker 5>so it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no life down there.</v>

1843
01:43:45.021 --> 01:43:50.021
<v Speaker 5>He is so far down at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ocean that there's nothing that's alive </v>

1844
01:43:50.021 --> 01:43:50.021
<v Speaker 5>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1845
01:43:50.021 --> 01:43:54.750
<v Speaker 5>And then we go inside the which is of </v>
<v Speaker 5>course absurd and we see that the whale </v>

1846
01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:56.480
<v Speaker 5>has eaten a boat at some point in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>past.</v>

1847
01:43:56.481 --> 01:44:01.481
<v Speaker 5>This is one whopping whale and Japan is </v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting with the kitten of all things.</v>

1848
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:05.270
<v Speaker 5>He's also got that little goldfish bowl </v>
<v Speaker 5>full of goldfish with them too,</v>

1849
01:44:05.271 --> 01:44:06.230
<v Speaker 5>which is quite the feat.</v>

1850
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:09.140
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's sitting there and he's.</v>

1851
01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:12.590
<v Speaker 5>He knows that he's trapped in the belly </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the whale to and in that he can't get</v>

1852
01:44:12.591 --> 01:44:15.380
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's an interesting issue.</v>

1853
01:44:15.381 --> 01:44:18.140
<v Speaker 5>It's because not only is Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 5>lacking his father,</v>

1854
01:44:18.141 --> 01:44:23.141
<v Speaker 5>which isn't a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the farther is lacking the sun and </v>

1855
01:44:23.141 --> 01:44:27.461
<v Speaker 5>there is some indication that the father</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't get out of the whale without the </v>

1856
01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:30.521
<v Speaker 5>sun and so it's like the possibility for</v>
<v Speaker 5>order is down there in this chaotic </v>

1857
01:44:31.041 --> 01:44:33.830
<v Speaker 5>state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but unless there's an active agent to go</v>

1858
01:44:33.831 --> 01:44:35.840
<v Speaker 5>seek it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can't pull itself.</v>

1859
01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:38.540
<v Speaker 5>It's not animated enough to get out by </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself,</v>

1860
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:39.950
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you could say,</v>

1861
01:44:39.951 --> 01:44:44.951
<v Speaker 5>well there's wisdom in the libraries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not going to like without you </v>

1862
01:44:44.951 --> 01:44:46.070
<v Speaker 5>going in there and gathering it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>embodying it.</v>

1863
01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:49.550
<v Speaker 5>All it does is sit there and potential.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in all of that,</v>

1864
01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:55.180
<v Speaker 5>in all of that implicit form,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now it's a good way of thinking about </v>

1865
01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:55.220
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

1866
01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:59.030
<v Speaker 5>Jupiter was pretty feeling pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>hopeless because he can't figure out any</v>

1867
01:44:59.031 --> 01:45:02.090
<v Speaker 5>way of getting out of the whale and he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>also starving.</v>

1868
01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:03.920
<v Speaker 5>He's starving in the belly of the whale.</v>

1869
01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.290
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1870
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.260
<v Speaker 5>here's a way of thinking about that</v>

1871
01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:18.890
<v Speaker 5>Japan is a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's old and that being his way of </v>

1872
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:21.630
<v Speaker 5>doing things is no longer fruitful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why you starving.</v>

1873
01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:24.750
<v Speaker 5>And it's especially not fruitful because</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's missing his son.</v>

1874
01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:27.810
<v Speaker 5>He's missing the active element that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>child represents,</v>

1875
01:45:27.811 --> 01:45:31.320
<v Speaker 5>say the playful and transformative </v>
<v Speaker 5>element that the child represents.</v>

1876
01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:34.800
<v Speaker 5>And so if you get stuck doing something </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same old way,</v>

1877
01:45:34.890 --> 01:45:36.600
<v Speaker 5>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's no longer going to work.</v>

1878
01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:41.250
<v Speaker 5>Even if it was good at some point it has</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be updated and it's updated by,</v>

1879
01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 5>let's call it the spirit of youth or the</v>
<v Speaker 5>spirit of attention or the spirit of </v>

1880
01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 5>play,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

1881
01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:49.280
<v Speaker 5>The willingness to break boundaries and </v>
<v Speaker 5>take risks in Japan,</v>

1882
01:45:49.281 --> 01:45:51.150
<v Speaker 5>eto is very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very skilled,</v>

1883
01:45:51.151 --> 01:45:53.070
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he doesn't have that.</v>

1884
01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:58.300
<v Speaker 5>That symbolized by the loss of his son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why he was looking for his son </v>

1885
01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:02.331
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need them and so they're in despair </v>

1886
01:46:02.331 --> 01:46:02.700
<v Speaker 5>down there trying to fish and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting anything.</v>

1887
01:46:02.701 --> 01:46:03.150
<v Speaker 5>And so</v>

1888
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.020
<v Speaker 4>monster wakes up.</v>

1889
01:46:09.250 --> 01:46:12.010
<v Speaker 5>Mackerel happens to swim by and monster </v>
<v Speaker 5>wakes up.</v>

1890
01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:16.050
<v Speaker 5>And so then he started,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there two now actually,</v>

1891
01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:21.120
<v Speaker 5>they look like tune into me and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>monster wakes up and he opens his mouth </v>

1892
01:46:21.251 --> 01:46:23.860
<v Speaker 5>and a bunch of water starts to come in </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so.</v>

1893
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:26.590
<v Speaker 5>And then you see Pinocchio with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fish.</v>

1894
01:46:26.650 --> 01:46:27.010
<v Speaker 5>Now</v>

1895
01:46:31.210 --> 01:46:35.770
<v Speaker 5>there's very intense implicit Christian </v>
<v Speaker 5>symbolism in this part of the film.</v>

1896
01:46:35.771 --> 01:46:38.410
<v Speaker 5>And I'm going to lay it out point by </v>
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

1897
01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.680
<v Speaker 5>So you may remember and perhaps you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't.</v>

1898
01:46:41.710 --> 01:46:46.000
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps you don't know that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>symbols for Christ is a fish it thesis.</v>

1899
01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:51.060
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a play on the Greek </v>

1900
01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:51.060
<v Speaker 5>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Christ's name.</v>

1901
01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:55.131
<v Speaker 5>But there's more to it than that because</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of Christ's followers are fishermen </v>

1902
01:46:55.131 --> 01:46:59.490
<v Speaker 5>and he performs a bunch of miracles with</v>
<v Speaker 5>fish and fish are strange things because</v>

1903
01:46:59.491 --> 01:47:01.320
<v Speaker 5>while you can pull them up out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>depths,</v>

1904
01:47:01.321 --> 01:47:06.321
<v Speaker 5>that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there are things that can be </v>

1905
01:47:06.321 --> 01:47:06.321
<v Speaker 5>pulled out of the depth and you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>say that</v>

1906
01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:10.330
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be very difficult for me </v>
<v Speaker 5>to take this apart.</v>

1907
01:47:10.331 --> 01:47:13.420
<v Speaker 5>But you could say in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christ is a matter of fish.</v>

1908
01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:18.070
<v Speaker 5>A fish is something that you can dine </v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

1909
01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.880
<v Speaker 5>but a way of being is something that </v>
<v Speaker 5>provides you with something to dine on </v>

1910
01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:27.910
<v Speaker 5>on a continual basis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so you might say,</v>

1911
01:47:27.911 --> 01:47:32.911
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it better to be to have a fish or to </v>

1912
01:47:32.911 --> 01:47:34.681
<v Speaker 5>be a fisherman?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's another way of thinking about it </v>

1913
01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:37.111
<v Speaker 5>and obviously it's better to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fisherman because then you can get more </v>

1914
01:47:37.111 --> 01:47:38.290
<v Speaker 5>fish and so it's one thing to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

1915
01:47:38.291 --> 01:47:43.291
<v Speaker 5>but it's another way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's another thing completely to know </v>

1916
01:47:43.291 --> 01:47:45.490
<v Speaker 5>how to generate good things and so if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you had any sense,</v>

1917
01:47:45.670 --> 01:47:50.670
<v Speaker 5>you'd take the ladder over the former,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though the former is more </v>

1918
01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:53.110
<v Speaker 5>instantaneously gratifying and requires </v>
<v Speaker 5>less work and responsibility.</v>

1919
01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.920
<v Speaker 5>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way I'll opens his mouth and goes </v>

1920
01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.981
<v Speaker 5>chasing these fish and Pinocchio tries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to get the hell out of </v>

1921
01:48:01.981 --> 01:48:03.340
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though he wants to find the whale.</v>

1922
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:06.050
<v Speaker 5>When he actually sees the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he leaves he.</v>

1923
01:48:06.130 --> 01:48:08.530
<v Speaker 5>And that's also a very common </v>
<v Speaker 5>mythological,</v>

1924
01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.170
<v Speaker 5>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plot element.</v>

1925
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.440
<v Speaker 5>It's very frequently that what happens </v>
<v Speaker 5>when the hero first sees the terrible </v>

1926
01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:22.041
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dragon say the terrible thing that </v>

1927
01:48:22.041 --> 01:48:23.931
<v Speaker 5>he's come to conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He freezes and gets the hell out of </v>

1928
01:48:23.931 --> 01:48:26.781
<v Speaker 5>there because it's far worse than you </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought it was going to be and so </v>

1929
01:48:26.781 --> 01:48:26.781
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1930
01:48:26.781 --> 01:48:28.110
<v Speaker 5>no way man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going.</v>

1931
01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:33.120
<v Speaker 5>When you hear that whale way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he swims and he's actually at the </v>

1932
01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:33.300
<v Speaker 5>forefront of all the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is quite interesting too.</v>

1933
01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:37.380
<v Speaker 5>So it meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>monster was opened.</v>

1934
01:48:37.381 --> 01:48:40.830
<v Speaker 5>His mouth and the are pouring in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was fishing like mad and he's catching</v>

1935
01:48:40.831 --> 01:48:45.831
<v Speaker 5>fish like crazy and so the little cat is</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan was flinging the fish backwards </v>

1936
01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:52.370
<v Speaker 5>into this box and the little cat is </v>
<v Speaker 5>there whacking them to to kill them </v>

1937
01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.570
<v Speaker 5>while they're flopping around and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're.</v>

1938
01:48:55.571 --> 01:48:59.190
<v Speaker 5>They're pretty excited about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they have a problem.</v>

1939
01:48:59.190 --> 01:49:00.750
<v Speaker 5>The problem is how to get out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whale.</v>

1940
01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.840
<v Speaker 5>That's the actual problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a nasty problem inside that is how </v>

1941
01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:10.131
<v Speaker 5>not to starve to death and so Japan was </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty happy that even though he's not </v>

1942
01:49:10.131 --> 01:49:11.790
<v Speaker 5>getting out of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he gets to have something to eat.</v>

1943
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:15.930
<v Speaker 5>So you could say as well that he's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly focused on the right thing.</v>

1944
01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:21.020
<v Speaker 5>He's focused on the micro problem </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of the macro problem and that </v>

1945
01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:22.080
<v Speaker 5>makes them kind of blind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

1946
01:49:23.450 --> 01:49:28.450
<v Speaker 5>the whale swallows up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio and Japan are keeps fishing </v>

1947
01:49:28.890 --> 01:49:33.060
<v Speaker 5>and then he snags Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now this is cool because,</v>

1948
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:38.290
<v Speaker 5>and this is another example of that Meta</v>
<v Speaker 5>fish idea is like you better was </v>

1949
01:49:40.231 --> 01:49:43.110
<v Speaker 5>actually looking for a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's looking for a way out of the day.</v>

1950
01:49:43.111 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm whale and then he catches a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 5>fish and he's focused on like mad and</v>

1951
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 2>then he couches Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio represents what would get them</v>

1952
01:49:51.821 --> 01:49:56.821
<v Speaker 2>out of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's so bloody obsessed with the </v>

1953
01:49:56.821 --> 01:49:59.251
<v Speaker 2>fish that he doesn't even notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we catch this Pinocchio and flings </v>

1954
01:49:59.251 --> 01:50:02.791
<v Speaker 2>them into the fish basket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it signifies the blindness of </v>

1955
01:50:02.791 --> 01:50:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Japan orientation in India as it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he's inside the way on that,</v>

1956
01:50:06.551 --> 01:50:11.440
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a comment on his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his aged and insufficient nature.</v>

1957
01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:14.440
<v Speaker 2>He's solving the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's solving the problem very well,</v>

1958
01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:16.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's the wrong problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1959
01:50:16.481 --> 01:50:20.920
<v Speaker 2>he fires Pinocchio into the Fish Pen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio says,</v>

1960
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here in Japan.</v>

1961
01:50:22.501 --> 01:50:24.880
<v Speaker 2>No says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't bother me right now.</v>

1962
01:50:24.881 --> 01:50:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm busy fishing so.</v>

1963
01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Well then that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then he kind of wakes up.</v>

1964
01:50:31.501 --> 01:50:36.501
<v Speaker 2>He has this little moment of insight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little revelation that while he's </v>

1965
01:50:36.501 --> 01:50:37.320
<v Speaker 2>caught Pinocchio's who cares about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn fish.</v>

1966
01:50:37.321 --> 01:50:42.321
<v Speaker 2>So then he runs over to the fish box to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grab Pinocchio and instead he grabs a </v>

1967
01:50:42.321 --> 01:50:45.891
<v Speaker 2>fish and gives him a kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that is another way of hammering </v>

1968
01:50:45.891 --> 01:50:49.461
<v Speaker 2>home the fact that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this confusion that he's </v>

1969
01:50:49.461 --> 01:50:52.490
<v Speaker 2>suffering from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can distinguish the local truth from </v>

1970
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:53.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the transcendent truth.</v>

1971
01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:55.620
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does figure it out.</v>

1972
01:50:56.490 --> 01:51:01.490
<v Speaker 2>He tosses the fish aside and he grabs </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio and they're all thrilled to </v>

1973
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.490
<v Speaker 2>death to see each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1974
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:04.800
<v Speaker 2>and so they're united.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Pinocchio has found his father,</v>

1975
01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:06.690
<v Speaker 2>but they're still trapped in the belly </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the whale.</v>

1976
01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Now Pinocchio takes off his hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets covered with a blanket,</v>

1977
01:51:10.741 --> 01:51:14.250
<v Speaker 2>he takes off his hat and he reveals his </v>
<v Speaker 2>jackass ears,</v>

1978
01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:17.460
<v Speaker 2>and so he's found his father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he but he's,</v>

1979
01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:20.780
<v Speaker 2>he's damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not put Lko is he's damaged,</v>

1980
01:51:20.781 --> 01:51:25.781
<v Speaker 2>did not in good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He isn't becoming what he was supposed </v>

1981
01:51:25.781 --> 01:51:25.781
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1982
01:51:25.781 --> 01:51:27.120
<v Speaker 2>he's actually degenerated since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since Japan.</v>

1983
01:51:27.121 --> 01:51:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I saw him last and so he becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed and he says he has a tale.</v>

1984
01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:32.730
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nothing.</v>

1985
01:51:32.731 --> 01:51:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I have a tail too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he spins that around,</v>

1986
01:51:34.921 --> 01:51:37.710
<v Speaker 2>kind of laughing and braise and gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>really embarrassed,</v>

1987
01:51:37.711 --> 01:51:39.570
<v Speaker 2>and so that's what you see here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like.</v>

1988
01:51:39.571 --> 01:51:44.571
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's revealed himself as a jackass to </v>

1989
01:51:44.571 --> 01:51:44.790
<v Speaker 2>his father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1990
01:51:44.791 --> 01:51:46.500
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a good thing because</v>

1991
01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.320
<v Speaker 2>he is a jackass and if he was unwilling </v>
<v Speaker 2>to admit his insufficiency,</v>

1992
01:51:59.090 --> 01:52:00.800
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have ever gone on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit.</v>

1993
01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:02.850
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1994
01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it's this perverse willingness to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he isn't all that he could be.</v>

1995
01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:16.920
<v Speaker 2>That's part of what drives him to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that his father represents.</v>

1996
01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mission of.</v>

1997
01:52:18.450 --> 01:52:21.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a humility and it's an admission of</v>

1998
01:52:21.241 --> 01:52:24.480
<v Speaker 2>insufficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you need that before you're going to</v>

1999
01:52:24.481 --> 01:52:26.580
<v Speaker 2>learn anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because before you learn anything,</v>

2000
01:52:26.581 --> 01:52:29.460
<v Speaker 2>you have to admit that there are things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are important,</v>

2001
01:52:29.461 --> 01:52:33.510
<v Speaker 2>that you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're a fool and maybe that you're</v>

2002
01:52:33.511 --> 01:52:38.511
<v Speaker 2>a brain jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why there are injunctions </v>

2003
01:52:38.511 --> 01:52:42.800
<v Speaker 2>in many religious writings that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>positively portrait humility positively </v>

2004
01:52:43.621 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 2>as the antidote to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the right</v>

2005
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.460
<v Speaker 5>way of thinking about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>humility means I still have something to</v>

2006
01:52:49.461 --> 01:52:51.080
<v Speaker 5>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still have something to learn.</v>

2007
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm in sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still have something to learn.</v>

2008
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:56.390
<v Speaker 5>It's exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say of lamp wakes attitude.</v>

2009
01:52:57.410 --> 01:52:58.630
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>

2010
01:52:58.631 --> 01:53:03.631
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>decides that sun puppet who's half </v>

2011
01:53:03.631 --> 01:53:06.671
<v Speaker 5>jackass is better than no sun at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is another indication of his </v>

2012
01:53:06.671 --> 01:53:08.450
<v Speaker 5>relatively positive orientation towards </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>

2013
01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:13.630
<v Speaker 5>And they reunite and then put it on cue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately sets his eyes on the main </v>

2014
01:53:13.971 --> 01:53:14.750
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2015
01:53:14.751 --> 01:53:15.860
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're stuck in this whale.</v>

2016
01:53:15.861 --> 01:53:20.861
<v Speaker 5>We need to get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it turns out that Japan has already </v>

2017
01:53:20.861 --> 01:53:20.861
<v Speaker 5>built a raft,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a problem.</v>

2018
01:53:20.861 --> 01:53:22.810
<v Speaker 5>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that as Japan,</v>

2019
01:53:22.811 --> 01:53:25.310
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>says Pinocchio says,</v>

2020
01:53:25.311 --> 01:53:30.311
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll wait for his mouth to open in </v>

2021
01:53:30.311 --> 01:53:30.311
<v Speaker 5>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2022
01:53:30.311 --> 01:53:30.311
<v Speaker 5>says that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because when he opens his mouth,</v>

2023
01:53:30.311 --> 01:53:33.050
<v Speaker 5>monster opens his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything comes in and nothing goes out</v>

2024
01:53:33.051 --> 01:53:34.730
<v Speaker 5>so raft,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

2025
01:53:34.730 --> 01:53:38.110
<v Speaker 5>But there's no way of using it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so Japan,</v>

2026
01:53:38.111 --> 01:53:40.400
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>decides that they're not going to bother</v>

2027
01:53:40.401 --> 01:53:43.670
<v Speaker 5>with that problem and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>go have some fish.</v>

2028
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:47.510
<v Speaker 5>But Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his eye is still on the main prize.</v>

2029
01:53:47.511 --> 01:53:48.260
<v Speaker 5>He thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no way,</v>

2030
01:53:48.261 --> 01:53:49.490
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're getting out of this whale.</v>

2031
01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:55.120
<v Speaker 5>That's the fundamental thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not going to rearrange the deck </v>

2032
01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:58.271
<v Speaker 5>chairs on the titanic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to attend to the fact that </v>

2033
01:53:58.271 --> 01:54:01.061
<v Speaker 5>it's sinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to keep our eye on the </v>

2034
01:54:01.061 --> 01:54:01.061
<v Speaker 5>primary problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's a little more awake by now.</v>

2035
01:54:01.061 --> 01:54:04.430
<v Speaker 5>So Pinocchio says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll make a fire now.</v>

2036
01:54:04.431 --> 01:54:08.510
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think because he's down in chaos,</v>

2037
01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:11.600
<v Speaker 5>whereas father is trapped in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first thing he does is to use fire.</v>

2038
01:54:11.601 --> 01:54:13.370
<v Speaker 5>And of course that's exactly what people</v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

2039
01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.300
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because we're fire users and so this and</v>

2040
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:17.480
<v Speaker 5>Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2041
01:54:17.481 --> 01:54:19.630
<v Speaker 5>our masters of fire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2042
01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:24.670
<v Speaker 5>there's this really primordial element </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the story right here and it's an </v>

2043
01:54:24.670 --> 01:54:28.301
<v Speaker 5>indication that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the thing that can transform order </v>

2044
01:54:28.301 --> 01:54:31.030
<v Speaker 5>into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into productive order results,</v>

2045
01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:36.040
<v Speaker 5>so the same spirit that mastered fire </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so Pinocchio lays that out and he </v>

2046
01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:38.650
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to build a fire and a Japan.</v>

2047
01:54:38.650 --> 01:54:41.120
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>says and we'll fill them up with smoke.</v>

2048
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:44.990
<v Speaker 5>And Japan says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great smoked fish.</v>

2049
01:54:45.110 --> 01:54:47.060
<v Speaker 5>So he's still stuck on this whole fish </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2050
01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:52.040
<v Speaker 5>And so Pinocchio runs around gathering </v>
<v Speaker 5>up all the spare wood on the boat,</v>

2051
01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:54.710
<v Speaker 5>including the furniture which he starts </v>
<v Speaker 5>to break.</v>

2052
01:54:54.711 --> 01:54:55.180
<v Speaker 5>And Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2053
01:54:55.190 --> 01:54:56.510
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2054
01:54:56.511 --> 01:54:59.090
<v Speaker 5>what are we going to sit on while we eat</v>
<v Speaker 5>or smoked fish?</v>

2055
01:54:59.091 --> 01:55:04.091
<v Speaker 5>And Pinocchio Basically says politely </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough with the Damn Fish thing.</v>

2056
01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:08.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to fill the whale with smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2057
01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:10.310
<v Speaker 5>that's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make them sneeze and then we can get the</v>

2058
01:55:10.311 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 5>hell out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2059
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:12.070
<v Speaker 5>and Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2060
01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:13.490
<v Speaker 5>says that's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make them mad.</v>

2061
01:55:13.491 --> 01:55:17.600
<v Speaker 5>It's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And well,</v>

2062
01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:22.720
<v Speaker 5>I would say that that's the stance of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the benevolent state against innovation,</v>

2063
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:29.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if the innovation is positive and </v>

2064
01:55:29.310 --> 01:55:29.660
<v Speaker 5>even if it's transformative and freeing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the old state,</v>

2065
01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:32.360
<v Speaker 5>even if it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is going to stand in opposition to that.</v>

2066
01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:35.900
<v Speaker 5>And so that's also something that's very</v>
<v Speaker 5>useful to know because otherwise you can</v>

2067
01:55:35.901 --> 01:55:37.250
<v Speaker 5>get bitter about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

2068
01:55:37.251 --> 01:55:41.150
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio makes this big Fire Shapiro's </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty worried about it and he starts to</v>

2069
01:55:41.151 --> 01:55:46.151
<v Speaker 5>fill the way up with smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so this is where the whale turns </v>

2070
01:55:46.151 --> 01:55:46.800
<v Speaker 5>into a fire breathing dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is quite cool.</v>

2071
01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:51.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like in sleeping beauty maleficent </v>
<v Speaker 5>turns into a fire spewing dragon as </v>

2072
01:55:52.381 --> 01:55:57.381
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you watch the little mermaid </v>

2073
01:55:57.381 --> 01:55:57.381
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's her name,</v>

2074
01:55:57.381 --> 01:56:01.341
<v Speaker 5>that Ursula,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she turns into a gigantic snake like </v>

2075
01:56:01.341 --> 01:56:02.790
<v Speaker 5>creature as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although she doesn't exactly spew fire,</v>

2076
01:56:02.791 --> 01:56:07.791
<v Speaker 5>but the transformation of the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>monster into something like a dragon is </v>

2077
01:56:09.210 --> 01:56:14.210
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very common because it's the ultimate </v>

2078
01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:14.670
<v Speaker 5>symbol of the unknown for a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons that we'll discuss later.</v>

2079
01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:16.320
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

2080
01:56:17.010 --> 01:56:18.270
<v Speaker 5>it's a symbol of chaos.</v>

2081
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:23.930
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is quite a horrifying scene.</v>

2082
01:56:24.170 --> 01:56:29.170
<v Speaker 5>When my son watched,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he watched Pinocchio when he was about </v>

2083
01:56:29.170 --> 01:56:29.510
<v Speaker 5>four and he watched the scene over and </v>
<v Speaker 5>over and over and over.</v>

2084
01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:31.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many times he watched </v>
<v Speaker 5>that movie,</v>

2085
01:56:31.101 --> 01:56:36.101
<v Speaker 5>but it must've been 100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was really fascinated by this </v>

2086
01:56:36.321 --> 01:56:37.520
<v Speaker 5>seat and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

2087
01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:39.950
<v Speaker 5>he was like locked onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was frightening,</v>

2088
01:56:39.951 --> 01:56:42.850
<v Speaker 5>but there was something in it that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was processing and,</v>

2089
01:56:42.930 --> 01:56:44.990
<v Speaker 5>and cordoning onto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

2090
01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:50.590
<v Speaker 5>you see the whale is starting to prepare</v>
<v Speaker 5>to sneeze and it's belting out huge </v>

2091
01:56:50.590 --> 01:56:54.731
<v Speaker 5>quantities of smoke and fire and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio and Japan Eto and the cat and </v>

2092
01:56:54.951 --> 01:56:55.790
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

2093
01:56:55.791 --> 01:57:00.791
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Goldfish bowl are all on the </v>

2094
01:57:00.791 --> 01:57:03.491
<v Speaker 5>raft trying desperately to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way whale which inhales and pulls </v>

2095
01:57:03.491 --> 01:57:05.120
<v Speaker 5>the back and then sneezes and pushes </v>
<v Speaker 5>them forward.</v>

2096
01:57:05.121 --> 01:57:10.121
<v Speaker 5>And at some point they actually break </v>
<v Speaker 5>free and there's a good gates of hell </v>

2097
01:57:10.121 --> 01:57:13.790
<v Speaker 5>image there with the whale belching </v>
<v Speaker 5>smoke like mad and its jaws open.</v>

2098
01:57:13.791 --> 01:57:18.791
<v Speaker 5>And so they are a paddling madly away to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get away from this whale.</v>

2099
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.020
<v Speaker 5>And the whale is very angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just as you peddle a suggested.</v>

2100
01:57:24.021 --> 01:57:27.430
<v Speaker 5>And there's interesting sound effects </v>
<v Speaker 5>that go along with this,</v>

2101
01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:30.170
<v Speaker 5>that whale actually turns into a</v>

2102
01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:35.560
<v Speaker 5>what happened when your phone is smarter</v>
<v Speaker 5>than you are?</v>

2103
01:57:36.330 --> 01:57:41.330
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way I'll actually turns into </v>

2104
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:42.070
<v Speaker 5>something that's like a locomotive and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the sound effects become industrial.</v>

2105
01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:47.460
<v Speaker 5>So it's this monstrous machine like </v>
<v Speaker 5>locomotive dragon that's bent on the </v>

2106
01:57:48.551 --> 01:57:50.370
<v Speaker 5>destruction of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2107
01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:55.440
<v Speaker 5>of Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you could say it's an amalgam of </v>

2108
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.430
<v Speaker 5>natural and social forces completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>unleashed.</v>

2109
01:57:57.550 --> 01:58:00.340
<v Speaker 5>Everything's unleashed against Pinocchio</v>
<v Speaker 5>and his father.</v>

2110
01:58:01.090 --> 01:58:05.660
<v Speaker 5>And so they're having a hell of a time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's big waves and there and they end</v>

2111
01:58:05.661 --> 01:58:08.770
<v Speaker 5>up the way I'll actually abandons them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but before it does that,</v>

2112
01:58:08.771 --> 01:58:11.680
<v Speaker 5>it nails them with its tail and blows </v>
<v Speaker 5>the raft into smithereens.</v>

2113
01:58:11.681 --> 01:58:16.681
<v Speaker 5>And so then they're both in the water </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Japan and Pinocchio or drowning and </v>

2114
01:58:16.681 --> 01:58:16.830
<v Speaker 5>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2115
01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:19.840
<v Speaker 5>actually goes down for the third time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak.</v>

2116
01:58:19.841 --> 01:58:22.390
<v Speaker 5>And as he's going down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says to Pinocchio,</v>

2117
01:58:22.630 --> 01:58:24.790
<v Speaker 5>Save Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>save yourself.</v>

2118
01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:30.180
<v Speaker 5>And so that's kind of Pinocchios last </v>
<v Speaker 5>temptation because Japan has had it and </v>

2119
01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:33.880
<v Speaker 5>he could just get to shore on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he would have abandoned his father.</v>

2120
01:58:34.150 --> 01:58:39.150
<v Speaker 5>And so that's the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's one of the issues that this </v>

2121
01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:41.200
<v Speaker 5>movie grapples with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is what exactly is your responsibility?</v>

2122
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 5>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2123
01:58:42.011 --> 01:58:45.760
<v Speaker 5>it's to save yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the myth that underlies this says,</v>

2124
01:58:45.761 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

2125
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:51.510
<v Speaker 5>That's not exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to rescue your father from the </v>

2126
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:53.320
<v Speaker 5>chaotic depths and integrate with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and to save both.</v>

2127
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:56.380
<v Speaker 5>And that's your duty to your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But more than that,</v>

2128
01:58:56.381 --> 01:59:01.381
<v Speaker 5>it's also your duty to your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It isn't going to work if you just save </v>

2129
01:59:01.381 --> 01:59:03.280
<v Speaker 5>yourself because you're still going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be a jackass puppet,</v>

2130
01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:05.470
<v Speaker 5>even though you're going to be back on </v>
<v Speaker 5>shore.</v>

2131
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:11.160
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio Grabs Jus Pedo and carries </v>

2132
01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:14.470
<v Speaker 5>them to shore and the whale shows back </v>
<v Speaker 5>up and gives them one more good wallop.</v>

2133
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:18.300
<v Speaker 5>And then we see everybody on shore and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's peaceful again.</v>

2134
01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:23.700
<v Speaker 5>Japan is on his back on the dry land and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kitten washes up and the Goldfish </v>

2135
01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:26.710
<v Speaker 5>bowl washes up and the cricket washes </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

2136
01:59:26.770 --> 01:59:28.750
<v Speaker 5>He's been outside the whale all of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2137
01:59:29.170 --> 01:59:33.340
<v Speaker 5>And we see the cricket calling for </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio.</v>

2138
01:59:33.341 --> 01:59:35.890
<v Speaker 5>And then we see him lying in a pool of </v>
<v Speaker 5>water depth.</v>

2139
01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.400
<v Speaker 5>So he's died rescuing his father,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he died well,</v>

2140
01:59:42.211 --> 01:59:42.900
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2141
01:59:42.901 --> 01:59:44.250
<v Speaker 5>he is a jackass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>puppet,</v>

2142
01:59:44.251 --> 01:59:49.251
<v Speaker 5>and maybe he was supposed to die if he </v>
<v Speaker 5>rescued his father because that </v>

2143
01:59:49.251 --> 01:59:54.110
<v Speaker 5>insufficiency that characterized him is </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's destroyed by the </v>

2144
01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:57.360
<v Speaker 5>process of encountering the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which it was so difficult.</v>

2145
01:59:57.361 --> 02:00:02.280
<v Speaker 5>It reforms the personality and the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>occurs when he rescues his father and he</v>

2146
02:00:02.281 --> 02:00:04.260
<v Speaker 5>incorporates that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like</v>

2147
02:00:07.530 --> 02:00:08.850
<v Speaker 5>Bilbo in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

2148
02:00:08.851 --> 02:00:10.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

2149
02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:13.260
<v Speaker 5>in the first part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it called,</v>

2150
02:00:13.261 --> 02:00:15.330
<v Speaker 5>the Lord of the rings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Hobbit.</v>

2151
02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:18.700
<v Speaker 5>He's this sort of jackass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>puppet guy,</v>

2152
02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:22.140
<v Speaker 5>little overprotected shire dweller at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the beginning,</v>

2153
02:00:22.530 --> 02:00:27.270
<v Speaker 5>and he goes on this tremendous adventure</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he has to develop the negative parts</v>

2154
02:00:27.271 --> 02:00:29.430
<v Speaker 5>of his character.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He actually has to become a professional</v>

2155
02:00:29.431 --> 02:00:34.431
<v Speaker 5>thief and he has to develop his bravery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they old personality and sunsets </v>

2156
02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:38.960
<v Speaker 5>has to die to give life to the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so</v>

2157
02:00:44.050 --> 02:00:49.050
<v Speaker 5>you see in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Harry Potter series to at the </v>

2158
02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:51.190
<v Speaker 5>very end part dies and then his </v>
<v Speaker 5>resurrected right?</v>

2159
02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:56.280
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that actually happens to a slightly </v>

2160
02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:58.060
<v Speaker 5>lesser degree in the second movie where </v>
<v Speaker 5>the resurrection is aided by the Phoenix</v>

2161
02:00:58.061 --> 02:01:02.230
<v Speaker 5>tears after he gets eaten by that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or he gets chomped by that big snake,</v>

2162
02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:05.470
<v Speaker 5>which is roughly speaking the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's happening here.</v>

2163
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:08.140
<v Speaker 5>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2164
02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:09.640
<v Speaker 5>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't kill us dead.</v>

2165
02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:12.730
<v Speaker 5>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the next scene,</v>

2166
02:01:12.731 --> 02:01:17.731
<v Speaker 5>we see them back at home and he's lying </v>
<v Speaker 5>dead on the bed and Japan and,</v>

2167
02:01:18.690 --> 02:01:22.930
<v Speaker 5>and everyone else are mourning his loss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the blue.</v>

2168
02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:25.990
<v Speaker 5>Then we see this magic transformation </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we hear the blue fairies</v>

2169
02:01:27.690 --> 02:01:32.690
<v Speaker 5>voice and so it's like he's pushed </v>
<v Speaker 5>himself to his limits and the natural </v>

2170
02:01:32.690 --> 02:01:34.920
<v Speaker 5>process kicks back in and revive and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fires him,</v>

2171
02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:38.070
<v Speaker 5>but now he's no longer a jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Puppet.</v>

2172
02:01:38.071 --> 02:01:43.010
<v Speaker 5>He's actually something that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then he tells,</v>

2173
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:46.210
<v Speaker 5>he wakes up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he notices that now you know,</v>

2174
02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:48.170
<v Speaker 5>he's under gun this proper </v>
<v Speaker 5>transformation.</v>

2175
02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:53.620
<v Speaker 5>He notices his hands in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then he and then he tells Japan who </v>

2176
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:55.880
<v Speaker 5>refuses to even notice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

2177
02:01:55.881 --> 02:01:56.400
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2178
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:58.640
<v Speaker 5>don't kill your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lie Down.</v>

2179
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:04.990
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio convinces him that he's not </v>

2180
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:07.691
<v Speaker 5>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then in celebration they start the </v>

2181
02:02:07.691 --> 02:02:09.881
<v Speaker 5>clock again and so time kicks back in at</v>
<v Speaker 5>that point and so then they have a big </v>

2182
02:02:09.881 --> 02:02:14.471
<v Speaker 5>celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Music happens again because this is a </v>

2183
02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:19.480
<v Speaker 5>celebratory moment and they dance and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the harmony is restored.</v>

2184
02:02:20.601 --> 02:02:25.601
<v Speaker 5>The good old guy has his son and so the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house is properly set up and the old </v>

2185
02:02:26.211 --> 02:02:31.211
<v Speaker 5>state has its vision and its capacity </v>
<v Speaker 5>for transformation and the thing that </v>

2186
02:02:31.211 --> 02:02:34.310
<v Speaker 5>transforms how's the stability of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>culture behind it and so perfect.</v>

2187
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:40.030
<v Speaker 5>And then the cricket goes outside and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's talking to the star and the blue </v>

2188
02:02:40.030 --> 02:02:41.420
<v Speaker 5>fairy it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says he's pretty happy about how this</v>

2189
02:02:41.421 --> 02:02:46.421
<v Speaker 5>has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then she gives him this little </v>

2190
02:02:46.421 --> 02:02:48.590
<v Speaker 5>metal which is made out of gold and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sign in.</v>

2191
02:02:48.591 --> 02:02:51.520
<v Speaker 5>It's a Mandela Hall at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's.</v>

2192
02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:54.380
<v Speaker 5>And it's made out of gold and gold is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>noble metal.</v>

2193
02:02:54.381 --> 02:02:58.430
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mate discriminate </v>
<v Speaker 5>indiscriminately with other metals.</v>

2194
02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:00.730
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't tarnish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's.</v>

2195
02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:05.780
<v Speaker 5>It's a metal that represents the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he flashes his little badge at </v>

2196
02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:10.361
<v Speaker 5>the star,</v>
<v Speaker 5>establishing a relationship between his </v>

2197
02:03:10.361 --> 02:03:14.651
<v Speaker 5>function as the proper conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And his orientation towards the highest </v>

2198
02:03:14.651 --> 02:03:17.800
<v Speaker 5>good and that's it there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's got this little son,</v>

2199
02:03:17.801 --> 02:03:19.700
<v Speaker 5>he's wearing this little son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2200
02:03:19.701 --> 02:03:23.990
<v Speaker 5>so he's also transformed and developed </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a consequence of this entire process.</v>

2201
02:03:23.991 --> 02:03:27.800
<v Speaker 5>And now his Pinocchio's conscience is </v>
<v Speaker 5>properly oriented.</v>

2202
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:33.250
<v Speaker 5>It's oriented towards the highest value.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the movie closes and that's,</v>

2203
02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:41.820
<v Speaker 5>but don't kill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'll give you a minute and I'll take </v>

2204
02:03:50.351 --> 02:03:55.351
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take some questions and try to figure </v>

2205
02:03:55.351 --> 02:03:55.930
<v Speaker 5>out how to shut my phone off.</v>

2206
02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:03.120
<v Speaker 6>So does anybody have any questions?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2207
02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:09.350
<v Speaker 6>Vaguely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Psychoanalytic approach to kind of </v>

2208
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:12.460
<v Speaker 6>extracting me articulated messages from </v>
<v Speaker 6>the mythology,</v>

2209
02:04:12.461 --> 02:04:14.580
<v Speaker 6>getting the stories and the religion </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's developed over time.</v>

2210
02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:18.170
<v Speaker 6>So could you almost say that those are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2211
02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:21.080
<v Speaker 6>kind of constructing this to a societal </v>
<v Speaker 6>level?</v>

2212
02:04:22.190 --> 02:04:25.010
<v Speaker 6>These are kind of the dreams of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>collective unconscious.</v>

2213
02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:27.440
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just exactly what they are.</v>

2214
02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:31.530
<v Speaker 5>They're a collective founder of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fantasies of the collective unconscious.</v>

2215
02:04:31.531 --> 02:04:33.170
<v Speaker 5>So that's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2216
02:04:33.171 --> 02:04:37.320
<v Speaker 5>they also take us socio social,</v>
<v Speaker 5>socially determined form,</v>

2217
02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:40.350
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's animated and that's,</v>

2218
02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:42.090
<v Speaker 5>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>technology and,</v>

2219
02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:47.190
<v Speaker 5>and it's obviously something that exists</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a particular time and place.</v>

2220
02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:52.520
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a collective attempt to give voice </v>

2221
02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:56.121
<v Speaker 5>to the oldest of a behavioral patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here's one way of thinking about </v>

2222
02:04:56.121 --> 02:05:00.921
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we'll talk about it in some </v>

2223
02:05:00.921 --> 02:05:03.081
<v Speaker 5>detail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you should have read about at </v>

2224
02:05:03.081 --> 02:05:04.791
<v Speaker 5>least to some degree already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is where is that knowledge </v>

2225
02:05:04.791 --> 02:05:07.080
<v Speaker 5>represented and younger would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2226
02:05:07.190 --> 02:05:09.360
<v Speaker 5>it's part of the collective unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's.</v>

2227
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:11.640
<v Speaker 5>It's got a biological origin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

2228
02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.540
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his description of the biological nature</v>

2229
02:05:17.541 --> 02:05:22.541
<v Speaker 5>of the collective unconscious is quite </v>
<v Speaker 5>ambiguous and I think that that's </v>

2230
02:05:22.541 --> 02:05:25.580
<v Speaker 5>because it actually is ambiguous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like for example,</v>

2231
02:05:25.581 --> 02:05:30.581
<v Speaker 5>we know that primates and humans in </v>
<v Speaker 5>particular are at least biologically </v>

2232
02:05:31.911 --> 02:05:35.990
<v Speaker 5>predisposed to be afraid of snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we can learn that very easily.</v>

2233
02:05:36.230 --> 02:05:40.460
<v Speaker 5>Now you could make a case that it's more</v>
<v Speaker 5>than biological predisposition that it's</v>

2234
02:05:40.461 --> 02:05:43.490
<v Speaker 5>actually built in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would say the predisposition id is</v>

2235
02:05:43.491 --> 02:05:48.380
<v Speaker 5>actually a better one because you would </v>
<v Speaker 5>need the exposure to the snake to get it</v>

2236
02:05:48.381 --> 02:05:49.800
<v Speaker 5>going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2237
02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:52.940
<v Speaker 5>so that would take place as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequence of your experience.</v>

2238
02:05:52.941 --> 02:05:57.941
<v Speaker 5>So it's not purely biological,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although it is the case that snake fear </v>

2239
02:05:58.071 --> 02:06:00.320
<v Speaker 5>tends to become more intense as you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>older.</v>

2240
02:06:00.321 --> 02:06:04.400
<v Speaker 5>Which is not necessarily what you would </v>
<v Speaker 5>expect and the.</v>

2241
02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:08.570
<v Speaker 5>I just read a paper this week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>localizing snake fear in primates and it</v>

2242
02:06:08.571 --> 02:06:12.740
<v Speaker 5>was hypothalamic to really old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so because the hypothalamus is a very,</v>

2243
02:06:12.741 --> 02:06:15.020
<v Speaker 5>very old part of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's older than the Amygdala.</v>

2244
02:06:15.021 --> 02:06:18.200
<v Speaker 5>The amygdala is involved in snake fear </v>
<v Speaker 5>as well.</v>

2245
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:19.610
<v Speaker 5>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really old.</v>

2246
02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:21.500
<v Speaker 5>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2247
02:06:21.501 --> 02:06:26.030
<v Speaker 5>you're prepared to develop snake fear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're prepared to develop language</v>

2248
02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:29.690
<v Speaker 5>and like you're prepared to walk by your</v>
<v Speaker 5>biological structure.</v>

2249
02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:35.560
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether that actually constitutes the </v>

2250
02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:37.250
<v Speaker 5>contents of your memory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what young seems to imply is an</v>

2251
02:06:37.251 --> 02:06:39.710
<v Speaker 5>open question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't really matter because.</v>

2252
02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:41.600
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2253
02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:49.540
<v Speaker 5>one time when I went to visit my nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was running around in a night suit.</v>

2254
02:06:50.630 --> 02:06:54.020
<v Speaker 5>He was only about four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he's acting out this</v>

2255
02:06:55.490 --> 02:06:58.370
<v Speaker 5>mythological pattern roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you'd say,</v>

2256
02:06:58.371 --> 02:07:00.710
<v Speaker 5>well how did he know how to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer would be,</v>

2257
02:07:00.711 --> 02:07:05.711
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was represented all around them in </v>

2258
02:07:05.711 --> 02:07:05.711
<v Speaker 5>the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in fragments,</v>

2259
02:07:05.711 --> 02:07:09.410
<v Speaker 5>and like kids are pretty good at putting</v>
<v Speaker 5>fragments of stories together.</v>

2260
02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:11.620
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's really what understanding is,</v>

2261
02:07:11.621 --> 02:07:16.621
<v Speaker 5>is to put fragments into story form and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so he'd watched Disney movies and neat </v>

2262
02:07:16.670 --> 02:07:21.670
<v Speaker 5>and his parents had read him stories and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did pretend play with the other kids </v>

2263
02:07:21.670 --> 02:07:24.920
<v Speaker 5>and all of those were like exemplars of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this underlying narrative.</v>

2264
02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:29.030
<v Speaker 5>There are variants of it and because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>can abstract and generalize,</v>

2265
02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:34.060
<v Speaker 5>he's pulling out the central features of</v>
<v Speaker 5>those narratives to hear the heroic </v>

2266
02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:35.620
<v Speaker 5>features and then embodying them so </v>
<v Speaker 5>could say,</v>

2267
02:07:35.621 --> 02:07:40.621
<v Speaker 5>well the central features of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>narratives are fragmented and </v>

2268
02:07:40.621 --> 02:07:44.641
<v Speaker 5>distributed around across the entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>culture and so they don't have to be </v>

2269
02:07:46.001 --> 02:07:51.001
<v Speaker 5>exactly inside your head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have to be part of your </v>

2270
02:07:51.001 --> 02:07:53.611
<v Speaker 5>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are distributed in the behavior </v>

2271
02:07:53.611 --> 02:07:55.740
<v Speaker 5>and the actions and the stories of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>entire culture and they just.</v>

2272
02:07:56.050 --> 02:07:59.200
<v Speaker 5>You can put them together out of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

2273
02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:01.810
<v Speaker 5>And people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they're so hungry for stories</v>

2274
02:08:01.811 --> 02:08:06.811
<v Speaker 5>like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this one or like star wars or star </v>

2275
02:08:06.811 --> 02:08:10.300
<v Speaker 5>trek or like the marvel movies are like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Harry Potter.</v>

2276
02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:16.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you said about the last scene on </v>

2277
02:08:16.050 --> 02:08:19.150
<v Speaker 6>watching me over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my little brother did the same thing </v>

2278
02:08:19.150 --> 02:08:19.190
<v Speaker 6>with the last first Harry Potter you got</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the two faces.</v>

2279
02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:21.970
<v Speaker 6>Watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably 20 or $30.</v>

2280
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:26.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting watching little </v>

2281
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.240
<v Speaker 5>kids interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because movies are unbelievably complex.</v>

2282
02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:28.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2283
02:08:28.501 --> 02:08:30.030
<v Speaker 5>by the time you're your age and you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>seen,</v>

2284
02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:33.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>several hundred of them at minimum,</v>

2285
02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:39.140
<v Speaker 5>the impact wears off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's really something sitting down </v>

2286
02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:40.770
<v Speaker 5>with a four year old who hasn't watched </v>
<v Speaker 5>very many movies and walking through one</v>

2287
02:08:40.771 --> 02:08:43.320
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there are so turned on.</v>

2288
02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:48.380
<v Speaker 5>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took my daughter when she was too </v>

2289
02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:50.811
<v Speaker 5>young actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took her to see the mask that Jim </v>

2290
02:08:50.811 --> 02:08:51.150
<v Speaker 5>Carrey movie Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean she,</v>

2291
02:08:51.170 --> 02:08:52.350
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she survived it.</v>

2292
02:08:52.351 --> 02:08:55.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I traumatized her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she was sitting on my lap,</v>

2293
02:08:55.801 --> 02:09:00.240
<v Speaker 5>but it was really like a gripping a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bundle of barbed wire.</v>

2294
02:09:00.330 --> 02:09:03.270
<v Speaker 5>She was just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the entire movie,</v>

2295
02:09:03.271 --> 02:09:05.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and halfway through I thought,</v>

2296
02:09:05.221 --> 02:09:10.221
<v Speaker 5>well that's probably a little too much </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychophysiological intensity for one </v>

2297
02:09:10.221 --> 02:09:10.221
<v Speaker 5>small body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2298
02:09:10.221 --> 02:09:11.760
<v Speaker 5>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was movies,</v>

2299
02:09:11.761 --> 02:09:16.761
<v Speaker 5>they just have a massive impact on </v>
<v Speaker 5>little kids and they will do exactly </v>

2300
02:09:16.761 --> 02:09:19.941
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll watch it over and over and over </v>

2301
02:09:19.941 --> 02:09:21.561
<v Speaker 5>and you think what is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are they doing exactly how they're </v>

2302
02:09:21.561 --> 02:09:21.561
<v Speaker 5>trying to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're gripped by.</v>

2303
02:09:21.630 --> 02:09:24.000
<v Speaker 5>They're gripped by it somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2304
02:09:24.001 --> 02:09:29.001
<v Speaker 5>And it's like there are deeply curious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know there's something in it and </v>

2305
02:09:29.001 --> 02:09:33.771
<v Speaker 5>they're turning to extract out what it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is and they'll repeat it and repeat it </v>

2306
02:09:33.771 --> 02:09:33.771
<v Speaker 5>and repeat it and repeat it and repeat </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2307
02:09:33.930 --> 02:09:38.930
<v Speaker 5>So they're hungry for the information </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's part of rescuing their </v>

2308
02:09:38.930 --> 02:09:41.130
<v Speaker 5>father from the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

2309
02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:45.480
<v Speaker 5>So other questions?</v>

2310
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:51.480
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good enough.</v>

2311
02:09:51.481 --> 02:09:53.200
<v Speaker 6>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's call it a day.</v>

2312
02:09:54.970 --> 02:09:59.970
<v Speaker 6>What is one more question?</v>
<v Speaker 6>In maps of meaning that you keep </v>

2313
02:10:01.261 --> 02:10:04.220
<v Speaker 6>returning to the boat when you first </v>
<v Speaker 6>encounter the unknown.</v>

2314
02:10:04.221 --> 02:10:06.320
<v Speaker 6>It's like fearful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

2315
02:10:06.730 --> 02:10:11.730
<v Speaker 6>You're the idea of archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are there other kinds of meaning that </v>

2316
02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:17.820
<v Speaker 6>people will find new information that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>already patterned into them,</v>

2317
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:24.510
<v Speaker 6>it's patterned into them or into the new</v>
<v Speaker 6>information that's pattern into them by </v>

2318
02:10:24.510 --> 02:10:27.090
<v Speaker 6>the architect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do people actually,</v>

2319
02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:32.120
<v Speaker 6>sure while they project the project,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the contents of their fantasy onto the </v>

2320
02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:33.770
<v Speaker 6>unknown thing and partly</v>

2321
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:37.780
<v Speaker 5>partly a process of self discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2322
02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:40.970
<v Speaker 5>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say that you,</v>

2323
02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gripped by love at first sight or</v>

2324
02:10:44.371 --> 02:10:49.371
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you don't know anything about the </v>

2325
02:10:49.371 --> 02:10:49.371
<v Speaker 5>person that you're tremendously </v>
<v Speaker 5>attracted to,</v>

2326
02:10:49.650 --> 02:10:52.860
<v Speaker 5>but you'll have fantasies about them and</v>
<v Speaker 5>not found.</v>

2327
02:10:52.861 --> 02:10:57.861
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your image of them is a fantasy and if </v>

2328
02:10:57.861 --> 02:11:00.090
<v Speaker 5>you take that fantasy apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll find out what you value.</v>

2329
02:11:02.420 --> 02:11:07.420
<v Speaker 5>So you are projecting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're projecting yourself into the </v>

2330
02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:09.971
<v Speaker 5>world and you can discover,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you may also discover something </v>

2331
02:11:09.971 --> 02:11:12.521
<v Speaker 5>about them because there may be elements</v>
<v Speaker 5>of them that matched the ideal quite </v>

2332
02:11:12.521 --> 02:11:13.700
<v Speaker 5>nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're fortunate and if your ideal is</v>

2333
02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:17.030
<v Speaker 5>to have a reasonable sort,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can,</v>

2334
02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:22.060
<v Speaker 5>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You definitely encounter yourself when </v>

2335
02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:22.140
<v Speaker 5>you look at the unknown because you use </v>
<v Speaker 5>your.</v>

2336
02:11:22.580 --> 02:11:25.130
<v Speaker 5>Use your fantasy to structure the </v>
<v Speaker 5>contact.</v>

2337
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:31.310
<v Speaker 5>The fundamental structuring is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>heroic encounter with a without known </v>

2338
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:35.680
<v Speaker 5>because that's the pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the fundamental pathway of human </v>

2339
02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:38.240
<v Speaker 5>beings because we're information </v>
<v Speaker 5>foragers fundamentally,</v>

2340
02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:44.340
<v Speaker 5>so it's automatic responses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fantasies as well that are part of the </v>

2341
02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:45.680
<v Speaker 5>first [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>

2342
02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:46.430
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2343
02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:47.630
<v Speaker 5>that's all also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2344
02:11:47.631 --> 02:11:49.160
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly right.</v>

2345
02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:52.230
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Mindy,</v>

2346
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:54.320
<v Speaker 5>imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine that you're attracted to someone</v>

2347
02:11:54.321 --> 02:11:56.240
<v Speaker 5>in York too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrified to go speak to her.</v>

2348
02:11:57.730 --> 02:12:02.730
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's happening while you have a </v>

2349
02:12:02.730 --> 02:12:04.641
<v Speaker 5>fantasy of a judge and that's your </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagined representation of your own </v>

2350
02:12:05.981 --> 02:12:08.500
<v Speaker 5>insufficiency in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideal,</v>

2351
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:13.930
<v Speaker 5>and you project that on this person as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>judge and then you're too paralyzed to </v>

2352
02:12:13.930 --> 02:12:15.580
<v Speaker 5>even open your mouth around her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very common experience.</v>

2353
02:12:17.730 --> 02:12:19.890
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should,</v>

2354
02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:23.170
<v Speaker 5>let's call it a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll see you in a week.</v>
