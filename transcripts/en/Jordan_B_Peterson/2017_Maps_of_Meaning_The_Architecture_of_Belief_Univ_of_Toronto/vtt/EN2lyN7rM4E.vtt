1
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to briefly review some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I told you last time and then I'm </v>

2
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>going to walk through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned,</v>

3
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:25.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk through the Disney </v>
<v Speaker 1>Film Pinocchio and which I presume most </v>

4
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>of you have seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have seen it?</v>

5
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so as I think I mentioned,</v>

7
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>that's something in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fact that you've all seen it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that it's a production of cultural</v>

9
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>significance and because it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange artifact,</v>

10
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:47.151
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be worth trying to take it </v>

11
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>apart to understand why it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

12
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:53.661
<v Speaker 1>that you even understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I offered you the proposition </v>

13
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>last week that we view the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially through a narrative lens and</v>

14
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I believe that we view the world through</v>
<v Speaker 1>a narrative lens because the fundamental</v>

15
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:08.181
<v Speaker 1>problem that we have to solve as living </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures is how we should act in the </v>

16
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:08.181
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

17
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And that means how we should act to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain ourselves,</v>

18
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>but also how we need to act in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to other people and in </v>

19
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.241
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the broader world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to maintain ourselves across </v>

20
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a complicated problem,</v>

21
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just how you survive,</v>

22
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 1>it's how you survive now and next week </v>
<v Speaker 1>and next month and next year and 50 </v>

23
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:35.120
<v Speaker 1>years from now and maybe your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

24
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your descendants as well if the culture </v>

25
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>is going to stabilize and then not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>you across all those timeframes,</v>

26
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.790
<v Speaker 1>but you and everyone else across all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those timeframes so viciously difficult </v>

27
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.081
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that we have evolved </v>

28
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms to solve that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's self evident in some </v>

29
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.811
<v Speaker 1>sense because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the mechanisms that animals have </v>

30
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>evolved to deal with the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social being,</v>

31
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>even if they're not particularly social </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

32
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>is the dominance hierarchy.</v>

33
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could call it a hierarchy of </v>

34
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.821
<v Speaker 1>authority or power because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>considering human structures,</v>

35
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:19.011
<v Speaker 1>social structures as mirror power </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures is a terrible mistake.</v>

36
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:25.221
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible oversimplification </v>
<v Speaker 1>because power is by no means the only </v>

37
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>like force is what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Force is not a stable way of solving the</v>

38
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>problem of how to live together across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

39
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>The question is what is the stable way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of solving how to live together across </v>

40
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.331
<v Speaker 1>time and that really is the question and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the question that I'm </v>

41
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:48.021
<v Speaker 1>trying to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because it's a perennial problem,</v>

42
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

43
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.750
<v Speaker 1>we face the problem of how to organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in small social units without </v>

44
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.941
<v Speaker 1>undue conflict and then we faced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger problem of how to organize </v>

45
00:02:58.941 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>ourselves into large social units </v>
<v Speaker 1>without</v>

46
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.360
<v Speaker 2>undue conflict and that conflict can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely devastating and,</v>

47
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and frequently is so.</v>

48
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.280
<v Speaker 2>So then I would also say that the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of solving this problem isn't </v>

49
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see not at all.</v>

50
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.150
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may know and you may not know that </v>

51
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are different forms of memory,</v>

52
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really technically different forms of </v>

53
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.560
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

54
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 2>there's short term working memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the memory that you use to hold</v>

55
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>things like telephone numbers in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>active imagination.</v>

56
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 2>It decays very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only about four to seven bits,</v>

57
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.700
<v Speaker 2>which is why well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's white phone numbers or were at </v>

58
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>least seven digits long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

59
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of manage that as a loop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That and then there's um,</v>

60
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 2>episodic memory and that has two </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements.</v>

61
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 2>One is semantic and the other is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>episodic.</v>

62
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the name of that?</v>

63
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Someone's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone said something.</v>

64
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's procedural memory and then </v>

65
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.191
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another the kind of memory that </v>

66
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 2>you use to represent your experiences to</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

67
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:23.851
<v Speaker 2>So let's say it's image Laden and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other one is semantic and semantic is </v>

68
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 2>your memory for facts and those are </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite different.</v>

69
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>procedural memory,</v>

70
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 2>that's how you ride a bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you play the piano,</v>

71
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 2>that's how you play jazz music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in a combo,</v>

72
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the memory,</v>

73
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 2>it's in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny kind of memory because it's</v>

74
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 2>actually built right into you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean so is so is the kind of memory </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you use to represent your life,</v>

76
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's much more malleable in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

77
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>procedures there is information that you</v>

78
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 2>don't know about at patterned </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that you don't know about.</v>

79
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Part of that is how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 2>like when you walk into a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering,</v>

81
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.120
<v Speaker 2>you don't really think through how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to act,</v>

82
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to act and if someone asked you </v>

83
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.270
<v Speaker 2>exactly what it is that you're doing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you could formulate a story about </v>

84
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the probability that,</v>

85
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 2>that it's the existence of that story </v>
<v Speaker 2>that enabled you to act that way as zero</v>

86
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 2>because you have to react way faster </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

87
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have social knowledge built into </v>

88
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.851
<v Speaker 2>your nervous system because you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>practiced being a social being for a </v>

89
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 2>very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course then that social being has</v>

90
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 2>been shaped for forever really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the right way of thinking about</v>

91
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

92
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 2>we know that animals organize themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>into hierarchies and we'll say of </v>

93
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:50.881
<v Speaker 2>dominance because it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more true the farther back you go in </v>

94
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:53.760
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least since the time of the </v>

95
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.760
<v Speaker 2>crustaceans.</v>

96
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we split from our common ancestor </v>

97
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.790
<v Speaker 2>300 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's true for social animals and </v>

98
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 2>non social animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even animals that don't live together</v>

99
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 2>in groups have to organize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a hierarchy in this space.</v>

100
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.480
<v Speaker 2>They inhabit songbirds are a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>example and they have dominance disputes</v>

101
00:06:10.481 --> 00:06:15.481
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly that's you can hear them having </v>

102
00:06:15.481 --> 00:06:18.581
<v Speaker 2>their little dominance disputes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spring when they're singing because </v>

103
00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:21.611
<v Speaker 2>basically what they're saying is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty damn healthy and I'm ready to go </v>

104
00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 2>and if you're another bird like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better steer clear of this tree.</v>

105
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.660
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

106
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 2>the dominant songbirds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

107
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 2>they don't live together crozer social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most songbirds aren't.</v>

108
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.360
<v Speaker 2>The dominant songbirds get the best nest</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the best nest is the one that </v>

109
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.670
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get rained on and isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not too windy and it's close to </v>

110
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.751
<v Speaker 2>food sources and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then they have the healthiest </v>

111
00:06:46.751 --> 00:06:50.350
<v Speaker 2>chicks and they attract the best mates </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like it's really important where </v>

112
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.071
<v Speaker 2>you're positioned in the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're not like a flock or herd </v>

113
00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:54.071
<v Speaker 2>creature.</v>

114
00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Now we're more like herd creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's even more,</v>

115
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 2>it's even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even more relevant to us,</v>

116
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 2>but there's just no escaping a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical arrangement in,</v>

117
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in social being.</v>

118
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 2>That is social being and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

119
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 2>and it's evolutionarily ancient beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception.</v>

120
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 2>So 300 million years ago there weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees,</v>

121
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

122
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 2>so the dominance hierarchies older than </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees.</v>

123
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 2>So that's really something to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

124
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:26.051
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're thinking about the reality </v>

125
00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 2>that shaped us say from an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

126
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:32.141
<v Speaker 2>but also from a cultural perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you have to understand is that the </v>

127
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 2>things that have shaped us most are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that have been around the longest</v>

128
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:41.231
<v Speaker 2>and so you could say those are the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>real things and you can't even see some </v>

129
00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

130
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you can come in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's not exactly true.</v>

131
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.720
<v Speaker 2>You can't come in here and see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple dominance hierarchies that are </v>

132
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:49.720
<v Speaker 2>at work.</v>

133
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.710
<v Speaker 2>You can't in a way because the chairs </v>
<v Speaker 2>are set up to face this way and I'm </v>

134
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.420
<v Speaker 2>facing that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gives you some clues about the </v>

135
00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 2>social order here and you take the cues </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly,</v>

136
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come down,</v>

137
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.680
<v Speaker 2>you sit in the chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you organize yourselves according to </v>

138
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 2>mutual expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of your procedural </v>

139
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about how to behave as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>social creature.</v>

140
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.490
<v Speaker 2>Now that knowledge is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really deep and a lot of it's coded in </v>

141
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.310
<v Speaker 2>your behavior now and another people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior as well and that's you know,</v>

142
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:24.311
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the expectations you have of </v>

143
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:26.711
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of yourself and a lot of those are </v>

144
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:26.711
<v Speaker 2>implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

145
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 2>So when we're interacting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

146
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very large number of things </v>

147
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 2>that you just don't get to do and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that too and you won't do them.</v>

148
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.280
<v Speaker 2>And that way we can act as if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand each other even though we </v>

149
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.781
<v Speaker 2>don't because you're really complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm really complicated and there's </v>

150
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 2>lots of situations where we might really</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in conflict,</v>

151
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 2>but because we share a map of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

152
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 2>the cultural expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes part of our.</v>

153
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.400
<v Speaker 2>It's built right into our perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will act out that set of </v>

154
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 2>expectations and so will I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if neither of us can do that,</v>

155
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 2>even if one of us can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to stay.</v>

156
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.480
<v Speaker 2>We're either going to immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>devolve into conflict or we're going to </v>

157
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.051
<v Speaker 2>avoid each other like the plague,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly the right thing to </v>

158
00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:15.561
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so one of the really useful things </v>

159
00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 2>to understand in this took me a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time to formulate properly.</v>

160
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear the terror management theorists</v>

161
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have this idea that you're.</v>

162
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:27.070
<v Speaker 2>You're meaning representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story you tell about the world </v>

163
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>regulates your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your death,</v>

164
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that,</v>

165
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.850
<v Speaker 2>but that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's close to right and it's a </v>

166
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:34.850
<v Speaker 2>smart idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It came from Ernest Becker,</v>

167
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:39.441
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wrote a book called the denial of </v>

168
00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:39.441
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually quite a good book even</v>

169
00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:39.441
<v Speaker 2>though it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 2>sometimes a book can be very useful.</v>

171
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.540
<v Speaker 2>It can be usefully wrong in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Becker's book is usefully wrong </v>

172
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.640
<v Speaker 2>because he thought that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal representation of your belief </v>

173
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:57.681
<v Speaker 2>system that regulates your anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anxiety is fundamentally in the </v>

174
00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 2>final analysis anxiety about death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

175
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

176
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a reasonable proposition,</v>

177
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

178
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 2>it isn't my beliefs right now that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulating my emotions.</v>

179
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:16.010
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that I'm acting out those </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs which include implicit </v>

180
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 2>perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm acting them out and so are you,</v>

181
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 2>and so what you're doing and what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect more,</v>

182
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 2>more accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing and what I want you to</v>

183
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 2>do and the way I want you to react to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's working,</v>

184
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:35.390
<v Speaker 2>so it's the match between my belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and the way everyone else is </v>

185
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 2>acting that's regulating my emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the belief system.</v>

186
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 2>It's mediated by the social culture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see if you understand this,</v>

187
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:47.631
<v Speaker 2>then you understand more particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>why people are willing to fight to the </v>

188
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:49.170
<v Speaker 2>bitter end to protect their culture.</v>

189
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not a psychological structure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're protecting.</v>

190
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a psychological structure and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociological structures,</v>

191
00:10:56.601 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 2>symbol tanium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the social contract is you have a set</v>

192
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:05.190
<v Speaker 2>of expectations and I have a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations there actually desires.</v>

193
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 2>They're not merely expectations because </v>
<v Speaker 2>as living creatures,</v>

194
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:13.521
<v Speaker 2>we're desirous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't just expect and so you desired </v>

195
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 2>outcome and I desired outcome and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree to act in accordance with that.</v>

196
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.700
<v Speaker 2>That's the social contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so people don't like having that </v>

197
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:22.700
<v Speaker 2>disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

198
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 2>it isn't because it's psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilizes them.</v>

199
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Although it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because it actually destabilizes </v>

200
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

201
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:35.571
<v Speaker 2>If all of a sudden we can't occupy the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same specified domain of territory,</v>

202
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 2>it isn't only that we're thrown into </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological disarray,</v>

203
00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:44.871
<v Speaker 2>although we will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that will start fighting with each </v>

204
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 2>other like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that can kill you.</v>

205
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.210
<v Speaker 2>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kills people a lot.</v>

206
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Like it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can happen very easily,</v>

207
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:56.361
<v Speaker 2>that are cohesive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social Group can fragment along some </v>

208
00:11:56.361 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 2>fracture line of identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

209
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 2>And all hell breaks loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

210
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:03.320
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened with the Tutsis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hutus and in,</v>

211
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Rwanda,</v>

212
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:10.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those things can get out of control </v>

213
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 2>just so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just unbelievable.</v>

214
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that wasn't death anxiety,</v>

215
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 2>that was death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole different thing.</v>

216
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's the other thing that Tara </v>
<v Speaker 2>management people don't exactly get.</v>

217
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't just that your culture and your</v>

218
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 2>cultural beliefs protect you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and say anxiety about death.</v>

219
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:30.781
<v Speaker 2>Even it's that they actually protect you</v>
<v Speaker 2>from death as well as protecting you </v>

220
00:12:30.781 --> 00:12:31.520
<v Speaker 2>from death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety.</v>

221
00:12:31.521 --> 00:12:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

222
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 2>it's warm in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cold outside.</v>

223
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the culture is intact </v>
<v Speaker 2>means that you're not outside freezing.</v>

224
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a hell of a lot more fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense than mere anxiety.</v>

225
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Although I'm not trying to underplay the</v>
<v Speaker 2>role of anxiety.</v>

226
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:54.631
<v Speaker 2>That's a major issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something that's a lot more </v>

227
00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 2>fundamental at stake than mere </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>

228
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.480
<v Speaker 2>so it's the match between your map of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and other people's actions </v>

229
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:05.671
<v Speaker 2>that regulates your emotion and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulates it completely because you know</v>

230
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:12.151
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone in here started acting </v>

231
00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:12.151
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deranged,</v>

232
00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:16.530
<v Speaker 2>like brandish a pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say all of a sudden you would not </v>

233
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 2>be in the same place at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a bit,</v>

234
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 2>and so what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

235
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.010
<v Speaker 2>chaos would happen and chaos isn't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would get anxious.</v>

236
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good enough explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would happen is more complex than </v>

237
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.801
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens in some senses that your </v>

238
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:36.820
<v Speaker 2>body and it does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does this.</v>

239
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.850
<v Speaker 2>What would happen is that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>react the same way that it reacts to a </v>

240
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 2>cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly that.</v>

241
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.430
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would respond as if a terrible </v>

242
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Predator had emerged in your midst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what is that reaction?</v>

243
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:54.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just anxiety because when you </v>

244
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:58.590
<v Speaker 2>encounter a Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety isn't the only thing that's </v>

245
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.261
<v Speaker 2>useful that just makes you freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that could be the worst thing </v>

246
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:04.321
<v Speaker 2>you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You freeze and while you're a pretty </v>

247
00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:06.991
<v Speaker 2>easy target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be prepared for a lot </v>

248
00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:09.871
<v Speaker 2>broader range of responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Mirror Mirror Mirror,</v>

249
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 2>petro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fication,</v>

250
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 2>like how about a little aggression that </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be helpful.</v>

251
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also might get you killed,</v>

252
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:22.201
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can take the guy down and </v>

253
00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:22.201
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

254
00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you have to run.</v>

255
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:28.831
<v Speaker 2>So that's disinhibited as well and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to think really quickly and </v>

256
00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:30.550
<v Speaker 2>reflexively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that happens.</v>

257
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 2>That's activated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disinhibited I would say as well.</v>

258
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like your whole being is thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>into intense concentration on the moment</v>

259
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 2>and you're burning up physiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources like mad.</v>

260
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And so what will happen after something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

261
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.930
<v Speaker 2>if you don't develop outright </v>
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

262
00:14:46.931 --> 00:14:51.931
<v Speaker 2>which some of you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you assuming that the situation </v>

263
00:14:51.931 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 2>was brought under control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd walk out of here shaking with your</v>

264
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:59.711
<v Speaker 2>heart rate at one 70 and it would take </v>
<v Speaker 2>you like while it might take you the </v>

265
00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 2>rest of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you would never recover,</v>

266
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 2>but you can bloody well be sure that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would take you the rest of the day.</v>

267
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.780
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's no joke when someone steps </v>

268
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 2>steps outside the confines of the social</v>
<v Speaker 2>contract,</v>

269
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's Kinda.</v>

270
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a philosopher named hobbs who I </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppose in some sense was essentially </v>

271
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 2>conservative philosopher as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russo,</v>

272
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 2>who's kind of his exact opposite.</v>

273
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Rousseau believed that people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically good in their natural state.</v>

274
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:33.821
<v Speaker 2>So he believed nature was basically good</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he believed that culture was </v>

275
00:15:33.821 --> 00:15:34.830
<v Speaker 2>corrupted people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and uh,</v>

276
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hobbs,</v>

277
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Thomas hobbes believed exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

278
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:43.571
<v Speaker 2>He believed that in the state of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say every person was at every </v>

279
00:15:43.571 --> 00:15:48.371
<v Speaker 2>other person's throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing that prevented </v>

280
00:15:48.371 --> 00:15:52.630
<v Speaker 2>continual chaos was the imposition of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a collective agreement that would be </v>

281
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:57.971
<v Speaker 2>the social contract that essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>governed how people would interact and </v>

282
00:15:57.971 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 2>that would keep that underlying chaos at</v>
<v Speaker 2>bay.</v>

283
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.710
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my contention is is that hobbes was </v>

284
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:06.210
<v Speaker 2>correct and Russolo was correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

285
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.410
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that if you add Russo and </v>

286
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.260
<v Speaker 2>hobbs together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a total picture of the world.</v>

287
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:17.261
<v Speaker 2>And that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the picture of the world that </v>

288
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to relate to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's both at once.</v>

289
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can't just attribute human </v>

290
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.640
<v Speaker 2>malevolence and unpredictability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

291
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.580
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nonstarter.</v>

292
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:32.581
<v Speaker 2>It's like people build society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all you're doing is pushing the </v>

293
00:16:32.581 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 2>problem back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like where did it come from?</v>

294
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

295
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 2>the society before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then the one before that,</v>

296
00:16:37.911 --> 00:16:40.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you got to tangle up the individual</v>

297
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:43.040
<v Speaker 2>in there at some point because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>created society.</v>

298
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:48.510
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't just blame human </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrationality and malevolence on </v>

299
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.850
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

300
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:52.820
<v Speaker 2>and also it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ungrateful for God's sake.</v>

301
00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:56.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like society obviously also makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you peaceful.</v>

302
00:16:56.121 --> 00:17:01.121
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason you're a peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now all of you is because while </v>

303
00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 2>you're not that hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're certainly not starving to death.</v>

304
00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:07.571
<v Speaker 2>You would be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different person if you were </v>

305
00:17:07.571 --> 00:17:07.571
<v Speaker 2>starving right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

306
00:17:07.571 --> 00:17:12.100
<v Speaker 2>or if you were enraged or if you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>panicking or if you were terrified </v>

307
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:12.100
<v Speaker 2>because your.</v>

308
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Your future was radically uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

309
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 2>you're just not any of those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

310
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:22.190
<v Speaker 2>You're satiated that I mean that </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically you're satisfied.</v>

311
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.940
<v Speaker 2>None of your biological systems except </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps curiosity,</v>

312
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:31.150
<v Speaker 2>which is a rather pleasant emotion are </v>
<v Speaker 2>activated in the least and you know,</v>

313
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:33.110
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all think,</v>

314
00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:34.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in control of yourself,</v>

315
00:17:34.611 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 2>but don't be thinking that that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>not right.</v>

316
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at how the brain is </v>

317
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:43.090
<v Speaker 2>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

318
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.300
<v Speaker 2>the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a really important part of the </v>

319
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:46.300
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it basically,</v>

320
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.350
<v Speaker 2>it basically establishes the framework </v>
<v Speaker 2>of reference and the actions,</v>

321
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.700
<v Speaker 2>the framework of reference within which </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the actions you take in order to </v>

322
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.751
<v Speaker 2>fulfill basic biological needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the hypothalamus makes you thirsty </v>

323
00:17:59.751 --> 00:18:01.770
<v Speaker 2>and the hypothalamus makes you hungry </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it makes you sexually aroused.</v>

324
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 2>If it puts you into a state of defensive</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression and it,</v>

325
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 2>it actually also makes you explore and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be curious.</v>

326
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.040
<v Speaker 2>All of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamic,</v>

327
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:13.260
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

328
00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 2>and it's really small and it's right at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the base of the brain.</v>

329
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could imagine it as something </v>

330
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.441
<v Speaker 2>that has tremendously powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>projections upward throughout the rest </v>

331
00:18:24.441 --> 00:18:28.281
<v Speaker 2>of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the emotional systems in the </v>

332
00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:29.640
<v Speaker 2>cortical systems and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tree trunk size connections,</v>

333
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:31.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically speaking.</v>

334
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:33.810
<v Speaker 2>And then the cortex has these little </v>
<v Speaker 2>like vine,</v>

335
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 2>like tendrils going down to regulate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus,</v>

336
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it's,</v>

337
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:43.190
<v Speaker 2>when push comes to shove man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hypothalamus that thing winds.</v>

338
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

339
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:48.780
<v Speaker 2>you get people now and then who have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them</v>

340
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 2>produces a condition called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember it.</v>

341
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not dip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mania,</v>

342
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 2>although it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that doesn't matter.</v>

343
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.820
<v Speaker 2>It produces uncontrollable thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what will happen is that people </v>

344
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 2>who have this hypothalamic problem will </v>
<v Speaker 2>drown themselves by drinking water,</v>

345
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.320
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can do by the way.</v>

346
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they just cannot get enough water</v>

347
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.920
<v Speaker 2>and there's no stopping them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

348
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more than there would be stopping you</v>

349
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 2>if you were suffering from raging </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirst.</v>

350
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:23.451
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a happy day when the hypothalamus </v>

351
00:19:23.451 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 2>is not telling you what to do and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

352
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:27.270
<v Speaker 2>you live in such a civilized state that </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time,</v>

353
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:33.470
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tranquil and satisfied and more </v>

354
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.000
<v Speaker 2>or less you can imagine yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful,</v>

355
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:41.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>productive well meaning entity,</v>

356
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.420
<v Speaker 2>but don't be thinking that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be if you were put in the right </v>

357
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:47.700
<v Speaker 2>situation because that's just not right </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

358
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

359
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.680
<v Speaker 2>lots of times soldiers develop </v>
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic stress disorder because </v>

360
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:54.870
<v Speaker 2>they go out to the battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of naive.</v>

361
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.130
<v Speaker 2>They're young guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362
00:19:56.131 --> 00:19:57.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

363
00:19:57.001 --> 00:19:57.600
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

364
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.750
<v Speaker 2>it actually is worse if they're not that</v>
<v Speaker 2>bright.</v>

365
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.780
<v Speaker 2>It turns out because having a lower Iq </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the things that predisposes </v>

366
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:05.780
<v Speaker 2>you to post traumatic stress disorder.</v>

367
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.700
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go out in the battlefield and they </v>

368
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 2>see what they're capable of under </v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefield conditions.</v>

369
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

370
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.980
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had been fighting wars for a very </v>

371
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:16.980
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of years,</v>

372
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps basically have wars with other </v>

373
00:20:21.651 --> 00:20:21.651
<v Speaker 2>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the troops,</v>

374
00:20:21.651 --> 00:20:25.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the juveniles will patrol the </v>

375
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.850
<v Speaker 2>perimeter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the perimeter of their territory and if </v>

376
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:29.160
<v Speaker 2>they find other chimps from other troops</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they outnumber,</v>

377
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 2>they will tear them to pieces like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps are really,</v>

378
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:37.791
<v Speaker 2>really strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I say they'll tear them to </v>

379
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:37.791
<v Speaker 2>pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that literally,</v>

380
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:37.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

381
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:42.650
<v Speaker 2>they tear them to pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jane Goodall discovered that </v>

382
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.251
<v Speaker 2>originally in the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't even report it for awhile </v>

383
00:20:46.251 --> 00:20:47.100
<v Speaker 2>because she was so shocked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

384
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.110
<v Speaker 2>she kind of assumed like most followers </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ruth soul,</v>

385
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 2>that the human proclivity for warfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>was part.</v>

386
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.340
<v Speaker 2>That part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was something that was a uniquely </v>

387
00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.340
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

388
00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had something to do with our,</v>

389
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Speaker 2>our unique self consciousness or </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence or something like that.</v>

390
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 2>She had no idea that it was rooted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply,</v>

391
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:06.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

392
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Speaker 2>we split from chimps about six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7 million years ago,</v>

393
00:21:09.881 --> 00:21:14.020
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we were patrolling territory.</v>

394
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.080
<v Speaker 2>We were gang members 7 million years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know at that that's minimum </v>

395
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:26.251
<v Speaker 2>estimation because of course that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestor shaded back maybe 20 million </v>

396
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:33.151
<v Speaker 2>years into entities that were roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>primate like and so territoriality and a</v>

397
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:39.070
<v Speaker 2>and a proclivity to defend territory is </v>
<v Speaker 2>so deeply embedded in us.</v>

398
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.370
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

399
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

400
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's the control center for </v>
<v Speaker 2>our whole brain and so there isn't </v>

401
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 2>anything more important to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

402
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:54.121
<v Speaker 2>Then maintaining the match between what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to have happen and what other </v>

403
00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:59.350
<v Speaker 2>people are doing in response to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>

404
00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Like that's that that's what we want and</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as that match is maintained,</v>

405
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:09.630
<v Speaker 2>then our emotional systems and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say anxiety's probably primary in that </v>

406
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 2>regard.</v>

407
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Our emotional systems remain inhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're on,</v>

408
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 2>they're ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

409
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.900
<v Speaker 2>like a nuclear reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rods are on and the rest of the brain </v>

410
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.721
<v Speaker 2>dampens them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like if you don't want them to </v>

411
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:27.721
<v Speaker 2>take time to start up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

412
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 2>you want them to be on at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a 10th of a second's notice when it's</v>

413
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:32.870
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

414
00:22:32.871 --> 00:22:33.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of why.</v>

415
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look like look at a wild animal,</v>

416
00:22:35.801 --> 00:22:40.801
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's alert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's ready to dark this way or </v>

417
00:22:40.801 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a prey animal instantaneously</v>

418
00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:47.581
<v Speaker 2>and it has reflex is built into it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do that will respond way before your</v>

419
00:22:48.251 --> 00:22:50.080
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

420
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.650
<v Speaker 2>if you happen to be walking down a trail</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you detect something snake like in </v>

421
00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:00.001
<v Speaker 2>the periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll leap away before you even know </v>

422
00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:04.140
<v Speaker 2>that you lapped and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's because it takes a fair bit </v>

423
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.291
<v Speaker 2>of time to actually see a snake by which</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean form a conscious representation </v>

424
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:08.920
<v Speaker 2>of the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

425
00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:11.500
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it takes a quarter of a second</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>

426
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 2>or even longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

427
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it takes 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No 20th of a set a 10th of a second.</v>

428
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:21.730
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about the damn snake is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way faster than that.</v>

429
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 2>It's really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing,</v>

430
00:23:23.441 --> 00:23:28.441
<v Speaker 2>and it evolved with primates by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it can nail you like way faster </v>

431
00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:32.830
<v Speaker 2>than you can look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have your eyes map,</v>

432
00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:37.860
<v Speaker 2>snake like objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right onto your reflexes so that the </v>

433
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.520
<v Speaker 2>eyes go to eyes make you jump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they see after that,</v>

434
00:23:41.521 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

435
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:44.510
<v Speaker 2>well now you can see that's no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

436
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.460
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

437
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:52.680
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now what I would say that what we do is </v>

438
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.960
<v Speaker 2>we live in a shared story and the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a way of looking at the world and its</v>

439
00:23:56.961 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 2>way of acting in the world at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

440
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 2>And that story has to operate within </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrow parameters.</v>

441
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.630
<v Speaker 2>And this is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily important to understand </v>

442
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.930
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something I think that </v>

443
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.971
<v Speaker 2>piaget figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Piaget figured out better than </v>

444
00:24:12.971 --> 00:24:12.971
<v Speaker 2>anyone else.</v>

445
00:24:12.971 --> 00:24:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I think he really got this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

446
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that piaget was trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

447
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 2>you never hear about how strange these </v>
<v Speaker 2>great thinkers are.</v>

448
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:21.470
<v Speaker 2>But Piaget was a very strange guy and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

449
00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.620
<v Speaker 2>he was a hyper genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was offered the curatorship of a </v>

450
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.830
<v Speaker 2>bloody museum when he was 10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

451
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.930
<v Speaker 2>because he wrote this little paper on </v>
<v Speaker 2>mollusks,</v>

452
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:34.931
<v Speaker 2>which parent was a very good and so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>offered him the curatorship of a museum </v>

453
00:24:34.931 --> 00:24:35.840
<v Speaker 2>and his parents wrote back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

454
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

455
00:24:37.581 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Speaker 2>probably not because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually ted.</v>

456
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:43.610
<v Speaker 2>And so that was piaget man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was a genius and you know,</v>

457
00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:48.611
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was actually motivated by the desire </v>

458
00:24:48.611 --> 00:24:49.130
<v Speaker 2>to reconcile science and religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

459
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that was actually his entire motivation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what he did.</v>

460
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 2>You never hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the case.</v>

461
00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.970
<v Speaker 2>And so piaget was very interested in how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you produce structures that enable you </v>

462
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:04.280
<v Speaker 2>to regulate yourself because you're like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of a,</v>

463
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:09.550
<v Speaker 2>a colony of strange sub animals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to figure out how to get along so </v>

464
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.841
<v Speaker 2>that you can sort of be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of learned that I would say </v>

465
00:25:13.841 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 2>between the ages of two and four as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being socialized,</v>

466
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:17.750
<v Speaker 2>you know how erratic two year olds are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

467
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:20.060
<v Speaker 2>they're a blast and it's part because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were erratic.</v>

468
00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:25.061
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're unbelievably happy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're unbelievably hungry and </v>

469
00:25:25.061 --> 00:25:27.470
<v Speaker 2>then they're really hot and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>really upset and crying,</v>

470
00:25:27.471 --> 00:25:28.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're really scared.</v>

471
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:31.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that just untrammeled.</v>

472
00:25:31.671 --> 00:25:33.380
<v Speaker 2>And so it's really fun to be around </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

473
00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:36.050
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're happy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so happy that it's just,</v>

474
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't ever get to be that happy and </v>

475
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.471
<v Speaker 2>so it's nice to be around the two year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old because you can kinda feel that </v>

476
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.270
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:25:45.271 --> 00:25:46.180
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of what the.</v>

478
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:51.190
<v Speaker 2>One of the horrible things about being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>parent is that you spend a tremendous </v>

479
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.360
<v Speaker 2>amount of your time making your child </v>
<v Speaker 2>less happy.</v>

480
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion is a very impulsive,</v>

481
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know because everybody says,</v>

482
00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:00.860
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be happy.</v>

483
00:26:00.861 --> 00:26:02.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

484
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.790
<v Speaker 2>when you're happy you're actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

485
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 2>And so because happiness makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive,</v>

486
00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:09.710
<v Speaker 2>happiness makes happiness says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

487
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:14.711
<v Speaker 2>things are really good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get what you can while the getting's </v>

488
00:26:14.711 --> 00:26:15.140
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as a,</v>

489
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're hyper optimistic,</v>

490
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.510
<v Speaker 2>manic will say it's like every stock </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment looks like a really good </v>

491
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.140
<v Speaker 2>stock investment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you won't spend all your money</v>

492
00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:29.141
<v Speaker 2>because look at those wonderful things </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and you could do such great </v>

493
00:26:29.141 --> 00:26:29.330
<v Speaker 2>things with them and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

494
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 2>you spend all your money and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>crash and you think,</v>

495
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life's over,</v>

496
00:26:34.821 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I just,</v>

497
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I just spent all my money on all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>useless stuff.</v>

498
00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.900
<v Speaker 2>And it's all under the grip of </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive,</v>

499
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

500
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:48.741
<v Speaker 2>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're telling your kids to be </v>

501
00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 2>quiet and settled down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't because they're making a lot of</v>

502
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 2>noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being in pain is because they're running</v>

503
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 2>around like wild baboons having a blast </v>
<v Speaker 2>and disrupting things like mad,</v>

504
00:26:58.501 --> 00:27:00.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you got kids,</v>

505
00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 2>you got to settle down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

506
00:27:01.381 --> 00:27:06.381
<v Speaker 2>like quit having so much fun and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of awful that you do that,</v>

507
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
<v Speaker 2>but what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's because the emotions and the </v>

508
00:27:12.091 --> 00:27:17.091
<v Speaker 2>motivations have to be brought into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with one another within the</v>

509
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:18.660
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

510
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:24.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing I remember with my son who is </v>

511
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.110
<v Speaker 2>quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's quite disagreeable by temperament,</v>

512
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 2>which is actually a good thing as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned,</v>

513
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:31.221
<v Speaker 2>although it brings its own challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so with my daughter when she was </v>

514
00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 2>misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was pretty agreeable and uh,</v>

515
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she was misbehaving I could basically</v>

516
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:41.250
<v Speaker 2>just look at her and then she'd quit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

517
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:44.390
<v Speaker 2>but my son was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just nothing.</v>

518
00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

519
00:27:45.451 --> 00:27:47.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not gonna go anywhere man.</v>

520
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:52.790
<v Speaker 2>And so then I'd tell him to stop and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really wasn't having much of an </v>

521
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.751
<v Speaker 2>effect either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just sort of maybe laugh or runaway </v>

522
00:27:56.751 --> 00:27:56.751
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

523
00:27:56.751 --> 00:28:00.471
<v Speaker 2>he was a tough little rat and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would do with him is he would be </v>

524
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 2>doing something and it interfered and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd get upset and you know,</v>

525
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:09.770
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then I get them to sit on the </v>

526
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:09.770
<v Speaker 2>steps and I told him when he was about </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

527
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

528
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 2>you're going to sit on the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's time out.</v>

529
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.480
<v Speaker 2>You're going to sit on the steps until </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got control of yourself and you </v>

530
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.610
<v Speaker 2>can come back and be and play the family</v>
<v Speaker 2>game again.</v>

531
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a civilized human being and then </v>

532
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.130
<v Speaker 2>you're welcome again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he'd sit on the steps.</v>

533
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.970
<v Speaker 2>It was so interesting to watch because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just enraged.</v>

534
00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 2>He'd sit there like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen a two year old have a</v>

535
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 2>temper tantrum?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really quite the bloody phenomena.</v>

536
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.470
<v Speaker 2>If you ever saw an adult do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd like,</v>

537
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.480
<v Speaker 2>you'd call nine one one right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

538
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen adults do that.</v>

539
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people say with borderline </v>

540
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:46.940
<v Speaker 2>personality disorder will have temper </v>
<v Speaker 2>tantrums,</v>

541
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.640
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

542
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.100
<v Speaker 2>you want to be about 30 feet away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that person.</v>

543
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really.</v>

544
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.600
<v Speaker 2>But in kids it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>

545
00:28:54.601 --> 00:28:59.601
<v Speaker 2>they're only this long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how much trouble can they really </v>

546
00:28:59.601 --> 00:28:59.601
<v Speaker 2>cause?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

547
00:28:59.601 --> 00:29:00.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just completely gone there.</v>

548
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Like on the floor of their face is red.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just furious,</v>

549
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:09.531
<v Speaker 2>like way more furious than you ever get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are even vaguely socialized </v>

550
00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:09.531
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

551
00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Just outraged and they're kicking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting the ground and like,</v>

552
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.690
<v Speaker 2>it's like a little epileptic fits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>

553
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:20.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're completely controlled by their </v>

554
00:29:20.691 --> 00:29:22.750
<v Speaker 2>rage and we took care of one kid for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile who he was actually a pushover,</v>

555
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.990
<v Speaker 2>that kid you could get them to behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

556
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of shaking your finger at him.</v>

557
00:29:26.671 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 2>But his mother thought he was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough because he had her,</v>

558
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 2>he had her figured out and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things he would do is have a temperature</v>

559
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.880
<v Speaker 2>temper tantrum and during the temper </v>
<v Speaker 2>tantrum he would hold his bloody breath </v>

560
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.000
<v Speaker 2>until he turned blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

561
00:29:39.001 --> 00:29:40.530
<v Speaker 2>try that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

562
00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:45.531
<v Speaker 2>as that's your homework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go home and go home and have a temper </v>

563
00:29:45.531 --> 00:29:47.260
<v Speaker 2>tantrum and while you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold your breath until you actually turn</v>

564
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 2>blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you won't be able to do it.</v>

565
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the willpower of a two </v>
<v Speaker 2>year old,</v>

566
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

567
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 2>That little varmint man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just had a fit.</v>

568
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Then he'd hold his breath and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned blue.</v>

569
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

570
00:29:57.821 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

571
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.030
<v Speaker 2>And we would just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them do it.</v>

572
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.540
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He turned blue and everybody would be </v>

573
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:06.540
<v Speaker 2>gone and he'd come out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

574
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.610
<v Speaker 2>and it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he just quit doing it.</v>

575
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:12.010
<v Speaker 2>I think he did it like twice and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out,</v>

576
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:15.460
<v Speaker 2>oh well that's a lot of work for very </v>
<v Speaker 2>little outcome and you know,</v>

577
00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:17.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not like two year olds are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

578
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.470
<v Speaker 2>they're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably smarter than you,</v>

579
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 2>but they're not civilized by any stretch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the imagination.</v>

580
00:30:23.711 --> 00:30:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to my son,</v>

581
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd put them on the steps and he'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

582
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like aged and trying to get </v>

583
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 2>himself together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

584
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.720
<v Speaker 2>And I wait a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>few,</v>

585
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I got a strict rule which was as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done,</v>

586
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:40.690
<v Speaker 2>you're welcome again.</v>

587
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's completely under your control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

588
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.090
<v Speaker 2>you get yourself calmed down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come and talk to me again.</v>

589
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.250
<v Speaker 2>If you're calm enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I like you,</v>

590
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.190
<v Speaker 2>then you're welcome back in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No grudge or nothing.</v>

591
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.180
<v Speaker 2>And so it's harder than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people think they liked their kids.</v>

592
00:30:55.181 --> 00:31:00.181
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be thinking that they're hard to </v>

593
00:31:00.181 --> 00:31:00.181
<v Speaker 2>like they're little monsters and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

594
00:31:00.181 --> 00:31:04.561
<v Speaker 2>very pushy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And provocative and so lots of parents </v>

595
00:31:04.561 --> 00:31:07.351
<v Speaker 2>do not like their children and they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible things to them their whole </v>

596
00:31:07.351 --> 00:31:11.341
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's no joke and it's a very common </v>

597
00:31:11.341 --> 00:31:12.280
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was Freud's observation,</v>

598
00:31:12.281 --> 00:31:17.281
<v Speaker 2>fundamental observation that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology is rooted in the family </v>

599
00:31:17.281 --> 00:31:18.520
<v Speaker 2>and you can be sure of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

600
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:23.521
<v Speaker 2>and when you hear about some mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's done something terrible to her </v>

601
00:31:23.521 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happens reasonably frequently,</v>

602
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:28.780
<v Speaker 2>you know perfectly well that she has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very terrible capacity to discipline.</v>

603
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.780
<v Speaker 2>The child is just provoked her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>provoked or unprovoked or and provoked </v>

604
00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.021
<v Speaker 2>or unprovoked or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just happens to be a day where </v>

605
00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:39.750
<v Speaker 2>her new boyfriend left and she's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>hung over and she got fired and it's </v>

606
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.591
<v Speaker 2>like that was the wrong data provoker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she does something that is not </v>

607
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.580
<v Speaker 2>good and you read about it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

608
00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:46.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could that happen?</v>

609
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.250
<v Speaker 2>How could anyone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

610
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 2>that's how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

611
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.710
<v Speaker 2>and kids are very provocative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like little chimps.</v>

612
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Chimps will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The adolescents will like throw little </v>

613
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.031
<v Speaker 2>pebbles and sticks at the sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>larger males and bug them and that </v>

614
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:04.420
<v Speaker 2>teasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it is,</v>

615
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.330
<v Speaker 2>that teasing turns into full fledged </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance,</v>

616
00:32:07.331 --> 00:32:10.210
<v Speaker 2>challenged behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once the adolescent males get big enough</v>

617
00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:15.211
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you're being provoked by a </v>

618
00:32:15.211 --> 00:32:15.211
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they provoke your time,</v>

619
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:16.380
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

620
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:20.590
<v Speaker 2>just where are you exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens if I do this?</v>

621
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:22.030
<v Speaker 2>What happens if I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

622
00:32:22.031 --> 00:32:24.040
<v Speaker 2>and how else are they going to figure it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>

623
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd sit on the steps and just,</v>

624
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.310
<v Speaker 2>he's just enraged and trying to control </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

625
00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:32.410
<v Speaker 2>And I'd watched that and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

626
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:36.660
<v Speaker 2>I come back after about two minutes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and he'd still be around.</v>

627
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.750
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well are,</v>

628
00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you got yourself under control?</v>

629
00:32:40.011 --> 00:32:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Are you ready to get it off the steps?</v>

630
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.500
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

631
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:48.900
<v Speaker 2>he'd get himself under control and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd come back and you know,</v>

632
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.770
<v Speaker 2>he'd be contrite and then I would like </v>
<v Speaker 2>them right away.</v>

633
00:32:51.771 --> 00:32:53.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to watch that,</v>

634
00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:58.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't like being dominated </v>

635
00:32:58.271 --> 00:32:58.271
<v Speaker 2>by a two year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one does,</v>

636
00:32:58.271 --> 00:33:02.620
<v Speaker 2>and so if the child hasn't mastered </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself and started to act in accordance</v>

637
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:07.760
<v Speaker 2>with the prevailing social norms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't like them while you think,</v>

638
00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:12.761
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will because you know I'm a good </v>

639
00:33:12.761 --> 00:33:12.761
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

640
00:33:12.761 --> 00:33:12.761
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't,</v>

641
00:33:12.761 --> 00:33:12.761
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not a good person,</v>

642
00:33:12.761 --> 00:33:14.540
<v Speaker 2>so don't be thinking about that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not true.</v>

643
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.900
<v Speaker 2>So when he was contrite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he'd come and then we just go on </v>

644
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:22.610
<v Speaker 2>like nothing had happened because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want to do,</v>

645
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you get compliance,</v>

646
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.980
<v Speaker 2>especially if the compliance is in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best interest of the child,</v>

647
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 2>you want to reward it instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

648
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the right thing to do because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then and,</v>

649
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:37.340
<v Speaker 2>and you could just see him gaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over himself.</v>

650
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:41.750
<v Speaker 2>And so really what was happening is his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his mind,</v>

651
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.040
<v Speaker 2>in his brain will say there was a war </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the psyche,</v>

652
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:51.041
<v Speaker 2>the ego that was starting to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrated and starting to become a </v>

653
00:33:51.041 --> 00:33:52.400
<v Speaker 2>continuous person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an identity,</v>

654
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:56.510
<v Speaker 2>and it's fragile in two year olds and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be disrupted all the time and it is.</v>

655
00:33:56.511 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're so hyper emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fragile,</v>

656
00:33:59.361 --> 00:34:04.361
<v Speaker 2>that little eagle and it doesn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of power and so what you want to do </v>

657
00:34:04.361 --> 00:34:06.720
<v Speaker 2>is reward it when it wins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it,</v>

658
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.290
<v Speaker 2>when he gets control over the underlying</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations,</v>

659
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 2>you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

660
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:11.750
<v Speaker 2>good work man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good work kid.</v>

661
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:12.860
<v Speaker 2>You did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

662
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:15.470
<v Speaker 2>you guard yourself under control way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

663
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:20.650
<v Speaker 2>And the kids really happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's actually not that much fun </v>

664
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 2>to have a temper tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting.</v>

665
00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes you over question.</v>

666
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pat on the head or you know,</v>

667
00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.390
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a kind word,</v>

668
00:34:32.391 --> 00:34:33.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

669
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.870
<v Speaker 2>or whatever earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

670
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay attention.</v>

671
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.160
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

672
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Pay attention and that's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great thing to know with people </v>

673
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 2>like in your relationships here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the key to a good relationship.</v>

674
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:49.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not the only one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but watch your person carefully,</v>

675
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>

676
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.170
<v Speaker 2>and whenever they do something that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would like them to do more of,</v>

677
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:57.440
<v Speaker 2>tell them that that was really good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean it.</v>

678
00:34:57.441 --> 00:35:00.290
<v Speaker 2>And it's not manipulative because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's manipulated it won't work.</v>

679
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

680
00:35:02.031 --> 00:35:04.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to be precise?</v>

681
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Here's what you just did that I thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>was great and Oh boy,</v>

682
00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:10.970
<v Speaker 2>that's so nice that you've noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe they can notice.</v>

683
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

684
00:35:12.051 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Speaker 2>you do that 20 times and the person will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like the rat.</v>

685
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.150
<v Speaker 2>That's just pushing the lever for </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>

686
00:35:17.151 --> 00:35:18.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

687
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:19.130
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

688
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a skinner established this bf </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinner noticed this a long time ago.</v>

689
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Reward is intensely useful in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>modifying behavior,</v>

690
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:32.411
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is is that it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to notice when things are going </v>

691
00:35:32.411 --> 00:35:33.230
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

692
00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:38.231
<v Speaker 2>Because of your kind of primed to notice</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things are going wrong and so you </v>

693
00:35:38.231 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 2>use threat and punishment more often as </v>
<v Speaker 2>agents of,</v>

694
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.570
<v Speaker 2>of shaping the people that you're around</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know when everything's going</v>

695
00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:46.320
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

696
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's going right.</v>

697
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.580
<v Speaker 2>It turns to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just assume it and that's,</v>

698
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.620
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>

699
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 2>You want to pay attention and if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

700
00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 2>your children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife,</v>

701
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 2>your whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mother,</v>

702
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 2>your sister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want them to,</v>

703
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 2>if you want to rectify your </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships with them,</v>

704
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:11.300
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying to do this in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulative way,</v>

705
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:16.370
<v Speaker 2>won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they do something that's </v>

706
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.370
<v Speaker 2>promoting harmony and peace and </v>
<v Speaker 2>goodwill,</v>

707
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 2>it's like attend to it.</v>

708
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Tell them that you noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's so useful and you have to</v>

709
00:36:21.271 --> 00:36:23.970
<v Speaker 2>get rid of your grudges and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment to do that,</v>

710
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't want you to kind of </v>

711
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:29.240
<v Speaker 2>mad at your sister and then you know she</v>
<v Speaker 2>does something good.</v>

712
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.200
<v Speaker 2>You think there is no god damn way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to reward you for that.</v>

713
00:36:31.201 --> 00:36:33.480
<v Speaker 2>So you ignore her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she does something good.</v>

714
00:36:33.481 --> 00:36:35.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's brilliant.</v>

715
00:36:35.101 --> 00:36:38.580
<v Speaker 2>That is because then you've just </v>
<v Speaker 2>punished her for doing what you want,</v>

716
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 2>and people do that with their kids all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

717
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they let the kids dominate them.</v>

718
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Then they get resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the kid will run up to them to show</v>

719
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:52.221
<v Speaker 2>them something that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular and they'll they're not </v>

720
00:36:52.221 --> 00:36:52.221
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll like,</v>

721
00:36:52.221 --> 00:36:52.221
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

722
00:36:52.221 --> 00:36:52.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

723
00:36:52.621 --> 00:36:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working,</v>

724
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:59.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little kid has all sad about that and </v>

725
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.511
<v Speaker 2>he's just learned something so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not perhaps what you want them </v>

726
00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:02.511
<v Speaker 2>to learn.</v>

727
00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.940
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to keep your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your relationship with your children </v>

728
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.391
<v Speaker 2>pristine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means that you can't hold a </v>

729
00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:15.021
<v Speaker 2>grudge or resent them and that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to help them learn how to </v>

730
00:37:15.021 --> 00:37:17.640
<v Speaker 2>behave so that you liked them and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way if they,</v>

731
00:37:17.641 --> 00:37:22.641
<v Speaker 2>if you like them and you're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensible and maybe your partner also </v>

732
00:37:22.641 --> 00:37:22.650
<v Speaker 2>likes them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

733
00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:27.651
<v Speaker 2>you got to consensus going there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reasonable possibility that </v>

734
00:37:27.651 --> 00:37:29.820
<v Speaker 2>other people will actually like them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>including other children.</v>

735
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.850
<v Speaker 2>And then the world will open up to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

736
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.880
<v Speaker 2>then you'll bring them to people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses and the people will actually </v>

737
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.050
<v Speaker 2>smile at them and given them a pat on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head and instead of thinking,</v>

738
00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that brands coming to visit again,</v>

739
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what he'll break this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

740
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:49.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's just a horrible thing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your child to experience repetitively in</v>

741
00:37:49.891 --> 00:37:51.720
<v Speaker 2>situation after situation.</v>

742
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.750
<v Speaker 2>All they learned is that adults have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>false smile,</v>

743
00:37:54.751 --> 00:37:57.720
<v Speaker 2>but they're really lying all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

744
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like a bit of hell and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of children who are trapped in that.</v>

745
00:38:01.681 --> 00:38:06.681
<v Speaker 2>It's really awful to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see kids like that when I walked </v>

746
00:38:06.681 --> 00:38:06.681
<v Speaker 2>down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

747
00:38:06.681 --> 00:38:10.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like their little doomed things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there they are and you know,</v>

748
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.770
<v Speaker 2>they're screwed in 15 different ways and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way out of it.</v>

749
00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:18.771
<v Speaker 2>It's really awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would not recommend that you do </v>

750
00:38:18.771 --> 00:38:22.881
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better to notice that you're a bit </v>

751
00:38:22.881 --> 00:38:24.981
<v Speaker 2>of a monster or a lot of a monster and </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice that you are much happier with </v>

752
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:31.521
<v Speaker 2>the people around you when they behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>in accordance with reasonable source </v>

753
00:38:31.521 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 2>social norms and then you actually feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely connected to them and you want</v>

754
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:37.360
<v Speaker 2>to work their behalf so that everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>works out.</v>

755
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:42.870
<v Speaker 2>But if you think you're a good person </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you'd never do anything that </v>

756
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.811
<v Speaker 2>was harmful to your children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can just forget about that </v>

757
00:38:45.811 --> 00:38:47.050
<v Speaker 2>because you'll never take it seriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to actually learn.</v>

758
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.590
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

759
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:54.690
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live inside this story as far as I </v>

760
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 2>can tell and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we kind of put the story together inside</v>

761
00:38:56.171 --> 00:39:01.171
<v Speaker 2>us to begin with and that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>between two and four when you're </v>

762
00:39:01.171 --> 00:39:04.530
<v Speaker 2>integrating those motivations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions into a relatively functional </v>

763
00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 2>unity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

764
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

765
00:39:06.721 --> 00:39:11.721
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that does happen between two and </v>

766
00:39:11.721 --> 00:39:13.591
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have your kids socialized </v>

767
00:39:13.591 --> 00:39:15.751
<v Speaker 2>by the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore you might as well just forget </v>

768
00:39:15.751 --> 00:39:18.031
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that sounds terribly </v>

769
00:39:18.031 --> 00:39:20.281
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know the literature on trying to </v>

770
00:39:20.281 --> 00:39:22.960
<v Speaker 2>rectify antisocial behavior in children </v>
<v Speaker 2>and after the age of four,</v>

771
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 2>it's virtually impossible no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

772
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.530
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that kids who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are still acting like two year olds when</v>

773
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 2>they're for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

774
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:35.410
<v Speaker 2>they're twice as old as a two year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of difference.</v>

775
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Like a four year olds in adult as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a two year old is concerned.</v>

776
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.710
<v Speaker 2>And so if the four year old is still </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting like a two year old,</v>

777
00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:46.711
<v Speaker 2>that's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And other four year olds will come up </v>

778
00:39:46.711 --> 00:39:50.041
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a little play invitation like a dog </v>

779
00:39:50.041 --> 00:39:50.041
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

780
00:39:50.041 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 2>the kid a two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four year old has no idea how to react </v>

781
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:55.090
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the more mature kid thinks,</v>

782
00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how about a play with you?</v>

783
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:03.660
<v Speaker 2>And then that kid is isolated from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>peers and after four year mostly </v>

784
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.210
<v Speaker 2>socialized by your peers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you just fall farther and farther</v>

785
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:08.080
<v Speaker 2>and farther behind.</v>

786
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:13.080
<v Speaker 2>You're more and more alienated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're more bitter and angry and no </v>

787
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.370
<v Speaker 2>wonder and it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't rectify it.</v>

788
00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.800
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

789
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.400
<v Speaker 2>so that's useful to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like your job from two to four is </v>

790
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:27.031
<v Speaker 2>to turn your child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help turn your child into a functional </v>

791
00:40:27.031 --> 00:40:30.391
<v Speaker 2>unity and buy three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be functional enough as a </v>

792
00:40:30.391 --> 00:40:34.531
<v Speaker 2>unity within themselves so that they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on a voluntary goal for some</v>

793
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:40.801
<v Speaker 2>reasonable length of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is also why it's useful to let </v>

794
00:40:40.801 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 2>them spend some time alone so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can learn to amuse themselves.</v>

795
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Because if they can either be used </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

796
00:40:44.381 --> 00:40:49.381
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be able to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other kids and then by three </v>

797
00:40:49.381 --> 00:40:50.770
<v Speaker 2>they're sorted together enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if another three year old comes along</v>

798
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.690
<v Speaker 2>they can at least play in parallel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>may also start,</v>

799
00:40:55.710 --> 00:41:00.710
<v Speaker 2>may be able to start playing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperative game.</v>

800
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 2>And so that's often a fantasy game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

801
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:06.000
<v Speaker 2>pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what the kids will do it,</v>

802
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:10.480
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they mediated verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's more acted out.</v>

803
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a combination of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll assign each other rules,</v>

804
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:15.430
<v Speaker 2>they'll do this with you too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

805
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:17.830
<v Speaker 2>let's have a tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what does that mean?</v>

806
00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means let's sit down and act out the </v>

807
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:25.390
<v Speaker 2>act of sharing food and see if we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get that right.</v>

808
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.910
<v Speaker 2>That's what the is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a little tea party,</v>

809
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:33.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very important because he wouldn't </v>

810
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.270
<v Speaker 2>being shared food like this is a major </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to get right man.</v>

811
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:38.230
<v Speaker 2>And so the kid will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you be the mom and the dad and you </v>

812
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:42.161
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll make little fort and that'll be </v>

813
00:41:42.161 --> 00:41:43.811
<v Speaker 2>our house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll go in there and we'll run our </v>

814
00:41:43.811 --> 00:41:45.491
<v Speaker 2>roles and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're acting out or acting out family </v>

815
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:46.670
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>

816
00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.580
<v Speaker 2>if were both reasonably civilized as </v>
<v Speaker 2>three year olds,</v>

817
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.740
<v Speaker 2>we can concentrate on that goal.</v>

818
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 2>We can establish that little fictional </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

819
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:59.740
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can negotiate a mutual goal and then </v>

820
00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.881
<v Speaker 2>we can run the simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what kids are doing when </v>

821
00:42:03.881 --> 00:42:03.881
<v Speaker 2>they're pretending it's bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>

822
00:42:03.881 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 2>That's play man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

823
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:09.550
<v Speaker 2>it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely unbelievable because you</v>

824
00:42:09.551 --> 00:42:11.270
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to play a mom,</v>

825
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.480
<v Speaker 2>let's say it isn't like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

826
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:18.530
<v Speaker 2>it isn't exactly like you imitate your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mom because invitation would be,</v>

827
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:24.010
<v Speaker 2>you know how annoying it is when someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>copies you so you know you're sitting </v>

828
00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I do the same thing.</v>

829
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:26.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really annoying.</v>

830
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.480
<v Speaker 2>And if that isn't what kids do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't act out the precise actions </v>

831
00:42:33.411 --> 00:42:37.610
<v Speaker 2>that they've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the target of their fantasy display.</v>

832
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.410
<v Speaker 2>There are way more sophisticated than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

833
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.850
<v Speaker 2>They watch their mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say like hawks and then they start</v>

834
00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:46.370
<v Speaker 2>to extract out regularities in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

835
00:42:46.371 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 2>which is mum behavior.</v>

836
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that's what makes you mom </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is and then so it's like </v>

837
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:57.490
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look at you across time and they </v>

838
00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.771
<v Speaker 2>extract out the regularity that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you mother and then they try to embody </v>

839
00:42:59.771 --> 00:43:01.460
<v Speaker 2>that regularity in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend play,</v>

840
00:43:01.461 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 2>and then they sort of encapsulate or </v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporate the spirit of being a mother</v>

841
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.960
<v Speaker 2>or being a father or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or an animal because they'll play it </v>

842
00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what they're doing.</v>

843
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.570
<v Speaker 2>They're using their body and their mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>is dramatic forums.</v>

844
00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:16.100
<v Speaker 2>It's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

845
00:43:16.101 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 2>it's so sophisticated and no other </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal does that as far as we know.</v>

846
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's the platform on which language </v>
<v Speaker 2>is based,</v>

847
00:43:23.121 --> 00:43:28.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all we imitate and languages </v>

848
00:43:28.121 --> 00:43:28.121
<v Speaker 2>imitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

849
00:43:28.121 --> 00:43:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Because we use the same words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

850
00:43:29.181 --> 00:43:31.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's imitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal.</v>

851
00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:36.551
<v Speaker 2>So you can act out someone else and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can conceptualize them in fantasy </v>

852
00:43:36.551 --> 00:43:39.470
<v Speaker 2>and it's only way after that that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could maybe articulate it like what does</v>

853
00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:40.520
<v Speaker 2>it mean to be a mother?</v>

854
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 2>So I could have you write an essay about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

855
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to think about it,</v>

856
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:46.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't just automatically know,</v>

857
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:51.970
<v Speaker 2>but if someone hands you a baby and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you're not completely socially </v>

858
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:57.221
<v Speaker 2>blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're roughly know what to do after </v>

859
00:43:57.221 --> 00:43:57.221
<v Speaker 2>you're done with your initial </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervousness,</v>

860
00:43:57.221 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 2>you roughly know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't drop it.</v>

861
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a good rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've probably figured that one out.</v>

862
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:04.280
<v Speaker 2>At least you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't yell at it,</v>

863
00:44:04.281 --> 00:44:06.320
<v Speaker 2>don't startle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give it a little pack,</v>

864
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:09.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe try hugging it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you go like this,</v>

865
00:44:09.201 --> 00:44:10.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make eyes out it,</v>

866
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.750
<v Speaker 2>you know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's built into you.</v>

867
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:17.810
<v Speaker 2>You know it's built into you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean you could lay it </v>

868
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:18.890
<v Speaker 2>out as a series of rules about how to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mother.</v>

869
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:21.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could write a whole damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>book about that.</v>

870
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

871
00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:26.180
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in this story and first of all,</v>

872
00:44:26.181 --> 00:44:31.181
<v Speaker 2>you get your own story together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's by integrating your motivations </v>

873
00:44:31.181 --> 00:44:33.420
<v Speaker 2>and emotions together under social </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>

874
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:39.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piaget states that before the age of </v>

875
00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:43.311
<v Speaker 2>three kids can't really play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're egocentric and it's not exactly </v>

876
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:48.681
<v Speaker 2>right because you're actually playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your mother from the time you're </v>

877
00:44:48.681 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 2>born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even with breastfeeding that that's a</v>

878
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:54.621
<v Speaker 2>social interaction and it's a complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperative endeavor and it's often hard</v>

879
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 2>for mother and infant to get that right </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's complicated and it requires</v>

880
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 2>a lot of social interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like while the child has to learn not to</v>

881
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 2>bite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

882
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:08.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mother has to learn not to be </v>

883
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:08.960
<v Speaker 2>too nervous and there's a lot of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>bonding.</v>

884
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.290
<v Speaker 2>It's really complicated social </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction.</v>

885
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:15.291
<v Speaker 2>So the child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the infant even at the earliest stages </v>

886
00:45:15.291 --> 00:45:18.020
<v Speaker 2>is already engaged in a complex social </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic that's essentially play </v>

887
00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:20.150
<v Speaker 2>oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

888
00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:22.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty primordial.</v>

889
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:27.110
<v Speaker 2>It has to do mostly with the mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>child's mouth and tongue are already </v>

890
00:45:27.181 --> 00:45:28.560
<v Speaker 2>hard wired at birth.</v>

891
00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 2>So your child is most Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday and observation as well.</v>

892
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:37.191
<v Speaker 2>Your child is almost all mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tongue when it's born and the rest of </v>

893
00:45:37.191 --> 00:45:37.860
<v Speaker 2>it's body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you watch infants,</v>

894
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:41.640
<v Speaker 2>like even when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how old?</v>

895
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Seven months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six months,</v>

896
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.120
<v Speaker 2>four months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even remember now.</v>

897
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:50.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll move their arm and they kind of </v>

898
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.040
<v Speaker 2>go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they have got no fine control </v>

899
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like they have,</v>

900
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clubs on the ends of sticks.</v>

901
00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:59.541
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their nervous system isn't thoroughly </v>

902
00:45:59.541 --> 00:46:00.960
<v Speaker 2>myelinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have control over themselves,</v>

903
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:06.140
<v Speaker 2>but their mouth and tongue are already </v>
<v Speaker 2>wired up and so otherwise they wouldn't </v>

904
00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.041
<v Speaker 2>be able to swallow or or nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the oral element is extraordinarily </v>

905
00:46:10.041 --> 00:46:14.451
<v Speaker 2>important for a young child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why kids put everything in their </v>

906
00:46:14.451 --> 00:46:14.451
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

907
00:46:14.451 --> 00:46:15.500
<v Speaker 2>even when they're a bit older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're.</v>

908
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.390
<v Speaker 2>They see with their tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course everyone can do.</v>

909
00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put a block in your mouth,</v>

910
00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:25.611
<v Speaker 2>you can tell that it's a like a cube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell that it's a cube without </v>

911
00:46:25.611 --> 00:46:29.211
<v Speaker 2>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see with your tongue and see </v>

912
00:46:29.211 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 2>with your hands can even see to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree with your ears anyways.</v>

913
00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.490
<v Speaker 2>So there's social interaction right from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning,</v>

914
00:46:35.491 --> 00:46:37.620
<v Speaker 2>but for the point of simplification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

915
00:46:37.621 --> 00:46:42.300
<v Speaker 2>well first the child organized this </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves into a functional unity under</v>

916
00:46:42.301 --> 00:46:46.830
<v Speaker 2>the pressure of social dynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they get unified enough so that</v>

917
00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:51.831
<v Speaker 2>they can attain unity with another child</v>
<v Speaker 2>by setting up a fictional world and </v>

918
00:46:51.831 --> 00:46:56.600
<v Speaker 2>cooperating and competing within that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's quite interesting to a </v>

919
00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.350
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people often juxtapose cooperation and </v>

920
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.880
<v Speaker 2>competition as if they're opposites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that they're not opposites at all.</v>

921
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.700
<v Speaker 2>In another Piagetian observation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>

922
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:07.380
<v Speaker 2>well there's hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a competitive game.</v>

923
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.450
<v Speaker 2>And people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

924
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.190
<v Speaker 2>but then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well really,</v>

925
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Speaker 2>really no one brings a basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

926
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to play by the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cooperation.</v>

927
00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:24.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the teams competing against each </v>

928
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:24.711
<v Speaker 2>other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

929
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:27.261
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they agree to compete within a </v>

930
00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:29.130
<v Speaker 2>particular landscape and they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperate to maintain that landscape.</v>

931
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 2>And so you do the same thing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing monopoly.</v>

932
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're trying to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time you're cooperating.</v>

933
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:36.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

934
00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 2>That's society man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's society right there.</v>

935
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 2>You're cooperating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big enclosure.</v>

936
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 2>And within that there are regulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitions,</v>

937
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.960
<v Speaker 2>but to separate those artificially and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

938
00:47:49.961 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one's come competition.</v>

939
00:47:51.341 --> 00:47:52.840
<v Speaker 2>And the others cooperation has just.</v>

940
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not very smart.</v>

941
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not observant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That isn't how it works and,</v>

942
00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 2>and Games are intensely cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if they're intensely competitive.</v>

943
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean the hockey teams are playing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same game.</v>

944
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then each team,</v>

945
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:16.090
<v Speaker 2>there's competition within the team to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the best player let's say,</v>

946
00:48:16.091 --> 00:48:19.570
<v Speaker 2>but everyone wants that because everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants good players to emerge,</v>

947
00:48:19.571 --> 00:48:24.571
<v Speaker 2>but you still cooperate like mad with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your teammates and if you don't pass </v>

948
00:48:24.571 --> 00:48:24.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

949
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:29.701
<v Speaker 2>play like a reasonable person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're going to not be happy with </v>

950
00:48:29.701 --> 00:48:32.410
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even within that competition,</v>

951
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 2>cooperation is regulating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions and then you can think this</v>

952
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:38.110
<v Speaker 2>is a really good thing to think too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

953
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:41.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people often say to their kids,</v>

954
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.290
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter whether you win or </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose,</v>

955
00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:49.291
<v Speaker 2>it's how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the kid who of course has no idea </v>

956
00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:49.291
<v Speaker 2>what that means.</v>

957
00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:49.291
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean,</v>

958
00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:50.410
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to win.</v>

959
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.100
<v Speaker 2>And the parents says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

960
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 2>it matters how you play and the kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushes them and the parents really can't</v>

961
00:48:55.961 --> 00:48:58.300
<v Speaker 2>come up with a good explanation of why </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the case.</v>

962
00:48:58.301 --> 00:48:58.900
<v Speaker 2>They might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

963
00:48:58.901 --> 00:49:02.170
<v Speaker 2>other kids won't play with you if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go,</v>

964
00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 2>because you could say this is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>to think about.</v>

965
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 2>So there's a game and there's a victory </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the game,</v>

966
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:18.240
<v Speaker 2>but then there's the set of all games </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's victory across the set of </v>

967
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.891
<v Speaker 2>all games and the victory that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>attained across the set of all games </v>

968
00:49:22.891 --> 00:49:27.451
<v Speaker 2>isn't winning all the games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being invited to play all the </v>

969
00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:29.290
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you play fair,</v>

970
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.570
<v Speaker 2>then you're playing a metagame and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>metagame is how to win across the set of</v>

971
00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:39.571
<v Speaker 2>all games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you teach your child how to </v>

972
00:49:39.571 --> 00:49:41.170
<v Speaker 2>behave properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they always get invited to play and</v>

973
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:42.280
<v Speaker 2>that makes them winners.</v>

974
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you understand that,</v>

975
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:50.791
<v Speaker 2>you understand something phenomenally </v>
<v Speaker 2>important about the emergence of </v>

976
00:49:50.791 --> 00:49:51.590
<v Speaker 2>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.640
<v Speaker 2>because people moral relativists in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular think that morality is </v>

978
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:56.770
<v Speaker 2>relative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

979
00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:01.840
<v Speaker 2>and of course human beings are diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like languages are diverse and </v>

980
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:07.050
<v Speaker 2>there's more than one playable game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not really more than one </v>

981
00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:11.161
<v Speaker 2>playable metagame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're either the kind of </v>

982
00:50:11.161 --> 00:50:12.040
<v Speaker 2>person that other people want to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>with or you're not,</v>

983
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.220
<v Speaker 2>and if you're not the kind of person </v>
<v Speaker 2>that other people want to play with,</v>

984
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.560
<v Speaker 2>then you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that,</v>

985
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.800
<v Speaker 2>and that's true of all cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be playing different </v>

986
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.030
<v Speaker 2>individual games within their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Undoubtedly they are,</v>

987
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:30.420
<v Speaker 2>but the set of all games that they play </v>
<v Speaker 2>is still common across cultures.</v>

988
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:33.830
<v Speaker 2>That's part of what makes us human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you could say as well,</v>

989
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:39.280
<v Speaker 2>we're actually evolved to detect people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are good at playing the set of all </v>

990
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.740
<v Speaker 2>possible games and we actually know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not theoretical.</v>

991
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.270
<v Speaker 2>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

992
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:47.690
<v Speaker 2>some things are easy to remember and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some things are hard to remember.</v>

993
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's something that's easy to </v>

994
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:52.720
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You play with someone in need,</v>

995
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 2>cheat man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will remember that.</v>

996
00:50:54.111 --> 00:50:57.230
<v Speaker 2>That's like in your mind that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going anywhere.</v>

997
00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.620
<v Speaker 2>And so you're great at detecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaters and you remember and that's </v>

998
00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 2>because you can't trust a cheater and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't invite a cheater to play a</v>

999
00:51:05.601 --> 00:51:10.601
<v Speaker 2>game with you because they might cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's part of the innate </v>

1000
00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:15.130
<v Speaker 2>morality system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember cheaters because they </v>

1001
00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:15.830
<v Speaker 2>aren't good at playing the metagame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course your evolved,</v>

1002
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.820
<v Speaker 2>of course you're adapted to the metagame</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're the product of this </v>

1003
00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 2>immense evolutionary history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1004
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:27.581
<v Speaker 2>And whoever your ancestors were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an unbroken string of </v>

1005
00:51:27.581 --> 00:51:30.440
<v Speaker 2>successful reproducers going back three </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half billion years,</v>

1006
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:35.441
<v Speaker 2>you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single one of your ancestors </v>

1007
00:51:35.441 --> 00:51:37.320
<v Speaker 2>successfully reproduced it's mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>boggling,</v>

1008
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 2>the chances against that are so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions,</v>

1009
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:41.900
<v Speaker 2>billions to one.</v>

1010
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:46.900
<v Speaker 2>And here you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line of three and a half billion </v>

1011
00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.411
<v Speaker 2>years of success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole world was trying to kill you </v>

1012
00:51:50.411 --> 00:51:50.900
<v Speaker 2>that whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here you are.</v>

1013
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and but you know,</v>

1014
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.890
<v Speaker 2>you're still only gonna last about eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1015
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:56.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

1016
00:51:56.811 --> 00:51:57.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still,</v>

1017
00:51:57.501 --> 00:51:58.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>

1018
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:03.610
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were lots of games that your </v>

1019
00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.660
<v Speaker 2>ancestors were playing across that </v>
<v Speaker 2>immense span of time.</v>

1020
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

1021
00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lizard Games and tree dweller games and,</v>

1022
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:12.590
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>

1023
00:52:12.591 --> 00:52:14.690
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Crustacean Games,</v>

1024
00:52:14.691 --> 00:52:19.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that huge set of games and you're </v>

1025
00:52:19.691 --> 00:52:21.110
<v Speaker 2>adapted to win across those games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them.</v>

1026
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:22.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's built into you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1027
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:24.890
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your central human nature.</v>

1028
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:29.891
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes you social.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not some mirror cultural </v>

1029
00:52:29.891 --> 00:52:31.790
<v Speaker 2>construct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite the contrary.</v>

1030
00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:34.280
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so deeply embedded in you.</v>

1031
00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:36.430
<v Speaker 2>It's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1032
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.770
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is a story.</v>

1033
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:42.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a game too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

1034
00:52:42.111 --> 00:52:43.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's a monopoly game.</v>

1035
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the frame while that's the rules </v>

1036
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:50.540
<v Speaker 2>of the game and are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you accept them?</v>

1037
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of arbitrary,</v>

1038
00:52:52.281 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that happens to be the rules.</v>

1039
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Hockey has different rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball has different rules,</v>

1040
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.500
<v Speaker 2>but what they share is that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

1041
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a frame that's the rules.</v>

1042
00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:08.351
<v Speaker 2>And then within the frame there's a goal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the goal is whatever the rules </v>

1043
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:08.630
<v Speaker 2>dictate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1044
00:53:08.631 --> 00:53:13.631
<v Speaker 2>there's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's usually the construction of a </v>

1045
00:53:13.631 --> 00:53:15.851
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of success within a frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what you play.</v>

1046
00:53:16.931 --> 00:53:19.880
<v Speaker 2>And so you play monopoly and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we'll accept the rules.</v>

1047
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:22.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the social contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll each try to win.</v>

1048
00:53:22.131 --> 00:53:24.650
<v Speaker 2>And that'll be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We find that amusing.</v>

1049
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.030
<v Speaker 2>And if you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you say?</v>

1050
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Why you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1051
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:31.140
<v Speaker 2>there's always said another game and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

1052
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 2>So if you have that attitude and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>play fair,</v>

1053
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 2>then it doesn't matter that much that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1054
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:41.150
<v Speaker 2>whether you win or lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you still want to try to win </v>

1055
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.150
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you're not a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>player,</v>

1056
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:45.380
<v Speaker 2>but you accept defeat gracefully because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can play again and so and you'll win</v>

1057
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:47.910
<v Speaker 2>some and you lose some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's not so bad,</v>

1058
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even if you lose,</v>

1059
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:55.190
<v Speaker 2>well maybe you learn something and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're doing a lot more than one </v>

1060
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.620
<v Speaker 2>thing while you're playing monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1061
00:53:55.621 --> 00:53:58.830
<v Speaker 2>you're having a conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning how to interact with people and</v>

1062
00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:01.920
<v Speaker 2>learning how to regulate your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even if you lose,</v>

1063
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:03.360
<v Speaker 2>if you have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you win.</v>

1064
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.600
<v Speaker 2>And if your kids have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know that and so that way you </v>

1065
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.120
<v Speaker 2>buffer them against defeat.</v>

1066
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1067
00:54:09.691 --> 00:54:12.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get them next time.</v>

1068
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>

1069
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 2>you should try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's okay.</v>

1070
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.690
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1071
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's useful information for people to </v>

1072
00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:23.720
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1073
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're always in one of these little </v>

1074
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:28.760
<v Speaker 2>frameworks and there's just no getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of it.</v>

1075
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:28.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's because,</v>

1076
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at any given moment,</v>

1077
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:32.160
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like field theory.</v>

1078
00:54:32.161 --> 00:54:37.161
<v Speaker 2>There used to be psychological theories </v>
<v Speaker 2>that talked about the field of human </v>

1079
00:54:37.161 --> 00:54:37.320
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1080
00:54:37.321 --> 00:54:39.690
<v Speaker 2>And this is kind of what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a field.</v>

1081
00:54:39.691 --> 00:54:44.580
<v Speaker 2>And basically what happens is you parse </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a little part of the world say,</v>

1082
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:50.150
<v Speaker 2>and so you can handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say it has some duration.</v>

1083
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.830
<v Speaker 2>You're not aiming at something 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future.</v>

1084
00:54:52.831 --> 00:54:54.600
<v Speaker 2>It's because how the hell are you going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that?</v>

1085
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:56.310
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too many variables,</v>

1086
00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:01.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're aiming at some handleable </v>

1087
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.311
<v Speaker 2>amount of time and you pause it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a goal in there and you plot your route </v>

1088
00:55:04.311 --> 00:55:08.751
<v Speaker 2>and then that tells you what's up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you what's down because up moves </v>

1089
00:55:08.751 --> 00:55:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you towards the goal and down moves you </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the goal.</v>

1090
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:15.830
<v Speaker 2>And that sets up your motivational </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework so that you have some worth </v>

1091
00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:15.830
<v Speaker 2>attaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1092
00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:17.790
<v Speaker 2>that's a really interesting thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know too.</v>

1093
00:55:17.791 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like why have a goal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While it's easy,</v>

1094
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.430
<v Speaker 2>no goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no positive emotion,</v>

1095
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:28.740
<v Speaker 2>because you experienced positive emotion</v>
<v Speaker 2>by noticing that you're moving towards a</v>

1096
00:55:28.741 --> 00:55:33.741
<v Speaker 2>goal and so if you don't have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal while you can't have any positive </v>

1097
00:55:33.741 --> 00:55:35.550
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you better have a goal,</v>

1098
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:37.290
<v Speaker 2>and so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1099
00:55:37.291 --> 00:55:39.240
<v Speaker 2>what should the goal be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1100
00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:40.500
<v Speaker 2>we could start by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1101
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.350
<v Speaker 2>any goal is better than none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we might say,</v>

1102
00:55:43.351 --> 00:55:48.351
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be a goal that other people </v>

1103
00:55:48.351 --> 00:55:50.480
<v Speaker 2>will let you pursue because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be kind of difficult and </v>

1104
00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.750
<v Speaker 2>maybe there'll be even happy to help you</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue it.</v>

1105
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:56.780
<v Speaker 2>That would even be better and maybe it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a goal that would enable you to learn </v>

1106
00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.860
<v Speaker 2>how to pursue other goals while you </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue that goal.</v>

1107
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would really be good,</v>

1108
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:04.290
<v Speaker 2>and so you can see that your goal is </v>
<v Speaker 2>parameterized,</v>

1109
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:06.960
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that any old goal </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

1110
00:56:06.961 --> 00:56:10.560
<v Speaker 2>It means there's some goals that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>nicely and some not so nicely.</v>

1111
00:56:10.561 --> 00:56:13.110
<v Speaker 2>There are playable games and non </v>
<v Speaker 2>playable games.</v>

1112
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:16.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you want to have a playable game and</v>

1113
00:56:16.771 --> 00:56:18.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawyer,</v>

1114
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:20.340
<v Speaker 2>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1115
00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:22.530
<v Speaker 2>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1116
00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:27.010
<v Speaker 2>they're playable games and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not obvious which ones better,</v>

1117
00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:31.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly obvious which ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>are sustainable and which ones are worth</v>

1118
00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:35.590
<v Speaker 2>and so there's a set of playable games </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you need to extract from that set of</v>

1119
00:56:35.591 --> 00:56:40.591
<v Speaker 2>playable games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a game that suits you and that would be </v>

1120
00:56:40.591 --> 00:56:40.591
<v Speaker 2>partly due to your temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1121
00:56:40.591 --> 00:56:45.571
<v Speaker 2>because extroverted people want to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>an extroverted game and highly neurotic </v>

1122
00:56:45.571 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 2>people want to play a safe game and </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeable people want to play a generous</v>

1123
00:56:48.911 --> 00:56:52.840
<v Speaker 2>game and disagreeable people wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play a game that's highly competitive so</v>

1124
00:56:52.841 --> 00:56:55.240
<v Speaker 2>they can win and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1125
00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.360
<v Speaker 2>but they're all within the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>playable gates and that means they're </v>

1126
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.660
<v Speaker 2>socially acceptable as well.</v>

1127
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 2>And so that means it isn't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary,</v>

1128
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:09.820
<v Speaker 2>it isn't just relative what you decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1129
00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:12.190
<v Speaker 2>It's heavily parameterized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only,</v>

1130
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.670
<v Speaker 2>there's a set of playable games and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>large.</v>

1131
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:17.410
<v Speaker 2>The set is large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

1132
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:21.610
<v Speaker 2>there are commonalities within it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why there are commonalities.</v>

1133
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 2>That's why morality has a common basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally.</v>

1134
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And so that's partly what we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to investigate is like what's up?</v>

1135
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.720
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean?</v>

1136
00:57:31.721 --> 00:57:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Is there such a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1137
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:39.180
<v Speaker 2>one thing to remember is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have direct a hierarchical </v>

1138
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:43.471
<v Speaker 2>structure with to he matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got no positive motivation because </v>

1139
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.890
<v Speaker 2>you experience positive motivation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to a goal,</v>

1140
00:57:47.891 --> 00:57:52.891
<v Speaker 2>not from attaining the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that satisfaction and besides it's </v>

1141
00:57:52.891 --> 00:57:53.770
<v Speaker 2>fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know perfectly well,</v>

1142
00:57:53.771 --> 00:57:55.600
<v Speaker 2>you graduate from university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poof,</v>

1143
00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.870
<v Speaker 2>next day you have a problem which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do next?</v>

1144
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:01.060
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough problem.</v>

1145
00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like you've solved your </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1146
00:58:03.161 --> 00:58:08.161
<v Speaker 2>By winning that game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just introduced the problem of </v>

1147
00:58:08.161 --> 00:58:11.311
<v Speaker 2>having to introduce another game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's unreliable as a source of </v>

1148
00:58:11.311 --> 00:58:15.511
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's reliable is you set a goal </v>

1149
00:58:15.511 --> 00:58:17.320
<v Speaker 2>and you try to attain it and then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives your life.</v>

1150
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:21.190
<v Speaker 2>That literally provides your life with </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

1151
00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 2>That's what meaning is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's more than that,</v>

1152
00:58:24.161 --> 00:58:25.600
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

1153
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.430
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1154
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:31.420
<v Speaker 2>what's a really good goal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1155
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.060
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a really good goal?</v>

1156
00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:35.440
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1157
00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:40.441
<v Speaker 2>so you got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm going to walk through at </v>

1158
00:58:40.441 --> 00:58:40.441
<v Speaker 2>least partly through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see how far we get.</v>

1159
00:58:40.441 --> 00:58:45.331
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to walk through Pinocchio with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you because that's what the movie's </v>

1160
00:58:45.331 --> 00:58:45.331
<v Speaker 2>about and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1161
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:51.030
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say how it came about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was written the story by a guy </v>

1162
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:53.230
<v Speaker 2>named cody I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>c o l l O v I,</v>

1163
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:54.520
<v Speaker 2>and it's quite a bit different.</v>

1164
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.870
<v Speaker 2>The story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that story,</v>

1165
00:58:55.871 --> 00:59:00.871
<v Speaker 2>the written one from the Disney version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Disney version was a product of the </v>

1166
00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:03.730
<v Speaker 2>collaboration of geniuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of animation essentially.</v>

1167
00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:08.731
<v Speaker 2>So they were artistic geniuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great at capturing motion and emotion </v>

1168
00:59:08.731 --> 00:59:12.931
<v Speaker 2>and all of that be stellar at that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>imaginative,</v>

1169
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:16.450
<v Speaker 2>tremendously imaginative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but collectively imaginative.</v>

1170
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 2>And so they put together a collective </v>
<v Speaker 2>product and you might say,</v>

1171
00:59:20.081 --> 00:59:21.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did they do that?</v>

1172
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1173
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:24.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were good storytellers.</v>

1174
00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.210
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1175
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 2>it means you don't want the story that </v>
<v Speaker 2>works and the story that doesn't.</v>

1176
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:34.700
<v Speaker 2>And maybe partly what you do is you kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of think out a story and you think,</v>

1177
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if this happens?</v>

1178
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this should happen.</v>

1179
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

1180
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would work.</v>

1181
00:59:41.091 --> 00:59:42.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like the little flash of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration,</v>

1182
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:47.921
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got a piece of the puzzle </v>

1183
00:59:47.921 --> 00:59:47.921
<v Speaker 2>that fits you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1184
00:59:47.921 --> 00:59:51.011
<v Speaker 2>that would work there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you talk to the other people </v>

1185
00:59:51.011 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 2>and you generate ideas and someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1186
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:51.830
<v Speaker 2>what if.</v>

1187
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:53.870
<v Speaker 2>What if they do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone goes now,</v>

1188
00:59:53.871 --> 00:59:56.660
<v Speaker 2>now that's just not believable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to buy that,</v>

1189
00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.030
<v Speaker 2>and someone else has a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation.</v>

1190
00:59:59.031 --> 00:59:59.570
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1191
00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:02.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes some sense somehow with if they</v>

1192
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:03.590
<v Speaker 2>do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody goes,</v>

1193
01:00:03.591 --> 01:00:04.150
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1194
01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 2>that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really,</v>

1195
01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:07.130
<v Speaker 2>that really works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1196
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.260
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1197
01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1198
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know why it works,</v>

1199
01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:18.200
<v Speaker 2>but it works because it works because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the right story.</v>

1200
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.840
<v Speaker 2>And so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1201
01:00:20.841 --> 01:00:23.660
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of associated with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>metagame idea.</v>

1202
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:29.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's a story that you </v>

1203
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:29.870
<v Speaker 2>should be acting out that works across </v>
<v Speaker 2>games and you have an inkling of it.</v>

1204
01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.750
<v Speaker 2>You have a notion of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a vague apprehension of it.</v>

1205
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.910
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of built into that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetype,</v>

1206
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:39.940
<v Speaker 2>that's an archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then when you read a story that </v>

1207
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:43.121
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just entranced by it and you all </v>

1208
01:00:43.121 --> 01:00:45.611
<v Speaker 2>know that you go to a movie and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great movie and it's like you're just </v>

1209
01:00:45.611 --> 01:00:45.611
<v Speaker 2>blown away.</v>

1210
01:00:45.611 --> 01:00:46.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a movie,</v>

1211
01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:51.041
<v Speaker 2>can pull you in and turn you into one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the screen characters and like run you </v>

1212
01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:55.931
<v Speaker 2>through a huge set of emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this movie once about South </v>

1213
01:00:55.931 --> 01:01:00.400
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started with this guy running out of </v>

1214
01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.901
<v Speaker 2>a subway naked and he didn't know where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was and it turned out that he had </v>

1215
01:01:01.901 --> 01:01:05.441
<v Speaker 2>been absconded by the totalitarian death</v>
<v Speaker 2>squads and he couldn't remember anything</v>

1216
01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:08.960
<v Speaker 2>about himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he went back to his village.</v>

1217
01:01:08.961 --> 01:01:13.961
<v Speaker 2>And basically what happened was that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up back in the totalitarian death </v>

1218
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:17.760
<v Speaker 2>grip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was.</v>

1219
01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:22.580
<v Speaker 2>It showed how the fascist state had </v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated the village completely.</v>

1220
01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.930
<v Speaker 2>And so it was a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could see with every action that</v>

1221
01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.480
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amnestic guy,</v>

1222
01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:32.990
<v Speaker 2>as he recreated him himself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>remembered his identity,</v>

1223
01:01:32.991 --> 01:01:36.680
<v Speaker 2>was going to travel down exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same road because nothing had changed.</v>

1224
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:40.850
<v Speaker 2>And by the time I wish I've looked for </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that movie was for years,</v>

1225
01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I've never been able to find it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when the movie was over,</v>

1226
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:49.220
<v Speaker 2>every single person in the theater was </v>
<v Speaker 2>crying and not just a little bit.</v>

1227
01:01:49.221 --> 01:01:52.460
<v Speaker 2>It was like they were just out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was brilliant,</v>

1228
01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.520
<v Speaker 2>terrifying movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that meant there was some write </v>

1229
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.300
<v Speaker 2>about it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it got people and you might say,</v>

1230
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:04.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have dim apprehensions about the </v>

1231
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:07.691
<v Speaker 2>world and some of those are instinctual </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of them are a consequence of </v>

1232
01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:08.570
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your experience.</v>

1233
01:02:08.571 --> 01:02:13.571
<v Speaker 2>And it's like the pieces are fragmented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you get away from them a long </v>

1234
01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:15.920
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you could see how they fit together,</v>

1235
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:21.130
<v Speaker 2>but they're fragmented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you go see a story and those </v>

1236
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:21.130
<v Speaker 2>pieces go click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

1237
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:21.130
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

1238
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:21.240
<v Speaker 2>click.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

1239
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:22.290
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

1240
01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 2>that's how that works out.</v>

1241
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what that means.</v>

1242
01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>And that produces that overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>

1243
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:32.571
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly how you make yourself </v>

1244
01:02:32.571 --> 01:02:33.720
<v Speaker 2>transparent to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1245
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.450
<v Speaker 2>you go experience the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who watched the story,</v>

1246
01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:39.330
<v Speaker 2>you tell a story and you start to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>out who you are by doing that.</v>

1247
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:45.860
<v Speaker 2>My nephew had a dream at one point </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone made a little animated thing out</v>

1248
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.310
<v Speaker 2>of it and put it on the intranet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite cool.</v>

1249
01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.630
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1250
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:56.660
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was having night terrors and he ran </v>

1251
01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:56.660
<v Speaker 2>around like a little night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1252
01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kai,</v>

1253
01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>k and Igh t night,</v>

1254
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.470
<v Speaker 2>and he had little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1255
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:06.710
<v Speaker 2>armor and a sword and he run around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house with little white hat on being the</v>

1256
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.030
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was only like four or something.</v>

1257
01:03:09.031 --> 01:03:10.980
<v Speaker 2>And he'd watched his lot of Disney </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

1258
01:03:10.981 --> 01:03:13.410
<v Speaker 2>lot of movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he kinda got the night idea was,</v>

1259
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.550
<v Speaker 2>it was at his acting that out and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>having these terrorists at night.</v>

1260
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he'd go to bed with his little </v>

1261
01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:22.610
<v Speaker 2>night hat and his sword and he put them </v>
<v Speaker 2>on is bad.</v>

1262
01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:24.600
<v Speaker 2>And then at night he'd wake up </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming.</v>

1263
01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:28.110
<v Speaker 2>And that happened for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I went to visit,</v>

1264
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:28.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1265
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I found out that this was happening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a night terror,</v>

1266
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:37.160
<v Speaker 2>so the kid wakes up with night terrors </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming but can't remember anything </v>

1267
01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1268
01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>this was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happened one day?</v>

1269
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:43.500
<v Speaker 2>And I was sitting with him and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>family at the,</v>

1270
01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.810
<v Speaker 2>at the breakfast table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

1271
01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:46.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>

1272
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:48.120
<v Speaker 2>did he have a dream?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1273
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a dream.</v>

1274
01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:50.400
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1275
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:51.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was your dream?</v>

1276
01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:52.440
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

1277
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out on this field and,</v>

1278
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:57.810
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was surrounded by these dwarfs.</v>

1279
01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:59.970
<v Speaker 2>And they came up to my knees and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

1280
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.120
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have any arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had big feet and they were covered </v>

1281
01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.991
<v Speaker 2>with hair and there was a cross shaved </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top of their head and they were </v>

1282
01:04:08.991 --> 01:04:11.571
<v Speaker 2>all greasy and they had huge beaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everywhere I went they jumped at me </v>

1283
01:04:11.571 --> 01:04:12.390
<v Speaker 2>with their beaks and there was lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1284
01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:17.690
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was very quiet after he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said this because it was like that,</v>

1285
01:04:17.761 --> 01:04:19.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you're screaming at night.</v>

1286
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:20.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1287
01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:22.230
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1288
01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:24.210
<v Speaker 2>so and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1289
01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:25.320
<v Speaker 2>and then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1290
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:30.410
<v Speaker 2>but at the background there was a dragon</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the dragon would blow out smoke and </v>

1291
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>fire and then it would turn into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwarfs.</v>

1292
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1293
01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:34.770
<v Speaker 2>that kid had a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1294
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:35.730
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1295
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:37.320
<v Speaker 2>what are you gonna do you fight off a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwarf?</v>

1296
01:04:37.321 --> 01:04:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

1297
01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like puff 10 more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's life,</v>

1298
01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:42.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's life.</v>

1299
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Hydra.</v>

1300
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.950
<v Speaker 2>You cut off one head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven more grow.</v>

1301
01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 2>That's life snakes everywhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of one,</v>

1302
01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:53.730
<v Speaker 2>there'll be more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he figured that out.</v>

1303
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a hell of an existential shock when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're four.</v>

1304
01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:58.410
<v Speaker 2>And so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a knight.</v>

1305
01:04:58.411 --> 01:05:03.411
<v Speaker 2>He's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I do about these dwarfs while </v>

1306
01:05:03.411 --> 01:05:03.411
<v Speaker 2>there's too many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a dragon also.</v>

1307
01:05:03.411 --> 01:05:03.870
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1308
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.990
<v Speaker 2>what could you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1309
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Loaded question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It implies that you could do something </v>

1310
01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:12.450
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1311
01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:17.451
<v Speaker 2>he kind of knew that which is why he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>running around like a night and he kind </v>

1312
01:05:17.451 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 2>of figured out and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1313
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:23.611
<v Speaker 2>I get my dad and I jump up on the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I poke out both of its size with my </v>

1314
01:05:23.611 --> 01:05:26.530
<v Speaker 2>sword and then I go right down in </v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach to the place where the fire came</v>

1315
01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:31.531
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the firebox and then I carve a piece of </v>

1316
01:05:31.531 --> 01:05:31.531
<v Speaker 2>the firebox out at.</v>

1317
01:05:31.531 --> 01:05:33.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd make a shield and that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of that.</v>

1318
01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:34.630
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1319
01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.350
<v Speaker 2>good work kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you really got it right.</v>

1320
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:41.080
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the central human story.</v>

1321
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 2>There's the terrible unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1322
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Fire-Breathing generating trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you do?</v>

1323
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:52.021
<v Speaker 2>You confront that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you confront that and by confronting it </v>

1324
01:05:52.021 --> 01:05:53.380
<v Speaker 2>you get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the shield and that's,</v>

1325
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:57.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what a human being is and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1326
01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:02.320
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the end of his night </v>

1327
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:02.320
<v Speaker 2>terrors by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems too good to be true,</v>

1328
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.290
<v Speaker 2>but it is actually true because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>followed up with his mother for a long </v>

1329
01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.830
<v Speaker 2>time and that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He catalyzed that part of his identity.</v>

1330
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:14.250
<v Speaker 2>He adopted the role of the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero and that's what he needed to do </v>

1331
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:16.570
<v Speaker 2>because like there was lots of drag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a dragon and a bunch of dwarfs.</v>

1332
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are you going to do about </v>

1333
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:21.630
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to help.</v>

1334
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:22.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you run into dream like that,</v>

1335
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:26.500
<v Speaker 2>the doors multiply and they get bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get smaller as you run.</v>

1336
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:30.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's not a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not a good solution.</v>

1337
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:33.100
<v Speaker 2>And people do that in their life all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1338
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:38.520
<v Speaker 2>And so the dwarves get bigger until </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're giants and they get smaller </v>

1339
01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.940
<v Speaker 2>until there's nothing left of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1340
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.810
<v Speaker 2>then there's no recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not good.</v>

1341
01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:47.000
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1342
01:06:47.001 --> 01:06:48.180
<v Speaker 2>So now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1343
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Also propose to you that there there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolic structure to the world.</v>

1344
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:55.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a metal structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

1345
01:06:55.490 --> 01:07:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I think these categories are truly real </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're there basically this,</v>

1346
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:05.130
<v Speaker 2>there's unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's explored territory and there's </v>

1347
01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:10.151
<v Speaker 2>you and unexplored territory is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>source of great riches and it probably </v>

1348
01:07:10.881 --> 01:07:15.881
<v Speaker 2>will kill you and explored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Territory is your culture and it </v>

1349
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:19.031
<v Speaker 2>crunches you into submission and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conformity and turns you into a </v>

1350
01:07:19.031 --> 01:07:23.501
<v Speaker 2>civilized being and you're stuck with </v>
<v Speaker 2>both of those and then there's you and </v>

1351
01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:25.760
<v Speaker 2>you know you're kind of admirable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool and you do a lot of decent,</v>

1352
01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:30.790
<v Speaker 2>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing things and there's things about </v>

1353
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:32.570
<v Speaker 2>you that are just horrible and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know about them and you're stuck</v>

1354
01:07:32.571 --> 01:07:35.690
<v Speaker 2>with them and that's the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

1355
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:40.490
<v Speaker 2>that's the landscape of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you'll see if you pay attention</v>

1356
01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:45.230
<v Speaker 2>is that people who aren't ideologues </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Rousseau or say like hobbs,</v>

1357
01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:50.530
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot logs will tell you part of that </v>

1358
01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:50.960
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So environmentalist's for example,</v>

1359
01:07:50.961 --> 01:07:55.490
<v Speaker 2>we'll say nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pristine beauty,</v>

1360
01:07:56.210 --> 01:08:00.020
<v Speaker 2>natural harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a French landscape,</v>

1361
01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.000
<v Speaker 2>be it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a paradise,</v>

1362
01:08:02.001 --> 01:08:04.250
<v Speaker 2>especially if there are no people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a paradise.</v>

1363
01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:09.580
<v Speaker 2>And then culture is a rapacious monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and human beings driving that culture </v>

1364
01:08:10.731 --> 01:08:11.870
<v Speaker 2>against nature are</v>

1365
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.370
<v Speaker 2>monsters of a sort that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps</v>

1366
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.930
<v Speaker 1>there should be fewer of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1367
01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1368
01:08:18.351 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 1>that's all true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1369
01:08:19.671 --> 01:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead on.</v>

1370
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Right on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

1371
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that movie called Avatar?</v>

1372
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's James Cameron's movie,</v>

1373
01:08:29.211 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that story.</v>

1374
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1375
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good story.</v>

1376
01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.210
<v Speaker 1>It's even a mythological story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's only half the story.</v>

1377
01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.360
<v Speaker 1>The other story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it as a frontier </v>

1378
01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.650
<v Speaker 1>myth that star trek or star wars for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that better mostly star Trek.</v>

1379
01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:46.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1380
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>but we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll put it in context to the frontier </v>

1381
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:54.780
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The myth that drew settlers into America</v>

1382
01:08:54.781 --> 01:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1383
01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:01.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a wild savage landscape out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that can be conquered by unsettled</v>

1384
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>and stabilized by civilization and it'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the heroic pioneer who does it.</v>

1385
01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the opposite story of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental story,</v>

1386
01:09:09.871 --> 01:09:14.871
<v Speaker 1>which is actually why I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental story of eventually </v>

1387
01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:17.481
<v Speaker 1>emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the frontier story called how to </v>

1388
01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:21.981
<v Speaker 1>lack and it missed half of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the other story I had to come up </v>

1389
01:09:21.981 --> 01:09:23.550
<v Speaker 1>and it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you take both of those stories,</v>

1390
01:09:23.551 --> 01:09:26.400
<v Speaker 1>even though they're exactly opposite to </v>
<v Speaker 1>one another,</v>

1391
01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:31.730
<v Speaker 1>if you know both of those stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know the whole story and it's </v>

1392
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:31.730
<v Speaker 1>really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1393
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:36.681
<v Speaker 1>because one of the propositions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>formal logic is it's a fundamental </v>

1394
01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:42.441
<v Speaker 1>proposition is that something can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and its opposite at the same </v>

1395
01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:42.441
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1396
01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's true for some sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1397
01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:50.480
<v Speaker 1>It's true for logical claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's completely wrong in this </v>

1398
01:09:50.581 --> 01:09:55.581
<v Speaker 1>particular situation because things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what they are and they're opposite </v>

1399
01:09:55.581 --> 01:09:57.240
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes it very,</v>

1400
01:09:57.241 --> 01:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why a dragon hordes gold.</v>

1401
01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:02.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with that?</v>

1402
01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll eat you and it will,</v>

1403
01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>but it has gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1404
01:10:08.641 --> 01:10:10.950
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's,</v>

1405
01:10:10.951 --> 01:10:13.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's paradoxical demands.</v>

1406
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do is face the dragon </v>

1407
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:18.500
<v Speaker 1>and get the damn goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to do.</v>

1408
01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a paradoxical being even </v>

1409
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:23.570
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1410
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1411
01:10:24.191 --> 01:10:26.550
<v Speaker 1>in the Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1412
01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.020
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name,</v>

1413
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Frodo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1414
01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1415
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:32.010
<v Speaker 1>or it's Bilbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo in the Harvard,</v>

1416
01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of this little underdeveloped</v>

1417
01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.840
<v Speaker 1>overprotected shire dweller and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called on a great adventure to go and </v>

1418
01:10:43.501 --> 01:10:48.501
<v Speaker 1>find the dragon and he has to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thief in order to manage it.</v>

1419
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty weird,</v>

1420
01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:52.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1421
01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1422
01:10:52.741 --> 01:10:57.741
<v Speaker 1>it's because as a good citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just not enough to conquer a </v>

1423
01:10:57.751 --> 01:11:00.900
<v Speaker 1>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked to also become a bad citizen in</v>

1424
01:11:00.901 --> 01:11:05.901
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to incorporate the part of </v>

1425
01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:05.901
<v Speaker 1>themselves that's monstrous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1426
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.570
<v Speaker 1>and develop that and hone it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's to say that,</v>

1427
01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:10.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are harmless,</v>

1428
01:11:10.951 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 1>you're not virtuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just harmless.</v>

1429
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 1>You're like a rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rabbit isn't virtuous.</v>

1430
01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:21.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't do anything except get eaten.</v>

1431
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a monster and you don't act </v>

1432
01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>monstrously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're virtuous.</v>

1433
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>But you also have to be a monster while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this all the time.</v>

1434
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter's like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's,</v>

1435
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>he's flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's hurt.</v>

1436
01:11:35.371 --> 01:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>He's got evil in him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can talk to snakes.</v>

1437
01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he breaks rules all the time,</v>

1438
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:43.050
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not an obedient at all,</v>

1439
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.320
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a good reason for breaking the </v>

1440
01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:48.320
<v Speaker 1>rules and if he couldn't break the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>

1441
01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.250
<v Speaker 1>him and his little clique of rule </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking,</v>

1442
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:51.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>troublemakers.</v>

1443
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.920
<v Speaker 1>If they didn't break the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't attain the highest goal.</v>

1444
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's very peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

1445
01:11:58.441 --> 01:11:59.220
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

1446
01:11:59.221 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1447
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:03.530
<v Speaker 1>very common mythological notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1448
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.620
<v Speaker 1>the hero has to be,</v>

1449
01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:10.780
<v Speaker 1>the hero has to be a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a controlled monster.</v>

1450
01:12:10.781 --> 01:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Batman is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1451
01:12:12.431 --> 01:12:13.210
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's everywhere.</v>

1452
01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It's tour story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always hear meaning.</v>

1453
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:20.570
<v Speaker 1>We have to be more precise.</v>

1454
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>

1455
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:32.060
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question because one </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is,</v>

1456
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of implicitly moral insofar </v>

1457
01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:37.670
<v Speaker 1>as you're socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's sort of procedural.</v>

1458
01:12:37.671 --> 01:12:39.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just built into you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is different.</v>

1459
01:12:39.711 --> 01:12:44.711
<v Speaker 1>This is also becoming conscious of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and expanding out your personality into </v>

1460
01:12:44.711 --> 01:12:45.950
<v Speaker 1>dimensions that it wouldn't normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy.</v>

1461
01:12:45.951 --> 01:12:50.180
<v Speaker 1>So this happens to people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1462
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:55.390
<v Speaker 1>lots of my clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my clinical clients are too agreeable </v>

1463
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're generally women because women </v>

1464
01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.181
<v Speaker 1>are more agreeable than men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not always because I've had </v>

1465
01:13:01.181 --> 01:13:01.181
<v Speaker 1>agreeable man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his clients as well,</v>

1466
01:13:01.181 --> 01:13:05.620
<v Speaker 1>and what happens is they're resentful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't know how to stand up for </v>

1467
01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:07.580
<v Speaker 1>themselves and it's because they're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate by nature.</v>

1468
01:13:07.581 --> 01:13:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're entering into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiation with them,</v>

1469
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:12.620
<v Speaker 1>they'll let you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1470
01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.960
<v Speaker 1>that's not so good because you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to win too.</v>

1471
01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're in an organization </v>
<v Speaker 1>of adults where there's,</v>

1472
01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1473
01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.810
<v Speaker 1>When you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can let them win,</v>

1474
01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:29.200
<v Speaker 1>especially infants like you have to let </v>
<v Speaker 1>them win and that's partly why </v>

1475
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.100
<v Speaker 1>compassion is so necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a,</v>

1476
01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:34.910
<v Speaker 1>as a basis for negotiation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults,</v>

1477
01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1478
01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.090
<v Speaker 1>it's insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

1479
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.480
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a bit of a monster so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can say no.</v>

1480
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:46.870
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of what you do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is treat people's anxiety </v>

1481
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:47.780
<v Speaker 1>and depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge chunk of it.</v>

1482
01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Help them straighten out the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1483
01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge chunk of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another chunk of it is,</v>

1484
01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's toughen you up.</v>

1485
01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:59.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put you in a position where you </v>

1486
01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.881
<v Speaker 1>can bargain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's teach you how to assert yourself </v>

1487
01:14:00.881 --> 01:14:03.821
<v Speaker 1>and stand up for yourself and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training and it's a huge </v>

1488
01:14:03.821 --> 01:14:04.280
<v Speaker 1>chunk of psychotherapy and you need to.</v>

1489
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>You need to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like because part of how you </v>

1490
01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:14.021
<v Speaker 1>regulate your interactions with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to negotiate and you cannot </v>

1491
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:17.080
<v Speaker 1>negotiate unless you can say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it,</v>

1492
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>and its causes conflict to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't like conflict,</v>

1493
01:14:20.651 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being agreeable,</v>

1494
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:28.140
<v Speaker 1>then you can't tolerate the conflict and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you can't negotiate on your own </v>

1495
01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:30.790
<v Speaker 1>behalf and so then you keep losing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bullied and you know it's,</v>

1496
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you get resentful and,</v>

1497
01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:37.921
<v Speaker 1>and it's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to develop your inner </v>

1498
01:14:37.921 --> 01:14:41.950
<v Speaker 1>monster a little bit and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that makes you a better person.</v>

1499
01:14:41.951 --> 01:14:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Not a worst person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1500
01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.640
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1501
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:51.990
<v Speaker 1>but that's just how it is outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that diagram is chaos itself and that's </v>

1502
01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:00.250
<v Speaker 1>the chaos from which things emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1503
01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you much about that yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's too damn complicated,</v>

1504
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:07.930
<v Speaker 1>but I think the best way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is as potential.</v>

1505
01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also that place you end up when you</v>

1506
01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:12.730
<v Speaker 1>don't know what to do.</v>

1507
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the source of all things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the terrible Predator,</v>

1508
01:15:19.721 --> 01:15:23.830
<v Speaker 1>the terrible eternal Predator that lurks</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the explored domain.</v>

1509
01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a winged dragon and it's weighing </v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows why matter and spirit.</v>

1510
01:15:29.801 --> 01:15:31.990
<v Speaker 1>That's partly what it is and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain that later.</v>

1511
01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:37.140
<v Speaker 1>It's also potentially the predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>beast that's been after us for for </v>

1512
01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:41.590
<v Speaker 1>forever and the winged Predator that </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked us up from the sky.</v>

1513
01:15:41.591 --> 01:15:43.450
<v Speaker 1>So primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1514
01:15:43.451 --> 01:15:47.410
<v Speaker 1>monkeys have some monkeys have three </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized alarm cries,</v>

1515
01:15:47.411 --> 01:15:52.330
<v Speaker 1>one is for snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that usually means hit the trees and</v>

1516
01:15:52.331 --> 01:15:57.331
<v Speaker 1>then one's for leopards and that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the trees and go out on a skinny </v>

1517
01:15:57.331 --> 01:15:57.331
<v Speaker 1>branch because the leopard can't get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1518
01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 1>And then there's one for like birds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prey,</v>

1519
01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:03.070
<v Speaker 1>which means hide somewhere on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't get picked off.</v>

1520
01:16:03.071 --> 01:16:04.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1521
01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:07.750
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>

1522
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:13.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's expanded into much more than </v>

1523
01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:14.530
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I showed you,</v>

1524
01:16:14.531 --> 01:16:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if I showed you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is.</v>

1525
01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.720
<v Speaker 1>This is a symbolic representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother nature for their culture and the </v>

1526
01:16:22.751 --> 01:16:25.630
<v Speaker 1>suffering individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's all that's all positive.</v>

1527
01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:29.500
<v Speaker 1>There's no negative elements there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

1528
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:34.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a partial representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those things are sacred in some </v>

1529
01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:37.801
<v Speaker 1>sense because they are representative of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ultimate reality of an ultimate </v>

1530
01:16:37.871 --> 01:16:42.871
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sacrificial individual hear the </v>

1531
01:16:42.871 --> 01:16:42.871
<v Speaker 1>suffering individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1532
01:16:42.871 --> 01:16:43.780
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1533
01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:47.120
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's life,</v>

1534
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:49.520
<v Speaker 1>that's suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's life,</v>

1535
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:54.140
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens to the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everyone is looking at that.</v>

1536
01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:56.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has power,</v>

1537
01:16:56.241 --> 01:16:58.700
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1538
01:16:58.701 --> 01:17:02.270
<v Speaker 1>it's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture supports the suffering,</v>

1539
01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:05.660
<v Speaker 1>individual cultures nested inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolent nature.</v>

1540
01:17:05.661 --> 01:17:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1541
01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And this part of the story we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out and make articulate.</v>

1542
01:17:11.931 --> 01:17:16.931
<v Speaker 1>We'd been doing that for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years trying to make this story </v>

1543
01:17:16.931 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>articulate and it's not yet articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1544
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:23.130
<v Speaker 1>It's only we're only getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're only getting it and we.</v>

1545
01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:28.190
<v Speaker 1>We basically do that now mostly with </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies and stories and fiction and that </v>

1546
01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:29.450
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still don't have it articulated.</v>

1547
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I think young when he came closer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else,</v>

1548
01:17:32.721 --> 01:17:35.030
<v Speaker 1>young and an Eric Norman who was one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his students,</v>

1549
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:40.180
<v Speaker 1>came closer than anyone else ever has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually articulate about and that's </v>

1550
01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.080
<v Speaker 1>what you and was trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to take all these images,</v>

1551
01:17:42.081 --> 01:17:45.320
<v Speaker 1>archetipal images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctual images and say,</v>

1552
01:17:45.321 --> 01:17:46.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they mean?</v>

1553
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.660
<v Speaker 1>What do they mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they mean?</v>

1554
01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:53.020
<v Speaker 1>And he got a long ways on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although his writing is quite obscure </v>

1555
01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.081
<v Speaker 1>and it's obscured because how the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to explain an image like </v>

1556
01:17:56.081 --> 01:17:59.771
<v Speaker 1>that without being obscure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's insanely complicated and </v>

1557
01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:05.501
<v Speaker 1>it's not linear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a linear thing that that's why </v>

1558
01:18:05.501 --> 01:18:08.270
<v Speaker 1>it's in a picture because a picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>presents everything at once and you want</v>

1559
01:18:08.271 --> 01:18:10.220
<v Speaker 1>to take that apart linearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1560
01:18:10.221 --> 01:18:12.320
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just impossible,</v>

1561
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:14.300
<v Speaker 1>but we've been struggling to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1562
01:18:14.301 --> 01:18:18.320
<v Speaker 1>We'd been struggling to do that from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time we became self conscious,</v>

1563
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the world about?</v>

1564
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:24.170
<v Speaker 1>How should we live in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that's a partial answer,</v>

1565
01:18:24.171 --> 01:18:26.750
<v Speaker 1>and it's a culture bound answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1566
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.430
<v Speaker 1>but you see archetypal representations </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this and many cultures,</v>

1567
01:18:31.431 --> 01:18:36.431
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the image of the Virgin and child that </v>

1568
01:18:36.431 --> 01:18:36.860
<v Speaker 1>way predates Christianity.</v>

1569
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Like the Egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was isis and horace.</v>

1570
01:18:39.471 --> 01:18:40.870
<v Speaker 1>That goes back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1571
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:45.910
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how far thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years before the emergence </v>

1572
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:50.861
<v Speaker 1>of Judaism and Christianity way back </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that and no doubt back into </v>

1573
01:18:51.381 --> 01:18:56.381
<v Speaker 1>prehistory itself because a culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't hold the mother and child as </v>

1574
01:18:58.011 --> 01:19:03.011
<v Speaker 1>sacred dies obviously because obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it has to be held as it has to be </v>

1575
01:19:08.781 --> 01:19:13.781
<v Speaker 1>held as something that you revere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which at least means you don't kill </v>

1576
01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.400
<v Speaker 1>mothers and children and at least means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1577
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:19.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's an instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1578
01:19:19.011 --> 01:19:21.890
<v Speaker 1>it's an instinct and violates you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1579
01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:25.450
<v Speaker 1>And thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1580
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:31.120
<v Speaker 1>let's take 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I told you about this a little bit </v>

1581
01:19:34.141 --> 01:19:35.340
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1582
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the motivations I had for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking the things that I've thought </v>

1583
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:42.960
<v Speaker 1>through the motivation I had for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking them through was because,</v>

1584
01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:45.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1585
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1586
01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:47.800
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1587
01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it seemed self evident to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1588
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:56.450
<v Speaker 1>and I think that was partly from reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>you but not that just helped me clarify,</v>

1589
01:19:56.490 --> 01:20:01.490
<v Speaker 1>was that it was sort of humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>contention that we had an organic </v>

1590
01:20:03.481 --> 01:20:08.481
<v Speaker 1>development of a metaphysical ethic that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was embedded in,</v>

1591
01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:11.940
<v Speaker 1>in religious tradition and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically unfolded,</v>

1592
01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the West until about 1600,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1500,</v>

1593
01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:15.900
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1594
01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And then science emerged and we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably technologically powerful </v>

1595
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>art and using a certain view of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1596
01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:29.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so technologically powerful but </v>

1597
01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:32.190
<v Speaker 1>we're still not very wise and that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to be a bad combination.</v>

1598
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:35.010
<v Speaker 1>And I thought about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1599
01:20:35.011 --> 01:20:40.011
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how do you handle the combination </v>

1600
01:20:40.011 --> 01:20:41.310
<v Speaker 1>of exceptional technological power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an impaired ethic,</v>

1601
01:20:41.311 --> 01:20:44.640
<v Speaker 1>let's say something like that under </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed ethic or one even in which you</v>

1602
01:20:44.641 --> 01:20:49.641
<v Speaker 1>have no faith because you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that the foundational elements </v>

1603
01:20:49.741 --> 01:20:52.530
<v Speaker 1>of it are irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there in mythology,</v>

1604
01:20:52.531 --> 01:20:57.531
<v Speaker 1>there in religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't fit well with the scientific </v>

1605
01:20:57.531 --> 01:20:58.320
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you rectify that problem?</v>

1606
01:20:58.470 --> 01:21:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And while that's a tough problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1607
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:04.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy problem and certainly it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the problem that young was trying to</v>

1608
01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:06.240
<v Speaker 1>address.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

1609
01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an associated problem which,</v>

1610
01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:10.270
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1611
01:21:10.330 --> 01:21:15.330
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was so awful and in so many </v>

1612
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:20.061
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just so unbelievably brutal and </v>

1613
01:21:20.061 --> 01:21:23.211
<v Speaker 1>terrible and it was perpetrated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people and they were </v>

1614
01:21:23.221 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 1>individual people and they weren't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much different from normal people.</v>

1615
01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.200
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were normal people.</v>

1616
01:21:28.201 --> 01:21:32.100
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing that struck me </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that it would be better if that sort</v>

1617
01:21:32.101 --> 01:21:37.101
<v Speaker 1>of thing didn't happen anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was trying to figure out what </v>

1618
01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:37.980
<v Speaker 1>the hell could possibly be done about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you know,</v>

1619
01:21:37.981 --> 01:21:41.730
<v Speaker 1>part of humans contention was while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to understand yourself as a monster,</v>

1620
01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:46.731
<v Speaker 1>if you were ever going to maintain some </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over the fact that you are in </v>

1621
01:21:46.731 --> 01:21:49.500
<v Speaker 1>fact the monster and that that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>come forth if the situation is correct.</v>

1622
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1623
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:55.611
<v Speaker 1>that seems reasonable and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it seemed to me that,</v>

1624
01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:01.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had to become wiser and of course</v>

1625
01:22:01.111 --> 01:22:06.111
<v Speaker 1>that's a very difficult thing to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out because you can even question </v>

1626
01:22:06.111 --> 01:22:06.370
<v Speaker 1>whether there is such a thing as wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1627
01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.820
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I thought,</v>

1628
01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:10.620
<v Speaker 1>well that's what the universities are </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do.</v>

1629
01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Especially the humanities mostly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

1630
01:22:13.381 --> 01:22:16.110
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to make you wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's for.</v>

1631
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:19.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's doing a terrible job of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my estimation.</v>

1632
01:22:19.651 --> 01:22:24.651
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more decimating people as far as I </v>

1633
01:22:24.651 --> 01:22:27.321
<v Speaker 1>can tell and undermining whatever ethic </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have rather than making people </v>

1634
01:22:27.321 --> 01:22:29.730
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

1635
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:33.840
<v Speaker 1>But I think that we have to become wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there a choice.</v>

1636
01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:38.841
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a matter of survival and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that because if you're </v>

1637
01:22:38.841 --> 01:22:42.201
<v Speaker 1>wise in your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a way better life </v>

1638
01:22:42.201 --> 01:22:45.230
<v Speaker 1>like incomparably better because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna sleep soundly with a good </v>

1639
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:50.961
<v Speaker 1>conscience at night and you know people </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that's worth more than money and </v>

1640
01:22:50.961 --> 01:22:54.680
<v Speaker 1>that's worth more than money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know lots of people who have lots of </v>

1641
01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:55.770
<v Speaker 1>money and let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money protects you.</v>

1642
01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Your as well protected from the world by</v>
<v Speaker 1>money right now as you ever will be for </v>

1643
01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.731
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your life because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of life's fundamental problems </v>

1644
01:23:04.731 --> 01:23:05.830
<v Speaker 1>can't be solved with money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1645
01:23:05.831 --> 01:23:08.650
<v Speaker 1>like rich people get divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have affairs.</v>

1646
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:13.651
<v Speaker 1>Their children get sick that they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the problems you have and that's </v>

1647
01:23:13.651 --> 01:23:15.040
<v Speaker 1>partly because you're already rich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1648
01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:19.750
<v Speaker 1>you might think that if you had a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>more money,</v>

1649
01:23:19.751 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>things would be better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not true.</v>

1650
01:23:21.671 --> 01:23:26.671
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways that they might be worse </v>

1651
01:23:26.671 --> 01:23:28.300
<v Speaker 1>because money can open up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can open up the possibility of all sorts</v>

1652
01:23:28.301 --> 01:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>of temptations to you that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't afford at the moment.</v>

1653
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.040
<v Speaker 1>So well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like economic economics,</v>

1654
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:41.220
<v Speaker 1>we've already solved that problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and we're rapidly solving </v>

1655
01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:41.220
<v Speaker 1>it everywhere in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1656
01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:45.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world economy is growing so damn </v>

1657
01:23:45.811 --> 01:23:47.260
<v Speaker 1>fast that you can't even imagine how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could possibly make it grow any faster.</v>

1658
01:23:47.261 --> 01:23:52.261
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've lifted hundreds of millions of </v>

1659
01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:53.110
<v Speaker 1>people out of poverty in the last 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1660
01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:55.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UN set a goal by 2015,</v>

1661
01:23:55.931 --> 01:23:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it was to cut poverty by half if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember correctly.</v>

1662
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:02.680
<v Speaker 1>And they reached it two years early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1663
01:24:02.681 --> 01:24:04.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable.</v>

1664
01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.230
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1665
01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I started to try to understand </v>

1666
01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.540
<v Speaker 1>what it might be to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live and,</v>

1667
01:24:15.541 --> 01:24:20.541
<v Speaker 1>and really what I was looking forward to</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not so much to live a life that was </v>

1668
01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:23.781
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least to live a life that wasn't </v>

1669
01:24:23.781 --> 01:24:26.210
<v Speaker 1>pathologically unwise and I thought of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of things that people were </v>

1670
01:24:27.031 --> 01:24:32.031
<v Speaker 1>doing to one another in Auschwitz camps </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the Gulag archipelago and all of </v>

1671
01:24:32.031 --> 01:24:36.861
<v Speaker 1>that horror that was perpetrated on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on people as definitely unwise.</v>

1672
01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Whatever else you might say about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was unwise.</v>

1673
01:24:40.381 --> 01:24:41.310
<v Speaker 1>And so then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1674
01:24:41.311 --> 01:24:43.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a way to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could not do that.</v>

1675
01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:50.190
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's my sense is that</v>

1676
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:54.510
<v Speaker 1>when you come to university to learn how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a civilized person,</v>

1677
01:24:54.630 --> 01:24:56.820
<v Speaker 1>which is what supposed to happen at </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

1678
01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:02.120
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it's just a trade school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well go to trade school as </v>

1679
01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.110
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to learn something that will</v>

1680
01:25:04.111 --> 01:25:09.111
<v Speaker 1>get you a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a lot faster and it's </v>

1681
01:25:09.111 --> 01:25:11.370
<v Speaker 1>more certain and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's useful.</v>

1682
01:25:11.730 --> 01:25:14.670
<v Speaker 1>If you're not being taught to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen at university,</v>

1683
01:25:14.671 --> 01:25:14.970
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

1684
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:22.030
<v Speaker 1>why bother with it so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're trying to figure </v>

1685
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:22.280
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1686
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:28.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of that cloud of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological fantasy that surrounds our </v>

1687
01:25:28.110 --> 01:25:32.921
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it's part of it's deep history </v>

1688
01:25:32.921 --> 01:25:35.150
<v Speaker 1>that we're trying to grapple with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities and with art and all of that,</v>

1689
01:25:35.151 --> 01:25:40.151
<v Speaker 1>that you're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to master and incorporate </v>

1690
01:25:40.151 --> 01:25:40.151
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1691
01:25:40.151 --> 01:25:44.580
<v Speaker 1>and pull into you so that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>situated properly in history and,</v>

1692
01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.950
<v Speaker 1>and you're not just floating in the void</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1693
01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:48.800
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1694
01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:53.300
<v Speaker 1>this tiny individuality that's divorced </v>
<v Speaker 1>from everything else.</v>

1695
01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.170
<v Speaker 1>You're weak in that circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1696
01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:58.130
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1697
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.900
<v Speaker 1>that's more of an explanation of why I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to puzzle through these things </v>

1698
01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:08.270
<v Speaker 1>and trying to puzzle through them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1699
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:10.870
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this,</v>

1700
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:13.430
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this song last week.</v>

1701
01:26:13.431 --> 01:26:15.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1702
01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I made a hypothesis to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go through this quickly.</v>

1703
01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Doggerel,</v>

1704
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:23.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not great poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's irrelevant.</v>

1705
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very popular song.</v>

1706
01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:31.571
<v Speaker 1>It's quite beautiful in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually sung by like a heavenly </v>

1707
01:26:31.571 --> 01:26:31.640
<v Speaker 1>choir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it sounds like.</v>

1708
01:26:31.641 --> 01:26:35.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's got this cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine people singing it in a</v>

1709
01:26:35.511 --> 01:26:38.180
<v Speaker 1>cathedral essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not accidental.</v>

1710
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.130
<v Speaker 1>It's purposeful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1711
01:26:40.131 --> 01:26:40.460
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1712
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:44.340
<v Speaker 1>it partakes of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

1713
01:26:44.610 --> 01:26:47.300
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it partakes of that aesthetic,</v>

1714
01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:47.930
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1715
01:26:47.931 --> 01:26:52.931
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the filmmakers are are implying that </v>

1716
01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:58.540
<v Speaker 1>what is about to be shown to you has </v>
<v Speaker 1>this divine element essentially,</v>

1717
01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:05.081
<v Speaker 1>and that that's signified by the choir </v>
<v Speaker 1>of voices that sings the song and the </v>

1718
01:27:08.031 --> 01:27:13.031
<v Speaker 1>song says so fundamentally something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is that if you lift up your </v>

1719
01:27:13.281 --> 01:27:16.640
<v Speaker 1>eyes above the temporal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the transcendent,</v>

1720
01:27:16.641 --> 01:27:21.230
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what exists in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavenly world.</v>

1721
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:23.480
<v Speaker 1>In the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pick a,</v>

1722
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.690
<v Speaker 1>an ultimate goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you pick the right ultimate goal,</v>

1723
01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:30.260
<v Speaker 1>then anyone can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

1724
01:27:30.261 --> 01:27:32.840
<v Speaker 1>It's democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's anyone can do this.</v>

1725
01:27:32.841 --> 01:27:35.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's the second proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter who you are,</v>

1726
01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:41.140
<v Speaker 1>you can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's a reflection of </v>

1727
01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:41.270
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the divinity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

1728
01:27:41.271 --> 01:27:45.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's something about each </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual that's valuable regardless of</v>

1729
01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:50.111
<v Speaker 1>their idiosyncrasies and and so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this potential that they can </v>

1730
01:27:50.111 --> 01:27:50.570
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you manifest it?</v>

1731
01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:53.360
<v Speaker 1>You pick the right goal and what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right goal?</v>

1732
01:27:53.361 --> 01:27:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1733
01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:55.850
<v Speaker 1>it's high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's elevated,</v>

1734
01:27:55.851 --> 01:27:58.910
<v Speaker 1>it's above the mundane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that mean?</v>

1735
01:27:58.911 --> 01:27:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know.</v>

1736
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:05.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it signified by a star and a </v>

1737
01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:05.270
<v Speaker 1>star is something that glimmers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

1738
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:10.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a source of light in the </v>

1739
01:28:10.330 --> 01:28:10.330
<v Speaker 1>darkness and so there's a metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1740
01:28:10.330 --> 01:28:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's a metaphor there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the star is the star,</v>

1741
01:28:14.241 --> 01:28:17.810
<v Speaker 1>that star of Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the person that you emulate.</v>

1742
01:28:17.811 --> 01:28:22.811
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it because it's an ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be a human ideal of some </v>

1743
01:28:22.811 --> 01:28:24.920
<v Speaker 1>sort that you're aiming out and so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal human being is,</v>

1744
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:28.310
<v Speaker 1>is the star that you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something like that.</v>

1745
01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:30.740
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you're aiming at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

1746
01:28:30.741 --> 01:28:32.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should you aim out in life?</v>

1747
01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:37.631
<v Speaker 1>And wanting to answer as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you aim at being whatever you </v>

1748
01:28:38.151 --> 01:28:39.920
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the best.</v>

1749
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:45.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what that is exactly </v>

1750
01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:45.400
<v Speaker 1>because how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1751
01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:50.111
<v Speaker 1>but you could think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that would be really good if I </v>

1752
01:28:50.111 --> 01:28:50.111
<v Speaker 1>could have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>

1753
01:28:50.111 --> 01:28:54.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I think of anything better than </v>

1754
01:28:54.191 --> 01:28:54.191
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is no,</v>

1755
01:28:54.191 --> 01:28:55.160
<v Speaker 1>then well why not go for that?</v>

1756
01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.170
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

1757
01:28:57.171 --> 01:28:58.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too ambitious,</v>

1758
01:28:58.701 --> 01:29:00.410
<v Speaker 1>it takes too much responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1759
01:29:00.411 --> 01:29:00.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1760
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.820
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are definitely problems.</v>

1761
01:29:02.821 --> 01:29:07.821
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I've figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out over the years is that if you </v>

1762
01:29:07.821 --> 01:29:07.821
<v Speaker 1>offered the person the opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1763
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:08.790
<v Speaker 1>because people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1764
01:29:08.791 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 1>life doesn't really have any ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

1765
01:29:11.281 --> 01:29:12.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1766
01:29:12.301 --> 01:29:13.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1767
01:29:13.051 --> 01:29:15.450
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it has an ultimate meaning,</v>

1768
01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.850
<v Speaker 1>but that in order to experience that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate meaning,</v>

1769
01:29:20.851 --> 01:29:24.960
<v Speaker 1>you have to take on ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for what you do.</v>

1770
01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a heavy price to pay,</v>

1771
01:29:27.031 --> 01:29:29.280
<v Speaker 1>to have a meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1772
01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1773
01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:31.620
<v Speaker 1>there's no damn way I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1774
01:29:31.621 --> 01:29:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go for the pointless.</v>

1775
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll go for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trivial pointless perspective,</v>

1776
01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.220
<v Speaker 1>which you know was kind of hard on me </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentially,</v>

1777
01:29:43.221 --> 01:29:45.980
<v Speaker 1>but it frees me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do whatever the hell I want moment</v>

1778
01:29:45.981 --> 01:29:50.981
<v Speaker 1>to moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any ultimate </v>

1779
01:29:50.981 --> 01:29:50.981
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>

1780
01:29:50.981 --> 01:29:52.220
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then then.</v>

1781
01:29:52.221 --> 01:29:54.530
<v Speaker 1>But that raises this weird specter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt,</v>

1782
01:29:54.531 --> 01:29:58.310
<v Speaker 1>which is why when you hear people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the ultimate futility of life,</v>

1783
01:29:58.610 --> 01:30:03.610
<v Speaker 1>is it because life is ultimately futile </v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it because they've decided that </v>

1784
01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:08.680
<v Speaker 1>they would just as soon not adopt the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and they use that real </v>

1785
01:30:08.691 --> 01:30:13.691
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to not adopt the </v>

1786
01:30:13.691 --> 01:30:15.281
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They rationalize that by proposing that </v>

1787
01:30:15.281 --> 01:30:16.880
<v Speaker 1>life is ultimately meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless,</v>

1788
01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.290
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1789
01:30:18.291 --> 01:30:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I kind of by that I really do think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going on.</v>

1790
01:30:21.230 --> 01:30:24.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not.</v>

1791
01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:30.670
<v Speaker 1>But it could be that if you want to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ultimately meaningful life that you </v>

1792
01:30:30.670 --> 01:30:33.320
<v Speaker 1>have to adopt ultimate responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

1793
01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:37.780
<v Speaker 1>What might that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1794
01:30:37.781 --> 01:30:41.400
<v Speaker 1>one thing it might mean is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do think it means this is it.</v>

1795
01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Alexander Pope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I might be wrong about that.</v>

1796
01:30:45.771 --> 01:30:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Who said nothing human is foreign to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a hell of a statement,</v>

1797
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:55.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you think about all the </v>

1798
01:30:55.570 --> 01:30:56.450
<v Speaker 1>things that human beings are capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're capable of some,</v>

1799
01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.540
<v Speaker 1>like if you really want to know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are capable of,</v>

1800
01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:02.120
<v Speaker 1>you should read about read about unit </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven slash 31,</v>

1801
01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.580
<v Speaker 1>but I would not recommend it because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you read it,</v>

1802
01:31:04.581 --> 01:31:07.490
<v Speaker 1>you will never forget it and you will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry that you read it,</v>

1803
01:31:08.210 --> 01:31:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but you'll know anyways to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing human is foreign to you.</v>

1804
01:31:14.301 --> 01:31:19.301
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a thing to say because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that what other people have </v>

1805
01:31:19.301 --> 01:31:23.351
<v Speaker 1>done you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also means you need to take </v>

1806
01:31:23.351 --> 01:31:25.520
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no joke.</v>

1807
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:30.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal to do that and even the </v>

1808
01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:32.960
<v Speaker 1>trivial manner anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that you can elevate.</v>

1809
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:37.220
<v Speaker 1>If you elevate your viewpoint to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent ethic,</v>

1810
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:40.310
<v Speaker 1>you want what's ultimately good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really want that.</v>

1811
01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you're even out says </v>

1812
01:31:45.411 --> 01:31:50.411
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then it says this strange thing </v>

1813
01:31:50.411 --> 01:31:50.411
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1814
01:31:50.411 --> 01:31:50.411
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll all of a sudden come to you.</v>

1815
01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a proposition.</v>

1816
01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:54.440
<v Speaker 1>The proposition that's basically played </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the movie,</v>

1817
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:58.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothesis is the best way to Orient</v>

1818
01:31:58.101 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 1>yourself in life is to orient yourself</v>

1819
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:05.040
<v Speaker 2>towards the highest good that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of imagining and then aim at </v>

1820
01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.210
<v Speaker 2>that and then things will work out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best way they can for you.</v>

1821
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:09.670
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's correct.</v>

1822
01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:13.120
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my observation of life has led me to see</v>

1823
01:32:13.121 --> 01:32:16.030
<v Speaker 2>that that seems to be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1824
01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:21.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't get something you don't aim at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just doesn't work out and so lots </v>

1825
01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:21.970
<v Speaker 2>of people are not thinking that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get.</v>

1826
01:32:22.330 --> 01:32:27.330
<v Speaker 2>So if you aim at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a reasonable crack at getting </v>

1827
01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:27.330
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1828
01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:31.500
<v Speaker 2>you tend to change what you're aiming at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bed along the way because like what </v>

1829
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:31.500
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1830
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:31.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aim there,</v>

1831
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:35.911
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong but you get a little closer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the aim there and you're still </v>

1832
01:32:35.911 --> 01:32:36.010
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a little closer to the aim there</v>

1833
01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:39.310
<v Speaker 2>and you know as you move towards what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're aiming at,</v>

1834
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:44.530
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your characterization of what to aim at </v>

1835
01:32:44.530 --> 01:32:44.530
<v Speaker 2>becomes more and more sophisticated.</v>

1836
01:32:44.530 --> 01:32:46.660
<v Speaker 2>And so it doesn't really matter if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong to begin with,</v>

1837
01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:51.661
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're smart enough to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way and as long as you specify a </v>

1838
01:32:51.661 --> 01:32:55.381
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I specify a vague what I want things </v>

1839
01:32:55.381 --> 01:32:56.740
<v Speaker 2>to be the best they could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm willing to learn what best means</v>

1840
01:32:56.741 --> 01:32:58.240
<v Speaker 2>as I go along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1841
01:32:58.241 --> 01:33:03.241
<v Speaker 2>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you get what you truly need </v>

1842
01:33:03.241 --> 01:33:03.241
<v Speaker 2>will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1843
01:33:03.241 --> 01:33:06.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe not know if your heart is in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>

1844
01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.740
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1845
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 2>that to me reflects this idea of a kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of integrated viewpoint.</v>

1846
01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:15.190
<v Speaker 2>One of the things young proposed was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as you,</v>

1847
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 2>as you integrate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically,</v>

1848
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:22.390
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that your rationality </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrates with your emotions.</v>

1849
01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:26.230
<v Speaker 2>They stopped being opposed forces like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenment ideas.</v>

1850
01:33:26.231 --> 01:33:30.220
<v Speaker 2>That rationality and desire are </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposites and enemies in a sense.</v>

1851
01:33:30.221 --> 01:33:33.190
<v Speaker 2>And the young Ian notion is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the psychoanalytic notion,</v>

1852
01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:38.191
<v Speaker 2>I would say in general and the humanist </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion even perhaps is the thought </v>

1853
01:33:38.191 --> 01:33:38.191
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>

1854
01:33:38.191 --> 01:33:43.140
<v Speaker 2>What you want to do is you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrate irrationality with your </v>

1855
01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.681
<v Speaker 2>emotions and your motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not separable even in </v>

1856
01:33:46.681 --> 01:33:51.001
<v Speaker 2>technically they have to work together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that all has to be integrated with </v>

1857
01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:53.440
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only do you have to take your,</v>

1858
01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:58.690
<v Speaker 2>your heart into account and notice what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that you want and don't want,</v>

1859
01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:02.380
<v Speaker 2>but you also have to embody that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to act that out in the world.</v>

1860
01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.270
<v Speaker 2>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what that means.</v>

1861
01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.770
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then well then your horizons open up.</v>

1862
01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:10.900
<v Speaker 2>And I also believe that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1863
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I've known people in my life who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>insanely successful,</v>

1864
01:34:14.411 --> 01:34:19.000
<v Speaker 2>like insanely successful and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>

1865
01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.300
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are pretty damn together about,</v>

1866
01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're tough,</v>

1867
01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.650
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategic,</v>

1868
01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:27.970
<v Speaker 2>generous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1869
01:34:27.971 --> 01:34:29.800
<v Speaker 2>they're always given people </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities,</v>

1870
01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:33.020
<v Speaker 2>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they've got it all and oh,</v>

1871
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:34.200
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes they're not.</v>

1872
01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying that everyone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wildly successful is wildly successful </v>

1873
01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.530
<v Speaker 2>because they've got themselves together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1874
01:34:41.531 --> 01:34:46.531
<v Speaker 2>because there are crooks and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who gained status one </v>

1875
01:34:48.521 --> 01:34:53.521
<v Speaker 2>way or another by nefarious means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a lot more unstable than you </v>

1876
01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:56.740
<v Speaker 2>might think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't say exactly if that,</v>

1877
01:34:56.890 --> 01:34:59.420
<v Speaker 2>if pursue that route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pay for it,</v>

1878
01:34:59.670 --> 01:35:01.730
<v Speaker 2>like you'll have your money or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

1879
01:35:01.731 --> 01:35:06.731
<v Speaker 2>but it's not gonna do much good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so it does seem to me to be the </v>

1880
01:35:08.511 --> 01:35:13.511
<v Speaker 2>people that have integrated themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that and that are pursuing a noble </v>

1881
01:35:13.511 --> 01:35:14.630
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high goal,</v>

1882
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.960
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who actually are able to do remarkable </v>

1883
01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:20.870
<v Speaker 2>things and remarkable things can be done</v>
<v Speaker 2>at every level.</v>

1884
01:35:20.871 --> 01:35:25.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't like you'd have to change the </v>

1885
01:35:25.871 --> 01:35:27.791
<v Speaker 2>world as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be that you do something </v>

1886
01:35:27.791 --> 01:35:28.130
<v Speaker 2>remarkable within your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1887
01:35:28.131 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be tremendously admirable.</v>

1888
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:35.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's got to take care of a family </v>

1889
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.590
<v Speaker 2>member if they're sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1890
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>

1891
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:37.790
<v Speaker 2>there's heroic acts that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>undertake in the local environment.</v>

1892
01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.350
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that will go on an heralded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

1893
01:35:42.351 --> 01:35:44.450
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable.</v>

1894
01:35:44.451 --> 01:35:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met people who are so damaged,</v>

1895
01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.100
<v Speaker 2>you just can't imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1896
01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.560
<v Speaker 2>and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1897
01:35:51.561 --> 01:35:55.880
<v Speaker 2>one person I met when I was at in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Montreal was this woman and she was just</v>

1898
01:35:55.881 --> 01:35:56.660
<v Speaker 2>ruined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1899
01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:01.920
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looked like a street person and she </v>

1900
01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:03.731
<v Speaker 2>was so shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't even look at you like she </v>

1901
01:36:03.731 --> 01:36:06.071
<v Speaker 2>basically looked at the ground because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like there was light emanating </v>

1902
01:36:06.071 --> 01:36:08.330
<v Speaker 2>from everyone else and she was way too </v>
<v Speaker 2>timid and humbled to even bear it,</v>

1903
01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:13.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and partly what I was doing was trying </v>

1904
01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:15.371
<v Speaker 2>to get her to straighten up and not look</v>
<v Speaker 2>so street person because it wasn't going</v>

1905
01:36:15.441 --> 01:36:17.300
<v Speaker 2>very well for her in social </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions,</v>

1906
01:36:17.301 --> 01:36:17.630
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1907
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:23.050
<v Speaker 2>But it turned out that that isn't what </v>
<v Speaker 2>she came to the behavior therapy unit </v>

1908
01:36:23.050 --> 01:36:23.210
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she had her,</v>

1909
01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I think she lived with her attitude was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like schizophrenia.</v>

1910
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:31.330
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then her aunt's boyfriend was an </v>

1911
01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:34.511
<v Speaker 2>alcoholic who like went on long </v>
<v Speaker 2>harangues about the devil and it's like </v>

1912
01:36:34.511 --> 01:36:36.560
<v Speaker 2>really mad and she wasn't bright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This woman,</v>

1913
01:36:36.561 --> 01:36:37.640
<v Speaker 2>she really wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1914
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:38.720
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1915
01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:44.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't really have a job and it was </v>

1916
01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:44.260
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just not good in every way.</v>

1917
01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:48.560
<v Speaker 2>And then she also had this unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 2>humility and,</v>

1918
01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.040
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1919
01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.160
<v Speaker 2>it turned out what she wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't bloody well believe </v>

1920
01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.671
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she had this dog and she used to </v>

1921
01:36:57.671 --> 01:36:59.861
<v Speaker 2>walk it around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She took care of the dog and now you </v>

1922
01:36:59.861 --> 01:36:59.861
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a good thing and she'd actually</v>

1923
01:36:59.861 --> 01:37:00.470
<v Speaker 2>been an inpatient at the Douglas </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hospital,</v>

1924
01:37:00.471 --> 01:37:05.471
<v Speaker 2>which is where I was working and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Orient Patients in the Douglas Hospital </v>

1925
01:37:05.471 --> 01:37:07.310
<v Speaker 2>and this was back in the eighties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people were like,</v>

1926
01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:11.300
<v Speaker 2>she was like super woman compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>inpatients at the Douglas Hospital.</v>

1927
01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Those people looked like they were from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Hieronymus Bosch painting because they</v>

1928
01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:20.801
<v Speaker 2>had deinstitutionalized everyone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could possibly be deinstitutionalized.</v>

1929
01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:26.020
<v Speaker 2>And so the only people that were left </v>
<v Speaker 2>were people who couldn't be dns to </v>

1930
01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:29.500
<v Speaker 2>institutionalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those would have been people who </v>

1931
01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:29.500
<v Speaker 2>are in the sight words for like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1932
01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:33.191
<v Speaker 2>And all of the hospitals were connected </v>
<v Speaker 2>by tunnels underground in the patients </v>

1933
01:37:33.191 --> 01:37:35.030
<v Speaker 2>used to hang out down there by the coke </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine and so forth.</v>

1934
01:37:35.031 --> 01:37:36.470
<v Speaker 2>And one day I took my brother down </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1935
01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:41.471
<v Speaker 2>He was visiting and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like he just turned white </v>

1936
01:37:41.471 --> 01:37:43.010
<v Speaker 2>because it was just really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if,</v>

1937
01:37:43.011 --> 01:37:44.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hieronymus Bosch,</v>

1938
01:37:44.331 --> 01:37:46.550
<v Speaker 2>he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an interesting painter to say the least,</v>

1939
01:37:46.551 --> 01:37:48.440
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1940
01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.420
<v Speaker 2>so here was her idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1941
01:37:50.421 --> 01:37:52.640
<v Speaker 2>she'd come to the behavior therapy unit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she had been,</v>

1942
01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:58.240
<v Speaker 2>she'd been in the inpatient ward for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile and she met some of these like </v>

1943
01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.490
<v Speaker 2>ruined people and she tried to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>

1944
01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:01.080
<v Speaker 2>She thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm walking my dog,</v>

1945
01:38:01.081 --> 01:38:01.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1946
01:38:01.831 --> 01:38:04.080
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could take one of these patients</v>
<v Speaker 2>out for a walk,</v>

1947
01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:09.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she'd been talking to the hospital </v>

1948
01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.941
<v Speaker 2>administrators trying to get her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow her to go take out one of these </v>

1949
01:38:10.941 --> 01:38:14.571
<v Speaker 2>patients and go for a walk with her dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically she had come to the </v>

1950
01:38:14.571 --> 01:38:15.410
<v Speaker 2>behavior therapy unit because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what she wanted to do.</v>

1951
01:38:15.411 --> 01:38:16.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1952
01:38:16.681 --> 01:38:18.400
<v Speaker 2>that person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just blew me away.</v>

1953
01:38:18.401 --> 01:38:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I just couldn't believe it.</v>

1954
01:38:22.050 --> 01:38:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Like she had nothing going for her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nothing.</v>

1955
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:27.530
<v Speaker 2>And yet she wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1956
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:32.540
<v Speaker 2>help some people that were worse off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like there just weren't that many </v>

1957
01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:36.561
<v Speaker 2>people that were worse off than her mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>boggling mind boggling and I never </v>

1958
01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:39.450
<v Speaker 2>forgot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it really,</v>

1959
01:38:39.451 --> 01:38:41.630
<v Speaker 2>it really blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1960
01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:46.640
<v Speaker 2>there are opportunities for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for elevating your sites within your </v>

1961
01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:49.710
<v Speaker 2>realm of capability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever you happen to be.</v>

1962
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's interesting.</v>

1963
01:38:51.781 --> 01:38:54.780
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's strange that that's the case.</v>

1964
01:38:59.210 --> 01:39:02.810
<v Speaker 2>She brings those who love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what that should say,</v>

1965
01:39:02.811 --> 01:39:06.980
<v Speaker 2>the sweet fulfillment of their secret </v>
<v Speaker 2>longing like a bolt out of the blue fate</v>

1966
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:11.300
<v Speaker 2>characterized here as feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens in the movie.</v>

1967
01:39:11.301 --> 01:39:15.020
<v Speaker 2>The movie's got a Christian underbelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's quite pronounced,</v>

1968
01:39:15.021 --> 01:39:17.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's really a pagan movie in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

1969
01:39:17.211 --> 01:39:20.650
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no blue fairy in,</v>

1970
01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:22.430
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I'm speaking of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>

1971
01:39:22.431 --> 01:39:27.431
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because this movie was created in a </v>

1972
01:39:27.431 --> 01:39:28.120
<v Speaker 2>culture where Christianity was still </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably intact.</v>

1973
01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.710
<v Speaker 2>And of course it was fully informed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1974
01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:34.610
<v Speaker 2>But the underlying mythos is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely Christian,</v>

1975
01:39:34.611 --> 01:39:36.890
<v Speaker 2>even though it's informed by Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagery.</v>

1976
01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:42.340
<v Speaker 2>There is this old idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a gnostic idea that the </v>

1977
01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:43.190
<v Speaker 2>wisdom of God is feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1978
01:39:43.191 --> 01:39:48.191
<v Speaker 2>And Anima,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means soul is feminine and so </v>

1979
01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:48.191
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1980
01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:48.860
<v Speaker 2>there's an idea like that lurking here.</v>

1981
01:39:49.190 --> 01:39:51.890
<v Speaker 2>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fate and that's the blue fairy in</v>

1982
01:39:51.891 --> 01:39:52.930
<v Speaker 2>this particular movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1983
01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:57.230
<v Speaker 2>she comes down from the star which kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of makes her an Avatar of God.</v>

1984
01:39:57.231 --> 01:39:58.370
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the idea.</v>

1985
01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.510
<v Speaker 2>And she's the transformative agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's really mother nature,</v>

1986
01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in her positive guys.</v>

1987
01:40:04.371 --> 01:40:09.371
<v Speaker 2>And that's why she can animate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>animate something means to infuse it </v>

1988
01:40:09.371 --> 01:40:10.520
<v Speaker 2>with soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means.</v>

1989
01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.440
<v Speaker 2>And she animates Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1990
01:40:12.441 --> 01:40:17.441
<v Speaker 2>She's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the forest that frees him from his </v>

1991
01:40:17.441 --> 01:40:17.441
<v Speaker 2>strings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's her fate,</v>

1992
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:22.570
<v Speaker 2>like a bolt out of the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The blue faith steps in and sees you </v>

1993
01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:22.570
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1994
01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:27.360
<v Speaker 2>what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means something like mean something </v>

1995
01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:27.710
<v Speaker 2>like this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1996
01:40:27.711 --> 01:40:32.711
<v Speaker 2>if you orient yourself properly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and we'll say that you do that by </v>

1997
01:40:32.711 --> 01:40:34.730
<v Speaker 2>trying to attain the ultimate goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that happens to be,</v>

1998
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:38.240
<v Speaker 2>then it's as if the world is on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>side and,</v>

1999
01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things go well for you.</v>

2000
01:40:40.881 --> 01:40:45.881
<v Speaker 2>And I also believe that's true because </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly one of the things that's more </v>

2001
01:40:45.881 --> 01:40:47.180
<v Speaker 2>or less self evident is that generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

2002
01:40:47.181 --> 01:40:49.400
<v Speaker 2>if you tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things go a lot better for you.</v>

2003
01:40:49.401 --> 01:40:51.200
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2004
01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to reality opposed</v>

2005
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:57.100
<v Speaker 1>to you or do you want to have reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>backing you up?</v>

2006
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a pretty straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

2007
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.320
<v Speaker 1>If you're truthful to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be truthful,</v>

2008
01:41:02.321 --> 01:41:07.321
<v Speaker 1>then reality is on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing because there's a </v>

2009
01:41:07.321 --> 01:41:07.510
<v Speaker 1>lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a bunch of you.</v>

2010
01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you take a deceitful approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>to things,</v>

2011
01:41:10.151 --> 01:41:15.040
<v Speaker 1>then while then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're challenging reality.</v>

2012
01:41:15.041 --> 01:41:15.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2013
01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:19.750
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're holding a plastic ruler</v>

2014
01:41:19.751 --> 01:41:24.490
<v Speaker 1>in front of your face and bending it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point you're going to let go and</v>

2015
01:41:24.491 --> 01:41:29.491
<v Speaker 1>it's going to all that force that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>stored up and it's going to snap back </v>

2016
01:41:29.491 --> 01:41:34.351
<v Speaker 1>and nail you and that that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like I've just never seen anyone in </v>

2017
01:41:34.841 --> 01:41:38.170
<v Speaker 1>my clinical practice ever get away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2018
01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not surprising.</v>

2019
01:41:41.021 --> 01:41:44.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're going to mess with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of reality,</v>

2020
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:49.410
<v Speaker 1>like it's gonna mess back and it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it might not happen for years and </v>

2021
01:41:49.410 --> 01:41:53.641
<v Speaker 1>you might not even notice the connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>being part of what you do in </v>

2022
01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:55.270
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is to actually make those </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections.</v>

2023
01:41:55.270 --> 01:42:00.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did this horrible thing happened to </v>

2024
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.270
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2025
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:01.660
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like let's take it apart while May,</v>

2026
01:42:01.690 --> 01:42:05.620
<v Speaker 1>who knows how far back we have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might even have things to do,</v>

2027
01:42:05.621 --> 01:42:10.621
<v Speaker 1>not even with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might have things to do with the </v>

2028
01:42:10.621 --> 01:42:13.020
<v Speaker 1>errors in your parents' relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you just can't mess with the </v>

2029
01:42:13.511 --> 01:42:14.850
<v Speaker 1>structure of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2030
01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:20.320
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stays warped until you straighten it </v>

2031
01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.690
<v Speaker 1>out and it is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2032
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.690
<v Speaker 1>so there's an injunction here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

2033
01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:28.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've followed this path,</v>

2034
01:42:28.121 --> 01:42:31.810
<v Speaker 1>you pick a high goal and you put your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart in it,</v>

2035
01:42:32.250 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you commit to it,</v>

2036
01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:37.840
<v Speaker 1>believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe means to love,</v>

2037
01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.150
<v Speaker 1>believe and beloved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

2038
01:42:40.151 --> 01:42:42.820
<v Speaker 1>It means to act out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the belief means.</v>

2039
01:42:42.821 --> 01:42:47.821
<v Speaker 1>Like we think belief means to accept a </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of propositions as true or that is </v>

2040
01:42:47.821 --> 01:42:51.700
<v Speaker 1>one form of belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's more like factual knowledge,</v>

2041
01:42:51.701 --> 01:42:56.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belief is more like you decide that </v>

2042
01:42:56.701 --> 01:42:59.041
<v Speaker 1>you're going to act something out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a decision and then you act it </v>

2043
01:42:59.041 --> 01:42:59.830
<v Speaker 1>out and that's a reflection of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

2044
01:43:00.370 --> 01:43:00.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2045
01:43:00.791 --> 01:43:03.850
<v Speaker 1>you're staking yourself on something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

2046
01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't.</v>

2047
01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:09.460
<v Speaker 1>You can't know you're bonded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance.</v>

2048
01:43:09.461 --> 01:43:14.461
<v Speaker 1>You can make your best guess and move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and you can do that with </v>

2049
01:43:14.461 --> 01:43:17.461
<v Speaker 1>commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to believe in order to do </v>

2050
01:43:17.461 --> 01:43:17.461
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2051
01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's why it's a wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2052
01:43:20.951 --> 01:43:25.951
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then we have jimminy cricket that </v>

2053
01:43:25.951 --> 01:43:29.140
<v Speaker 1>south southern US Slang for Jesus Christ</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

2054
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:32.680
<v Speaker 1>And the initial overlap isn't a fluke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2055
01:43:32.681 --> 01:43:37.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the animators thought that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny and of course it is funny and you </v>

2056
01:43:37.681 --> 01:43:37.870
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lion king,</v>

2057
01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you know that that at boone who is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shaman basically?</v>

2058
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with,</v>

2059
01:43:43.901 --> 01:43:46.300
<v Speaker 1>he was kind of just a comic relief </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

2060
01:43:46.301 --> 01:43:47.530
<v Speaker 1>like a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2061
01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:50.290
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fool,</v>

2062
01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>the fool tends to turn into the savior.</v>

2063
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:53.840
<v Speaker 2>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an archetypal reality.</v>

2064
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Bugs bunny is sort of like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2065
01:43:55.671 --> 01:43:58.130
<v Speaker 2>he's a trickster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as the,</v>

2066
01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:01.250
<v Speaker 2>as the movie developed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the character of the fool,</v>

2067
01:44:01.251 --> 01:44:03.690
<v Speaker 2>baboons took on the full fledged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2068
01:44:03.691 --> 01:44:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>priest element and,</v>

2069
01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:07.460
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2070
01:44:07.461 --> 01:44:09.540
<v Speaker 2>well Jimminy cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's this little cricket and,</v>

2071
01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:12.920
<v Speaker 2>and he turns out to be the conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty damn weird.</v>

2072
01:44:12.921 --> 01:44:17.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like a bug is your conscience and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bug is JC.</v>

2073
01:44:17.271 --> 01:44:21.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's like that's a very strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>juxtaposition of ideas,</v>

2074
01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:22.910
<v Speaker 2>conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insect,</v>

2075
01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:25.370
<v Speaker 2>savior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2076
01:44:25.371 --> 01:44:26.690
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up with that?</v>

2077
01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:28.070
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2078
01:44:28.130 --> 01:44:30.710
<v Speaker 2>what bugs you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it.</v>

2079
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:36.490
<v Speaker 2>While your conscious conscience </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly bugs you and you should pay </v>

2080
01:44:36.490 --> 01:44:38.150
<v Speaker 2>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just little niggling annoying thing</v>

2081
01:44:38.151 --> 01:44:40.280
<v Speaker 2>that you can't quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can override it,</v>

2082
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:41.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>

2083
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:45.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's this swell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

2084
01:44:45.411 --> 01:44:48.980
<v Speaker 2>when he talks to Pinocchio later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says it's that still small voice,</v>

2085
01:44:48.981 --> 01:44:51.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've asked people before,</v>

2086
01:44:51.021 --> 01:44:52.530
<v Speaker 2>like in my personality class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2087
01:44:53.190 --> 01:44:54.880
<v Speaker 2>because conscience is a weird thing.</v>

2088
01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.530
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like if I said to you,</v>

2089
01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:01.430
<v Speaker 2>if you're about to do something that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know you shouldn't do,</v>

2090
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:05.450
<v Speaker 2>do you have a voice in your head that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you that you shouldn't do it?</v>

2091
01:45:05.451 --> 01:45:07.490
<v Speaker 2>So how many people have had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience?</v>

2092
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2093
01:45:09.021 --> 01:45:09.650
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2094
01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.290
<v Speaker 2>so other people have a feeling instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a voice.</v>

2095
01:45:12.291 --> 01:45:15.440
<v Speaker 2>And so is there anybody here who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to admit it?</v>

2096
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Who has neither the feeling nor the </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>

2097
01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2098
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:25.510
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very understudied phenomena in </v>

2099
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.510
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This conscience.</v>

2100
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:29.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean people can be conscientious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe those are people who listen to </v>

2101
01:45:29.441 --> 01:45:30.170
<v Speaker 2>their conscience more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2102
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:35.290
<v Speaker 2>but nobody's ever investigated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that you do have this </v>

2103
01:45:35.290 --> 01:45:35.810
<v Speaker 2>little voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is inside your head,</v>

2104
01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:37.580
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell's up with that?</v>

2105
01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.280
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't tell you what you want to</v>

2106
01:45:40.281 --> 01:45:42.770
<v Speaker 2>hear least as far as I can tell.</v>

2107
01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the internal representation </v>

2108
01:45:47.770 --> 01:45:48.680
<v Speaker 2>of society operating within you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a Freudian view.</v>

2109
01:45:48.681 --> 01:45:51.860
<v Speaker 2>That's the Super Ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly there's something to that,</v>

2110
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:56.630
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 2>presume that that's all there is to it.</v>

2111
01:45:56.631 --> 01:45:59.120
<v Speaker 2>And even if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still wouldn't have the voice.</v>

2112
01:45:59.121 --> 01:46:04.121
<v Speaker 2>It's if you didn't have the biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential to have that voice embedded </v>

2113
01:46:04.121 --> 01:46:08.661
<v Speaker 2>itself in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if it is socio culturally </v>

2114
01:46:08.661 --> 01:46:08.720
<v Speaker 2>constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it is in part,</v>

2115
01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:14.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like your language associated </v>

2116
01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:16.590
<v Speaker 2>culturally constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reason you can speak is because </v>

2117
01:46:16.590 --> 01:46:17.090
<v Speaker 2>human beings can speak and if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience,</v>

2118
01:46:17.091 --> 01:46:22.091
<v Speaker 2>it's because human beings have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience and the contents of that </v>

2119
01:46:22.091 --> 01:46:23.930
<v Speaker 2>conscience might differ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that it exists,</v>

2120
01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.950
<v Speaker 2>what seems to me to be a universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2121
01:46:27.951 --> 01:46:29.630
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the conscience.</v>

2122
01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:35.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's Jimminy cricket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then crick the cricket opens this </v>

2123
01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:37.130
<v Speaker 2>book and then you look at the book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

2124
01:46:37.131 --> 01:46:38.780
<v Speaker 2>well what kind of book is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2125
01:46:38.781 --> 01:46:41.990
<v Speaker 2>it's got a spotlight on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's being highlighted.</v>

2126
01:46:41.991 --> 01:46:44.210
<v Speaker 2>This is an important book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what kind of book is it?</v>

2127
01:46:44.211 --> 01:46:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's leather bound.</v>

2128
01:46:45.591 --> 01:46:47.000
<v Speaker 2>It has a lock on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2129
01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.070
<v Speaker 2>it's not something cheap book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like a,</v>

2130
01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>you might think about,</v>

2131
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.550
<v Speaker 1>it looks like something from an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>library or maybe it looks biblical,</v>

2132
01:46:53.551 --> 01:46:56.130
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a major league book and this bug is</v>

2133
01:46:56.131 --> 01:47:01.131
<v Speaker 1>the introduction to the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it does that mean your conscience is </v>

2134
01:47:01.131 --> 01:47:03.420
<v Speaker 1>the introduction to the book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe that is what it means.</v>

2135
01:47:03.421 --> 01:47:08.421
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly what's being played out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie while then the cricket </v>

2136
01:47:08.421 --> 01:47:09.150
<v Speaker 1>opens the book and so then what do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see?</v>

2137
01:47:09.151 --> 01:47:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that look like?</v>

2138
01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:15.250
<v Speaker 1>What does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it remind you of?</v>

2139
01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the van Gogh painting.</v>

2140
01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:24.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a nativity scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

2141
01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:28.700
<v Speaker 1>it's the Christmas star and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because what's going to happen?</v>

2142
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero is going to be born.</v>

2143
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:33.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a star signifies that.</v>

2144
01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Why does this star signify the birth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an infant,</v>

2145
01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:38.630
<v Speaker 1>let's say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2146
01:47:38.631 --> 01:47:43.180
<v Speaker 1>because there's something miraculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the birth of an infant and,</v>

2147
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:47.330
<v Speaker 1>and why would the infant be a savior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the Christian notion say,</v>

2148
01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:52.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what the infant is </v>

2149
01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.670
<v Speaker 1>potentially every infant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how you should act about </v>

2150
01:47:54.670 --> 01:47:55.220
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2151
01:47:55.221 --> 01:47:57.920
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about having little kids,</v>

2152
01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:03.400
<v Speaker 1>and I loved having little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you have this opportunity to </v>

2153
01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.420
<v Speaker 1>have this pristine relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like,</v>

2154
01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:10.660
<v Speaker 1>like a relationship you've never had </v>
<v Speaker 1>with anyone because the kid really is </v>

2155
01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:10.700
<v Speaker 1>just there to love you.</v>

2156
01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:12.170
<v Speaker 1>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't screw it up,</v>

2157
01:48:12.171 --> 01:48:15.320
<v Speaker 1>you've got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can keep that going.</v>

2158
01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:20.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can try to keep that </v>

2159
01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:20.510
<v Speaker 1>relationship like pristine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so fun.</v>

2160
01:48:20.511 --> 01:48:22.370
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun to try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2161
01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:25.880
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

2162
01:48:25.881 --> 01:48:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids get a bad rap in our society,</v>

2163
01:48:29.841 --> 01:48:34.841
<v Speaker 1>but it's an amazing thing to have little</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and they are remarkable and they </v>

2164
01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:38.930
<v Speaker 1>give you back far more than they require</v>
<v Speaker 1>from you.</v>

2165
01:48:38.931 --> 01:48:41.540
<v Speaker 1>And partly because they treat you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2166
01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:46.900
<v Speaker 1>you're valuable beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the kid thinks about you.</v>

2167
01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:49.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty good.</v>

2168
01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:55.480
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like something divine is going to </v>

2169
01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:55.480
<v Speaker 1>happen and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2170
01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:55.480
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2171
01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:58.240
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2172
01:48:58.241 --> 01:49:03.241
<v Speaker 1>there's The star signifying that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's associated in some way with </v>

2173
01:49:03.241 --> 01:49:04.450
<v Speaker 1>this star that you're supposed to wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon.</v>

2174
01:49:04.750 --> 01:49:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda odd.</v>

2175
01:49:05.711 --> 01:49:10.711
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this relationship that's </v>

2176
01:49:10.711 --> 01:49:13.261
<v Speaker 1>implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that star that signifies the birth of </v>

2177
01:49:13.261 --> 01:49:13.261
<v Speaker 1>the hero is the same star that you wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon.</v>

2178
01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2179
01:49:15.730 --> 01:49:20.730
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the star that you're wishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon is the wish that the hero will be </v>

2180
01:49:20.730 --> 01:49:22.090
<v Speaker 1>born in your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

2181
01:49:22.091 --> 01:49:24.880
<v Speaker 1>You're aiming at an ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ideal you,</v>

2182
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2183
01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.040
<v Speaker 1>you can certainly figure out what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>

2184
01:49:30.850 --> 01:49:32.800
<v Speaker 1>That's where you start as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

2185
01:49:33.010 --> 01:49:33.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2186
01:49:33.611 --> 01:49:38.611
<v Speaker 1>what you shouldn't be doing and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could at least stop doing those things </v>

2187
01:49:38.611 --> 01:49:39.130
<v Speaker 1>and then see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2188
01:49:39.131 --> 01:49:41.680
<v Speaker 1>and if you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a meditative exercise,</v>

2189
01:49:41.681 --> 01:49:46.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do this with the autobiography </v>

2190
01:49:46.681 --> 01:49:46.681
<v Speaker 1>to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2191
01:49:46.681 --> 01:49:50.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down for minutes and have a little </v>

2192
01:49:50.010 --> 01:49:50.010
<v Speaker 1>dialogue</v>

2193
01:49:50.010 --> 01:49:53.430
<v Speaker 2>with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you actually wanted to know the </v>

2194
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.430
<v Speaker 2>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2195
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.430
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask,</v>

2196
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:55.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably doing something stupid that</v>

2197
01:49:55.391 --> 01:50:00.391
<v Speaker 2>if I quit doing my life would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I could quit doing that I would </v>

2198
01:50:00.391 --> 01:50:04.201
<v Speaker 2>quit doing and maybe it's not a very big</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because you're not very </v>

2199
01:50:04.201 --> 01:50:07.651
<v Speaker 2>disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe there's something to ask </v>

2200
01:50:07.651 --> 01:50:07.651
<v Speaker 2>yourself that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2201
01:50:07.651 --> 01:50:09.430
<v Speaker 2>you'll have an answer no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2202
01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:10.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should start doing this.</v>

2203
01:50:10.601 --> 01:50:11.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2204
01:50:11.090 --> 01:50:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I know I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2205
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2206
01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I did,</v>

2207
01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I know my life would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can figure that out </v>

2208
01:50:22.410 --> 01:50:23.200
<v Speaker 2>immediately and if you do that 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

2209
01:50:23.530 --> 01:50:27.520
<v Speaker 2>well you'll be in way better shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't know what to do,</v>

2210
01:50:27.521 --> 01:50:32.521
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could at least figure out what you </v>

2211
01:50:32.521 --> 01:50:33.070
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just moronically pathetic and you</v>

2212
01:50:33.071 --> 01:50:35.440
<v Speaker 2>can be sure you're doing like a dozen of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

2213
01:50:35.441 --> 01:50:38.640
<v Speaker 2>At least you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>procrastinating or you know,</v>

2214
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:42.760
<v Speaker 2>you know everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the conscience tells you and</v>

2215
01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:47.761
<v Speaker 2>if you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just tell you why you're stupid </v>

2216
01:50:47.761 --> 01:50:48.520
<v Speaker 2>and insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so who wants to hear that?</v>

2217
01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:48.820
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

2218
01:50:50.590 --> 01:50:52.280
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could do something about it.</v>

2219
01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the cricut comes into the village </v>

2220
01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.811
<v Speaker 2>there and he sees this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little house and there's a little </v>

2221
01:51:00.811 --> 01:51:02.020
<v Speaker 2>fire in it and so it's Kinda got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>welcoming place.</v>

2222
01:51:02.021 --> 01:51:03.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a light in the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this house,</v>

2223
01:51:03.641 --> 01:51:08.641
<v Speaker 2>just like the star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he hops towards it and then he </v>

2224
01:51:08.641 --> 01:51:11.431
<v Speaker 2>ends up inside it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a nice fire and you get to see </v>

2225
01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:12.460
<v Speaker 2>the inside and the insights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cozy,</v>

2226
01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:17.760
<v Speaker 2>it's welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you look around you see </v>

2227
01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:20.011
<v Speaker 2>that everything's kind of in its place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hyper organized or anything </v>

2228
01:51:20.011 --> 01:51:21.310
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's friendly and welcoming and it's,</v>

2229
01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:26.490
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of wood and there's a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire and then there's toys everywhere </v>

2230
01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:30.360
<v Speaker 2>and they're well constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know that whoever lives there </v>

2231
01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:30.640
<v Speaker 2>likes children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if someone likes children,</v>

2232
01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:35.720
<v Speaker 2>well if someone doesn't like children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you should run away from them </v>

2233
01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:35.720
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>

2234
01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:39.390
<v Speaker 2>But if they liked children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then that's a good sign that you </v>

2235
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:39.390
<v Speaker 2>know Jesus there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least human.</v>

2236
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:40.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2237
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:44.650
<v Speaker 2>And then these things are all high </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>

2238
01:51:44.651 --> 01:51:46.960
<v Speaker 2>They're made very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>

2239
01:51:47.170 --> 01:51:49.120
<v Speaker 2>and he's looking around to see all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and there's,</v>

2240
01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:54.340
<v Speaker 2>there's toys and there's clocks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all handmade and so he sort of </v>

2241
01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:55.420
<v Speaker 2>infers that maybe there's a woodcarver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

2242
01:51:55.450 --> 01:51:57.850
<v Speaker 2>who lives there and a woodcarver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who,</v>

2243
01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:03.180
<v Speaker 2>who can build things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you build things that work and </v>

2244
01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:03.180
<v Speaker 2>that are beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2245
01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:03.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a kind of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2246
01:52:03.730 --> 01:52:06.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's built right into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>object.</v>

2247
01:52:06.011 --> 01:52:08.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what quality is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quality is the,</v>

2248
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:12.700
<v Speaker 2>the building into an object of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing works.</v>

2249
01:52:12.701 --> 01:52:15.130
<v Speaker 2>It does what it's supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has integrity.</v>

2250
01:52:15.131 --> 01:52:19.070
<v Speaker 2>And so you see that everywhere inherent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting a sense of that.</v>

2251
01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:22.960
<v Speaker 2>The filmmakers are setting the stage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so while.</v>

2252
01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:27.990
<v Speaker 2>So they set the stage by showing you the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage and the cricket tells you what he </v>

2253
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.510
<v Speaker 2>sees and he's pretty happy to be there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>

2254
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:31.450
<v Speaker 2>And this is also someone who's concerned</v>
<v Speaker 2>about time,</v>

2255
01:52:31.451 --> 01:52:33.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a lot of clocks,</v>

2256
01:52:33.281 --> 01:52:36.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of clocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so time turns out to be an important</v>

2257
01:52:36.401 --> 01:52:40.840
<v Speaker 2>sub element of this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he sees the puppet marionette.</v>

2258
01:52:40.841 --> 01:52:43.720
<v Speaker 2>And so what's a marion out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2259
01:52:43.721 --> 01:52:45.710
<v Speaker 2>a marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's sitting on the shelf.</v>

2260
01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:50.880
<v Speaker 2>A marionette is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] animated because it can </v>

2261
01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:51.830
<v Speaker 2>move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really have a soul,</v>

2262
01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:54.530
<v Speaker 2>but it sort of acts like it has a soul </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in,</v>

2263
01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:55.070
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2264
01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:57.620
<v Speaker 2>in the sense of anima and soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It animated and.</v>

2265
01:52:57.830 --> 01:53:02.830
<v Speaker 2>But a Marionette is something that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>being manipulated by something else </v>

2266
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:03.650
<v Speaker 2>behind the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2267
01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.050
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have its own volition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2268
01:53:06.170 --> 01:53:11.170
<v Speaker 2>it's dependent on the will have </v>
<v Speaker 2>something behind the scenes and so </v>

2269
01:53:11.170 --> 01:53:15.401
<v Speaker 2>there's a strong implication that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever this thing is is half formed </v>

2270
01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:20.620
<v Speaker 2>and that it's being manipulated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>unseen forces behind unseen forces </v>

2271
01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:25.070
<v Speaker 2>behind the facade.</v>

2272
01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a Friday.</v>

2273
01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:28.430
<v Speaker 2>An idea that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all of you.</v>

2274
01:53:28.431 --> 01:53:33.431
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're polled hither and fro by </v>

2275
01:53:33.431 --> 01:53:37.090
<v Speaker 2>unconscious forces and some of those are</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological and some of them are </v>

2276
01:53:37.090 --> 01:53:37.090
<v Speaker 2>cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2277
01:53:37.090 --> 01:53:41.531
<v Speaker 2>and you think about people who are swept</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in great ideological movements like </v>

2278
01:53:41.531 --> 01:53:44.660
<v Speaker 2>the Communists or the fascist is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are marionettes.</v>

2279
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:48.050
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all say the same thing.</v>

2280
01:53:48.051 --> 01:53:53.051
<v Speaker 2>They all mount the same words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all act the same way and some </v>

2281
01:53:53.051 --> 01:53:55.160
<v Speaker 2>things behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question is what will,</v>

2282
01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:58.010
<v Speaker 2>that is the question and that's partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what this movie tries to figure out.</v>

2283
01:53:58.011 --> 01:54:01.760
<v Speaker 2>So you see this Marionette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's at half formed,</v>

2284
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:05.870
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't headed puppet and he has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of potential,</v>

2285
01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:10.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cricket goes up and interacts </v>

2286
01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:10.900
<v Speaker 2>with them and sees that he's made out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>

2287
01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Would it makes a little joke about </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a wooden head and you know,</v>

2288
01:54:13.461 --> 01:54:15.170
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of obvious what that means.</v>

2289
01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:18.440
<v Speaker 2>And you noticed the cricket is dressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a tramp.</v>

2290
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:21.830
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you first saw him he wasn't,</v>

2291
01:54:21.831 --> 01:54:23.720
<v Speaker 2>he was dressed like in 19 twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millionaire.</v>

2292
01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:25.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now,</v>

2293
01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:27.560
<v Speaker 2>but here he's a tramp and this is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

2294
01:54:27.561 --> 01:54:29.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this bug,</v>

2295
01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:32.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the introduction to the book,</v>

2296
01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:36.110
<v Speaker 2>that's the conscience is also a tramp </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no home.</v>

2297
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:41.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it took me a long time to sort that </v>

2298
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:43.040
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like he's been everywhere.</v>

2299
01:54:43.730 --> 01:54:45.610
<v Speaker 2>This tramp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been everywhere and,</v>

2300
01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:50.760
<v Speaker 2>and he knows he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's traveled the world and anybody who </v>

2301
01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:51.980
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have a home.</v>

2302
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:55.220
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't made a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything real yet.</v>

2303
01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:56.990
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of a potential,</v>

2304
01:54:57.290 --> 01:55:02.290
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting about this movie </v>

2305
01:55:02.290 --> 01:55:04.841
<v Speaker 2>because if you think about the cricket </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a fragment of the of the hero and say</v>

2306
01:55:05.151 --> 01:55:08.120
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reflection of the of the savior,</v>

2307
01:55:08.121 --> 01:55:10.910
<v Speaker 2>which is his relationship with JCC of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

2308
01:55:10.911 --> 01:55:15.911
<v Speaker 2>and the person who introduces the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the story gets strange because if </v>

2309
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:19.670
<v Speaker 2>it was merely a representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect person,</v>

2310
01:55:19.671 --> 01:55:24.671
<v Speaker 2>the archetype of the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the conscience would know </v>

2311
01:55:24.671 --> 01:55:24.671
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2312
01:55:24.671 --> 01:55:27.530
<v Speaker 2>and it would just tell the puppet what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and that would be the end of it,</v>

2313
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:28.910
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2314
01:55:28.911 --> 01:55:29.990
<v Speaker 2>that's adult story.</v>

2315
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:31.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like perfect conscience comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>

2316
01:55:31.641 --> 01:55:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Puppet does everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says Bingo perfection,</v>

2317
01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:41.410
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this weird idea that this thing </v>

2318
01:55:41.410 --> 01:55:44.280
<v Speaker 2>that's got all these attributes needs a </v>
<v Speaker 2>home and has</v>

2319
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:49.280
<v Speaker 1>to enter into a learning relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the thing that it's trying to </v>

2320
01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:51.660
<v Speaker 1>transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so sophisticated because you know,</v>

2321
01:55:51.661 --> 01:55:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I could say you should do what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience tells you.</v>

2322
01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2323
01:55:55.801 --> 01:55:58.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's not exactly how it works.</v>

2324
01:55:58.830 --> 01:56:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your conscience isn't omniscient </v>
<v Speaker 1>and omnipotent.</v>

2325
01:56:01.710 --> 01:56:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not gone right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a guide,</v>

2326
01:56:05.130 --> 01:56:05.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2327
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:08.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's maybe smarter than you sometimes.</v>

2328
01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because it's society in your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously it's smarter than you </v>

2329
01:56:13.610 --> 01:56:17.571
<v Speaker 1>sometimes because it tells you not to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you go do it and then you </v>

2330
01:56:17.571 --> 01:56:18.960
<v Speaker 1>get into trouble and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I would've just listened?</v>

2331
01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:20.970
<v Speaker 1>But you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's interesting too.</v>

2332
01:56:20.971 --> 01:56:23.580
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to,</v>

2333
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.350
<v Speaker 1>which is seems to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill.</v>

2334
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:31.430
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if your conscience knows what </v>

2335
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:33.620
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you just a deterministic </v>

2336
01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:34.890
<v Speaker 1>puppet of your conscience Christ?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would work a lot better.</v>

2337
01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:37.650
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have to torture yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you would make any mistakes.</v>

2338
01:56:37.651 --> 01:56:40.440
<v Speaker 1>So why the separation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2339
01:56:40.441 --> 01:56:42.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because of the conscience is </v>
<v Speaker 1>generic</v>

2340
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and so it has to be taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to learn to.</v>

2341
01:56:47.731 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue with your conscience.</v>

2342
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:55.430
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>expose yourself to more and more of the </v>

2343
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:56.220
<v Speaker 1>world and you get wiser in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

2344
01:56:56.221 --> 01:57:01.221
<v Speaker 1>Gets wiser and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mature together and that's what </v>

2345
01:57:01.221 --> 01:57:03.930
<v Speaker 1>happens in this story because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket starts out as a tramp that,</v>

2346
01:57:04.210 --> 01:57:09.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is smarter than the puppet but not as </v>

2347
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:09.210
<v Speaker 1>smart as he thinks he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

2348
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:11.640
<v Speaker 1>And when he first starts to operate as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

2349
01:57:11.641 --> 01:57:13.200
<v Speaker 1>he's completely useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Added.</v>

2350
01:57:13.201 --> 01:57:18.201
<v Speaker 1>He babbles off a lot of cliches about </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality and then he's late the first </v>

2351
01:57:18.201 --> 01:57:20.100
<v Speaker 1>day for his job and he's just not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at it.</v>

2352
01:57:20.101 --> 01:57:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this weird idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

2353
01:57:22.801 --> 01:57:25.830
<v Speaker 1>which is part of what puts you towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>redemption,</v>

2354
01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:31.100
<v Speaker 1>is something that you actually have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with over the course of your </v>

2355
01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:32.370
<v Speaker 1>life in order for it to develop as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>

2356
01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And so then I would also say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket represents,</v>

2357
01:57:35.821 --> 01:57:38.220
<v Speaker 1>at least in part what you described as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the self,</v>

2358
01:57:38.250 --> 01:57:43.250
<v Speaker 1>which is like the potential fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed human being that sort of </v>

2359
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:45.780
<v Speaker 1>exists within you as a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be.</v>

2360
01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It has to be manifest in the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of your life.</v>

2361
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:53.580
<v Speaker 1>And so the conscience has to learn how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to position itself here and now.</v>

2362
01:57:53.970 --> 01:57:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's got generic advice and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not good enough.</v>

2363
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:59.280
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why the cricket is looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a home.</v>

2364
01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And so he needs a home even though he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other things we already said </v>

2365
01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:06.600
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to find a specific home before he</v>

2366
01:58:06.601 --> 01:58:10.560
<v Speaker 1>can become who he could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2367
01:58:10.561 --> 01:58:11.400
<v Speaker 1>so then Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2368
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:16.430
<v Speaker 1>shows up and he's a kindly old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much exactly what you'd </v>

2369
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.430
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2370
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:20.740
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a careful craftsman and he likes </v>

2371
01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:20.740
<v Speaker 1>kittens and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always a good thing.</v>

2372
01:58:22.090 --> 01:58:27.090
<v Speaker 1>And he has some fish and I know he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He's good at making things and he's </v>

2373
01:58:27.371 --> 01:58:29.230
<v Speaker 1>got a sense of humor and he's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>playful.</v>

2374
01:58:29.231 --> 01:58:30.040
<v Speaker 1>And so he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

2375
01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:31.990
<v Speaker 1>he's a good father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>

2376
01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:37.140
<v Speaker 1>He's the wise king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the positive archetype of the </v>

2377
01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:37.140
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he is.</v>

2378
01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And so he's culture and it's positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>

2379
01:58:39.731 --> 01:58:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And he gives rise to this creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is his puppet,</v>

2380
01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 1>which is what culture does because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a puppet of your culture,</v>

2381
01:58:46.361 --> 01:58:51.361
<v Speaker 1>you're a Marionette of your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you could be more than </v>

2382
01:58:51.361 --> 01:58:51.361
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2383
01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:54.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's the other thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange about this movie,</v>

2384
01:58:54.541 --> 01:58:59.541
<v Speaker 1>and it's strange about the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at the world because </v>

2385
01:58:59.541 --> 01:59:02.391
<v Speaker 1>scientifically deterministically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nature and there's culture and </v>

2386
01:59:03.781 --> 01:59:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you are the deterministic product of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction between nature and culture.</v>

2387
01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:10.800
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing else to you than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>

2388
01:59:11.370 --> 01:59:13.530
<v Speaker 1>But the mythological world doesn't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2389
01:59:13.531 --> 01:59:18.531
<v Speaker 1>It says something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says that there's nature and culture </v>

2390
01:59:18.531 --> 01:59:18.570
<v Speaker 1>and then there's you</v>

2391
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:24.910
<v Speaker 1>and the you that's in there has choices </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the destiny and that you actually </v>

2392
01:59:24.981 --> 01:59:29.981
<v Speaker 1>affect the interplay of nature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture in determining your own </v>

2393
01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:30.920
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it insists upon that.</v>

2394
01:59:30.921 --> 01:59:35.921
<v Speaker 1>The oldest stories we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the hero and the </v>

2395
01:59:35.921 --> 01:59:36.800
<v Speaker 1>archetypal mother and the archetype of </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

2396
01:59:36.801 --> 01:59:39.710
<v Speaker 1>There's always those three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never just two.</v>

2397
01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:44.980
<v Speaker 1>So from a narrative perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the implication that </v>

2398
01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:49.721
<v Speaker 1>there is something autonomous about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero of the story and you know,</v>

2399
01:59:50.630 --> 01:59:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you can't account for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a good way of accounting </v>

2400
01:59:55.630 --> 01:59:55.670
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a scientific perspective.</v>

2401
01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I was having a discussion with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris the other day,</v>

2402
01:59:58.401 --> 02:00:00.380
<v Speaker 1>which was very.</v>

2403
02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said we got wrapped around an axle,</v>

2404
02:00:06.511 --> 02:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris is one of the four famous,</v>

2405
02:00:09.571 --> 02:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheists along with Christopher Hitchens</v>

2406
02:00:12.781 --> 02:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennett.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2407
02:00:16.891 --> 02:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>And so we were having a discussion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2408
02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>he's a determinist just right down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>

2409
02:00:22.411 --> 02:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're determined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're determined,</v>

2410
02:00:24.721 --> 02:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>there's no freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a deterministic machine.</v>

2411
02:00:27.631 --> 02:00:32.631
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a coherent scientist and </v>

2412
02:00:32.631 --> 02:00:32.631
<v Speaker 1>you're a Newtonian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

2413
02:00:32.631 --> 02:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have much choice other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than to think that way,</v>

2414
02:00:34.441 --> 02:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't how it seems to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't treat each other that way.</v>

2415
02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>And our entire legal system is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that you do in </v>

2416
02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>fact have freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2417
02:00:45.001 --> 02:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we account for it?</v>

2418
02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2419
02:00:47.370 --> 02:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And do we have a scientific model for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

2420
02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I would also say we do not have</v>

2421
02:00:52.321 --> 02:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>a scientific model for consciousness.</v>

2422
02:00:54.210 --> 02:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>We don't know a damn thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

2423
02:00:57.030 --> 02:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>which is why Dan Dennett book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was called consciousness </v>

2424
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was referred to.</v>

2425
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It's by it's critics as consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained a way,</v>

2426
02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly right as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned because he took a mechanistic </v>

2427
02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:14.091
<v Speaker 1>approach and I just don't think you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that because there's something </v>

2428
02:01:14.091 --> 02:01:17.871
<v Speaker 1>really weird about consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the phenomenologists Heidegger,</v>

2429
02:01:18.210 --> 02:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>who tried to radically transformed </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western philosophy right from the bottom</v>

2430
02:01:22.111 --> 02:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He basically said,</v>

2431
02:01:23.161 --> 02:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2432
02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you can treat the world as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is primary and that human </v>

2433
02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>experience is reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's reality and that he doesn't exist</v>

2434
02:01:33.151 --> 02:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>independently of consciousness in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicable way.</v>

2435
02:01:36.810 --> 02:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2436
02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>what's out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's nothing to experience</v>

2437
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:41.060
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2438
02:01:41.061 --> 02:01:43.330
<v Speaker 2>everything at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

2439
02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:48.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not really comprehensible as </v>
<v Speaker 2>without a subject that subject defines </v>

2440
02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:48.920
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it real.</v>

2441
02:01:48.921 --> 02:01:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Now you don't have to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2442
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:55.810
<v Speaker 2>but at least I'm telling you that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are thoroughly coherent philosophical </v>

2443
02:01:56.211 --> 02:02:01.211
<v Speaker 2>positions that make that case very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly and that that allow </v>

2444
02:02:01.221 --> 02:02:06.221
<v Speaker 2>consciousness to exist as a phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to take it seriously and you </v>

2445
02:02:06.221 --> 02:02:07.150
<v Speaker 2>certainly act like you take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

2446
02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:12.160
<v Speaker 2>You Act like there's a you and that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make choices and you certainly treat </v>

2447
02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:14.330
<v Speaker 2>other people that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deterministic or not,</v>

2448
02:02:14.331 --> 02:02:19.331
<v Speaker 2>you're still gonna get angry when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being rude to you and you're </v>

2449
02:02:19.331 --> 02:02:19.610
<v Speaker 2>going to act as if they had some choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the matter.</v>

2450
02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's an illusion possibly,</v>

2451
02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:27.280
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say the oldest stories that </v>

2452
02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:30.380
<v Speaker 2>we have always include that as not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a fundamental element,</v>

2453
02:02:30.381 --> 02:02:33.710
<v Speaker 2>but even as the fundamental element so.</v>

2454
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can think about that however you </v>

2455
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.910
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

2456
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:40.790
<v Speaker 2>so Japan comes along and he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>finish off the puppet.</v>

2457
02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:43.700
<v Speaker 2>And so what does he do to finish off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>puppet?</v>

2458
02:02:43.730 --> 02:02:45.980
<v Speaker 2>He gives it a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives it a voice.</v>

2459
02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:47.900
<v Speaker 2>It gives it a mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2460
02:02:47.901 --> 02:02:49.550
<v Speaker 2>that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>

2461
02:02:49.551 --> 02:02:52.370
<v Speaker 2>So in Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Genesis,</v>

2462
02:02:52.810 --> 02:02:54.050
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very,</v>

2463
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:59.410
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complex idea and it took people </v>

2464
02:02:59.410 --> 02:03:02.081
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years to figure this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and it's something like this is so </v>

2465
02:03:02.081 --> 02:03:06.700
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was chaos and that was like </v>

2466
02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:08.330
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was something like potential,</v>

2467
02:03:08.810 --> 02:03:12.260
<v Speaker 2>the potential for being and God who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

2468
02:03:12.261 --> 02:03:16.130
<v Speaker 2>The father in the genesis account uses a</v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty that he has,</v>

2469
02:03:16.190 --> 02:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>which is the word to call being from </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and that's the creation of Ba,</v>

2470
02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:25.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>

2471
02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:29.810
<v Speaker 2>It's the manifestation of order from </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and it's the word,</v>

2472
02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:32.450
<v Speaker 2>the logos that it's.</v>

2473
02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:35.600
<v Speaker 2>It's the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the tool that God uses to do that</v>

2474
02:03:35.601 --> 02:03:39.200
<v Speaker 2>and that logos in Christianity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with Christ,</v>

2475
02:03:39.201 --> 02:03:44.201
<v Speaker 2>which is a very weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason for that is that there's </v>

2476
02:03:44.201 --> 02:03:47.621
<v Speaker 2>an idea that the divine element of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual is the thing that uses </v>

2477
02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:53.690
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicative language to call the world</v>

2478
02:03:53.691 --> 02:03:58.691
<v Speaker 2>into being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is what we do as far as we can </v>

2479
02:03:58.691 --> 02:03:58.691
<v Speaker 2>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you make a decision,</v>

2480
02:03:58.790 --> 02:04:00.950
<v Speaker 2>you think it through and talk it over </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your friends.</v>

2481
02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:05.210
<v Speaker 2>You plot a course and the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself in relationship to your</v>

2482
02:04:05.211 --> 02:04:10.211
<v Speaker 2>choice and it's for that reason and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is for that reason that in genesis and </v>

2483
02:04:10.211 --> 02:04:14.561
<v Speaker 2>in many other accounts that that logo's </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity is identified with human </v>

2484
02:04:14.601 --> 02:04:19.601
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have a small bit of that </v>

2485
02:04:19.601 --> 02:04:19.601
<v Speaker 2>in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that means,</v>

2486
02:04:19.601 --> 02:04:23.350
<v Speaker 2>and you participate in the process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually generating order out of </v>

2487
02:04:23.361 --> 02:04:28.100
<v Speaker 2>chaos and and sometimes the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mediate between them and so and that</v>

2488
02:04:28.101 --> 02:04:29.260
<v Speaker 2>is that in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2489
02:04:29.290 --> 02:04:29.810
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2490
02:04:29.811 --> 02:04:33.470
<v Speaker 2>in Western culture and certainly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case at other cultures as well,</v>

2491
02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:36.710
<v Speaker 2>that that's why you have rights.</v>

2492
02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the law has to respect you is</v>

2493
02:04:39.661 --> 02:04:44.550
<v Speaker 2>because you've got this spark of </v>
<v Speaker 2>divinity in you that's transcendent that</v>

2494
02:04:44.551 --> 02:04:47.670
<v Speaker 2>nobody gets to transgress against and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

2495
02:04:47.671 --> 02:04:48.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you believe that?</v>

2496
02:04:48.811 --> 02:04:49.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2497
02:04:50.010 --> 02:04:55.010
<v Speaker 2>you act like you believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You treat other people like you believe </v>

2498
02:04:55.010 --> 02:04:59.931
<v Speaker 2>it or they're not very happy with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it depends on what you mean by </v>

2499
02:04:59.931 --> 02:05:00.780
<v Speaker 2>believe you act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

2500
02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Do you accept it as a proposition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2501
02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:06.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you accept that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposition frankly,</v>

2502
02:05:06.661 --> 02:05:10.080
<v Speaker 2>because I think the best indicator of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you believe is how you act.</v>

2503
02:05:10.130 --> 02:05:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Not what you say because what do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about what you know?</v>

2504
02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Hardly anything and so actions speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>louder than words and if you want to be </v>

2505
02:05:19.501 --> 02:05:24.501
<v Speaker 2>treated properly by someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that you want to </v>

2506
02:05:24.501 --> 02:05:26.040
<v Speaker 2>treat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want them to treat you as a valuable</v>

2507
02:05:26.041 --> 02:05:27.480
<v Speaker 2>autonomous entity.</v>

2508
02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:30.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe you're not that.</v>

2509
02:05:30.931 --> 02:05:35.931
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're a deterministic puppet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what this strange movie suggests is that</v>

2510
02:05:35.971 --> 02:05:40.380
<v Speaker 2>you are kind of a deterministic puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to be all right,</v>

2511
02:05:40.850 --> 02:05:44.970
<v Speaker 2>well you the mouth goes on and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan was happy about that and then they</v>

2512
02:05:44.971 --> 02:05:46.020
<v Speaker 2>have a little dance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2513
02:05:46.021 --> 02:05:51.021
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they turned the music on and all these </v>

2514
02:05:51.021 --> 02:05:53.781
<v Speaker 2>little music boxes and they all play </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and it's like harmony of some </v>

2515
02:05:53.821 --> 02:05:58.260
<v Speaker 2>sort has been established because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the music represents and the layers</v>

2516
02:05:58.261 --> 02:06:03.261
<v Speaker 2>of reality that are communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 2>one another because that's what the </v>

2517
02:06:03.261 --> 02:06:06.741
<v Speaker 2>music represents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they have a little dance and </v>

2518
02:06:06.741 --> 02:06:06.741
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2519
02:06:06.741 --> 02:06:09.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing to let this puppet </v>
<v Speaker 2>habits own voice.</v>

2520
02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting idea because what </v>

2521
02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:15.440
<v Speaker 2>the hell does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2522
02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:15.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a wooden headed marionette.</v>

2523
02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Why the hell would you want something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that to talk?</v>

2524
02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same question you have in </v>

2525
02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:24.030
<v Speaker 2>relationship to your children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what do they know there two or</v>

2526
02:06:24.031 --> 02:06:25.470
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2527
02:06:25.471 --> 02:06:27.150
<v Speaker 2>they don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2528
02:06:27.151 --> 02:06:31.090
<v Speaker 2>so should you just like tyrannized them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make them do everything you want?</v>

2529
02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to let them have a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a voice?</v>

2530
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:35.460
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on whether do we want them to</v>

2531
02:06:35.461 --> 02:06:40.461
<v Speaker 2>be a puppet or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't want them to be a </v>

2532
02:06:40.461 --> 02:06:44.090
<v Speaker 2>puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want them to grow up atonomous </v>

2533
02:06:44.090 --> 02:06:45.450
<v Speaker 2>then you let them have a voice and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>facilitate the development of that voice</v>

2534
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:47.470
<v Speaker 2>and so and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2535
02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:50.340
<v Speaker 2>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you do if you don't want</v>

2536
02:06:50.730 --> 02:06:55.730
<v Speaker 2>a marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Japan who doesn't want a </v>

2537
02:06:55.730 --> 02:06:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Marionette?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he gives the puppet a voice even </v>

2538
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.030
<v Speaker 2>though he knows it's just a puppet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>

2539
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.790
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't know anything.</v>

2540
02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:04.230
<v Speaker 2>And then this is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the cricket sitting up there watching</v>

2541
02:07:04.231 --> 02:07:05.490
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty happy with it.</v>

2542
02:07:05.491 --> 02:07:09.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the first little CDC there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's sitting by this other thing that is</v>

2543
02:07:09.001 --> 02:07:12.750
<v Speaker 2>just not happy at all and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible father.</v>

2544
02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:16.860
<v Speaker 2>And you see it's a character that </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeats throughout the entire movie.</v>

2545
02:07:16.861 --> 02:07:21.861
<v Speaker 2>You see manifestations of the tyrannical</v>
<v Speaker 2>father continually through the movie in </v>

2546
02:07:21.861 --> 02:07:23.880
<v Speaker 2>different characters like he's played </v>
<v Speaker 2>out by different roles.</v>

2547
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:27.240
<v Speaker 2>And so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cricket is so thrilled about this.</v>

2548
02:07:27.241 --> 02:07:31.290
<v Speaker 2>And then he looks at the frowning king </v>
<v Speaker 2>there who's,</v>

2549
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:34.290
<v Speaker 2>who is not happy that the puppet has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been given a voice.</v>

2550
02:07:34.291 --> 02:07:39.291
<v Speaker 2>He's a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the representation of a tyrant and </v>

2551
02:07:39.291 --> 02:07:39.291
<v Speaker 2>a tyrant does not want you to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>

2552
02:07:39.291 --> 02:07:40.900
<v Speaker 2>And so the cricket looks at him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

2553
02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:43.270
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't please everybody all the time.</v>

2554
02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:46.510
<v Speaker 2>And it's just this tiny little fragment </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a joke,</v>

2555
02:07:46.511 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2556
02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:48.670
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this old idea.</v>

2557
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it comes from checkoff and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is that if you set a </v>

2558
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.390
<v Speaker 2>playoff and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a gun,</v>

2559
02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:57.250
<v Speaker 2>a rifle or a pistol on a table in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first act,</v>

2560
02:07:57.490 --> 02:08:02.490
<v Speaker 2>it better have been used by the third </v>
<v Speaker 2>act or it shouldn't have been there at </v>

2561
02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:06.301
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is you don't put anything </v>

2562
02:08:06.301 --> 02:08:08.740
<v Speaker 2>in your play that it's random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never do that.</v>

2563
02:08:08.770 --> 02:08:11.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this isn't life,</v>

2564
02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:13.330
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this isn't life.</v>

2565
02:08:13.331 --> 02:08:16.370
<v Speaker 2>This is a work of art and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected and it's caught,</v>

2566
02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:16.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2567
02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:21.840
<v Speaker 2>it's there by intent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this isn't accidental that this </v>

2568
02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:25.150
<v Speaker 2>little king character doesn't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on or that he shows up.</v>

2569
02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:28.170
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

2570
02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:33.220
<v Speaker 2>all the clocks go off and the music </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxes go and they have a little dance </v>

2571
02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:33.220
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's happy about it.</v>

2572
02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:36.520
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Japan notices what time it is.</v>

2573
02:08:36.521 --> 02:08:41.521
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a tremendous emphasis on </v>
<v Speaker 2>time in this part of the movie because </v>

2574
02:08:41.521 --> 02:08:43.390
<v Speaker 2>there are all these clocks are going off</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're all telling him what time it</v>

2575
02:08:43.391 --> 02:08:44.920
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 30 clocks go off.</v>

2576
02:08:44.921 --> 02:08:48.580
<v Speaker 2>And then he takes us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch out and notices what time it is.</v>

2577
02:08:48.581 --> 02:08:53.581
<v Speaker 2>It's like the idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about time going on is like </v>

2578
02:08:53.581 --> 02:08:55.030
<v Speaker 2>whacked at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2579
02:08:55.090 --> 02:08:59.680
<v Speaker 2>dozens of times so that you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a little joke that he pulls out</v>

2580
02:08:59.681 --> 02:09:01.870
<v Speaker 2>his watch and he figures out it's time </v>
<v Speaker 2>for bed.</v>

2581
02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:05.230
<v Speaker 2>While.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we're making a transition between</v>

2582
02:09:05.231 --> 02:09:07.150
<v Speaker 2>the conscious world and the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2583
02:09:07.930 --> 02:09:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2584
02:09:08.561 --> 02:09:13.561
<v Speaker 2>so there's an intimation in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything that happens now is in </v>

2585
02:09:13.561 --> 02:09:16.270
<v Speaker 2>the unconscious world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way you know that is that it's,</v>

2586
02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:20.830
<v Speaker 2>it's strange because the movie moves in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and out of this underworld.</v>

2587
02:09:21.070 --> 02:09:24.610
<v Speaker 2>But at the very end when Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed into a real boy,</v>

2588
02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:29.940
<v Speaker 2>the last thing Japan does is I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Japan always hit one of the </v>

2589
02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:31.780
<v Speaker 2>pendulums and start all the clocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2590
02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:37.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's as if what happens from here </v>
<v Speaker 2>onwards is part of a dream.</v>

2591
02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's murky because Pinocchio goes to </v>

2592
02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:43.840
<v Speaker 2>school and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the next day and all of that.</v>

2593
02:09:43.841 --> 02:09:48.841
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those are sort of realistic </v>

2594
02:09:48.841 --> 02:09:51.001
<v Speaker 2>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's also the whole going </v>

2595
02:09:51.001 --> 02:09:51.001
<v Speaker 2>down into the ocean to find the whale </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2596
02:09:51.001 --> 02:09:54.811
<v Speaker 2>which seems completely dreamlike and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an intimation that we're in </v>

2597
02:09:54.811 --> 02:09:55.730
<v Speaker 2>a different kind of world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2598
02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:58.060
<v Speaker 2>and so we go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all go to sleep,</v>

2599
02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:03.120
<v Speaker 2>including the cricket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then Japan notices the star and </v>

2600
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:06.380
<v Speaker 2>because he's a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes a wish on the start.</v>

2601
02:10:06.410 --> 02:10:10.150
<v Speaker 2>We've already explained why you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>wish on a star and what that might mean,</v>

2602
02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:12.890
<v Speaker 2>and he makes a very interesting wish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2603
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.360
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a self serving wish.</v>

2604
02:10:16.530 --> 02:10:18.100
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite the contrary.</v>

2605
02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:21.850
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't wish that Pinocchio is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>obedient son.</v>

2606
02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:25.150
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't wish that he's produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who will work for him.</v>

2607
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:29.110
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't wish any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wishes what a good father would wish,</v>

2608
02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 2>which is that the creation that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought forth would develop</v>

2609
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:37.760
<v Speaker 1>its capacity for autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants them to become real.</v>

2610
02:10:37.761 --> 02:10:42.761
<v Speaker 1>He wants him to become an actual living </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature and not a wooden headed </v>

2611
02:10:42.761 --> 02:10:44.300
<v Speaker 1>marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd say,</v>

2612
02:10:44.301 --> 02:10:46.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what your father should wish for</v>

2613
02:10:46.761 --> 02:10:47.420
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2614
02:10:47.421 --> 02:10:51.050
<v Speaker 1>and I have clients frequently whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>fathers weren't like that at all.</v>

2615
02:10:51.051 --> 02:10:53.300
<v Speaker 1>They were tyrannical or they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>neglectful or,</v>

2616
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:55.970
<v Speaker 1>or they punished this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the person,</v>

2617
02:10:55.971 --> 02:10:59.600
<v Speaker 1>every time they did something good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real fun game.</v>

2618
02:11:02.070 --> 02:11:05.040
<v Speaker 1>They competed with them and undermining </v>
<v Speaker 1>them at every opportunity.</v>

2619
02:11:05.070 --> 02:11:07.770
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to produce someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong and autonomous.</v>

2620
02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:12.920
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to give birth to a slave and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then diminish it as much as possible.</v>

2621
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>And so that's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good and not so Japan was not </v>

2622
02:11:19.950 --> 02:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>

2623
02:11:19.950 --> 02:11:24.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wish for something </v>

2624
02:11:24.761 --> 02:11:25.130
<v Speaker 1>completely unreasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that part of that ideal idea,</v>

2625
02:11:25.131 --> 02:11:30.131
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're unreasonable thing is that </v>

2626
02:11:30.131 --> 02:11:32.891
<v Speaker 1>this puppet could become real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually take on its autonomy and,</v>

2627
02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:38.000
<v Speaker 1>and move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what he wishes.</v>

2628
02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And then they go to sleep</v>

2629
02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:47.080
<v Speaker 1>and then the cricket starts to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven mad by the noises of the clock.</v>

2630
02:11:47.081 --> 02:11:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like he's going into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of state of hyper alertness and the</v>

2631
02:11:50.951 --> 02:11:54.700
<v Speaker 1>clocks are clanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him in Japan was snoring and,</v>

2632
02:11:55.060 --> 02:11:59.020
<v Speaker 1>and that he can even hear the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>grains of sand falling out of the,</v>

2633
02:11:59.410 --> 02:12:02.290
<v Speaker 1>out of the hourglass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's becoming hyper alert,</v>

2634
02:12:02.291 --> 02:12:04.090
<v Speaker 1>hyper alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he yells,</v>

2635
02:12:04.091 --> 02:12:07.030
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the clock stop.</v>

2636
02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Which is a pretty good trick for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket.</v>

2637
02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:11.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's the master of time.</v>

2638
02:12:11.591 --> 02:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>But also we're in a place now where time</v>
<v Speaker 1>has come to a stop or outside of time.</v>

2639
02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:18.430
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that Freud pointed</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2640
02:12:18.431 --> 02:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>dreams is that dreams are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of time.</v>

2641
02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what that means is,</v>

2642
02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they draw and eternal themes.</v>

2643
02:12:26.111 --> 02:12:26.680
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

2644
02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:28.540
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must have had this experience.</v>

2645
02:12:28.541 --> 02:12:33.541
<v Speaker 1>And Freud noted this carefully in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of dreams where you know </v>

2646
02:12:33.541 --> 02:12:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you're sleeping and the alarm goes off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the alarm noise is incorporated into</v>

2647
02:12:37.361 --> 02:12:42.361
<v Speaker 1>your dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the dream has been going </v>

2648
02:12:42.361 --> 02:12:45.361
<v Speaker 1>on for an hour in subjective time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up and you realize that it's </v>

2649
02:12:45.361 --> 02:12:45.361
<v Speaker 1>the alarm clock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>

2650
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason why your dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>time should be the same as real time </v>

2651
02:12:50.430 --> 02:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>because it's all going on in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

2652
02:12:51.341 --> 02:12:56.341
<v Speaker 1>But it's amazing in some sense how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>can happen in such a short period of </v>

2653
02:12:56.341 --> 02:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>time in your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's outside of time.</v>

2654
02:12:59.741 --> 02:13:02.860
<v Speaker 1>The world of fantasy is in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of outside of time.</v>

2655
02:13:02.861 --> 02:13:06.820
<v Speaker 1>And so the cricket tells time to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does.</v>

2656
02:13:08.290 --> 02:13:13.290
<v Speaker 1>And then the star enlarges and it turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this blue fairy who's got a </v>

2657
02:13:18.131 --> 02:13:21.280
<v Speaker 1>celestial Gao covered with stars.</v>

2658
02:13:21.610 --> 02:13:25.000
<v Speaker 1>And who's got wings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she's kind of some ethereal being and</v>

2659
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:28.090
<v Speaker 1>like you don't have a problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie.</v>

2660
02:13:28.091 --> 02:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2661
02:13:28.721 --> 02:13:29.320
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2662
02:13:29.321 --> 02:13:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2663
02:13:31.220 --> 02:13:33.030
<v Speaker 1>it came from a star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes perfect sense,</v>

2664
02:13:33.031 --> 02:13:36.090
<v Speaker 1>which of course it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense whatsoever.</v>

2665
02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense,</v>

2666
02:13:37.801 --> 02:13:41.940
<v Speaker 1>but you're willing to go along with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because on the one hand it makes sense.</v>

2667
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.000
<v Speaker 1>No sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand it makes perfect </v>

2668
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:47.000
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fairy godmother idea.</v>

2669
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:47.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2670
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:47.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairy Godmother,</v>

2671
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:52.430
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got back and it's in the idea there </v>

2672
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:53.550
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well nature comes to your aid.</v>

2673
02:13:53.551 --> 02:13:54.860
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2674
02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.710
<v Speaker 1>it's the benevolent force of nature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your side now,</v>

2675
02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:02.700
<v Speaker 1>not obviously only on your side because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it opposes you as well,</v>

2676
02:14:02.970 --> 02:14:07.970
<v Speaker 1>but then there's your own mother as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's also nature who's on your site.</v>

2677
02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:13.100
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an idea here and the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if the father gets the wish </v>

2678
02:14:13.861 --> 02:14:16.710
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aim right for the child,</v>

2679
02:14:17.550 --> 02:14:20.640
<v Speaker 1>then nature will cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2680
02:14:20.670 --> 02:14:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's true,</v>

2681
02:14:22.381 --> 02:14:27.381
<v Speaker 1>is that if you set up your relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cultural relationship with your </v>

2682
02:14:27.381 --> 02:14:31.341
<v Speaker 1>child properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're far more likely to </v>

2683
02:14:31.341 --> 02:14:33.951
<v Speaker 1>flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you get the magic of nature on </v>

2684
02:14:33.951 --> 02:14:35.040
<v Speaker 1>your side by establishing the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim.</v>

2685
02:14:35.250 --> 02:14:36.690
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

2686
02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2687
02:14:37.261 --> 02:14:42.261
<v Speaker 1>this is what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm aiming at and because </v>

2688
02:14:42.261 --> 02:14:44.520
<v Speaker 1>he's aiming at at it and because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the realm of possibility,</v>

2689
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:48.690
<v Speaker 1>nature comes to his service and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it works.</v>

2690
02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:52.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you aim at something,</v>

2691
02:14:52.590 --> 02:14:57.590
<v Speaker 1>then you muster your biological forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards that goal and if the goal is </v>

2692
02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:04.940
<v Speaker 1>feasible and attainable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will cooperate with yourself.</v>

2693
02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:08.580
<v Speaker 1>And so that's quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers would call that.</v>

2694
02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:13.890
<v Speaker 1>What's the word for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he called a genuineness,</v>

2695
02:15:13.891 --> 02:15:16.500
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think.</v>

2696
02:15:16.530 --> 02:15:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that's still what he called it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he started meant that,</v>

2697
02:15:18.601 --> 02:15:20.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of what happens when your,</v>

2698
02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>when your goals and your physiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>and biological being are aligned well </v>

2699
02:15:25.890 --> 02:15:30.890
<v Speaker 1>and you're and you can communicate both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not full of internal </v>

2700
02:15:30.890 --> 02:15:33.831
<v Speaker 1>contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so your conscious aims and your </v>

2701
02:15:33.831 --> 02:15:38.361
<v Speaker 1>biological possibilities are manifesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the same direction and so </v>

2702
02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:40.560
<v Speaker 1>while that would be good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

2703
02:15:40.561 --> 02:15:42.960
<v Speaker 1>the fairy shows up and she's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually attractive.</v>

2704
02:15:42.961 --> 02:15:47.961
<v Speaker 1>She's quite provocative and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she charmed the cricket and who gets all</v>

2705
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:50.420
<v Speaker 1>blushes and like is all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2706
02:15:51.090 --> 02:15:56.090
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed and overwhelmed by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure of celestial beauty and decides </v>

2707
02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:02.600
<v Speaker 1>to cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conscience decides to cooperate and </v>

2708
02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:05.661
<v Speaker 1>get some responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the ferry allows the puppet to </v>

2709
02:16:06.811 --> 02:16:09.450
<v Speaker 1>move without strings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>

2710
02:16:09.451 --> 02:16:13.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's the intervention of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culture focuses the aim,</v>

2711
02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:18.820
<v Speaker 1>then it's the intervention of nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>that produces the autonomy and that </v>

2712
02:16:18.820 --> 02:16:18.930
<v Speaker 1>seems to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2713
02:16:18.931 --> 02:16:20.490
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandable,</v>

2714
02:16:20.491 --> 02:16:25.491
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so she takes the strings off </v>

2715
02:16:25.591 --> 02:16:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2716
02:16:27.391 --> 02:16:29.890
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because your child is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly</v>

2717
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:34.980
<v Speaker 2>not just a creature of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By no means your child has a </v>

2718
02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:38.071
<v Speaker 2>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see that right away and that </v>

2719
02:16:38.071 --> 02:16:40.561
<v Speaker 2>temperament will unfold and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll unfold in a cultural context </v>

2720
02:16:40.561 --> 02:16:45.001
<v Speaker 2>that's amenable to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the combination of those two </v>

2721
02:16:45.001 --> 02:16:45.001
<v Speaker 2>things will produce something new,</v>

2722
02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:48.200
<v Speaker 4>you can talk,</v>

2723
02:16:50.170 --> 02:16:55.170
<v Speaker 2>he could walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the good fairy basically tells </v>

2724
02:16:55.170 --> 02:16:58.771
<v Speaker 2>him that he's got a bit of autonomy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's up to him to like clue in Tibet</v>

2725
02:16:59.201 --> 02:17:04.201
<v Speaker 2>and act properly and learn the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between good and evil and to </v>

2726
02:17:04.201 --> 02:17:06.280
<v Speaker 2>speak truthfully and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit a propaganda stick.</v>

2727
02:17:06.281 --> 02:17:08.740
<v Speaker 2>That part of the movie I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't really matter.</v>

2728
02:17:08.741 --> 02:17:13.480
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of inculcation of conventional</v>
<v Speaker 2>morality and there's a fair bit to it,</v>

2729
02:17:13.481 --> 02:17:15.400
<v Speaker 2>especially that he's supposed to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>

2730
02:17:15.940 --> 02:17:17.130
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2731
02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:19.180
<v Speaker 2>he says he will and the crickets </v>
<v Speaker 2>listing.</v>

2732
02:17:19.181 --> 02:17:22.470
<v Speaker 2>And then the puppet asks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2733
02:17:22.471 --> 02:17:26.020
<v Speaker 2>what does consciousness mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the ferry says,</v>

2734
02:17:26.021 --> 02:17:28.120
<v Speaker 2>always let your conscience be your </v>
<v Speaker 2>guide.</v>

2735
02:17:28.121 --> 02:17:29.770
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is conscience mean?</v>

2736
02:17:29.771 --> 02:17:33.370
<v Speaker 2>And then the bug who's like all puffed </v>
<v Speaker 2>up because he wants to impress the ferry</v>

2737
02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:38.520
<v Speaker 2>pops down and gets on his little </v>
<v Speaker 2>matchbox and gives this like horrible </v>

2738
02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:39.820
<v Speaker 2>little lecture about how to behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

2739
02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:43.840
<v Speaker 2>That's just like ideological chatter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could hardly even stand listening to</v>

2740
02:17:43.841 --> 02:17:45.430
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's supposed to be like that.</v>

2741
02:17:45.730 --> 02:17:50.730
<v Speaker 2>It's generic moral advice that anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>could give that's kind of dull and,</v>

2742
02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:56.080
<v Speaker 2>and also puffed up and grandiose and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just not very good at it.</v>

2743
02:17:56.740 --> 02:18:01.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why he's on his little </v>

2744
02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:01.740
<v Speaker 2>matchbox there with his chest puffed </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2745
02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.640
<v Speaker 2>And so he says that's just the travel </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the world today.</v>

2746
02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:06.040
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's his opening line,</v>

2747
02:18:06.041 --> 02:18:11.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's diagnosing the whole world and you </v>

2748
02:18:11.041 --> 02:18:11.041
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ferry,</v>

2749
02:18:11.041 --> 02:18:13.420
<v Speaker 2>she thinks he's kind of funny because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and you know,</v>

2750
02:18:13.421 --> 02:18:18.421
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real interesting thing here </v>

2751
02:18:18.421 --> 02:18:18.700
<v Speaker 2>going on because he's male and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's all puffed up with,</v>

2752
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:20.920
<v Speaker 2>with his knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is completely shallow.</v>

2753
02:18:20.921 --> 02:18:25.921
<v Speaker 2>And then he's put in contact with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>celestial feminine ideal and he just </v>

2754
02:18:25.921 --> 02:18:27.460
<v Speaker 2>turns into a complete moron.</v>

2755
02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:30.610
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what happens to men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens to them all the time.</v>

2756
02:18:31.090 --> 02:18:36.090
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she decides to give him a chance and </v>

2757
02:18:36.090 --> 02:18:39.450
<v Speaker 2>turns them into this conscience and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden he's this like 19 twenties </v>

2758
02:18:39.450 --> 02:18:39.450
<v Speaker 2>millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's been,</v>

2759
02:18:39.450 --> 02:18:42.190
<v Speaker 2>he's been unknowable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then she tells him that,</v>

2760
02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:47.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has to journey along with Pinocchio </v>

2761
02:18:47.370 --> 02:18:50.700
<v Speaker 2>in order for things to go properly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he promises that he'll be a good </v>

2762
02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:54.751
<v Speaker 2>conscience and do it and he already </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks that he can do it and that's why </v>

2763
02:18:54.751 --> 02:18:56.170
<v Speaker 2>he's on the matchbox podium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2764
02:18:56.830 --> 02:19:01.830
<v Speaker 2>espousing his morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality turns out to be much </v>

2765
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.830
<v Speaker 2>more complex</v>

2766
02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:02.660
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

2767
02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:06.670
<v Speaker 2>the bog has a little talk with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cricket.</v>

2768
02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:12.360
<v Speaker 2>The bug has a little talk with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>puppet and the Bug tries to tell </v>

2769
02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:16.141
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio explicitly what it means to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>good and he gets completely tangled up </v>

2770
02:19:17.141 --> 02:19:19.480
<v Speaker 2>in the explanation because what the hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>does he know?</v>

2771
02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:22.990
<v Speaker 2>And the puppet doesn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that he says anyways.</v>

2772
02:19:22.991 --> 02:19:27.991
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a message there and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>message is the kind of knowledge that </v>

2773
02:19:28.071 --> 02:19:33.071
<v Speaker 2>the conscience is that the conscience </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the puppet are supposed to cocreate </v>

2774
02:19:33.071 --> 02:19:36.200
<v Speaker 2>is not something that you can articulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily as a table of rules.</v>

2775
02:19:36.260 --> 02:19:41.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not like that because life is too </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated to just have fought five </v>

2776
02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:45.851
<v Speaker 2>rules that you live by and that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve every problem partly because the </v>

2777
02:19:45.851 --> 02:19:47.870
<v Speaker 2>rules will conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge part of the problem,</v>

2778
02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:52.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One moral guideline contradicts another </v>

2779
02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:52.940
<v Speaker 2>into situations like you don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

2780
02:19:53.930 --> 02:19:55.620
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decide that they're.</v>

2781
02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:00.020
<v Speaker 2>They decided that they're just going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

2782
02:20:00.021 --> 02:20:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2783
02:20:00.771 --> 02:20:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I'll be a good boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cricket says,</v>

2784
02:20:02.901 --> 02:20:04.340
<v Speaker 2>well that's the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

2785
02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:09.700
<v Speaker 2>well then Japan gets wind of it and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a little like horror episode and </v>

2786
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:15.070
<v Speaker 2>and then he finds out that the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>can is autonomous and they have a little</v>

2787
02:20:15.141 --> 02:20:20.141
<v Speaker 2>party which tells you exactly what Japan</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes up to is the autonomy emerges and </v>

2788
02:20:20.361 --> 02:20:25.361
<v Speaker 2>he's happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's stamping home the notion that </v>

2789
02:20:25.361 --> 02:20:27.710
<v Speaker 2>you pedo is in fact a good guy and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is in fact what he wants.</v>

2790
02:20:27.860 --> 02:20:32.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the encouragement of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>father is a precondition for the </v>

2791
02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:37.361
<v Speaker 2>emergence of your individuality and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also allows the feminine to play </v>

2792
02:20:37.701 --> 02:20:40.430
<v Speaker 2>a role both as nature and perhaps as </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>

2793
02:20:40.730 --> 02:20:45.730
<v Speaker 2>And so and the combination of those two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things produces the autonomous </v>

2794
02:20:45.730 --> 02:20:45.730
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

2795
02:20:45.730 --> 02:20:47.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that seems perfectly reasonable.</v>

2796
02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:52.600
<v Speaker 2>So off they go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next day they wake up and it's a new day</v>

2797
02:20:52.641 --> 02:20:55.400
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a Pinocchio is off to school.</v>

2798
02:20:55.401 --> 02:20:57.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good thing too because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

2799
02:20:57.641 --> 02:20:58.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>

2800
02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:03.340
<v Speaker 2>and he's really excited about it and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that he's been </v>

2801
02:21:03.340 --> 02:21:08.050
<v Speaker 2>parented properly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's going to go out into the world </v>

2802
02:21:08.050 --> 02:21:08.060
<v Speaker 2>of his peers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where he belongs.</v>

2803
02:21:08.210 --> 02:21:10.340
<v Speaker 2>And Japan isn't too worried about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2804
02:21:10.341 --> 02:21:11.870
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pushed them out the door,</v>

2805
02:21:11.871 --> 02:21:13.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like go,</v>

2806
02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:15.680
<v Speaker 2>you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the next thing.</v>

2807
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:20.830
<v Speaker 2>The kid isn't cowering in the corner and</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome by terror with the parents </v>

2808
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:22.280
<v Speaker 2>freaking out about all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to go wrong.</v>

2809
02:21:22.281 --> 02:21:24.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some faith in his,</v>

2810
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:29.590
<v Speaker 2>his ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he sees all the kids wandering by </v>

2811
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:33.701
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Japan Eto dresses them up and sends </v>

2812
02:21:33.701 --> 02:21:34.790
<v Speaker 2>them off to school and so and so.</v>

2813
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:37.040
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a happy family story.</v>

2814
02:21:37.041 --> 02:21:40.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like mom and dad got together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They decided that there,</v>

2815
02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:45.280
<v Speaker 2>the kid was going to be competent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous and ready to face the world.</v>

2816
02:21:45.891 --> 02:21:50.891
<v Speaker 2>And so our egos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's like five years old at this </v>

2817
02:21:50.891 --> 02:21:51.110
<v Speaker 2>point or something like that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we get,</v>

2818
02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:56.800
<v Speaker 2>that's where we're at in the story and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's a good place to stop </v>

2819
02:21:57.350 --> 02:22:02.350
<v Speaker 2>because the next thing that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 2>normally essentially it's like Pinocchio</v>

2820
02:22:02.661 --> 02:22:07.661
<v Speaker 2>goes off to be a good boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that's a hell of a lot </v>

2821
02:22:07.661 --> 02:22:10.721
<v Speaker 2>more complicated than he might think </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are actually complications</v>

2822
02:22:11.421 --> 02:22:14.240
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also malevolence right?</v>

2823
02:22:14.390 --> 02:22:19.390
<v Speaker 2>The desire for things not to go right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people who are not oriented </v>

2824
02:22:19.390 --> 02:22:23.711
<v Speaker 2>towards the ideal in any way at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Pinocchio's young and naive.</v>

2825
02:22:25.770 --> 02:22:29.730
<v Speaker 2>And so he has no defense whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 2>against this malevolence.</v>

2826
02:22:29.730 --> 02:22:31.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2827
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:36.150
<v Speaker 2>that's not an expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not unexpected.</v>

2828
02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:39.300
<v Speaker 2>And it also turns out that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience,</v>

2829
02:22:39.390 --> 02:22:44.390
<v Speaker 2>the cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is still not very clued in over </v>

2830
02:22:44.390 --> 02:22:46.350
<v Speaker 2>sleeps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's just not there at a critical</v>

2831
02:22:46.351 --> 02:22:48.420
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think we'll pick that up.</v>

2832
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:53.870
<v Speaker 2>We'll pick that up next week because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a good point in the plot to </v>

2833
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:57.711
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The child has entered the broader world </v>

2834
02:22:57.711 --> 02:23:01.280
<v Speaker 2>and has to cope with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's prepared because he had a </v>

2835
02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:05.541
<v Speaker 2>wonderful father and he had a magical </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother and so he's as prepared as you </v>

2836
02:23:05.541 --> 02:23:09.261
<v Speaker 2>can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not even completely a marionette </v>

2837
02:23:09.261 --> 02:23:09.261
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2838
02:23:09.261 --> 02:23:11.490
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now it's up to him.</v>

2839
02:23:11.580 --> 02:23:16.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's up to him and his parents have </v>

2840
02:23:16.580 --> 02:23:16.680
<v Speaker 2>done basically what they could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really about right.</v>

2841
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:17.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2842
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:19.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wise,</v>

2843
02:23:19.561 --> 02:23:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I would say psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2844
02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2845
02:23:25.801 --> 02:23:26.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
