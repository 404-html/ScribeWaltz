1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 2>so I guess the case that I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>last time,</v>

3
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that you're one of one way of </v>

4
00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:26.461
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizing the fundamental problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings face is to </v>

5
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:32.641
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize it as an ongoing struggle </v>
<v Speaker 2>with complexity and complexity emerges </v>

6
00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of</v>

7
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 2>the sort of finite boundedness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual consciousness and the </v>

8
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 2>incredible excess of the unbounded every</v>
<v Speaker 2>way are everywhere else,</v>

9
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 2>even including underneath that </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

10
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Because of course your individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness depends on the function or</v>

11
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 2>is related to the function of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are so complex.</v>

12
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:11.091
<v Speaker 2>You can't even understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there you are surrounded by some </v>

13
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:15.891
<v Speaker 2>things that you understand in an in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean of things that you don't </v>

14
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:19.701
<v Speaker 2>understand at all and including things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about yourself and it's not obvious at </v>

15
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 2>all how people solve that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in some sense it's not solvable.</v>

16
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.260
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive resources or the conceptual </v>

17
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.521
<v Speaker 2>resources to understand everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to understand in order to </v>

18
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 2>properly orient yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously,</v>

19
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:41.391
<v Speaker 2>partly the way we deal with that is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cooperate with other people and so </v>

20
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 2>that radically multiplies our resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>credibly multiplies our resources,</v>

21
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 2>so and so.</v>

22
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.190
<v Speaker 2>It's something to consider always when </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of the political dialog that </v>

23
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 2>surrounds us now consists of a critique </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

24
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 2>of cooperative societies and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 2>an analysis of their oppressive nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course that's true because any </v>

26
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.200
<v Speaker 2>cooperative system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it specifies a certain endpoint and </v>

27
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 2>produces a value hierarchy of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also simultaneously forces things into </v>

28
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 2>that value system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then rank orders,</v>

29
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 2>people according to the value structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there an oppressive element to </v>

30
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but compared to being naked in chaos,</v>

31
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 2>generally it's better now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't always have to be because it </v>

32
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 2>can get murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But generally speaking,</v>

33
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're social animals.</v>

34
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our evolutionary pathway has already </v>

35
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.971
<v Speaker 2>taken us here and so we're individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're unbelievably social and so </v>

36
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.960
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as far as I can tell,</v>

37
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to be completely different </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures not to fall,</v>

38
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 2>not to take advantage of and fall prey </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the problems with social being.</v>

39
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

40
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.820
<v Speaker 3>I think the way that the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity has been solved,</v>

41
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 3>and this is the best argument I know of </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the truth of the Darwinian notion of</v>

42
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:15.811
<v Speaker 3>evolution now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that our models of </v>

43
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 3>evolution are complete by any stretch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the imagination.</v>

44
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know they're not partly because of </v>

45
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 3>recent work done in epigenetics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which suggests that you can acquire,</v>

46
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 3>you can inherit acquired traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

47
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:33.151
<v Speaker 3>And when I went to university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started going to university in </v>

48
00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 3>the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was heresy really.</v>

49
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

50
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.530
<v Speaker 3>you cannot inherit acquired traits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually you can inherit acquired </v>

51
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 3>traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the field of epigenetic studies.</v>

52
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:47.491
<v Speaker 3>That and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a radical shift in perspective </v>

53
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 3>because we also don't know exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>that means across any length of time.</v>

54
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 3>And when you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary lengths of time,</v>

55
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking about three and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>billion years because that's the span of</v>

56
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 3>time over which life evolved.</v>

57
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160
<v Speaker 3>And so even things that don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmingly market potency for one </v>

58
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 3>generation can be unbelievably powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>across time.</v>

59
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also the issue of sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual selection,</v>

60
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:16.291
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll hear darwinists continually </v>

61
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:19.921
<v Speaker 3>describe the world and the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>world as a place of randomness and </v>

62
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 3>that's not true and I don't know why </v>
<v Speaker 3>they make that statement.</v>

63
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 3>The mutations are random or quasi random</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we don't understand the </v>

64
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 3>mutations that well yet either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most mutations are deadly,</v>

65
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most mutations are deadly.</v>

66
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a set of them that are harmful </v>
<v Speaker 3>but not deadly.</v>

67
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:40.291
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny proportion that could in principle </v>

68
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:44.460
<v Speaker 3>produced some benefit to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation assuming environmental </v>

69
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 3>environmental shift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say in the direction of the mutation.</v>

70
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a randomness element to that.</v>

71
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 3>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

72
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.610
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason that you mutate or </v>
<v Speaker 3>your cells mutate your DNA mutates is </v>

73
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 3>because of background levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>radioactivity.</v>

74
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that's a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>solar activity,</v>

75
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:07.921
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So cosmic rays come zipping through the </v>

76
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:09.931
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere and they nail your DNA and </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce minor alterations and that's a </v>

77
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:14.161
<v Speaker 3>mutation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you crank up the background </v>

78
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:14.161
<v Speaker 3>radiation rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say around Chernobyl,</v>

79
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:18.541
<v Speaker 3>then the mutation rate rises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's definitely a random element </v>

80
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:22.291
<v Speaker 3>to that and it's necessary for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a random element because as far as I </v>

81
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:27.961
<v Speaker 3>can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way you can beat a random </v>

82
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:27.961
<v Speaker 3>environment is by producing random </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes,</v>

83
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know the idea,</v>

84
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:35.161
<v Speaker 3>basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment isn't some static place </v>

85
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 3>that's selecting for higher and higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels of fitness or not in any,</v>

86
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.200
<v Speaker 3>not in any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly not doing that in any </v>

87
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 3>static way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's shifting around randomly and</v>

88
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:49.771
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a structure that's been your </v>

89
00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 3>species has a structure that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of this immense evolutionary</v>

90
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 3>journey and it's moderating itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>randomly within certain parameters.</v>

91
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 3>The parameters being that most mutations</v>
<v Speaker 3>will kill you,</v>

92
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 3>like alterations in your fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>form generally tend to kill you.</v>

93
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 3>So they're incremental and so the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mutations are random and they match.</v>

94
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:10.631
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully they ratchet the randomness in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environmental shift and so you can </v>

95
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 3>more or less keep up that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's additional complicating</v>

96
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:17.861
<v Speaker 3>factors and they're not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of them is whatever epigenetics </v>

97
00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:17.861
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know anything about that yet.</v>

98
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 3>But the second one is sexual selection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sexual selection is no joke.</v>

99
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.760
<v Speaker 3>It could be the primary thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly one of the primary things </v>

100
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.540
<v Speaker 3>that's driven human evolution and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you can say that</v>

101
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.870
<v Speaker 3>you think about the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

102
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 3>let's think about the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have a dominance hierarchy and </v>

103
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 3>that's really an old structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dominance hierarchy,</v>

104
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.820
<v Speaker 3>300 million years old because it emerged</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much whenever there was,</v>

105
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
<v Speaker 3>whenever there was a nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emergent nervous system and whenever </v>

106
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.280
<v Speaker 3>animals had to occupy the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory,</v>

107
00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:54.610
<v Speaker 3>they automatically organized themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>into something approximating a dominance</v>

108
00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:56.230
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a very,</v>

109
00:06:56.231 --> 00:06:57.010
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

110
00:06:57.011 --> 00:06:59.590
<v Speaker 3>very old structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's older than trees.</v>

111
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.620
<v Speaker 3>It's older than flowers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's old.</v>

112
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.880
<v Speaker 3>And as far as real goes from a Darwinian</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>

113
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.650
<v Speaker 3>permanent is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you,</v>

114
00:07:10.651 --> 00:07:11.440
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

115
00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:16.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our burial ancestors adapted themselves </v>

116
00:07:16.441 --> 00:07:19.171
<v Speaker 3>to treats and so the tree was a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>around long enough to be a feature of </v>

117
00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:23.911
<v Speaker 3>the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the dominance hierarchy has been </v>

118
00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:26.551
<v Speaker 3>around a lot longer than trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can think of the dominance </v>

119
00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:27.400
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy both as an adaptation to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

120
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.640
<v Speaker 3>because you'd kind of think about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominant Turkey has a cultural </v>

121
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.221
<v Speaker 3>construct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if a cultural construct lasts long </v>

122
00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.450
<v Speaker 3>enough that it becomes part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and so the dominant Turkey's</v>

123
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:40.930
<v Speaker 3>part of the environment and what seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen roughly speaking,</v>

124
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.300
<v Speaker 3>and this is an oversimplification but </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go with it,</v>

125
00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:48.301
<v Speaker 3>is that males have a dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a relatively small number of</v>

126
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:54.850
<v Speaker 3>males that are relatively successful and</v>
<v Speaker 3>those successful males have preferential</v>

127
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:59.851
<v Speaker 3>access to female reproductive capacity </v>
<v Speaker 3>either because the females actively </v>

128
00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:02.860
<v Speaker 3>choose the the more dominant males,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very,</v>

129
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:07.861
<v Speaker 3>very common or because the more dominant</v>
<v Speaker 3>males chase all the less dominant males </v>

130
00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:11.470
<v Speaker 3>away so that even if the females don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise choice,</v>

131
00:08:11.471 --> 00:08:16.471
<v Speaker 3>which they often do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the only males left around that can</v>

132
00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:17.770
<v Speaker 3>serve as reasonable.</v>

133
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Mating partners are the more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>

134
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.100
<v Speaker 3>And so you think you get to really </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical determiners of evolution as a </v>

135
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.550
<v Speaker 3>consequence of that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that</v>

136
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.430
<v Speaker 1>each.</v>

137
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about female dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies at the moment,</v>

138
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.400
<v Speaker 3>but I can talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's why this is an </v>

139
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.691
<v Speaker 3>oversimplification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what happens is that the males </v>

140
00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:44.470
<v Speaker 3>obviously are selected for their ability</v>
<v Speaker 3>to move up dominance hierarchies </v>

141
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 3>obviously because the ones that are at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the top of the dominance hierarchy </v>

142
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.250
<v Speaker 3>reproduce preferentially and so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>means the male dominance hierarchy </v>

143
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.061
<v Speaker 3>becomes a method of selection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then allied with that is the female </v>

144
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:01.491
<v Speaker 3>proclivity for choice on whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension the dominance hierarchy </v>

145
00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:05.391
<v Speaker 3>happens to be arranged and so then </v>
<v Speaker 3>female sexual selection also becomes a </v>

146
00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:09.411
<v Speaker 3>radical nonrandom selector of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

147
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.470
<v Speaker 3>of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what genetic material is going to move </v>

148
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.470
<v Speaker 3>into the next generation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>

149
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I failed to see how any of that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>separated from the emergence of complex </v>

150
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 3>nervous systems and mind over the course</v>
<v Speaker 3>of evolution because people aren't.</v>

151
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Creatures aren't making random choices.</v>

152
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:31.550
<v Speaker 3>They're not random at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we even know such things like imagine</v>

153
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 3>a peacock's tail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

154
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 3>it's covered with ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite interesting because eyes </v>

155
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 3>of course attract attention and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals have evolved.</v>

156
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.050
<v Speaker 3>I liked markets like moss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's moss that when they unfold your </v>

157
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.921
<v Speaker 3>wings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have two big eyes on the back of </v>

158
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:48.921
<v Speaker 3>them and that's to keep birds from </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating them right?</v>

159
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.251
<v Speaker 3>Because the birds don't like being </v>
<v Speaker 3>stared at so they stay away from the </v>

160
00:09:52.251 --> 00:09:55.041
<v Speaker 3>moths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so a peacock's tails is nothing but </v>

161
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:57.771
<v Speaker 3>eyes and so it's very attractive and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>shimmers and there's something about it </v>

162
00:09:57.771 --> 00:09:58.680
<v Speaker 3>that's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite interesting to.</v>

163
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.890
<v Speaker 3>The females have obviously been </v>
<v Speaker 3>selecting the male peacock peacocks for </v>

164
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 3>beauty and they have this insane tail </v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

165
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 3>So the evolutionary biologists have </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

166
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:12.531
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what possible utility could that tail </v>

167
00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 3>be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it just maybe the females got fixated</v>

168
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:14.520
<v Speaker 3>on tail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

169
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:19.521
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a bold would affect loop </v>

170
00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:23.001
<v Speaker 3>going there and the male peacocks just </v>
<v Speaker 3>got bigger and bigger tales and it's </v>

171
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:23.001
<v Speaker 3>just like an evolutionary dead end.</v>

172
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:23.001
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

173
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:26.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a positive feedback system that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone out of control,</v>

174
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.280
<v Speaker 3>but they have done things that like look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the symmetry and and and breadth say,</v>

175
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:37.131
<v Speaker 3>or the symmetry and size and overall </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality of the male peacock's tail as a </v>

176
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.160
<v Speaker 3>marker for physical health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So reduce parasite load for example,</v>

177
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 3>and it does turn out that the healthier </v>
<v Speaker 3>male peacocks have better tail display.</v>

178
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.360
<v Speaker 3>And so the way what the female seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be doing is using some marker or some </v>

179
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 3>set of markers as a proxy indicator for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

180
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.700
<v Speaker 3>for health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think I think you could say with,</v>

181
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.230
<v Speaker 3>with reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say reasonable that reasonably</v>

182
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:06.231
<v Speaker 3>that female human beings do the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to male human beings and there's </v>

183
00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 3>some of that vice versa too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we evaluate each other,</v>

184
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for symmetry,</v>

185
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:12.690
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the elements of beauty </v>
<v Speaker 3>because healthier people tend to be more</v>

186
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:15.240
<v Speaker 3>symmetrical and lots of animals use </v>
<v Speaker 3>symmetry.</v>

187
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Butterflies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>butterflies won't mate with another </v>

188
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 3>butterfly if it deviates from symmetry </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the tiniest amounts you can imagine.</v>

189
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.200
<v Speaker 3>So symmetry is a marker and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>other markers like shoulder width to </v>

190
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 3>waste with his wanton waste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with to hip width is another,</v>

191
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 3>that's usually what mail is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use that to evaluate females in part.</v>

192
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 3>So there's lots of markers of health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

193
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.890
<v Speaker 3>but it also looks to me like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

194
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 3>the data worldwide seems to indicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>that women.</v>

195
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that women made to cross </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance,</v>

196
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:49.530
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies end up socioeconomically </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking and on average across cultures,</v>

197
00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 3>women go for men who are about four to </v>
<v Speaker 3>five years older,</v>

198
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it varies in the Scandinavian countries </v>

199
00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.020
<v Speaker 3>that's shrunk a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not that much.</v>

200
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.620
<v Speaker 3>And in other cultures it's bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that depends to some degree </v>

201
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 3>on difficulty of establishing economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>independence,</v>

202
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because in richer countries it's easier </v>

203
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:08.220
<v Speaker 3>to have enough economic independence if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a male to be,</v>

204
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 3>to be a useful participant in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>process of having children.</v>

205
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>

206
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:19.501
<v Speaker 3>Cross culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still across an awkward man mate </v>

207
00:12:19.501 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 3>across and down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care much about socioeconomic</v>

208
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:24.811
<v Speaker 3>status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't seem to be part of their </v>

209
00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:25.060
<v Speaker 3>selection method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally speaking.</v>

210
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:31.110
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think that part of that is also the</v>

211
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 3>ability of women to select for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for male health,</v>

212
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:39.001
<v Speaker 3>it's something like that because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that only that because if you're </v>

213
00:12:39.001 --> 00:12:40.240
<v Speaker 3>healthy and energetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're much more likely to be successful</v>

214
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 3>because it's very hard to be successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're ill.</v>

215
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

216
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 3>so because the competition is just too </v>
<v Speaker 3>high and both,</v>

217
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:52.201
<v Speaker 3>both genders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both sexes select each other for </v>

218
00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:52.201
<v Speaker 3>attractiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both selector intelligence,</v>

219
00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:54.990
<v Speaker 3>both at select for personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although the different,</v>

220
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.920
<v Speaker 3>there are differences there in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

221
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 3>what stressed but so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

222
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 3>so I think you can derive a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things out of,</v>

223
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.680
<v Speaker 3>out of this and this is where I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are different than,</v>

224
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.910
<v Speaker 3>than other animals.</v>

225
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.910
<v Speaker 3>Importantly different is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you imagine that there's tremendous </v>

226
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.340
<v Speaker 3>selection pressure to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

227
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 3>towards the production,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say a man who are good at climbing</v>

228
00:13:17.441 --> 00:13:22.441
<v Speaker 3>male dominance hierarchies or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or climbing the male dominance </v>

229
00:13:22.441 --> 00:13:26.341
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that's so interesting </v>

230
00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:26.530
<v Speaker 3>about people is that we've multiplied </v>
<v Speaker 3>our dominance hierarchies.</v>

231
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:32.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take an animal that's got a </v>

232
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:32.420
<v Speaker 3>rather static behavioral pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's,</v>

233
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.670
<v Speaker 3>there's a single hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elephant seals are a good example of </v>

234
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.670
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So elephant seals,</v>

235
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 3>the males are absolutely massive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're way,</v>

236
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:43.591
<v Speaker 3>way bigger than the females,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they basically have harems roughly </v>

237
00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:44.040
<v Speaker 3>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

238
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 3>they used physical prowess as their </v>
<v Speaker 3>marker of status essentially.</v>

239
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 3>And obviously size is a huge part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because otherwise the male elephant</v>

240
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:53.590
<v Speaker 3>seals wouldn't be as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're massive.</v>

241
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:58.591
<v Speaker 3>These things are absolutely enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's just power slash health,</v>

242
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe aggression,</v>

243
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:01.540
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

244
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.130
<v Speaker 3>It's whatever makes them more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

245
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.580
<v Speaker 3>suitable for the kind of physical combat</v>
<v Speaker 3>that elephant seals engage it.</v>

246
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.180
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the degree to which power is </v>

247
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.361
<v Speaker 3>associated with dominance status in </v>
<v Speaker 3>those sorts of situation seems to be </v>

248
00:14:18.361 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 3>associated with the size differential </v>
<v Speaker 3>between males and females.</v>

249
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.590
<v Speaker 3>So the more power is an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to male competence,</v>

250
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:31.591
<v Speaker 3>the larger the bales are compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>females and the more likely the males </v>

251
00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:32.440
<v Speaker 3>are going to have a heroine relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the females.</v>

252
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.650
<v Speaker 3>And you see that a little bit in human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings because men are bigger than </v>

253
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not overwhelmingly bigger.</v>

254
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 3>That's sexual dimorphism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

255
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:41.860
<v Speaker 3>there's some men that are smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 3>some women,</v>

256
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:46.861
<v Speaker 3>but on average men are tolerant there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have more upper body strength and </v>

257
00:14:46.861 --> 00:14:50.251
<v Speaker 3>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is a power element to male </v>

258
00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:52.501
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not as extended as it would be </v>

259
00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 3>among animals like elephants seals.</v>

260
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.870
<v Speaker 3>So in the elephant seal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see maybe there's one stable set of </v>

261
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:03.641
<v Speaker 3>traits that's being selected for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes the males more likely to </v>

262
00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:03.950
<v Speaker 3>reproduce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but human beings,</v>

263
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:08.951
<v Speaker 3>we're very weird creatures because we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>so conceptually flexible and so what </v>

264
00:15:08.951 --> 00:15:12.940
<v Speaker 3>seems to have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we started male,</v>

265
00:15:12.941 --> 00:15:17.941
<v Speaker 3>started selecting each other for </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance competitions for something </v>

266
00:15:17.941 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 3>like cognitive flexibility and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness.</v>

267
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:24.521
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would be the ability to </v>

268
00:15:24.521 --> 00:15:28.541
<v Speaker 3>abstractly represent the world and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to operate effectively </v>

269
00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:32.021
<v Speaker 3>within it to represent yourself socially</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way and then to carry through with </v>

270
00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:32.990
<v Speaker 3>that because that enables people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust you.</v>

271
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:38.410
<v Speaker 3>So it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that produced cortical expansion </v>

272
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:44.111
<v Speaker 3>and then women were selecting men who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are good at that and that produced </v>

273
00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:47.231
<v Speaker 3>cortical expansion and then there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>arms race between women and men with </v>

274
00:15:47.231 --> 00:15:51.671
<v Speaker 3>regards to intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the women kept up or they certainly </v>

275
00:15:51.671 --> 00:15:51.671
<v Speaker 3>kept up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

276
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 3>with intelligence as the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle continued.</v>

277
00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:01.450
<v Speaker 3>But one of the consequences of selection</v>
<v Speaker 3>for cortical expansion and increased </v>

278
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.800
<v Speaker 3>cognitive flexibility was that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of dominance hierarchies that </v>

279
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.890
<v Speaker 3>human beings can produce started to </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiply.</v>

280
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's all sorts of ways that </v>

281
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:16.721
<v Speaker 3>you can be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's you think about how many ways </v>

282
00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:19.841
<v Speaker 3>you can be successful in a modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture and you can be successful in </v>

283
00:16:19.841 --> 00:16:21.110
<v Speaker 3>dimensions that aren't really even </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with each other,</v>

284
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 3>so you can be successful socially that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what an extrovert would do.</v>

285
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.680
<v Speaker 3>You could be successful in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimate relationships.</v>

286
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what a agreeable person would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A disagreeable person would be more </v>

287
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 3>successful with regards to competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A person who's high in neuroticism would</v>

288
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:40.691
<v Speaker 3>be would be trying to protect themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to establish some sort of security </v>

289
00:16:40.691 --> 00:16:44.800
<v Speaker 3>and open person would be looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>flexible creative environment and so </v>

290
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.851
<v Speaker 3>there's this multiplicity of of ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can establish a dominance </v>

291
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy and be successful in it and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're creative,</v>

292
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:53.840
<v Speaker 3>you can come up with your own damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy,</v>

293
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.550
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what you're doing.</v>

294
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.480
<v Speaker 3>If you're creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

295
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:01.510
<v Speaker 3>You spin up a game that's your game and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you make the rules and that's hard </v>

296
00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:03.850
<v Speaker 3>because if you make a new game with new </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>

297
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.860
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to monetize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can be the best at playing that </v>

298
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.251
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a huge advantage to being </v>

299
00:17:12.251 --> 00:17:12.620
<v Speaker 3>creative if you can pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you think,</v>

300
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:17.621
<v Speaker 3>well what's happened among human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the multiplication of the set of </v>

301
00:17:17.721 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 3>possible dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's become very broad.</v>

302
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.720
<v Speaker 3>And then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what's what's driving selection now</v>

303
00:17:23.721 --> 00:17:28.721
<v Speaker 3>is the ability to be successful across </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple sets of dominance hierarchies </v>

304
00:17:28.721 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 3>and that accounts at least in part for </v>
<v Speaker 3>our cognitive flexibility.</v>

305
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.580
<v Speaker 3>And so that's really what a human being </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a human being is a creature that has </v>

306
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.821
<v Speaker 3>high potential for succeeding across a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very wide range of potential human </v>

307
00:17:39.821 --> 00:17:39.950
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchies.</v>

308
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 3>And so that gives us our transformative </v>
<v Speaker 3>psyche.</v>

309
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:48.281
<v Speaker 3>That's the niche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the niche that we've both </v>

310
00:17:48.281 --> 00:17:49.530
<v Speaker 3>produced and occupy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's out of that,</v>

311
00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:54.531
<v Speaker 3>that hero mythology emerges </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally because I think what the </v>

312
00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:58.101
<v Speaker 3>hero is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mythological hero is a </v>

313
00:17:58.101 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 3>representation of that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psyche that's particularly good at being</v>

314
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 3>successful across sets of dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies.</v>

315
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.580
<v Speaker 3>And it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very biological way of thinking about </v>

316
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:07.580
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

317
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about this for a long time.</v>

318
00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 3>I can't see any way that that just can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the case in how else?</v>

319
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.290
<v Speaker 3>How else could it work if we had a fixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavioral pattern like beavers,</v>

320
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were the most successful beaver.</v>

321
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:22.580
<v Speaker 3>If you build the best damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like fine.</v>

322
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Then you know what's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>selected for it,</v>

323
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:27.990
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't what people are like and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also why we're so multipurpose.</v>

324
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have hands.</v>

325
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.990
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a hand for?</v>

326
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.310
<v Speaker 3>What's the evolutionary function of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand while you.</v>

327
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 3>You can't specify that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say it's something like,</v>

328
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.650
<v Speaker 3>well hand is useful for doing a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of different things with well and </v>

329
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:43.320
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tongue,</v>

330
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:48.321
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are words for while it's the same </v>

331
00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:48.660
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore very there for communicating a</v>

332
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.140
<v Speaker 3>very wide range of information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

333
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:54.840
<v Speaker 3>So were were these weird general purpose</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

334
00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:57.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not great at any one thing,</v>

335
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 3>but we can swim better than most </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrestrial animals.</v>

336
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:07.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can run faster than most animals and </v>

337
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.641
<v Speaker 3>we can certainly run longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a human being can run a horse to </v>

338
00:19:10.641 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 3>death over the course of a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're in good shape,</v>

339
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.230
<v Speaker 3>so like we're really good at being </v>
<v Speaker 3>multipurpose entity,</v>

340
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.310
<v Speaker 3>like a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

341
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:22.311
<v Speaker 3>were they call rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weedy species because they can be </v>

342
00:19:22.311 --> 00:19:22.311
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>

343
00:19:22.311 --> 00:19:24.170
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a specific niche like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

344
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.180
<v Speaker 3>there's animals down in the Amazon that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are specialized for like one tree or one</v>

345
00:19:30.451 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 3>type of tree in one tiny little area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what human beings like us.</v>

346
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like cockroaches and rats,</v>

347
00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:40.950
<v Speaker 3>which is nasty comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can go anywhere and thrive and so</v>

348
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 3>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being particularly good at that,</v>

349
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.120
<v Speaker 3>being particularly good at being able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go anywhere and thrive also seems to me </v>

350
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.780
<v Speaker 3>to be a canonical element of the hero </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythology.</v>

351
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

352
00:19:53.911 --> 00:19:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

353
00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Now I started to introduce all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>topics because I was trying to address </v>

354
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:08.400
<v Speaker 3>the issue of how it is that we've come </v>
<v Speaker 3>to deal with the fact that things are so</v>

355
00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:13.050
<v Speaker 3>complex that we can't deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a huge part of the answer to that</v>

356
00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:16.740
<v Speaker 3>is the Darwinian announcers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is while you keep up with things you</v>

357
00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:18.820
<v Speaker 3>can't keep up with by changing </v>
<v Speaker 3>unpredictably.</v>

358
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.760
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an example,</v>

359
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:26.690
<v Speaker 3>you know sometimes if you're driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the road and there's a deer on the </v>

360
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.171
<v Speaker 3>road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you'll run into it and it'll </v>

361
00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:32.480
<v Speaker 3>instead of jumping out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sort of jumps randomly and then you </v>

362
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:32.480
<v Speaker 3>run into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

363
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.321
<v Speaker 3>well that's a pretty stupid strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like natural selections at work </v>

364
00:20:36.321 --> 00:20:40.731
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it turns out the deer jump randomly </v>

365
00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 3>when wolves are chasing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well why would you do that?</v>

366
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't predict it,</v>

367
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

368
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 3>if something horrible is after you </v>
<v Speaker 3>acting unpredictably is a pretty good </v>

369
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.591
<v Speaker 3>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's basically what mutation does </v>

370
00:20:52.591 --> 00:20:55.500
<v Speaker 3>means the horrible thing that's after </v>
<v Speaker 3>you always is the rapid transformation </v>

371
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 3>of the environment and the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can possibly do in that,</v>

372
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 3>in that case is capitalize on chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

373
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:06.211
<v Speaker 3>So that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's partly why the Darwinian </v>

374
00:21:06.211 --> 00:21:06.211
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think has to be right,</v>

375
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.910
<v Speaker 3>because the environment does move </v>
<v Speaker 3>unpredictably and the only way you can </v>

376
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:13.550
<v Speaker 3>keep up with something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>unpredictable,</v>

377
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:18.590
<v Speaker 3>to generate variance and hope that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them has drawn the lucky lottery </v>

378
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:18.970
<v Speaker 3>card.</v>

379
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 3>But then there's these additional </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>

380
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:26.071
<v Speaker 3>which is that we're also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we also seem to be tightly selected for </v>

381
00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:30.660
<v Speaker 3>the capacity to cooperate and compete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that multiplies our cognitive </v>

382
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 3>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge part of it.</v>

383
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.300
<v Speaker 3>And then we're also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we also seem to have constructed </v>

384
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:36.300
<v Speaker 3>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

385
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 3>through sexual choice into these general</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

386
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 3>general purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem solving creatures.</v>

387
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:46.090
<v Speaker 3>And so we've internalized some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Darwinian process.</v>

388
00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:51.091
<v Speaker 3>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well most animals will produce variance </v>

389
00:21:51.091 --> 00:21:53.560
<v Speaker 3>of themselves physically and then most </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those variants die.</v>

390
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.110
<v Speaker 3>But human beings have built A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lance built a mechanism,</v>

391
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 3>let's say that's like a game engine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a really good,</v>

392
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.040
<v Speaker 3>you know how there are game engines now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have devised their,</v>

393
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:12.110
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their computational devices and you can </v>

394
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.630
<v Speaker 3>take a game engine and you can generate </v>
<v Speaker 3>games with it like computer games.</v>

395
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.860
<v Speaker 3>So I'm the game engine is a mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 3>for producing games.</v>

396
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what our brains are like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our brains are game engines for </v>

397
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.101
<v Speaker 3>producing games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is that when you </v>

398
00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:29.010
<v Speaker 3>think you produce an Avatar of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you produce a fictional world,</v>

399
00:22:29.011 --> 00:22:32.860
<v Speaker 3>and that that Avatar and habits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you produce multiple fictional</v>

400
00:22:32.861 --> 00:22:36.490
<v Speaker 3>worlds and multiple avatars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the EU that could be tomorrow,</v>

401
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:40.570
<v Speaker 3>which is what you're doing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>planning and you walk the Avatar through</v>

402
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:45.630
<v Speaker 3>its potential routes and those that look</v>
<v Speaker 3>good and you keep and those that don't </v>

403
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.630
<v Speaker 3>look good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kill.</v>

404
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:50.970
<v Speaker 3>And so you can then you can embody the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas that you keep an act those out.</v>

405
00:22:51.491 --> 00:22:54.070
<v Speaker 3>And hopefully the idea is that when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>embody them,</v>

406
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.350
<v Speaker 3>you're successful and you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

407
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:02.100
<v Speaker 3>And so we're select.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've also seen that when we've been </v>

408
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:02.100
<v Speaker 3>selecting each other for cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>prowess,</v>

409
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:07.500
<v Speaker 3>we've been selecting ourselves for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to generate avatars out of </v>

410
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.070
<v Speaker 3>ourself and kill them instead of dying.</v>

411
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.180
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

412
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.920
<v Speaker 3>and that's really akin to the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovery of the future,</v>

413
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The future is a place where variance of </v>

414
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.781
<v Speaker 3>you could exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that and other </v>

415
00:23:21.781 --> 00:23:21.781
<v Speaker 3>animals don't seem to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

416
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.790
<v Speaker 3>So we're very sneaky and well so far </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem to be working too badly,</v>

417
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:28.810
<v Speaker 3>although we haven't been around for very</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

418
00:23:28.811 --> 00:23:33.811
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean human beings of our particular </v>

419
00:23:33.811 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 3>sub species about 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

420
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:38.020
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is from an evolutionary timeframe.</v>

421
00:23:38.021 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

422
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.590
<v Speaker 3>it's 2080 year old man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not very long,</v>

423
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about it that way.</v>

424
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

425
00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 3>now what I want to do is draw a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between that developmental </v>

426
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.931
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that evolutionary process and the </v>

427
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:06.930
<v Speaker 3>emergence of these underlying </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivational systems.</v>

428
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:12.710
<v Speaker 3>It's something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you imagine you go back in time to </v>

429
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.710
<v Speaker 3>the emergence of the development of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous systems.</v>

430
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's cells that creatures use to do </v>

431
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.720
<v Speaker 3>produce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motor output and there are cells that </v>

432
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.900
<v Speaker 3>creatures use to map the patterns around</v>
<v Speaker 3>them onto themselves.</v>

433
00:24:24.901 --> 00:24:27.810
<v Speaker 3>And so those are that sensory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the sensory layer,</v>

434
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.170
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine sensory layer,</v>

435
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.920
<v Speaker 3>nervous layer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motor layer.</v>

436
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.280
<v Speaker 3>In simpler animals you just have sensory</v>
<v Speaker 3>motor cells.</v>

437
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.600
<v Speaker 3>Then they diversify sensory layer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous layer,</v>

438
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.980
<v Speaker 3>motor layer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

439
00:24:43.981 --> 00:24:47.610
<v Speaker 3>that's actually what you consist of when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're first developing in utero.</v>

440
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.940
<v Speaker 3>After the blast site stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when your cells differentiate,</v>

441
00:24:50.941 --> 00:24:52.920
<v Speaker 3>that's the differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sensory layer,</v>

442
00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.780
<v Speaker 3>nervous layer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motor layer,</v>

443
00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.730
<v Speaker 3>so then you think there's a sensory </v>
<v Speaker 3>layer.</v>

444
00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Now what's that sensory layer doing?</v>

445
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Think about the world as consists </v>
<v Speaker 3>consisting of patterns of all sorts,</v>

446
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:10.700
<v Speaker 3>like maybe there's an animal in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean and it's being subjected to wave </v>

447
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.410
<v Speaker 3>motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's sensory systems map the wave</v>

448
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.350
<v Speaker 3>motion onto the motor output.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at a sponge,</v>

449
00:25:16.351 --> 00:25:21.351
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sponges are good examples because </v>

450
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:22.010
<v Speaker 3>they're sort of half unicellular animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>and half multicellular animals.</v>

451
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:27.030
<v Speaker 3>You can take a sponge and run it through</v>
<v Speaker 3>a colander and separate it out into </v>

452
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.900
<v Speaker 3>cells in say in salt water and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>assemble itself back into a sponge.</v>

453
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.710
<v Speaker 3>So it sort of at the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

454
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.500
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

455
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.220
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of what you do in Utero it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the cells somehow know enough to </v>

456
00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.091
<v Speaker 3>communicate with another to one another </v>
<v Speaker 3>to organize themselves into an </v>

457
00:25:44.091 --> 00:25:44.730
<v Speaker 3>organism's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>

458
00:25:44.731 --> 00:25:49.731
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea how people do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when you're in the initial form </v>

459
00:25:49.731 --> 00:25:54.021
<v Speaker 3>blast site for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those cells are identical </v>

460
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:56.181
<v Speaker 3>genetically and then all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>they differentiate and they moved to </v>

461
00:25:56.181 --> 00:25:56.181
<v Speaker 3>other places.</v>

462
00:25:56.181 --> 00:25:57.360
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea how that,</v>

463
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.140
<v Speaker 3>how the hell can that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These cells are all identical except for</v>

464
00:26:01.141 --> 00:26:06.141
<v Speaker 3>their position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're obviously communicating with </v>

465
00:26:06.141 --> 00:26:08.040
<v Speaker 3>one another in some unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated way and saying,</v>

466
00:26:08.041 --> 00:26:08.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

467
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.670
<v Speaker 3>you're this sort of sell it and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to differentiate that way.</v>

468
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.680
<v Speaker 3>God only knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>

469
00:26:13.681 --> 00:26:18.681
<v Speaker 3>sponges can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now a sponge isn't complicated enough to</v>

470
00:26:19.081 --> 00:26:21.810
<v Speaker 3>have the sensory layer and the nervous </v>
<v Speaker 3>layer and the motor layer.</v>

471
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.600
<v Speaker 3>It's just sensory motor cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

472
00:26:24.601 --> 00:26:29.601
<v Speaker 3>but what the sponges trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out what is it wants to get water </v>

473
00:26:29.601 --> 00:26:33.141
<v Speaker 3>through its pores inside because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>how it eats and so there's wave motion </v>

474
00:26:33.141 --> 00:26:37.971
<v Speaker 3>constantly and so what's happening is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wave motion is a pattern and the </v>

475
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.120
<v Speaker 3>sponge is reacting to that in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterned way.</v>

476
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:44.380
<v Speaker 3>That's a really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really useful to think about what </v>

477
00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.080
<v Speaker 3>responding to as patterns instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>objects because we think we react to </v>

478
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.011
<v Speaker 3>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but objects are actually a specific </v>

479
00:26:52.011 --> 00:26:54.561
<v Speaker 3>subcategory of pattern and so because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't also helps to explain </v>

480
00:26:54.561 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 3>perception.</v>

481
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

482
00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean for you to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>

483
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means a bunch of things,</v>

484
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:03.660
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that means is when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at that thing,</v>

485
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 3>it manifests itself to me as a grippable</v>
<v Speaker 3>object.</v>

486
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean that that's built into the way I </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it.</v>

487
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.820
<v Speaker 3>So if you think about the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see that on the surface there,</v>

488
00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:17.970
<v Speaker 3>you can tell that it's separate from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface because it has a bit of a shadow</v>

489
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:23.540
<v Speaker 3>and it's a different color and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously shaped for a hand and so that </v>

490
00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.400
<v Speaker 3>thing tells you when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the grabbable object.</v>

491
00:27:26.401 --> 00:27:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

492
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:31.670
<v Speaker 3>it's hand shaped like a stone tool would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be and so and the things around you in </v>

493
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:37.611
<v Speaker 3>the world manifest themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns of utility that that's the </v>

494
00:27:37.611 --> 00:27:38.160
<v Speaker 3>appropriate way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

495
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:39.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does this thing mean?</v>

496
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Because that's a hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

497
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.910
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that your eyes do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

498
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.080
<v Speaker 3>imagine you've got this representational</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface at the back of your retina,</v>

499
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.210
<v Speaker 3>it's made out of pixels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

500
00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:56.211
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the cells and what it does is </v>

501
00:27:56.211 --> 00:27:59.210
<v Speaker 3>map that pattern onto your retinal </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern and then the retinal pattern </v>

502
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.980
<v Speaker 3>propagates itself as a nervous pattern </v>
<v Speaker 3>loan your optic nerve,</v>

503
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:07.190
<v Speaker 3>and then that manifests itself as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurological pattern and that </v>

504
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:11.121
<v Speaker 3>neurological pattern manifests itself as</v>
<v Speaker 3>an action pattern and so the meaning of </v>

505
00:28:11.121 --> 00:28:14.460
<v Speaker 3>the object is the action pattern that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>mapped onto the,</v>

506
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:19.320
<v Speaker 3>onto the percept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what does this mean?</v>

507
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.500
<v Speaker 3>This is what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think this is a pay as Eddie and </v>

508
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.771
<v Speaker 3>observation is like wonder many one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

509
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:34.580
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm acting like it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I do this then it's many y one,</v>

510
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.720
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right there separately manipulable </v>

511
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.600
<v Speaker 3>entities and so the concept of number is</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact predicated,</v>

512
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:52.971
<v Speaker 3>at least in part on the idea of singular</v>
<v Speaker 3>usability,</v>

513
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:54.390
<v Speaker 3>but you're mapping.</v>

514
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:55.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

515
00:28:55.021 --> 00:28:56.220
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a key.</v>

516
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

517
00:28:57.211 --> 00:29:02.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mapping that shape into this motion </v>

518
00:29:02.211 --> 00:29:02.211
<v Speaker 3>for that action say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

519
00:29:02.211 --> 00:29:03.840
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a key,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weapon.</v>

520
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's because I've mapped it </v>

521
00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.410
<v Speaker 3>onto a different output pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you think about perception as the</v>

522
00:29:10.411 --> 00:29:14.850
<v Speaker 3>matching of patterns onto patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes it makes way more sense.</v>

523
00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:19.851
<v Speaker 3>You can really start thinking about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception works because then you can </v>

524
00:29:19.851 --> 00:29:20.220
<v Speaker 3>also start thinking about unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception.</v>

525
00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:25.221
<v Speaker 3>So you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blind sight experiments show for </v>

526
00:29:25.221 --> 00:29:27.710
<v Speaker 3>example that if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've had critical damage so you,</v>

527
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.870
<v Speaker 3>you think you're blind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't see objects anymore,</v>

528
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 3>but I show you a picture of a frightened</v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

529
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.110
<v Speaker 3>You'll show us in skin conductance </v>
<v Speaker 3>response to it and you think,</v>

530
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the hell can that happen?</v>

531
00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:43.371
<v Speaker 3>It's like I have to see the face in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to infer the emotion in order to </v>

532
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:44.410
<v Speaker 3>have the reaction.</v>

533
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

534
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need that at all.</v>

535
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.840
<v Speaker 3>You need a pattern recognition system </v>
<v Speaker 3>that maps that right onto an amygdala </v>

536
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.150
<v Speaker 3>output that produces physiological </v>
<v Speaker 3>readiness.</v>

537
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 3>You don't need the perceptible entity </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

538
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:03.091
<v Speaker 3>you think you see something and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about the thing and then you </v>

539
00:30:03.091 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 3>evaluate the thing and then you act like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do do that,</v>

540
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but there are parts of you that don't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that at all way faster parts,</v>

541
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:11.140
<v Speaker 3>more primordial parts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so another example would be Darwin's</v>

542
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.060
<v Speaker 3>trick with the snake that I told you </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

543
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:18.061
<v Speaker 3>He'd go to this museum that had a cobra </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a glass cage and the Cobra,</v>

544
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:23.221
<v Speaker 3>he'd put his face up to the glass cage </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Cobra would strike out him and </v>

545
00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:26.341
<v Speaker 3>he'd go like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was no way he could control </v>

546
00:30:26.341 --> 00:30:26.341
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

547
00:30:26.341 --> 00:30:29.731
<v Speaker 3>it's because the part of him that saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>the snake wasn't the part that was doing</v>

548
00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

549
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a part of him that does this to </v>
<v Speaker 3>snakes.</v>

550
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what it does and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way faster than the per figure,</v>

551
00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 3>the to see the snake you have to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>images.</v>

552
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:46.201
<v Speaker 3>Obviously the image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pattern is portrayed on the retina </v>

553
00:30:46.201 --> 00:30:50.730
<v Speaker 3>propagates backwards to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be elaborated up through a </v>

554
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.630
<v Speaker 3>very complex set of neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>connections that takes time,</v>

555
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.030
<v Speaker 3>and so your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

556
00:30:55.031 --> 00:31:00.031
<v Speaker 3>the thing that snake means this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like three neurons superfast,</v>

557
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.560
<v Speaker 3>and so what is a snake at that level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation?</v>

558
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:10.561
<v Speaker 3>It's like a snake is that which makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do this and then you could also say </v>

559
00:31:10.561 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 3>that at that level of representation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that makes you do this is the</v>

560
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:15.520
<v Speaker 3>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

561
00:31:15.521 --> 00:31:20.521
<v Speaker 3>Because the same would be defined by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern that you manifest in response to</v>

562
00:31:20.801 --> 00:31:25.801
<v Speaker 3>that entity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then your nervous system is layered </v>

563
00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:25.801
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

564
00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:29.410
<v Speaker 3>That's sensory layer neurological layer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motor layer.</v>

565
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:35.220
<v Speaker 3>As you become more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sensory layer differentiates into </v>

566
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.251
<v Speaker 3>the different sensory systems and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurological level multiplies in terms </v>

567
00:31:39.071 --> 00:31:44.071
<v Speaker 3>of its potential number of connections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is that you can map </v>

568
00:31:44.071 --> 00:31:46.570
<v Speaker 3>patterns that manifest themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple different ways,</v>

569
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:50.320
<v Speaker 3>in multiple different ways to multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>motor outputs.</v>

570
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.360
<v Speaker 3>So you start with a fixed action </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern,</v>

571
00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:53.460
<v Speaker 3>which is just like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

572
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:58.820
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sponge reflects what's the world to </v>

573
00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.700
<v Speaker 3>a sponge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world is what makes you go like this</v>

574
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 3>or like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

575
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sponge has compressed the entire </v>

576
00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:07.960
<v Speaker 3>world into pores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open pores closed.</v>

577
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.970
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it to states,</v>

578
00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:15.660
<v Speaker 3>and then once the nervous system gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiated and the senses get </v>

579
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.340
<v Speaker 3>differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's specialized kinds of cells,</v>

580
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.690
<v Speaker 3>then you can detect more forms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns.</v>

581
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.920
<v Speaker 3>You can produce more patterned output to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

582
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:32.130
<v Speaker 3>but even more interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where the nervous system </v>

583
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.360
<v Speaker 3>starts to come into play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the mapping of the pattern onto the</v>

584
00:32:34.361 --> 00:32:39.361
<v Speaker 3>output is no longer one to one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can use the same pattern roughly </v>

585
00:32:39.361 --> 00:32:42.661
<v Speaker 3>speaking to British,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts different outputs that are </v>

586
00:32:42.661 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 3>context dependent because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

587
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.640
<v Speaker 3>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I picked that up and you say,</v>

588
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he picked that up.</v>

589
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:51.230
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

590
00:32:51.231 --> 00:32:54.660
<v Speaker 3>what about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

591
00:32:54.661 --> 00:32:55.530
<v Speaker 3>why you picked it up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

592
00:32:55.531 --> 00:32:56.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

593
00:32:56.131 --> 00:33:01.131
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except that the pattern of musculature </v>

594
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:04.581
<v Speaker 3>that I used to do this is by no means </v>
<v Speaker 3>identical to the pattern of musculature </v>

595
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:06.000
<v Speaker 3>that I used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

596
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean the fact that the orientation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>different is actually extraordinarily </v>

597
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

598
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.500
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

599
00:33:13.501 --> 00:33:18.501
<v Speaker 3>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that were sufficient nervous </v>

600
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:21.390
<v Speaker 3>complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can take the same thing,</v>

601
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:26.510
<v Speaker 3>so to speak and map that all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different ways and human beings are </v>

602
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:27.570
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

603
00:33:27.571 --> 00:33:30.540
<v Speaker 3>so now go back to when things were </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple,</v>

604
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.580
<v Speaker 3>so there's single celled organisms will </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

605
00:33:34.581 --> 00:33:39.581
<v Speaker 3>and then they start to differentiate to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some degree and they start to propagate </v>

606
00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:43.300
<v Speaker 3>and so then there's the environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts to shift because the fact of the </v>

607
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.740
<v Speaker 3>prevalence of all of these competitors </v>
<v Speaker 3>means the environment isn't exactly the </v>

608
00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.490
<v Speaker 3>same as it was when that system first </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved.</v>

609
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.600
<v Speaker 3>New problems emerge and so then there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>selection pressure on those creatures to</v>

610
00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:58.601
<v Speaker 3>diversify to some degree and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversification produces a </v>

611
00:33:58.601 --> 00:34:02.051
<v Speaker 3>transformation in the environment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's pressure on those new </v>

612
00:34:02.051 --> 00:34:05.860
<v Speaker 3>entities to diversify some more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you get this weird bootstrapping </v>

613
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.641
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the environment is one thing when </v>

614
00:34:09.641 --> 00:34:12.851
<v Speaker 3>there's 10 of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a completely different thing when </v>

615
00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:12.851
<v Speaker 3>there's a thousand of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

616
00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:17.021
<v Speaker 3>So just sheer multiplication is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>transform the environment and so then </v>

617
00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:21.280
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the environment has now become </v>

618
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.861
<v Speaker 3>more complex than it was their selection</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure to produce diversification in </v>

619
00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:24.500
<v Speaker 3>the underlying organisms.</v>

620
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Speaker 3>And that took a long time to get off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

621
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:31.160
<v Speaker 3>Like there were a single celled </v>
<v Speaker 3>organisms for a huge span of history.</v>

622
00:34:31.161 --> 00:34:33.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look at evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

623
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:38.950
<v Speaker 3>the amount of time that there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>single celled organisms is far longer </v>

624
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:40.970
<v Speaker 3>than the time that there's been since </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were multi celled organisms.</v>

625
00:34:40.971 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Moore's law,</v>

626
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law that governs the,</v>

627
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.520
<v Speaker 3>the increase in computational power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can trace that back to about the </v>

628
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 3>year 1400,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

629
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:56.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's been going on for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and maybe you could make the same </v>

630
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.621
<v Speaker 3>case from an evolutionary perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the flat part of the curve is </v>

631
00:34:59.621 --> 00:35:00.650
<v Speaker 3>really long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once it starts to move up,</v>

632
00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:05.651
<v Speaker 3>it starts to move up really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And obviously that's the position that </v>

633
00:35:05.651 --> 00:35:09.101
<v Speaker 3>we're in now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So single celled organisms for a long </v>

634
00:35:09.101 --> 00:35:09.101
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

635
00:35:09.101 --> 00:35:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Then they started to diversify and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could imagine,</v>

636
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the single cell organism,</v>

637
00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:18.380
<v Speaker 3>you start getting multicellular organism</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it ends up with this tripartite</v>

638
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:20.210
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensory layer,</v>

639
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.370
<v Speaker 3>nervous layer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motor layer.</v>

640
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.050
<v Speaker 3>And then that starts to differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every time there's a differentiation</v>

641
00:35:27.051 --> 00:35:30.500
<v Speaker 3>that's conserved and that's these </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>

642
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.890
<v Speaker 3>the motivational systems he emerged a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

643
00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 3>long time ago as emergent solutions to </v>
<v Speaker 3>emergent problems.</v>

644
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:43.370
<v Speaker 3>And you've conserved all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've conserved your snake </v>

645
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 3>reflux,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like three neurons long,</v>

646
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 3>so that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really primordial,</v>

647
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:52.610
<v Speaker 3>but you've conserved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've conserved function at almost </v>

648
00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.581
<v Speaker 3>every temporal level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's parts of you that are quick </v>

649
00:35:55.581 --> 00:35:59.451
<v Speaker 3>and dirty and parts of you that are slow</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sophisticated and a lot of the </v>

650
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:02.460
<v Speaker 3>contents of consciousness is slow and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated,</v>

651
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.620
<v Speaker 3>so it can't help you out in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>emergency,</v>

652
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.760
<v Speaker 3>but it can do or consciousness seems to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is take your structure,</v>

653
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.810
<v Speaker 3>it analyzes the world's for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for let's say,</v>

654
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.690
<v Speaker 3>mismatches between what you want and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening.</v>

655
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.540
<v Speaker 3>And then it either helps you all to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

656
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:23.541
<v Speaker 3>So those mismatches go away or it turns </v>
<v Speaker 3>inward and modifies the structures that </v>

657
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:27.030
<v Speaker 3>you're using.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're playing the piano,</v>

658
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.230
<v Speaker 3>you've got this automatized routine has </v>
<v Speaker 3>very little to do with consciousness.</v>

659
00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:33.390
<v Speaker 3>If you've practiced enough and you make </v>
<v Speaker 3>a mistake,</v>

660
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 3>you stop and you note the mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new stop,</v>

661
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.520
<v Speaker 3>and then you slow it down and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>read,</v>

662
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 3>you practice the new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you speed it up.</v>

663
00:36:45.091 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Then you speed it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speed it up,</v>

664
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:51.890
<v Speaker 3>and as you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neural representation shrinks until </v>

665
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:55.101
<v Speaker 3>you've developed this little specialized</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine and then you run that a few </v>

666
00:36:55.101 --> 00:36:58.611
<v Speaker 3>times and now you can ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can look at the notes and just play </v>

667
00:36:58.611 --> 00:36:59.550
<v Speaker 3>and away you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's kind of what consciousness is</v>

668
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:04.551
<v Speaker 3>doing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're laying out an automatized </v>

669
00:37:04.551 --> 00:37:07.461
<v Speaker 3>routine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then if that doesn't produce the </v>

670
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.110
<v Speaker 3>intended outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stop.</v>

671
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:15.170
<v Speaker 3>You become conscious really because </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing like an error to make you </v>

672
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.411
<v Speaker 3>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you do a high resolution analysis </v>

673
00:37:18.411 --> 00:37:22.311
<v Speaker 3>of the space in which the error emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You rematch your motor output,</v>

674
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 3>your perceptions and all of that to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>that error go away and away you go,</v>

675
00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.740
<v Speaker 3>and so your consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually.</v>

676
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Your consciousness seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually building your unconscious,</v>

677
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:38.330
<v Speaker 3>your procedural unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so to some degree the purpose of </v>

678
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is to make you functional </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconsciously,</v>

679
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's way better.</v>

680
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.180
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be conscious of most </v>
<v Speaker 3>things because it's just,</v>

681
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:50.330
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Conscious of your digestive </v>

682
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:50.330
<v Speaker 3>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

683
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:51.300
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're good at something,</v>

684
00:37:51.301 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 3>you hardly have to be conscious of it at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

685
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:58.250
<v Speaker 3>So consciousness is something like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>error detection and rectification </v>

686
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

687
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.480
<v Speaker 3>and so you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

688
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:03.870
<v Speaker 3>you can practice being conscious because</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that means in some sense,</v>

689
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.520
<v Speaker 3>you're always attending to your errors.</v>

690
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Not seems to be a really intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to do if you don't take it too far</v>

691
00:38:09.781 --> 00:38:13.440
<v Speaker 3>and collapse yourself because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>always attending to your errors,</v>

692
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.190
<v Speaker 3>you're always improving your automated </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptability,</v>

693
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.760
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

694
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Pay Attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if things are working out the way </v>

695
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.810
<v Speaker 3>that you want them to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if they're not,</v>

696
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:25.530
<v Speaker 3>modify your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

697
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.300
<v Speaker 3>your approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your perceptions.</v>

698
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have conserved these systems and </v>

699
00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:36.050
<v Speaker 3>the systems emerged to to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems of the emergent complexity and </v>

700
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:40.621
<v Speaker 3>you end up at birth with all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>conserved systems and so those would be </v>

701
00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:44.401
<v Speaker 3>proclivities that would enable you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest necessary realm of behaviors in</v>

702
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:50.020
<v Speaker 3>the social natural human environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

703
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:52.520
<v Speaker 3>So you're basically prepared for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

704
00:38:52.521 --> 00:38:57.521
<v Speaker 3>I told I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went through what those were last </v>

705
00:38:57.521 --> 00:38:59.521
<v Speaker 3>time and you can break them down into </v>
<v Speaker 3>self maintenance motivations and self </v>

706
00:38:59.621 --> 00:39:01.660
<v Speaker 3>propagation motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

707
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.670
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

708
00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:08.671
<v Speaker 3>now the question is how did those </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest themselves and that's where we </v>

709
00:39:08.671 --> 00:39:10.840
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where we can make a shift,</v>

710
00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:15.841
<v Speaker 3>say from evolutionary ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological ideas to narrative ideas.</v>

711
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:21.930
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made the case for you that you exist </v>

712
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:22.060
<v Speaker 3>within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within this thing,</v>

713
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:27.061
<v Speaker 3>I've never figured out exactly what to </v>
<v Speaker 3>call it because you can call it a game </v>

714
00:39:27.061 --> 00:39:27.880
<v Speaker 3>or you can call it a frame of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty good one.</v>

715
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Or you can call it a story or you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>call it a unit of perception,</v>

716
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 3>but that's not exactly right because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more than perception.</v>

717
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.680
<v Speaker 3>It's really this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really what it is is a micro </v>

718
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:40.690
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

719
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:45.691
<v Speaker 3>it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your personality as it manifests </v>

720
00:39:45.691 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 3>itself at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the highest possible resolution.</v>

721
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 3>That's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if I'm,</v>

722
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 3>let's say I set myself the task of </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving those keys from there to here.</v>

723
00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:01.650
<v Speaker 3>So my perceptual frame is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this thing I think,</v>

724
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:03.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the world?</v>

725
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Everything else can be ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to make an object out of my hand.</v>

726
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.590
<v Speaker 3>These keys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tiny spot on the table and,</v>

727
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:20.670
<v Speaker 3>and my goal is to transform this pattern</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that pattern and it's a pattern </v>

728
00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:26.620
<v Speaker 3>because it maintains itself across time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

729
00:40:26.621 --> 00:40:29.560
<v Speaker 3>It's not like smoke or cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It persists.</v>

730
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:31.450
<v Speaker 3>So there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is,</v>

731
00:40:31.451 --> 00:40:32.590
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

732
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.870
<v Speaker 3>That's a pattern that's extending across</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

733
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:39.190
<v Speaker 3>So I have this goal which is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation of this,</v>

734
00:40:39.191 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 3>into that and that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would be roughly speaking,</v>

735
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:47.791
<v Speaker 3>the goal is point b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't just think about this as </v>

736
00:40:47.791 --> 00:40:48.730
<v Speaker 3>something that's a goal because it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a goal.</v>

737
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:55.020
<v Speaker 3>There's a goal which is the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the end state of this entire </v>

738
00:40:56.431 --> 00:40:58.290
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The End State is,</v>

739
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I've moved the thing from here to here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've transformed this into this and I've</v>

740
00:41:04.971 --> 00:41:08.830
<v Speaker 3>done it using action and that's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a useful thing to know too.</v>

741
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:14.630
<v Speaker 3>I have an abstract notion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my decision that I'm going to get</v>

742
00:41:17.001 --> 00:41:19.760
<v Speaker 3>the world to manifest this pattern </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of this one.</v>

743
00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that gives me my target.</v>

744
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:29.390
<v Speaker 3>That's an abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I actually do the </v>

745
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:33.561
<v Speaker 3>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not an abstraction because now </v>

746
00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm using actual action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual behavior,</v>

747
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.850
<v Speaker 3>and so I take this abstract micro </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

748
00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 3>This is the part that's operating on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this tiny little section of the world.</v>

749
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I make the transformation and as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do that and other thing happens,</v>

750
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:47.690
<v Speaker 3>which is I don't need that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

751
00:41:47.691 --> 00:41:50.390
<v Speaker 3>I moved to the next one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it happens to be,</v>

752
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:55.660
<v Speaker 3>and so one of the things we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to figure out is what is the </v>

753
00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.290
<v Speaker 3>relationship between these things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're always in one of them and</v>

754
00:41:57.291 --> 00:42:02.291
<v Speaker 3>they're scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you're doing a specific </v>

755
00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:05.201
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really high resolution and that's </v>

756
00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 3>kind of where you want to be operating </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you know what you're doing,</v>

757
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:08.930
<v Speaker 3>that's where you want to be operating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

758
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.920
<v Speaker 3>when you're trying to do something new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's scalable and so that's the </v>

759
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:19.781
<v Speaker 3>framework which is constructed in part </v>
<v Speaker 3>from these motivational systems that </v>

760
00:42:19.781 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 3>emerged over evolutionary history.</v>

761
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 3>The framework specifies the current </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition,</v>

762
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:29.500
<v Speaker 3>the desired condition and and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavioral manifestations that are </v>

763
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.670
<v Speaker 3>necessary to make the transformation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can't think about it as a drive </v>

764
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:36.800
<v Speaker 3>because it's instincts are often thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>about is drives or as a goal.</v>

765
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:42.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not correct because the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually determines your perceptions.</v>

766
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:47.950
<v Speaker 3>It determines what objects manifest </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves to you in the world or what </v>

767
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:51.581
<v Speaker 3>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about it </v>

768
00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:51.581
<v Speaker 3>because like when I'm looking at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

769
00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:54.050
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to watch your own perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I'm looking at this,</v>

770
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see that chair,</v>

771
00:42:57.111 --> 00:43:02.111
<v Speaker 3>but if I didn't know it was a chair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be able to tell by looking </v>

772
00:43:02.111 --> 00:43:02.111
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by my visual input.</v>

773
00:43:02.111 --> 00:43:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I can kind of see this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I really can't tell what color </v>

774
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:09.650
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one slightly clearer.</v>

775
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.830
<v Speaker 3>This is pretty blurry here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I can't see my fingers.</v>

776
00:43:12.831 --> 00:43:17.831
<v Speaker 3>If I'm looking at the keys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't see my fingers unless they move </v>

777
00:43:17.831 --> 00:43:19.280
<v Speaker 3>and I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very focused on that.</v>

778
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:24.281
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is that all the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world turns into a low resolution </v>

779
00:43:24.281 --> 00:43:25.850
<v Speaker 3>representations that vanishes on its </v>
<v Speaker 3>periphery.</v>

780
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.480
<v Speaker 3>The resolution increases as as I moved </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the central part of my visual </v>

781
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.771
<v Speaker 3>field and here it's sharp enough so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can actually see the letters on that </v>

782
00:43:35.771 --> 00:43:35.771
<v Speaker 3>key.</v>

783
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.720
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my desire,</v>

784
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 3>which I am indicating by the point of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>

785
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:45.530
<v Speaker 3>is specifying the objects that I see and</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifying their level of resolution.</v>

786
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.500
<v Speaker 3>So you can't just call that a drive or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>goal.</v>

787
00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:49.000
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

788
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.360
<v Speaker 3>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

789
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.140
<v Speaker 3>it's the mechanism that makes the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest itself to you.</v>

790
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.740
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's unbelievably crazy thing is that </v>

791
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 3>the world manifests itself to you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping with your goals.</v>

792
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean that you can make the </v>

793
00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:06.530
<v Speaker 3>world do any old thing because it pushes</v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

794
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:08.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It objects to you so,</v>

795
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:11.580
<v Speaker 3>but still it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very strange thing that,</v>

796
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.680
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fine.</v>

797
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:18.770
<v Speaker 3>So it specifies your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your target,</v>

798
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:23.980
<v Speaker 3>the current reality and the likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>procedure that you're going to use to </v>

799
00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.150
<v Speaker 3>make all of that interrelated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does more than that.</v>

800
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:28.180
<v Speaker 3>So let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna we're gonna.</v>

801
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Look at it from a couple of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspectives.</v>

802
00:44:29.921 --> 00:44:31.280
<v Speaker 3>So the classic</v>

803
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:39.260
<v Speaker 3>and archaic way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception is the world's full of </v>

804
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:39.260
<v Speaker 3>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the objects,</v>

805
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:39.810
<v Speaker 3>you think about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you evaluate them,</v>

806
00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:40.980
<v Speaker 3>then you act on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

807
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't how it works.</v>

808
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:44.250
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is not made out of objects.</v>

809
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:49.730
<v Speaker 3>The world is made out of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the world is made out of tools </v>

810
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:52.791
<v Speaker 3>and obstacles and it's because you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>not perceive the world in relationship </v>

811
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:56.100
<v Speaker 3>to you and what you perceive actually or</v>
<v Speaker 3>the meaning of objects.</v>

812
00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:01.530
<v Speaker 3>You precede the patterns and the tool is</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like a meaningful pattern or </v>

813
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:06.890
<v Speaker 3>useful pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that and so lucky </v>

814
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.890
<v Speaker 3>look again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at,</v>

815
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:11.070
<v Speaker 3>I might say to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>describe this room.</v>

816
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Now you're going to pick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to pick a level of </v>

817
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.631
<v Speaker 3>description that's very particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to pick one that other </v>

818
00:45:20.631 --> 00:45:24.261
<v Speaker 3>human beings could understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's going to be predicated on on </v>

819
00:45:24.261 --> 00:45:24.261
<v Speaker 3>your size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

820
00:45:24.261 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 3>and so you're going to be predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your knowledge that that other person is</v>

821
00:45:26.881 --> 00:45:31.881
<v Speaker 3>a lot like you and it has a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same underlying structures and </v>

822
00:45:31.881 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 3>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

823
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.500
<v Speaker 3>and that's an implicit predicate of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>description.</v>

824
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

825
00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:40.671
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of an ordinary classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got 20 rows of tables that each </v>

826
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:45.060
<v Speaker 3>have five chairs at it and each of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>does have five chairs.</v>

827
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:48.960
<v Speaker 3>There's some posts that hold them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of speakers,</v>

828
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a podium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a screen,</v>

829
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:54.240
<v Speaker 3>there's some additional chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a scattering of people,</v>

830
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:57.840
<v Speaker 3>there's some electronic equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you know,</v>

831
00:45:57.841 --> 00:46:02.841
<v Speaker 3>of course that there's an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of things I could be describing </v>

832
00:46:02.841 --> 00:46:02.841
<v Speaker 3>in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

833
00:46:02.841 --> 00:46:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I could be describing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of color variation in that</v>

834
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.470
<v Speaker 3>tile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I look at it,</v>

835
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:12.471
<v Speaker 3>I can see that it's unlike the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>tiles because the light is reflecting </v>

836
00:46:12.471 --> 00:46:14.010
<v Speaker 3>off it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's got a shiny white element.</v>

837
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:19.220
<v Speaker 3>There's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God only knows a million different </v>

838
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:19.470
<v Speaker 3>scratches in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each which are unique.</v>

839
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.890
<v Speaker 3>I can't even really tell what color it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

840
00:46:21.891 --> 00:46:24.450
<v Speaker 3>It kind of looks like an off grayish </v>
<v Speaker 3>green.</v>

841
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.590
<v Speaker 3>But if I was painting it to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable representation,</v>

842
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:33.591
<v Speaker 3>I'd had to have to have at least six or </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven shades of green ranging from quite</v>

843
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:40.281
<v Speaker 3>dark to almost white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's only if I look at it from </v>

844
00:46:40.281 --> 00:46:40.920
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I look at it from here,</v>

845
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:46.520
<v Speaker 3>well then you get the point right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there is an infinite number of </v>

846
00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.661
<v Speaker 3>details in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an infinite number of facts in </v>

847
00:46:50.661 --> 00:46:51.570
<v Speaker 3>this room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also why I don't believe that you</v>

848
00:46:51.571 --> 00:46:54.610
<v Speaker 3>can derive an ought from an is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like w,</v>

849
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the old human issue,</v>

850
00:46:56.521 --> 00:47:01.521
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot derive ethical guidelines </v>

851
00:47:01.521 --> 00:47:03.950
<v Speaker 3>from factual knowledge and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason for that is which facts are you </v>

852
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:04.390
<v Speaker 3>going to pick?</v>

853
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:07.720
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to select them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

854
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.510
<v Speaker 3>there's an infinite number of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in a constrained situation.</v>

855
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.760
<v Speaker 3>So merely by attending to some and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>attending to others,</v>

856
00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:21.850
<v Speaker 3>you're already using an ethic because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't attend to one thing and not </v>

857
00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:27.131
<v Speaker 3>another without being ensconced in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these value structures because the </v>

858
00:47:27.131 --> 00:47:28.820
<v Speaker 3>value structure is what determines the </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction of your attention.</v>

859
00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.920
<v Speaker 3>And so you can't make the argument that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're using the,</v>

860
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:38.080
<v Speaker 3>the infinite number of facts that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>available at your disposal to govern how</v>

861
00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:40.990
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at the facts you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That isn't what you're doing.</v>

862
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not possible to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do?</v>

863
00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you described the things in the room </v>

864
00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:52.261
<v Speaker 3>that would be relevant to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you're going to bore them to </v>

865
00:47:52.261 --> 00:47:52.540
<v Speaker 3>death or they're gonna think you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane,</v>

866
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:53.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

867
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Or an artist maybe because an artist </v>
<v Speaker 3>might do the kind of concentration on a </v>

868
00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.701
<v Speaker 3>detail that I just described,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's obviously or she's obviously </v>

869
00:48:02.701 --> 00:48:03.310
<v Speaker 3>trying to paint the thing or represented</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow.</v>

870
00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's still too of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

871
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 3>why do you want to know that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>tables?</v>

872
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you said at the why do you want </v>

873
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:12.660
<v Speaker 3>to know if there are chairs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you sit in them.</v>

874
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about the screen or the camera </v>

875
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:16.930
<v Speaker 3>equipment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

876
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 3>they're all usable tools and so that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you describe.</v>

877
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:22.600
<v Speaker 3>You described the world at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>usable tool or you might also say,</v>

878
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

879
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 3>look out for that girl who's third in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the third row.</v>

880
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:31.981
<v Speaker 3>She's trouble and so you might call out </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone if you're describing the room </v>

881
00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 3>because there is somewhere in that room </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you go,</v>

882
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:38.980
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get into trouble and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so.</v>

883
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Those are sort of the things that seemed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me to be relevant.</v>

884
00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:43.960
<v Speaker 3>There are too old to move you along your</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

885
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Facilitators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another way of thinking about </v>

886
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.131
<v Speaker 3>that and there are obstacles that get in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your way and there's a tiny set of </v>

887
00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>

888
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you get overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to go anywhere where </v>

889
00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:56.850
<v Speaker 3>it's all obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

890
00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:59.260
<v Speaker 3>You don't even mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be in that place.</v>

891
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:04.320
<v Speaker 3>You want to be at a place where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly this and then then there's the </v>

892
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.950
<v Speaker 3>biggest category though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's cool,</v>

893
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.900
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is so important,</v>

894
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:13.590
<v Speaker 3>is the biggest perceptual category is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that which is not relevant at this time </v>

895
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.780
<v Speaker 3>because it contains everything you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you're.</v>

896
00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 3>When you're writing on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this pad,</v>

897
00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you assume the entire world around you </v>
<v Speaker 3>is constant and therefore you can ignore</v>

898
00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:26.680
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's everything out there.</v>

899
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:29.050
<v Speaker 3>All the transformations that are taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

900
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:34.260
<v Speaker 3>You turn to zero and you just focus on </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the space that's occupied by a </v>

901
00:49:35.051 --> 00:49:40.051
<v Speaker 3>single letter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your whole world shrinks down to just </v>

902
00:49:40.051 --> 00:49:40.390
<v Speaker 3>that single letter and everything else </v>
<v Speaker 3>is ignored.</v>

903
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens if something goes wrong?</v>

904
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why this is his own port.</v>

905
00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:50.490
<v Speaker 3>What happens if something goes wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>An indeterminate set of those irrelevant</v>

906
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:56.250
<v Speaker 3>entities has now become relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem is the invisibility </v>

907
00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:01.860
<v Speaker 3>disappears and so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all treating each other in this </v>

908
00:50:02.261 --> 00:50:05.020
<v Speaker 3>room right now as ignorable entities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking,</v>

909
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.080
<v Speaker 3>you could all be blogs from a perceptual</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

910
00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:13.081
<v Speaker 3>and if you look at how you see the room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except for the person that you're </v>

911
00:50:13.081 --> 00:50:16.921
<v Speaker 3>focusing on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone else's a blob and some of them </v>

912
00:50:16.921 --> 00:50:17.770
<v Speaker 3>are virtually invisible blocks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine because they're.</v>

913
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.680
<v Speaker 3>You're adequately represented as a blob </v>
<v Speaker 3>of less.</v>

914
00:50:20.681 --> 00:50:24.940
<v Speaker 3>You do something that disturbs the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ongoing flow of goal directed action.</v>

915
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Just like the gorilla thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

916
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

917
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 4>the damn gorilla was invisible because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't get in the way.</v>

918
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.530
<v Speaker 4>Even though you'd think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course you'd see a gorilla.</v>

919
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything that doesn't get in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way is invisible except for that </v>

920
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.791
<v Speaker 4>small fraction of things that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>use for your purpose and that's how you </v>

921
00:50:42.791 --> 00:50:46.340
<v Speaker 4>perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's so mind boggling that because it</v>

922
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:48.950
<v Speaker 4>puts perception into the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethics,</v>

923
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:54.640
<v Speaker 4>it isn't what you'd expect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see what you're aiming at and you </v>

924
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:58.421
<v Speaker 4>know that you know that you're standing </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a street corner and you look up and </v>

925
00:50:58.421 --> 00:51:02.981
<v Speaker 4>soon there's 10 advanced chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you right beside you looking up to </v>

926
00:51:03.081 --> 00:51:08.081
<v Speaker 4>see what the hell it is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>aiming at because they assume just by </v>

927
00:51:08.081 --> 00:51:11.531
<v Speaker 4>watching you that if you're focusing </v>
<v Speaker 4>your perception on something and you're </v>

928
00:51:11.531 --> 00:51:13.310
<v Speaker 4>fixated on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's relevant and important.</v>

929
00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:18.311
<v Speaker 4>It's tool like or maybe obstacle like </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's relevant for some reason and so we </v>

930
00:51:18.741 --> 00:51:21.940
<v Speaker 4>live in a landscape of relevance and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a mind.</v>

931
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:27.010
<v Speaker 4>To me that's an absolutely mind boggling</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea because that is way different than </v>

932
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:30.611
<v Speaker 4>living in a landscape of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is not the same thing even a little </v>

933
00:51:30.611 --> 00:51:34.811
<v Speaker 4>bit and there are philosophers who've </v>
<v Speaker 4>pursued that idea quite well.</v>

934
00:51:35.511 --> 00:51:38.230
<v Speaker 4>I would say to quite an incredible </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>

935
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.060
<v Speaker 4>High degree is probably the one who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>done that more than anyone else,</v>

936
00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.810
<v Speaker 4>but the the 19th century pragmatist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're very interested in that as well,</v>

937
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 4>but the because you think hold the </v>
<v Speaker 4>classic scientific ideas,</v>

938
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:53.120
<v Speaker 4>something like you perceive the universe</v>
<v Speaker 4>of facts and derive conclusions and act.</v>

939
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.690
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

940
00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:58.691
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You perceive a landscape of pre </v>

941
00:51:58.691 --> 00:52:00.620
<v Speaker 4>categorized relevance that's dependent </v>
<v Speaker 4>on your ethic.</v>

942
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so peculiar that and so that brings</v>

943
00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:09.230
<v Speaker 4>up real questions like what ethic best </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures,</v>

944
00:52:09.231 --> 00:52:12.890
<v Speaker 4>your perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that is an interest.</v>

945
00:52:12.891 --> 00:52:15.590
<v Speaker 4>That is the interesting ideas as far as </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned.</v>

946
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:16.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

947
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:21.730
<v Speaker 4>So then we can make this a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>more interesting I think is the right </v>

948
00:52:22.551 --> 00:52:23.810
<v Speaker 4>way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

949
00:52:23.811 --> 00:52:28.811
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you've got tools and obstacles but </v>

950
00:52:28.811 --> 00:52:30.611
<v Speaker 4>they're not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing because we're in </v>

951
00:52:30.611 --> 00:52:30.611
<v Speaker 4>an ethical landscape because we're in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivated landscape.</v>

952
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:35.980
<v Speaker 4>Whether something is a tool or an </v>
<v Speaker 4>obstacle actually matters to you and we </v>

953
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.271
<v Speaker 4>could actually define matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matter is a weird word because there </v>

954
00:52:40.271 --> 00:52:44.171
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's matter and then there's the </v>

955
00:52:44.171 --> 00:52:46.100
<v Speaker 4>things that matter and you could say the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world is made out of matter or you could</v>

956
00:52:46.101 --> 00:52:51.101
<v Speaker 4>say that the world is made out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that matter and I would say you </v>

957
00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:52.880
<v Speaker 4>act like the world is made out of things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that matter.</v>

958
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.650
<v Speaker 4>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that.</v>

959
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:59.651
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's made out of matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no you don't because that's not how </v>

960
00:52:59.651 --> 00:52:59.651
<v Speaker 4>you act.</v>

961
00:52:59.651 --> 00:53:02.360
<v Speaker 4>It might be what you say you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is not what you do.</v>

962
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:04.910
<v Speaker 4>So why did things matter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

963
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:08.030
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>irrelevant things don't matter and thank</v>

964
00:53:08.031 --> 00:53:09.350
<v Speaker 4>God for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

965
00:53:09.351 --> 00:53:14.351
<v Speaker 4>Because if everything mattered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's while you're either you're either </v>

966
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:19.390
<v Speaker 4>in the midst of an Lsd trip or you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenic or you're in real serious </v>

967
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:25.631
<v Speaker 4>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you want most things to be </v>

968
00:53:25.631 --> 00:53:28.361
<v Speaker 4>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that's kind of dull and takes the </v>

969
00:53:28.361 --> 00:53:29.400
<v Speaker 4>glory and the glamor out of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but from a cognitive perspective,</v>

970
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So irrelevancy,</v>

971
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:38.480
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's critical and a huge amount of </v>

972
00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.630
<v Speaker 4>what you have done is learned </v>
<v Speaker 4>irrelevance.</v>

973
00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:44.280
<v Speaker 4>It's the basis of your cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge is learned irrelevance.</v>

974
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:45.390
<v Speaker 4>What to ignore.</v>

975
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

976
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:51.690
<v Speaker 4>So that's that Zeros things out to turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the world into zero.</v>

977
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Well then you have this small subset of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are beneficial to you that </v>

978
00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.820
<v Speaker 4>you can use for the purposes of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>current operation,</v>

979
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
<v Speaker 4>which we'll define in more detail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can use that for the purposes of </v>

980
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 4>your current job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your current endeavor,</v>

981
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.140
<v Speaker 4>and then you have obstacles and so for </v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

982
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.220
<v Speaker 4>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm late for class,</v>

983
00:54:14.221 --> 00:54:19.221
<v Speaker 4>so I'm in a particular state of mind and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I walk in here and I see that I'm going </v>

984
00:54:19.221 --> 00:54:20.880
<v Speaker 4>to get a little burst of negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion,</v>

985
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:26.300
<v Speaker 4>it's irritation and the reason for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that is not a recycling bin.</v>

986
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:32.750
<v Speaker 4>Then it's an obstacle that some dimwit </v>
<v Speaker 4>left there just to annoy me and I mean,</v>

987
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:39.030
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you react to the world in a </v>

988
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.660
<v Speaker 4>situation like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's not a recycling bin.</v>

989
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:45.290
<v Speaker 4>If it's here and I don't want to stand </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

990
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:48.570
<v Speaker 4>then it's a recycling bin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's there,</v>

991
00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:51.400
<v Speaker 4>it's an obstacle and as soon as I look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at it,</v>

992
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:53.880
<v Speaker 4>it isn't that I see it and then get </v>
<v Speaker 4>annoyed.</v>

993
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:59.510
<v Speaker 4>It's that annoyance is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perception because it's an obstacle in </v>

994
00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:03.711
<v Speaker 4>my pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the emotion comes along with the </v>

995
00:55:03.711 --> 00:55:04.200
<v Speaker 4>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not laid on top of it.</v>

996
00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:05.220
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

997
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:06.240
<v Speaker 4>that's A.</v>

998
00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:12.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's a recycling bin </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in the wrong place.</v>

999
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:13.490
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in my way.</v>

1000
00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:18.580
<v Speaker 4>I should be annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That isn't what happens is the </v>

1001
00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:19.040
<v Speaker 4>annoyance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My suspicions are that the dam annoyance</v>

1002
00:55:19.041 --> 00:55:24.041
<v Speaker 4>is faster than the object perception </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's a more primordial circuit,</v>

1003
00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.930
<v Speaker 4>so you actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's now.</v>

1004
00:55:26.931 --> 00:55:29.090
<v Speaker 4>There's a great book if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in this sort of thing.</v>

1005
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:34.390
<v Speaker 4>There's a great book called an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ecological approach to visual </v>

1006
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:38.741
<v Speaker 4>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was written by a guy named Gibson </v>

1007
00:55:38.741 --> 00:55:38.741
<v Speaker 4>back in the seventies and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant.</v>

1008
00:55:38.741 --> 00:55:40.880
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his fundamental conclusion is,</v>

1009
00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:46.060
<v Speaker 4>I think wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't matter that the book is </v>

1010
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.721
<v Speaker 4>not only brilliant because see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was the guy that came up with the </v>

1011
00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:52.961
<v Speaker 4>idea of affordance and an affordance is </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that affords some utility in </v>

1012
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.470
<v Speaker 4>that can be positive or negative and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought about the world as being full of</v>

1013
00:55:57.471 --> 00:55:58.940
<v Speaker 4>furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking,</v>

1014
00:55:58.941 --> 00:55:59.720
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1015
00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:04.720
<v Speaker 4>And then what you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you perceived directly was the </v>

1016
00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.250
<v Speaker 4>affordance and so he imagined the visual</v>
<v Speaker 4>cliff experiment.</v>

1017
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:12.730
<v Speaker 4>So let's say I put a piece of glass over</v>
<v Speaker 4>top of this,</v>

1018
00:56:12.741 --> 00:56:14.800
<v Speaker 4>the space between these two tables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no chair there,</v>

1019
00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:17.510
<v Speaker 4>and I take a duck and I put the dark </v>
<v Speaker 4>here in the duck,</v>

1020
00:56:17.511 --> 00:56:19.550
<v Speaker 4>walks out on the glass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the duck doesn't care,</v>

1021
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.740
<v Speaker 4>it will just walk out and the glass </v>
<v Speaker 4>wall,</v>

1022
00:56:21.741 --> 00:56:24.790
<v Speaker 4>it's an aquatic animal and if there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>depth underneath that,</v>

1023
00:56:24.791 --> 00:56:27.880
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really bother a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you put a human infant on,</v>

1024
00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:32.920
<v Speaker 4>they're old enough to crawl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human infant will look over it and </v>

1025
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.030
<v Speaker 4>that's not going on that glass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you might say,</v>

1026
00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:39.031
<v Speaker 4>well what is it c?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could say it sees a space </v>

1027
00:56:39.031 --> 00:56:41.491
<v Speaker 4>between the two tables and infers that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it might fall,</v>

1028
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.480
<v Speaker 4>but it's like eight months old.</v>

1029
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is it's inferring that no,</v>

1030
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:47.950
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sees a place to fall off of.</v>

1031
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.880
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Gibson's fundamental point is </v>

1032
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.280
<v Speaker 4>that you don't see a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see a falling off place.</v>

1033
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:58.240
<v Speaker 4>And of course why wouldn't you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if that isn't what you saw,</v>

1034
00:56:58.241 --> 00:57:03.241
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't be here because what of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your dopey ancestors would've wandered </v>

1035
00:57:03.241 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 4>off the cliff and died?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ones that saw a falling off place,</v>

1036
00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:10.651
<v Speaker 4>they just stayed away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know if you have vertigo and </v>

1037
00:57:10.651 --> 00:57:14.910
<v Speaker 4>even if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're up on the 35th floor of an </v>

1038
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:16.150
<v Speaker 4>apartment building and you walk out onto</v>
<v Speaker 4>the balcony,</v>

1039
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:20.710
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting to notice your </v>
<v Speaker 4>perception because you might think,</v>

1040
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:24.820
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see the space and you become afraid.</v>

1041
00:57:24.821 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1042
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:27.550
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You walk closer to it in your body.</v>

1043
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:33.900
<v Speaker 4>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You perceive the damn thing with your </v>

1044
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:33.900
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

1045
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 4>You can also see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you perceive it with your body.</v>

1046
00:57:34.331 --> 00:57:36.100
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't go there.</v>

1047
00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:41.250
<v Speaker 4>Don't go any closer and your whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an automatic mapping of that </v>

1048
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:45.970
<v Speaker 4>place onto do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go away from there and that's underneath</v>

1049
00:57:45.971 --> 00:57:48.520
<v Speaker 4>and faster than the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The actual quote,</v>

1050
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.570
<v Speaker 4>conscious object perception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

1051
00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:56.380
<v Speaker 4>the other thing about Gibson's book that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love is he is so clear that guy,</v>

1052
00:57:56.381 --> 00:57:59.940
<v Speaker 4>he's such a good writer because he takes</v>
<v Speaker 4>you through a very complex argument.</v>

1053
00:57:59.941 --> 00:58:02.230
<v Speaker 4>But just a pristine example of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasoning.</v>

1054
00:58:02.231 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 4>It's the whole book is reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliant.</v>

1055
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.680
<v Speaker 4>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

1056
00:58:06.681 --> 00:58:08.860
<v Speaker 4>so if you want some background on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea,</v>

1057
00:58:08.861 --> 00:58:13.861
<v Speaker 4>the idea of perception of utility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say that's a great place to look,</v>

1058
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:17.860
<v Speaker 4>but it's also we're thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a biological perspective because of</v>

1059
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:22.861
<v Speaker 4>bloody well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course you're going to see the world </v>

1060
00:58:22.861 --> 00:58:25.140
<v Speaker 4>as what matters because you're the sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of creature that cares about what </v>

1061
00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:26.410
<v Speaker 4>matters mostly because you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>die.</v>

1062
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:32.250
<v Speaker 4>So you can't remove the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to die from your perception.</v>

1063
00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you did,</v>

1064
00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:36.700
<v Speaker 4>while you can imagine what would happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you did,</v>

1065
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:37.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1066
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:43.380
<v Speaker 4>you do something like wander off a </v>
<v Speaker 4>falling off place and that would be the </v>

1067
00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.321
<v Speaker 4>end of view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's built into your damn </v>

1068
00:58:46.321 --> 00:58:49.171
<v Speaker 4>perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's built into the facts that </v>

1069
00:58:49.171 --> 00:58:49.810
<v Speaker 4>you see because there's an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of facts.</v>

1070
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:52.960
<v Speaker 4>And so even just selecting the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an ethical issue.</v>

1071
00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:57.280
<v Speaker 4>So it's actually matters practically </v>
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

1072
00:58:57.281 --> 00:59:02.281
<v Speaker 4>because one of the things that I've come</v>
<v Speaker 4>to understand about political arguments </v>

1073
00:59:02.281 --> 00:59:03.940
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well say people say,</v>

1074
00:59:03.941 --> 00:59:04.780
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1075
00:59:04.781 --> 00:59:09.781
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person on the other side of the </v>

1076
00:59:09.781 --> 00:59:10.360
<v Speaker 4>ideological continuum has different </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinions than I do.</v>

1077
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1078
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:12.550
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe they do,</v>

1079
00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:17.850
<v Speaker 4>but they don't see the same facts </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the filter they use to select </v>

1080
00:59:17.861 --> 00:59:22.861
<v Speaker 4>from among the infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>available facts preferentially presents </v>

1081
00:59:22.861 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 4>them with the facts that are relevant to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and that's already built into their</v>

1082
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 4>ethic.</v>

1083
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:32.950
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the horrible things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>political discussions is that you're </v>

1084
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:33.940
<v Speaker 4>actually having a discussion about what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the facts are.</v>

1085
00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:38.970
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well the facts are the same for </v>

1086
00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:38.970
<v Speaker 4>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1087
00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:41.110
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like saying I have an infinite </v>

1088
00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:42.110
<v Speaker 4>library of books and you can come into </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1089
00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:42.690
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1090
00:59:42.691 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 4>you're going to pick out the same book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seems highly improbable.</v>

1091
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:49.260
<v Speaker 4>And that's the problem with facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's,</v>

1092
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:54.470
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what you try to do something </v>

1093
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 4>like untangled the Israel Palestine </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict.</v>

1094
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:57.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things you just to start with</v>

1095
00:59:57.531 --> 00:59:58.070
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1096
00:59:58.071 --> 01:00:00.260
<v Speaker 4>how far back you're going to go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1097
01:00:00.261 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 4>I would say it depends on what argument </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to make.</v>

1098
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to make argument a,</v>

1099
01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:09.701
<v Speaker 4>you go back 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to make our B go back 3000 </v>

1100
01:00:09.701 --> 01:00:12.581
<v Speaker 4>years and then you could have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument about which timescale you </v>

1101
01:00:12.581 --> 01:00:12.650
<v Speaker 4>should use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like it's obvious.</v>

1102
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:14.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it 10 years?</v>

1103
01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:16.460
<v Speaker 4>Is it one year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it six months?</v>

1104
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 4>Like is it's not 3000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it 2,999</v>

1105
01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:23.630
<v Speaker 4>years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where are the borders of relevancy?</v>

1106
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:25.880
<v Speaker 4>When you're laying out the landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the argument,</v>

1107
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.110
<v Speaker 4>God only knows it's intractable</v>

1108
01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.160
<v Speaker 4>and you know partly the way your </v>
<v Speaker 4>temperament solves that problem because </v>

1109
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:38.160
<v Speaker 4>it does is say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1110
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.961
<v Speaker 4>create a creature like you with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>temperament preferentially attends to </v>

1111
01:00:42.961 --> 01:00:45.721
<v Speaker 4>this set of facts and that'll work </v>
<v Speaker 4>because attending to that sort of fact </v>

1112
01:00:45.721 --> 01:00:48.970
<v Speaker 4>is likely to produce a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 4>outcome for you in most circumstances.</v>

1113
01:00:48.971 --> 01:00:53.971
<v Speaker 4>And it's a way that you simplify the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and make a tremendous amount of </v>

1114
01:00:53.971 --> 01:00:57.241
<v Speaker 4>the irrelevant a priority filters.</v>

1115
01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1116
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Now the next cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens when you see a tool?</v>

1117
01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.790
<v Speaker 4>You're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What tabs?</v>

1118
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.800
<v Speaker 4>When you see an obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're unhappy and they're now you </v>

1119
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.390
<v Speaker 4>understand emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's so.</v>

1120
01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.720
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't take much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's once you've got this initial </v>

1121
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:20.720
<v Speaker 4>framework,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1122
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:20.880
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what's an emotion for positive?</v>

1123
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.930
<v Speaker 4>Move forward?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Negative.</v>

1124
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:29.190
<v Speaker 4>Get Away indeterminant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop.</v>

1125
01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.530
<v Speaker 4>That's anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop.</v>

1126
01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.420
<v Speaker 4>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not where you think you are.</v>

1127
01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.340
<v Speaker 4>Your map isn't producing the desired </v>
<v Speaker 4>outcome.</v>

1128
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.320
<v Speaker 4>It's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What should you do?</v>

1129
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.610
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop.</v>

1130
01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:46.050
<v Speaker 4>Because if you don't know where to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no point in going anywhere.</v>

1131
01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.880
<v Speaker 4>And then one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prepare.</v>

1132
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:50.670
<v Speaker 4>That's anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start prepare.</v>

1133
01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.260
<v Speaker 4>While people hate that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

1134
01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.000
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for obvious reasons,</v>

1135
01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:56.190
<v Speaker 4>prepare for what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>

1136
01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1137
01:01:58.861 --> 01:02:02.920
<v Speaker 4>very demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psychophysiological.</v>

1138
01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.800
<v Speaker 4>And that's also something that's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>worth knowing.</v>

1139
01:02:05.801 --> 01:02:09.850
<v Speaker 4>It's like anxiety isn't just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological state that's unpleasant.</v>

1140
01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:14.851
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're revved up and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>burning resources like mad and you're in</v>

1141
01:02:15.791 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 4>a biochemical state such that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>optimized for quick</v>

1142
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.930
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's toxic.</v>

1143
01:02:21.931 --> 01:02:23.880
<v Speaker 3>If you inhabit it for any length of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1144
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:29.930
<v Speaker 3>so not knowing what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not good and it isn't just that </v>

1145
01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:30.300
<v Speaker 3>it makes you feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hurts you,</v>

1146
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 3>it damages you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can kill you,</v>

1147
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.110
<v Speaker 3>it'll make you age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll make you fat,</v>

1148
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:39.111
<v Speaker 3>it'll give you diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll suppress your immune system so </v>

1149
01:02:39.111 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 3>you're more likely to develop cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll damage your brain,</v>

1150
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:45.051
<v Speaker 3>your hippocampus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll increase the probability that you </v>

1151
01:02:45.051 --> 01:02:47.631
<v Speaker 3>have Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's no joke that it's you're </v>

1152
01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 3>running your machinery faster than you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can replenish it,</v>

1153
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:52.710
<v Speaker 3>so it's not a state that you can be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1154
01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not a state you can tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's anxious.</v>

1155
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's anxious,</v>

1156
01:02:56.610 --> 01:03:01.610
<v Speaker 3>but it's also not a state you can live </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and so I don't know where I am means </v>

1157
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:06.501
<v Speaker 3>everything's relevant and I have to ramp</v>
<v Speaker 3>up my capacity for auction to deal with </v>

1158
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:07.620
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1159
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Bad people do not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do not like not to be where we think </v>

1160
01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:15.030
<v Speaker 3>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really,</v>

1161
01:03:15.031 --> 01:03:20.031
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really don't like that and we structure </v>

1162
01:03:20.031 --> 01:03:20.031
<v Speaker 3>almost all over environment's </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly,</v>

1163
01:03:20.031 --> 01:03:23.730
<v Speaker 3>so that never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all dressed the same with tiny,</v>

1164
01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 3>tiny variations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1165
01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:30.350
<v Speaker 3>we all follow the same traffic laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's behaving according to the </v>

1166
01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:34.161
<v Speaker 3>appropriate code in this room and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone in this building is doing the </v>

1167
01:03:34.161 --> 01:03:37.311
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're doing everything we can </v>

1168
01:03:37.311 --> 01:03:40.610
<v Speaker 3>to make sure that everyone knows exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they are and what they're doing </v>

1169
01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:44.151
<v Speaker 3>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's because when we're in that </v>

1170
01:03:44.151 --> 01:03:47.400
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can advance cautiously using positive</v>

1171
01:03:47.401 --> 01:03:50.790
<v Speaker 3>things and maintain a modicum of </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive emotion.</v>

1172
01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.880
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're basically trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1173
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you want to set up your world so that</v>

1174
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:59.070
<v Speaker 3>you're surrounded by things that move </v>
<v Speaker 3>you along your way,</v>

1175
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:03.000
<v Speaker 3>that obstacles are minimized and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost everything can be ignored.</v>

1176
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so emotion,</v>

1177
01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:06.990
<v Speaker 3>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's dopaminergic,</v>

1178
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:12.620
<v Speaker 3>that's incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You experience it in relationship to a </v>

1179
01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:16.671
<v Speaker 3>goal because you know most of the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to behavioral </v>

1180
01:04:16.671 --> 01:04:20.091
<v Speaker 3>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you rewarding reward is a </v>

1181
01:04:20.091 --> 01:04:20.310
<v Speaker 3>satiation consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hungry,</v>

1182
01:04:20.311 --> 01:04:21.780
<v Speaker 3>you get a piece of food that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>rewarding.</v>

1183
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's conservatory reward,</v>

1184
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.400
<v Speaker 3>and that shuts down the motivational </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1185
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.940
<v Speaker 3>It's say it's satiating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you satisfied.</v>

1186
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.300
<v Speaker 3>That's not the same as incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incentive reward says,</v>

1187
01:04:36.301 --> 01:04:37.560
<v Speaker 3>come this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come this way,</v>

1188
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.750
<v Speaker 3>good things are over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good things are over here,</v>

1189
01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.740
<v Speaker 3>and that's dopaminergic and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of reward people really like.</v>

1190
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:48.980
<v Speaker 3>We live for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you talk about positive meaning </v>

1191
01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.420
<v Speaker 3>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an oversimplification,</v>

1192
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.650
<v Speaker 3>but a tremendous amount of that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>incentive reward.</v>

1193
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.800
<v Speaker 3>You're in a goal directed structure to </v>
<v Speaker 3>value structure.</v>

1194
01:04:55.801 --> 01:05:00.801
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's fairly well developed </v>

1195
01:05:00.801 --> 01:05:00.801
<v Speaker 3>because you're sophisticated.</v>

1196
01:05:00.801 --> 01:05:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Everything you do is linked to something</v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

1197
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.180
<v Speaker 3>You move ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it works,</v>

1198
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.400
<v Speaker 3>gets you move ahead at works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1199
01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:10.460
<v Speaker 3>and it's that constant moving ahead and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the validation of the frame that makes </v>

1200
01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:14.790
<v Speaker 3>your life meaningful and so that also </v>
<v Speaker 3>means no value system,</v>

1201
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:20.120
<v Speaker 3>no positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is another thing that's so much </v>

1202
01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.341
<v Speaker 3>worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the postmodernists complaint </v>

1203
01:05:23.341 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 3>about value systems constantly and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1204
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:29.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with a value system is that </v>

1205
01:05:29.431 --> 01:05:31.030
<v Speaker 3>it includes some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>winners and excludes other people.</v>

1206
01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Losers sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1207
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.380
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the answer?</v>

1208
01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:38.950
<v Speaker 3>Flatten the value system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no losers.</v>

1209
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Find new winners either and if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1210
01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:45.340
<v Speaker 3>If the value system is flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no point b,</v>

1211
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:48.610
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's your positive emotion?</v>

1212
01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:54.210
<v Speaker 3>You had nothing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to wander around being </v>

1213
01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:54.210
<v Speaker 3>happy that the value system is flat.</v>

1214
01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:54.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1215
01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:59.161
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you flatten out value </v>

1216
01:05:59.161 --> 01:06:01.801
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get rid of suffering because </v>

1217
01:06:01.801 --> 01:06:01.801
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you get rid of is the possibility of</v>

1218
01:06:01.801 --> 01:06:04.720
<v Speaker 3>positive emotion and that is not a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>

1219
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.170
<v Speaker 3>So then you leave people with nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>but negative emotion.</v>

1220
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 3>It's so naive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1221
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:13.960
<v Speaker 3>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now we know you're going from point a</v>

1222
01:06:13.961 --> 01:06:15.850
<v Speaker 3>to point b.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing that with an action.</v>

1223
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.830
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if things are working out,</v>

1224
01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:21.490
<v Speaker 3>if you see facilitators along the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can utilize your,</v>

1225
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to kick a positive emotion.</v>

1226
01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:30.060
<v Speaker 3>You know when you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can even see that calibrated like </v>

1227
01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:30.060
<v Speaker 3>let's say you do better than expected on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a test.</v>

1228
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's better than doing as </v>

1229
01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.271
<v Speaker 3>well as you expected because what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>message is is that not only am I moving </v>

1230
01:06:39.281 --> 01:06:44.281
<v Speaker 3>towards my desired goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm moving along faster and with </v>

1231
01:06:44.281 --> 01:06:44.350
<v Speaker 3>less effort than I thought.</v>

1232
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:47.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive reinforcement,</v>

1233
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1234
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:50.200
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's it.</v>

1235
01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:55.260
<v Speaker 3>That's meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big chunk of meaning and so a </v>

1236
01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:59.031
<v Speaker 3>really meaningful event is one that gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to the next step and simultaneously </v>

1237
01:06:59.771 --> 01:07:04.771
<v Speaker 3>increases the probability that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get to all the steps after </v>

1238
01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.801
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a maximally meaningful </v>

1239
01:07:07.801 --> 01:07:07.801
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1240
01:07:07.801 --> 01:07:09.940
<v Speaker 3>you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're opening an envelope about whether</v>

1241
01:07:09.941 --> 01:07:12.760
<v Speaker 3>or not you got into medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're going like this,</v>

1242
01:07:12.761 --> 01:07:13.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1243
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Why are you shaking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an envelope.</v>

1244
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:17.770
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1245
01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a portal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1246
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:25.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a portal and what's in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>envelope either puts you that way into </v>

1247
01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.420
<v Speaker 3>one world or that way into another and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you're looking at it,</v>

1248
01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:29.590
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's an envelope.</v>

1249
01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like your body isn't thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not for a bloody second.</v>

1250
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:35.770
<v Speaker 3>It knows perfectly well that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>portal and you open it up.</v>

1251
01:07:35.771 --> 01:07:40.771
<v Speaker 3>It's like collapse the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it,</v>

1252
01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:47.350
<v Speaker 3>that whole avatar related future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just those ashes or bang,</v>

1253
01:07:50.301 --> 01:07:55.301
<v Speaker 3>it springs into reality and you perceive</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and that you perceive all of that </v>

1254
01:07:55.301 --> 01:07:59.981
<v Speaker 3>almost instantaneously and that produces</v>
<v Speaker 3>that radical transformation in emotion </v>

1255
01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:06.220
<v Speaker 3>so you're not reacting to the envelope </v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe the envelope is and what you </v>

1256
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.600
<v Speaker 3>think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe the envelope isn't what you see</v>

1257
01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:11.750
<v Speaker 3>and that's more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's way more accurate.</v>

1258
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:14.000
<v Speaker 3>The envelope is way more than what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>

1259
01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1260
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Let's break for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1261
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.360
<v Speaker 4>and then we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll go ahead with the next part of </v>

1262
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:28.360
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1263
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.620
<v Speaker 4>so that's just a transformation of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>previous diagram.</v>

1264
01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're moving around long from what is </v>

1265
01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:36.640
<v Speaker 4>what should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll say</v>

1266
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:42.630
<v Speaker 4>as long as things are working out well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're mildly happy and if they </v>

1267
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:43.050
<v Speaker 4>don't work out well then you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>downstairs.</v>

1268
01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.410
<v Speaker 4>That's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>

1269
01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:49.411
<v Speaker 4>these are different sizes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason for that and that's </v>

1270
01:08:49.411 --> 01:08:52.561
<v Speaker 4>because negative emotion has more </v>
<v Speaker 4>potency unit for unit than positive </v>

1271
01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:57.181
<v Speaker 4>emotion does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what that means is that people </v>

1272
01:08:57.181 --> 01:09:00.541
<v Speaker 4>are more reactive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People hate a small loss more than they </v>

1273
01:09:00.541 --> 01:09:04.621
<v Speaker 4>like an equivalent gain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we're tilted to some degree </v>

1274
01:09:04.621 --> 01:09:09.031
<v Speaker 4>towards bias for negative emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is also dependent on temperament </v>

1275
01:09:10.841 --> 01:09:14.140
<v Speaker 4>because somebody who's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very low in neuroticism,</v>

1276
01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.980
<v Speaker 4>that's basically anxiety and emotional </v>
<v Speaker 4>pain susceptibility,</v>

1277
01:09:17.981 --> 01:09:22.981
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that would be the threshold for </v>

1278
01:09:22.981 --> 01:09:23.110
<v Speaker 4>experiencing a certain level of anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 4>or emotional pain,</v>

1279
01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.780
<v Speaker 4>but also the length of time that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>take to recover.</v>

1280
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:27.850
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1281
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:32.910
<v Speaker 4>but for the standard human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loss hurts more than gain rewards.</v>

1282
01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:37.950
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1283
01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.770
<v Speaker 4>it's useful to know that because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>helps you,</v>

1284
01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:44.340
<v Speaker 4>it helps you understand yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>other human beings,</v>

1285
01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:47.460
<v Speaker 4>even if you're trying to motivate </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone to do something,</v>

1286
01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:52.860
<v Speaker 4>loss avoidance is often a powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation as well as gain.</v>

1287
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:54.380
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

1288
01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:56.280
<v Speaker 4>prevention fundamentally.</v>

1289
01:09:57.630 --> 01:10:02.630
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now here's another way of thinking </v>

1290
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.630
<v Speaker 4>about this and this is a more abstract </v>
<v Speaker 4>way of thinking about it.</v>

1291
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:05.910
<v Speaker 4>So we talked about the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world might be divided into tools and,</v>

1292
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:10.080
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and obstacles and irrelevant things,</v>

1293
01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:13.170
<v Speaker 4>most of which are irrelevant things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a huge category.</v>

1294
01:10:13.171 --> 01:10:14.880
<v Speaker 4>And that's the one you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have disrupted</v>

1295
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:21.910
<v Speaker 4>and also that the obstacle category </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces more emotion than the tool </v>

1296
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:23.930
<v Speaker 4>category.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's another way of thinking about</v>

1297
01:10:23.931 --> 01:10:28.220
<v Speaker 4>it and this is thinking about it more </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a purely emotional perspective.</v>

1298
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:30.670
<v Speaker 4>When you think about the world as tools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1299
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:35.770
<v Speaker 4>it's dead practical and it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>grounded in the idea of motor usage and </v>

1300
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:36.850
<v Speaker 4>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can,</v>

1301
01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:42.090
<v Speaker 4>you can think in an analogical fashion </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the same system in a slightly </v>

1302
01:10:44.391 --> 01:10:49.391
<v Speaker 4>different matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in the situation that you're in </v>

1303
01:10:49.391 --> 01:10:51.521
<v Speaker 4>right now and that's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's another thing that's kind </v>

1304
01:10:51.521 --> 01:10:53.180
<v Speaker 4>of interesting about people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there a chronically dissatisfied with</v>

1305
01:10:53.181 --> 01:10:57.560
<v Speaker 4>the way things are?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's okay because you wouldn't be</v>

1306
01:10:57.561 --> 01:11:02.561
<v Speaker 4>motivated to move forward if you weren't</v>
<v Speaker 4>chronically dissatisfied with the way </v>

1307
01:11:02.561 --> 01:11:03.140
<v Speaker 4>that things are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's kind of annoying,</v>

1308
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:04.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you might think,</v>

1309
01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:06.410
<v Speaker 4>well why aren't you just happy with what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have?</v>

1310
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.680
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that is generally </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't know if it's going to </v>

1311
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.470
<v Speaker 4>last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's part of it.</v>

1312
01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:13.440
<v Speaker 4>And the other is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1313
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:18.530
<v Speaker 4>if the situation shifted a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'd have more options and some of </v>

1314
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:20.370
<v Speaker 4>that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would last longer and be more stable,</v>

1315
01:11:20.371 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 4>it'd be more promising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you can say,</v>

1316
01:11:23.461 --> 01:11:28.461
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be satisfied with what you </v>

1317
01:11:28.461 --> 01:11:30.021
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's kind of really a stupid thing </v>

1318
01:11:30.021 --> 01:11:30.240
<v Speaker 4>in some sense to tell human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>because no matter what you have,</v>

1319
01:11:30.241 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 4>it isn't going to solve your fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

1320
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:37.200
<v Speaker 4>So the problem isn't going away and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't fool yourself into saying,</v>

1321
01:11:37.201 --> 01:11:39.120
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I have is great.</v>

1322
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.240
<v Speaker 4>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could have a hell of a lot less and </v>

1323
01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.601
<v Speaker 4>that would be bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and most people have a lot less than me </v>

1324
01:11:47.601 --> 01:11:47.601
<v Speaker 4>and I should be grateful for what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

1325
01:11:47.601 --> 01:11:49.290
<v Speaker 4>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's perfectly reasonable.</v>

1326
01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:54.291
<v Speaker 4>But you're stuck in this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're stuck with this chronic sense of </v>

1327
01:11:54.291 --> 01:11:58.071
<v Speaker 4>unfinished business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is while you're </v>

1328
01:11:58.071 --> 01:11:58.290
<v Speaker 4>permanently vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so how else would you,</v>

1329
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.800
<v Speaker 4>how could it be otherwise?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even if you've got your problem </v>

1330
01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.601
<v Speaker 4>solved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's three or four people in </v>

1331
01:12:07.601 --> 01:12:07.601
<v Speaker 4>your family that by no means have got </v>
<v Speaker 4>their problem solved.</v>

1332
01:12:07.601 --> 01:12:11.370
<v Speaker 4>So the problem of problems never goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

1333
01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:17.120
<v Speaker 4>That's an existent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing to know </v>

1334
01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:17.790
<v Speaker 4>existentially too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it helps you calibrate your life</v>

1335
01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:20.190
<v Speaker 4>properly because you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1336
01:12:20.191 --> 01:12:22.170
<v Speaker 4>if I just got everything together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1337
01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:27.171
<v Speaker 4>I'd hit some plateau of satiation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stability and then I would just be </v>

1338
01:12:27.171 --> 01:12:27.171
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1339
01:12:27.171 --> 01:12:27.780
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's never going to happen.</v>

1340
01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:32.900
<v Speaker 4>It's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you might as well just forget about </v>

1341
01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.511
<v Speaker 4>that and what you can sisyphus issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the guy who pushes the rock up </v>

1342
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.490
<v Speaker 4>the road and up the hill and it rolls </v>
<v Speaker 4>back down.</v>

1343
01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:42.000
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Nietzsche who said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we must presume sisyphus to be happy.</v>

1344
01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.440
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1345
01:12:43.441 --> 01:12:45.420
<v Speaker 4>maybe you want to push your damn rock up</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hill,</v>

1346
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.070
<v Speaker 4>you know it's going to roll down again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1347
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.960
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just sit there by the rock.</v>

1348
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:54.890
<v Speaker 4>It's okay to be active even even if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem you're trying to solve is not </v>

1349
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:58.671
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally solvable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean it isn't worth trying </v>

1350
01:12:58.671 --> 01:13:02.121
<v Speaker 4>to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So although people can despair about it </v>

1351
01:13:02.121 --> 01:13:02.430
<v Speaker 4>and it's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1352
01:13:02.431 --> 01:13:05.100
<v Speaker 4>so another way that I should've really </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1353
01:13:05.101 --> 01:13:08.910
<v Speaker 4>instead of predicted outcome here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like an old model.</v>

1354
01:13:08.911 --> 01:13:13.911
<v Speaker 4>This would be a model that I derived </v>
<v Speaker 4>from work that was done at least </v>

1355
01:13:13.911 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 4>initially in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't even in the forties,</v>

1356
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:21.170
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that still underlies the thinking </v>

1357
01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:24.381
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say the vast majority of </v>

1358
01:13:24.381 --> 01:13:24.381
<v Speaker 4>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't that you're predicting outcomes</v>

1359
01:13:24.381 --> 01:13:25.620
<v Speaker 4>and and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and failing.</v>

1360
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:30.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not that it's that you desire </v>
<v Speaker 4>outcomes and sometimes you get an </v>

1361
01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:33.891
<v Speaker 4>undesirable outcome and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>important to get that distinction </v>

1362
01:13:33.891 --> 01:13:37.491
<v Speaker 4>correct because if you're thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>expectation is just a cold cognitive </v>

1363
01:13:37.491 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 4>model,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a rational model.</v>

1364
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:40.890
<v Speaker 4>I know the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand it's relationships.</v>

1365
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:43.920
<v Speaker 4>I can predict what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>next if,</v>

1366
01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:45.690
<v Speaker 4>and that's what I'm trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 4>predict it.</v>

1367
01:13:45.691 --> 01:13:46.590
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no you're not,</v>

1368
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:51.650
<v Speaker 4>you're not trying to predict it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to get what you want from </v>

1369
01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:55.551
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a prediction element to </v>

1370
01:13:55.551 --> 01:13:55.551
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1371
01:13:55.551 --> 01:13:55.551
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1372
01:13:55.551 --> 01:13:59.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to pick that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a prediction and their work </v>

1373
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.370
<v Speaker 4>verifying my prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1374
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:05.270
<v Speaker 4>but what's missing there is I want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pick that up and you can't throw that </v>

1375
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:10.011
<v Speaker 4>out of the equation because as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 4>you throw motivation out of the </v>

1376
01:14:10.011 --> 01:14:13.371
<v Speaker 4>equation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're stuck with the mystery of </v>

1377
01:14:13.371 --> 01:14:13.371
<v Speaker 4>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1378
01:14:13.371 --> 01:14:16.710
<v Speaker 4>How do you organize her perceptions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you want something when you </v>

1379
01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:19.411
<v Speaker 4>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you don't get to get rid of the want </v>

1380
01:14:19.411 --> 01:14:20.710
<v Speaker 4>and just substitute cold expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a slight of hand.</v>

1381
01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:25.630
<v Speaker 4>And the cognitive behaviors stew that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they almost always do that.</v>

1382
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.340
<v Speaker 4>That's how they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1383
01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:33.540
<v Speaker 4>it's not like a conspiracy or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's perfectly reasonable to have a </v>

1384
01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:34.090
<v Speaker 4>simplified model for the way that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>act,</v>

1385
01:14:34.091 --> 01:14:39.091
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want to throw motivation </v>
<v Speaker 4>and emotion out of the equation because </v>

1386
01:14:39.091 --> 01:14:39.670
<v Speaker 4>obviously there's or embodiment there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so important.</v>

1387
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:45.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So forget predicted an unpredicted </v>

1388
01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:46.210
<v Speaker 4>desired an undesired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1389
01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:49.450
<v Speaker 4>So I come walking in here and I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>this low level desire,</v>

1390
01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:54.451
<v Speaker 4>which is to make my way to my podium </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the least amount of effort </v>

1391
01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.750
<v Speaker 4>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I see that,</v>

1392
01:14:55.751 --> 01:14:59.260
<v Speaker 4>that chairs in the way and it's mildly </v>
<v Speaker 4>annoying.</v>

1393
01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.120
<v Speaker 4>And so there's something undesired </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1394
01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:04.430
<v Speaker 4>So the desired outcome produces positive</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion.</v>

1395
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 4>That's promise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's technically speaking?</v>

1396
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:12.030
<v Speaker 4>You could also think about it as hope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's related to the attainment of a </v>

1397
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:13.240
<v Speaker 4>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It indicates the potential attainment of</v>

1398
01:15:13.241 --> 01:15:14.680
<v Speaker 4>a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what hope is,</v>

1399
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:18.460
<v Speaker 4>or what promise is hope is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can probably attain this school,</v>

1400
01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:22.540
<v Speaker 4>promise his promises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If something is promising,</v>

1401
01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:27.541
<v Speaker 4>it indicates to you that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably attain the goal or if someone </v>

1402
01:15:27.541 --> 01:15:31.500
<v Speaker 4>makes a promise to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're telling you that they're </v>

1403
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:31.720
<v Speaker 4>going to facilitate movement towards a </v>
<v Speaker 4>goal,</v>

1404
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:35.920
<v Speaker 4>and so that's the emotional level that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the dopaminergic system works on.</v>

1405
01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:40.921
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's promise or hope or or technically </v>

1406
01:15:40.921 --> 01:15:40.960
<v Speaker 4>it's called incentive reward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's the technical term,</v>

1407
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:44.050
<v Speaker 4>but it's the indication that something </v>
<v Speaker 4>good is going to happen.</v>

1408
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.270
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I see a clear pathway,</v>

1409
01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:51.520
<v Speaker 4>then I know I can make my goal pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>efficiently and so it's going to produce</v>

1410
01:15:51.521 --> 01:15:52.770
<v Speaker 4>just a well.</v>

1411
01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.630
<v Speaker 4>I was going to produce enough positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion to make me walk forward.</v>

1412
01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:57.130
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the right amount.</v>

1413
01:15:57.610 --> 01:16:01.990
<v Speaker 4>So and so it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can actually use this when you're</v>

1414
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:04.390
<v Speaker 4>thinking about room design or house </v>
<v Speaker 4>designed.</v>

1415
01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:06.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're in a room,</v>

1416
01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1417
01:16:06.611 --> 01:16:08.440
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to use this room for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1418
01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.490
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sort that out.</v>

1419
01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.760
<v Speaker 4>Well then you want to make the pathways </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that use is clear and pristine as </v>

1420
01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.780
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you want to put in some </v>

1421
01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:18.780
<v Speaker 4>interesting variation just for </v>
<v Speaker 4>decoration,</v>

1422
01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:23.191
<v Speaker 4>but fundamentally what you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do is to set up the environment so that </v>

1423
01:16:23.191 --> 01:16:27.100
<v Speaker 4>it facilitates the actions you intend to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pursue there.</v>

1424
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:30.040
<v Speaker 4>If you go into your room and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>covered with stacks of paper and they're</v>

1425
01:16:30.041 --> 01:16:31.450
<v Speaker 4>all messy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1426
01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:36.451
<v Speaker 4>and and you know the bed isn't made and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's rubbish everywhere by your </v>

1427
01:16:36.451 --> 01:16:37.270
<v Speaker 4>definition of rubbish.</v>

1428
01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:42.660
<v Speaker 4>Then what you're doing basically is </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking into a room of snakes and it's </v>

1429
01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:46.771
<v Speaker 4>the same system that's responding to all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of those undone things that would </v>

1430
01:16:46.771 --> 01:16:47.950
<v Speaker 4>respond to snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1431
01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:51.700
<v Speaker 4>not like a Cobra that's right beside </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1432
01:16:51.701 --> 01:16:56.701
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same damn circuitry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the circuitry that responds to </v>

1433
01:16:56.701 --> 01:17:00.091
<v Speaker 4>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the circuitry that responds to the </v>

1434
01:17:00.091 --> 01:17:01.540
<v Speaker 4>dragon of chaos that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable.</v>

1435
01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:03.530
<v Speaker 4>In a room like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1436
01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:08.670
<v Speaker 4>it's not explored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a place where you can easily </v>

1437
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.580
<v Speaker 4>see the proper relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tools and the obstacles.</v>

1438
01:17:10.581 --> 01:17:12.860
<v Speaker 4>It's not a place that you can make </v>
<v Speaker 4>things irrelevant,</v>

1439
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.510
<v Speaker 4>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

1440
01:17:14.511 --> 01:17:18.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a place full of obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are you going to be comfortable in a</v>

1441
01:17:18.021 --> 01:17:23.021
<v Speaker 4>room like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's full of things that get in the way </v>

1442
01:17:23.021 --> 01:17:26.081
<v Speaker 4>of your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be nervous in there all </v>

1443
01:17:26.081 --> 01:17:28.571
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like it's full of envelopes that</v>

1444
01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:31.030
<v Speaker 4>you haven't opened and most of them have</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad news in.</v>

1445
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.380
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be comfortable in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>room like that.</v>

1446
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:39.010
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why can't you just ignore those </v>

1447
01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:39.010
<v Speaker 4>envelopes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1448
01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:39.360
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a stupid way of looking at it,</v>

1449
01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:44.810
<v Speaker 4>so promise produces hope slash pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>curiosity.</v>

1450
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:49.960
<v Speaker 4>All the incentive reward related </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotions sort of fit in that box and </v>

1451
01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.451
<v Speaker 4>then undesired outcomes produce threat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are threats and they produce </v>

1452
01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:55.940
<v Speaker 4>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not even exactly right.</v>

1453
01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:00.950
<v Speaker 4>That's in an elementary discussion of</v>

1454
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:04.950
<v Speaker 4>the role of competitor systems in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

1455
01:18:04.951 --> 01:18:09.951
<v Speaker 4>which we'll talk about in more detail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The general notion is is that the </v>

1456
01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:14.931
<v Speaker 4>violation of an expectation produces </v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety and that that's a pretty good </v>

1457
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:19.371
<v Speaker 4>model and you got some support from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychophysiological pharmacological </v>

1458
01:18:19.371 --> 01:18:24.351
<v Speaker 4>literature because if you give animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>antianxiety agents like benzodiazepines </v>

1459
01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:29.031
<v Speaker 4>or alcohol or barbiturates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do respond less to the violation of</v>

1460
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
<v Speaker 4>quote expectancy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does dampen the response,</v>

1461
01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 4>but but it's an oversimplified model and</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get understanding of human behavior,</v>

1462
01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:41.760
<v Speaker 4>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to expand it a bit.</v>

1463
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:43.770
<v Speaker 4>It isn't precisely that</v>

1464
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:48.410
<v Speaker 4>unpredicted outcome is a threat and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces anxiety.</v>

1465
01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:54.450
<v Speaker 4>It's that unpredicted outcome makes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>irrelevant relevant and it produces an </v>

1466
01:18:54.471 --> 01:18:57.260
<v Speaker 4>undifferentiated emotional and </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivational state.</v>

1467
01:18:57.830 --> 01:19:02.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a better way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it isn't just that you don't </v>

1468
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.830
<v Speaker 4>just get anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

1469
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:03.950
<v Speaker 4>if something goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get anxious,</v>

1470
01:19:03.951 --> 01:19:05.840
<v Speaker 4>you get angry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get curious,</v>

1471
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.210
<v Speaker 4>you get frustrated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get depressed,</v>

1472
01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:13.211
<v Speaker 4>like it's a whole bursting forward of </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotions and motivational states and </v>

1473
01:19:13.211 --> 01:19:16.550
<v Speaker 4>that's because when something doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>work the way it's supposed to,</v>

1474
01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:18.560
<v Speaker 4>even when you just encounter an </v>
<v Speaker 4>obstacle,</v>

1475
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:24.130
<v Speaker 4>it means that you're the way that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>construing the landscape is wrong in </v>

1476
01:19:24.130 --> 01:19:28.280
<v Speaker 4>some manner and you don't exactly know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're going to have to do in order</v>

1477
01:19:28.281 --> 01:19:33.281
<v Speaker 4>to fix that unless it's a very trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trivial violation and it's one that you </v>

1478
01:19:33.281 --> 01:19:36.470
<v Speaker 4>know immediately how to readdress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I'm again,</v>

1479
01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:45.090
<v Speaker 4>so I come around the corner and I look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at that chair and I'm annoyed because </v>

1480
01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:46.050
<v Speaker 4>it's in the way you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how annoyed should I get?</v>

1481
01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:51.260
<v Speaker 4>And the answer should be something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>your annoyance should be in proportion </v>

1482
01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.980
<v Speaker 4>to the amount of time and energy it will</v>
<v Speaker 4>take to move that chair.</v>

1483
01:19:53.610 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that's kind of like a proper </v>

1484
01:19:58.610 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 4>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like I should be that annoyed.</v>

1485
01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:03.350
<v Speaker 4>I should be annoyed enough so that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>indexed doing that because that does </v>

1486
01:20:06.331 --> 01:20:11.331
<v Speaker 4>actually take some and energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that actually has a cost and the </v>

1487
01:20:11.331 --> 01:20:14.181
<v Speaker 4>fact that I have to pay that cost </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be signified by something </v>

1488
01:20:14.181 --> 01:20:14.910
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise I wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>sensitive to costs.</v>

1489
01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:18.900
<v Speaker 4>And so the annoyance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's in proportion to the effort,</v>

1490
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 4>is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Index property.</v>

1491
01:20:20.761 --> 01:20:25.761
<v Speaker 4>Now often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately you don't know how to </v>

1492
01:20:25.761 --> 01:20:26.430
<v Speaker 4>index.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have an old car,</v>

1493
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:31.110
<v Speaker 4>you're driving to work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone bumps you from behind,</v>

1494
01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:32.730
<v Speaker 4>and then your car doesn't work.</v>

1495
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:33.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1496
01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:35.280
<v Speaker 4>how annoyed should you get?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>

1497
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:41.390
<v Speaker 4>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then all of a sudden a bunch of </v>

1498
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.940
<v Speaker 4>things that were irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the whole damn car poof,</v>

1499
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:47.120
<v Speaker 4>become relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plus you have to deal with this person </v>

1500
01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:47.120
<v Speaker 4>that just ran into you and what are they</v>
<v Speaker 4>like?</v>

1501
01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're stupid enough to run into you so</v>

1502
01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:54.050
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what else might be wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>with them and maybe they're going to be </v>

1503
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:56.661
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of trouble and you have to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>their insurance information and now </v>

1504
01:20:56.661 --> 01:20:59.271
<v Speaker 4>you're on the side of the road and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know if you're going to go to </v>

1505
01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:01.551
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's when your emotions can </v>

1506
01:21:01.551 --> 01:21:04.191
<v Speaker 4>unravel because they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>compute the effort and time you're going</v>

1507
01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:07.610
<v Speaker 4>to have to take in order to rectify this</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this span,</v>

1508
01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:08.140
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1509
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:10.070
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the what you'd call it,</v>

1510
01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:15.100
<v Speaker 4>the domain that is opening up as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of the problem isn't easy to</v>

1511
01:21:16.081 --> 01:21:19.440
<v Speaker 4>map and so you get stressed and you go </v>
<v Speaker 4>home and say,</v>

1512
01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.330
<v Speaker 4>I had a stressful day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the person says,</v>

1513
01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:21.840
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>

1514
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.550
<v Speaker 4>While someone hit me on the highway?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they go,</v>

1515
01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:24.510
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's terrible.</v>

1516
01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:25.920
<v Speaker 4>They figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1517
01:21:25.921 --> 01:21:27.210
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in this little map.</v>

1518
01:21:27.211 --> 01:21:32.211
<v Speaker 4>It was only this long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just going from here to here and </v>

1519
01:21:32.211 --> 01:21:35.001
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden booth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know where I was or how many </v>

1520
01:21:35.001 --> 01:21:38.150
<v Speaker 4>places I was going to have to wander </v>
<v Speaker 4>around in before I could get that map </v>

1521
01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:41.010
<v Speaker 4>working again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the car is an invisible predicate of</v>

1522
01:21:41.011 --> 01:21:44.370
<v Speaker 4>multiple potential future maps as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1523
01:21:44.371 --> 01:21:47.940
<v Speaker 4>It's an axiom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You make the map presuming that you have</v>

1524
01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:51.300
<v Speaker 4>the car and the car isn't a metal thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with wheels.</v>

1525
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:54.450
<v Speaker 4>The car is a conveyance for moving you </v>
<v Speaker 4>from point a to point b,</v>

1526
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:59.780
<v Speaker 4>and the fact that you have all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>maps of moving from point a to b that </v>

1527
01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:03.030
<v Speaker 4>are predicated on that conveyance means </v>
<v Speaker 4>that when it turns into a car instead of</v>

1528
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:04.680
<v Speaker 4>a conveyance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poof,</v>

1529
01:22:04.681 --> 01:22:07.470
<v Speaker 4>all those maps become extremely </v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated as well.</v>

1530
01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.370
<v Speaker 4>And so your body goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1531
01:22:09.371 --> 01:22:14.371
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My landscape is way more complex than I </v>

1532
01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:15.810
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Up goes the heart rate up,</v>

1533
01:22:15.811 --> 01:22:17.910
<v Speaker 4>close the cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that,</v>

1534
01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:23.150
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're more paralyzed and you can </v>

1535
01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:24.920
<v Speaker 4>like if you're a neurotic person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say something like that can just </v>

1536
01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:24.920
<v Speaker 4>paralyze you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're done.</v>

1537
01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.600
<v Speaker 4>You have to phone someone for emergency </v>
<v Speaker 4>help,</v>

1538
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:31.380
<v Speaker 4>which means you're in a map that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot put your map back together.</v>

1539
01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.260
<v Speaker 4>You have to call on outside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>help in order to do it.</v>

1540
01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:37.920
<v Speaker 4>So and you might not even know how to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1541
01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's another way.</v>

1542
01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Now here's another way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1543
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:48.120
<v Speaker 4>You want to stay inside this little map </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's working.</v>

1544
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:50.340
<v Speaker 4>You want to get from point a to point a </v>
<v Speaker 4>to point b,</v>

1545
01:22:50.341 --> 01:22:55.341
<v Speaker 4>and this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This indicates that you are moving </v>

1546
01:22:55.341 --> 01:22:58.041
<v Speaker 4>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the first thing it indicates and </v>

1547
01:22:58.041 --> 01:22:58.680
<v Speaker 4>the second thing it indicates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is even more important,</v>

1548
01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:01.230
<v Speaker 4>and you'll never hear this from </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavioral psychologists,</v>

1549
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:06.470
<v Speaker 4>is that your map is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so every time you move a little bit and </v>

1550
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:07.300
<v Speaker 4>something that you want happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it says,</v>

1551
01:23:07.301 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the game I'm playing is the right gate,</v>

1552
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:14.500
<v Speaker 4>and so not only does the reward indicate</v>
<v Speaker 4>progress,</v>

1553
01:23:14.501 --> 01:23:19.501
<v Speaker 4>it indicates that the frame within which</v>
<v Speaker 4>progress is being calculated is the </v>

1554
01:23:19.501 --> 01:23:23.191
<v Speaker 4>right frame and that's good because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the frame that makes things irrelevant </v>

1555
01:23:23.191 --> 01:23:27.930
<v Speaker 4>and you want them to stay irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you don't move forward and you </v>

1556
01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:31.030
<v Speaker 4>start to question the frame that's way </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse than merely not moving forward.</v>

1557
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.130
<v Speaker 4>You get a bad exam grade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

1558
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:35.170
<v Speaker 4>What the hell am I doing in university </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyways?</v>

1559
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:40.550
<v Speaker 4>It's like probably that's not the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>place you should go with that piece of </v>

1560
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.550
<v Speaker 4>information and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1561
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:41.950
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is that worse?</v>

1562
01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:44.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as I can tell,</v>

1563
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:50.200
<v Speaker 4>your map of view as a university student</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a comprehensive representation.</v>

1564
01:23:50.201 --> 01:23:51.600
<v Speaker 4>It tells you what you should do </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday.</v>

1565
01:23:51.730 --> 01:23:55.240
<v Speaker 4>It kind of tells you where you're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the future and if something emerges</v>

1566
01:23:55.241 --> 01:24:00.241
<v Speaker 4>as an the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Normally you get worse grade than you </v>

1567
01:24:00.241 --> 01:24:00.400
<v Speaker 4>expected and you blow that whole map.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1568
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:05.460
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have you been doing for the last </v>

1569
01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:07.141
<v Speaker 4>four years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of high school student were </v>

1570
01:24:07.141 --> 01:24:09.361
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How clueless are you about how you're </v>

1571
01:24:09.361 --> 01:24:09.361
<v Speaker 4>arranging your future?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your identity going to be?</v>

1572
01:24:09.361 --> 01:24:13.621
<v Speaker 4>If you're not going to be a student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are you going to end up in five </v>

1573
01:24:13.621 --> 01:24:13.621
<v Speaker 4>years?</v>

1574
01:24:13.621 --> 01:24:14.710
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like that little grade,</v>

1575
01:24:14.711 --> 01:24:19.711
<v Speaker 4>that bad grade is like a portal through </v>
<v Speaker 4>which snakes can crawl and that's </v>

1576
01:24:19.711 --> 01:24:23.371
<v Speaker 4>exactly how you respond to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you open the door too </v>

1577
01:24:23.371 --> 01:24:26.371
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe this means that I shouldn't </v>

1578
01:24:26.371 --> 01:24:26.371
<v Speaker 4>be in university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1579
01:24:26.371 --> 01:24:30.840
<v Speaker 4>one of the rules is don't you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to constrain the anomalous </v>

1580
01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:34.270
<v Speaker 4>event to the minimal necessary domain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

1581
01:24:34.271 --> 01:24:39.271
<v Speaker 4>really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to do that when you're arguing </v>

1582
01:24:39.271 --> 01:24:39.271
<v Speaker 4>with your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which will do all the time.</v>

1583
01:24:39.271 --> 01:24:40.060
<v Speaker 4>We have an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1584
01:24:40.061 --> 01:24:41.980
<v Speaker 4>I should never have married you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1585
01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:42.350
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1586
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:45.220
<v Speaker 4>that's not the first response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad response,</v>

1587
01:24:45.221 --> 01:24:50.221
<v Speaker 4>or here's a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've always done that sort of thing </v>

1588
01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.660
<v Speaker 4>and you always will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1589
01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:53.800
<v Speaker 4>oh good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

1590
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:58.830
<v Speaker 4>It's like the only answer to that is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hit someone because like you're done </v>

1591
01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:58.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1592
01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:59.380
<v Speaker 4>Your your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you've always been like that.</v>

1593
01:24:59.381 --> 01:25:02.380
<v Speaker 4>There isn't a chance that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>repaired and none of it is acceptable.</v>

1594
01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like the person's gonna fight with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you right away because what else are </v>

1595
01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.381
<v Speaker 4>they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what you want to do is you want to </v>

1596
01:25:10.381 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 4>minimize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't rationalization.</v>

1597
01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:11.140
<v Speaker 4>You want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1598
01:25:11.141 --> 01:25:13.900
<v Speaker 4>this person did something that disrupted</v>
<v Speaker 4>our joint map.</v>

1599
01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:19.380
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the smallest possible thing they </v>

1600
01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:19.840
<v Speaker 4>could do to put it back together?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have to know,</v>

1601
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:25.590
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to make a plan so you don't do </v>

1602
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:28.141
<v Speaker 4>it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or we need to have a discussion so that </v>

1603
01:25:28.141 --> 01:25:28.141
<v Speaker 4>you know that it wasn't a good thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

1604
01:25:28.141 --> 01:25:29.560
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not going to go after your whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>character.</v>

1605
01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:35.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say when I come home and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're watching TV,</v>

1606
01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:39.400
<v Speaker 4>just come to the door and say hello,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1607
01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.330
<v Speaker 4>don't you love me?</v>

1608
01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.560
<v Speaker 4>Or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1609
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.840
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1610
01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.380
<v Speaker 4>you just have to walk to the door and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like give me a hug or something,</v>

1611
01:25:44.381 --> 01:25:49.381
<v Speaker 4>and then that's good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so then the other person might be </v>

1612
01:25:49.381 --> 01:25:50.560
<v Speaker 4>able to tolerate that much corrective </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

1613
01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:55.820
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if you're kind of Nice about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you also understand that they're </v>

1614
01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.150
<v Speaker 4>probably going to have something equally</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible to say about you in the next 15</v>

1615
01:25:58.151 --> 01:26:03.151
<v Speaker 4>minutes because you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something stupid so so you don't wanna </v>

1616
01:26:03.151 --> 01:26:07.830
<v Speaker 4>you don't wanna open the door so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>every possible snake comes crawling </v>

1617
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:11.561
<v Speaker 4>through because that's a pathway to </v>
<v Speaker 4>depression and you actually see that </v>

1618
01:26:11.561 --> 01:26:15.281
<v Speaker 4>happening in depressed people is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>every small event produces a cascade </v>

1619
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:18.680
<v Speaker 4>through their entire value system and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they ended up saying,</v>

1620
01:26:18.681 --> 01:26:20.150
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just another reason that I should</v>

1621
01:26:20.151 --> 01:26:22.610
<v Speaker 4>jump off a bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they really see it that way.</v>

1622
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.670
<v Speaker 4>It's really awful because they've got no</v>
<v Speaker 4>defenses.</v>

1623
01:26:25.671 --> 01:26:26.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1624
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:31.040
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do so well in this course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm going to get a bad mark in</v>

1625
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:36.041
<v Speaker 4>the or in the exam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get bad mark in the course </v>

1626
01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:36.530
<v Speaker 4>that's going to screw up my ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>finish my degree.</v>

1627
01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:38.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to get into the field of</v>
<v Speaker 4>my choice.</v>

1628
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:44.140
<v Speaker 4>It's just another piece of indication </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm useless and that life isn't </v>

1629
01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:44.140
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

1630
01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:46.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to jump off a bridge and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're really depressed,</v>

1631
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:49.700
<v Speaker 4>it's like each of those things hits you </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the certainty of truth.</v>

1632
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.940
<v Speaker 4>It's really not good and so you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be careful.</v>

1633
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:57.970
<v Speaker 4>You want to be careful about walking </v>
<v Speaker 4>down that pathway when you make a </v>

1634
01:26:57.970 --> 01:26:57.970
<v Speaker 4>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

1635
01:26:57.970 --> 01:27:02.081
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the narrowest framework of </v>

1636
01:27:02.081 --> 01:27:03.650
<v Speaker 4>interpretation within which I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can understand this.</v>

1637
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:08.770
<v Speaker 4>That will require minimal behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 4>change to decrease the probability that </v>

1638
01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:09.260
<v Speaker 4>it will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1639
01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:13.130
<v Speaker 4>it's mental hygiene fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1640
01:27:15.190 --> 01:27:17.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll get to that.</v>

1641
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.970
<v Speaker 4>We'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the next question.</v>

1642
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 4>It's because they don't exist in </v>
<v Speaker 4>isolation,</v>

1643
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.280
<v Speaker 4>so and that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Frequently when when you,</v>

1644
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:28.640
<v Speaker 4>when you hear behavioral accounts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cognitive processes,</v>

1645
01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:33.530
<v Speaker 4>they generally only focus on it as if </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an isolated thing.</v>

1646
01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:34.660
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

1647
01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.650
<v Speaker 4>It's scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's scalable.</v>

1648
01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:41.651
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of ways it scalable temporarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what you do now is associated </v>

1649
01:27:41.651 --> 01:27:46.091
<v Speaker 4>with what you'll do tomorrow and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>with what you'll do next week and so </v>

1650
01:27:46.091 --> 01:27:46.970
<v Speaker 4>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it has to be scalable temporarily and</v>

1651
01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:49.550
<v Speaker 4>it's also scalable socially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1652
01:27:49.551 --> 01:27:53.330
<v Speaker 4>so it has an effect on you that has an </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect on your family that has an effect</v>

1653
01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:58.100
<v Speaker 4>on the community and so forth and so you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to take.</v>

1654
01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:04.180
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult to think through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>effect of your actions and all those </v>

1655
01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:05.270
<v Speaker 4>scaling link level simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1656
01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.920
<v Speaker 4>but you have mechanisms that allow you </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do that and we'll see.</v>

1657
01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.920
<v Speaker 4>I think that the sense of let's assume </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're not lying to yourself </v>

1658
01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.941
<v Speaker 4>constantly so your head isn't full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos and garbage and you have </v>

1659
01:28:18.941 --> 01:28:19.940
<v Speaker 4>reasonable relationships with people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

1660
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:25.630
<v Speaker 4>I think that this is leaping way ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that your sense of meaningful </v>

1661
01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:29.360
<v Speaker 4>engagement with what you're doing is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychophysiological marker,</v>

1662
01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:34.660
<v Speaker 4>that you're acting in a way that takes </v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the stacked representations into </v>

1663
01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:35.840
<v Speaker 4>account simultaneously because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

1664
01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.370
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1665
01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:40.310
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to figure out where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are and you might think,</v>

1666
01:28:40.311 --> 01:28:41.990
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that means where I am in this room,</v>

1667
01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.830
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this room is not a simple thing,</v>

1668
01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:48.290
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nested.</v>

1669
01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.480
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a subset of the university that's a</v>

1670
01:28:50.481 --> 01:28:52.850
<v Speaker 4>subset of society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a subset of your life.</v>

1671
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:58.030
<v Speaker 4>The room is a complicated thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to figure out where you should be </v>

1672
01:28:58.030 --> 01:29:01.601
<v Speaker 4>in the room and you can't do that shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>surely with perception because all you </v>

1673
01:29:01.601 --> 01:29:03.720
<v Speaker 4>see is me and some of the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1674
01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.370
<v Speaker 4>It's got this little narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this little narrow portal,</v>

1675
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:12.120
<v Speaker 4>and so you can't really rely on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>perceptions to Orient you,</v>

1676
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.690
<v Speaker 4>but you do Orient Yourself and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you do is you.</v>

1677
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:18.000
<v Speaker 4>It's engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1678
01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.030
<v Speaker 4>does this seem meaningful and deep and </v>
<v Speaker 4>engaging?</v>

1679
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.120
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it's an indication that it's </v>

1680
01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.211
<v Speaker 4>serving multiple masters simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so both maybe both socially and also </v>

1681
01:29:30.061 --> 01:29:35.061
<v Speaker 4>temporarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I think the sense of meaning is </v>

1682
01:29:35.061 --> 01:29:37.380
<v Speaker 4>actually an instinct that orients people</v>
<v Speaker 4>in time and space.</v>

1683
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:42.560
<v Speaker 4>It's not an EPA phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most fundamental form of </v>

1684
01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.651
<v Speaker 4>perception and that's the only </v>
<v Speaker 4>optimistic thought that I've ever been </v>

1685
01:29:45.651 --> 01:29:48.090
<v Speaker 4>able to derive from psychology is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that actually could be true.</v>

1686
01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:53.091
<v Speaker 4>It could be that the sense of meaning is</v>
<v Speaker 4>an orienting reflex and that would be </v>

1687
01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:55.830
<v Speaker 4>wonderful if it was true because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>would make it real,</v>

1688
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's one of the,</v>

1689
01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:03.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one of the devastating elements of </v>

1690
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.350
<v Speaker 4>nihilism is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1691
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:07.791
<v Speaker 4>who the hell cares what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what differences are going to make in a </v>

1692
01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:07.791
<v Speaker 4>million years?</v>

1693
01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:07.791
<v Speaker 4>It's like your sense of meaning is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>an illusion.</v>

1694
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1695
01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:12.960
<v Speaker 4>you're limited creature in a limited </v>
<v Speaker 4>place and nothing you do really matters.</v>

1696
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:17.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's a powerful argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're an objective </v>

1697
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:19.410
<v Speaker 4>materialist in a reductionist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a killer argument,</v>

1698
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:24.830
<v Speaker 4>but it looks to me like it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually wrong because meaning </v>

1699
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:26.190
<v Speaker 4>looks to me like it's an actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomenon.</v>

1700
01:30:26.191 --> 01:30:30.650
<v Speaker 4>It does say that you're positioned </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly between chaos and order,</v>

1701
01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:33.510
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a real so.</v>

1702
01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.390
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'll see.</v>

1703
01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:40.470
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna develop that argument </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if,</v>

1704
01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:46.220
<v Speaker 4>if it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to know that because it gives </v>

1705
01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:46.220
<v Speaker 4>you something to stand on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1706
01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:48.210
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's as real as pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not pain.</v>

1707
01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:51.840
<v Speaker 4>It's something positive and you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>something positive that you can rely on.</v>

1708
01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:57.380
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're concentrating now on the </v>

1709
01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:59.550
<v Speaker 4>unpredicted outcome or the undesired </v>
<v Speaker 4>outcome because we said,</v>

1710
01:30:59.551 --> 01:31:00.570
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like a portal.</v>

1711
01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:06.200
<v Speaker 4>It's a portal through which doubt can </v>
<v Speaker 4>pour and it's the thing that makes the </v>

1712
01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.560
<v Speaker 4>irrelevant relevant to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why I use this little </v>

1713
01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.350
<v Speaker 4>diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1714
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:11.720
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

1715
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:16.910
<v Speaker 4>that's a fear face roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I put all those stripes on it to </v>

1716
01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:22.431
<v Speaker 4>indicate that it's not just fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's preparation for all sorts of </v>

1717
01:31:22.431 --> 01:31:26.901
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for all sorts of different perceptions </v>

1718
01:31:26.901 --> 01:31:28.250
<v Speaker 4>and all sorts of different motivational </v>
<v Speaker 4>states.</v>

1719
01:31:28.251 --> 01:31:32.580
<v Speaker 4>So imagine what happens when something </v>
<v Speaker 4>knocks you back on your heels.</v>

1720
01:31:32.581 --> 01:31:34.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like not only does your body </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepare,</v>

1721
01:31:34.441 --> 01:31:37.200
<v Speaker 4>but simultaneously with all of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>preparation,</v>

1722
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:39.410
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of fantasies are generated </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1723
01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.790
<v Speaker 4>and what they are is all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>alternative worlds.</v>

1724
01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:45.990
<v Speaker 4>Well why did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go back into your past and you say,</v>

1725
01:31:45.991 --> 01:31:46.710
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's one route.</v>

1726
01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:47.270
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's another.</v>

1727
01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:48.420
<v Speaker 4>Here's another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's another.</v>

1728
01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:51.090
<v Speaker 4>Here's another route,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't know what I did wrong.</v>

1729
01:31:51.090 --> 01:31:56.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what anybody did wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something back there that </v>

1730
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.820
<v Speaker 4>someone did wrong and he can take people</v>
<v Speaker 4>years to sort that out,</v>

1731
01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.100
<v Speaker 4>and so those fantasies are all </v>
<v Speaker 4>generated.</v>

1732
01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:01.240
<v Speaker 4>Then the same thing happens with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

1733
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:01.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1734
01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:03.970
<v Speaker 4>what does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1735
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.000
<v Speaker 4>it could mean this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could mean that it could be not </v>

1736
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:09.000
<v Speaker 4>getting divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could mean I'm losing my house.</v>

1737
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:09.310
<v Speaker 4>It could mean I'll never talk to my kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1738
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.440
<v Speaker 4>It could mean that my career is going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>collapse,</v>

1739
01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe I'll get,</v>

1740
01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.770
<v Speaker 4>be able to get out of this stupid job </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've always hated.</v>

1741
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:17.440
<v Speaker 4>Something better will happen all at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same time.</v>

1742
01:32:18.010 --> 01:32:20.500
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the response to a normally.</v>

1743
01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:26.310
<v Speaker 4>And the reason you respond that way is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're no longer where you </v>

1744
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.310
<v Speaker 4>thought you were.</v>

1745
01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:37.460
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a simple way of looking at </v>

1746
01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:37.460
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>

1747
01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:39.300
<v Speaker 4>what does an unpredicted or anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 4>event mean?</v>

1748
01:32:39.301 --> 01:32:42.780
<v Speaker 4>And I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is maybe the most important thing,</v>

1749
01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:47.960
<v Speaker 4>the most important theme of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>class might be what does an unpredicted </v>

1750
01:32:48.031 --> 01:32:53.031
<v Speaker 4>or undesired outcome mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that would be equally </v>

1751
01:32:53.031 --> 01:32:53.850
<v Speaker 4>important is what should you do about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

1752
01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:57.240
<v Speaker 4>But we'll start with what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is,</v>

1753
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:58.530
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what it means.</v>

1754
01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:01.650
<v Speaker 4>It could mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a strange category,</v>

1755
01:33:01.651 --> 01:33:06.651
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The category of the normalist events </v>

1756
01:33:06.651 --> 01:33:08.580
<v Speaker 4>contains indefinite possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what the hell do you do about that?</v>

1757
01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:10.770
<v Speaker 4>While you prepare to do a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1758
01:33:10.771 --> 01:33:12.270
<v Speaker 4>you can simplify it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1759
01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:17.630
<v Speaker 4>it's half threat because something bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>might happen and it's half promise </v>

1760
01:33:17.701 --> 01:33:19.980
<v Speaker 4>because something good might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1761
01:33:19.981 --> 01:33:21.340
<v Speaker 4>So that's a good way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1762
01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:23.310
<v Speaker 4>It's a portal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden,</v>

1763
01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:26.250
<v Speaker 4>instead of the thing being irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is ambivalent.</v>

1764
01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:30.180
<v Speaker 4>It contains some slice of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>meanings,</v>

1765
01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:31.680
<v Speaker 4>positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1766
01:33:31.681 --> 01:33:35.010
<v Speaker 4>So you're trying to sort that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's partly why it's so stressful to.</v>

1767
01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:38.220
<v Speaker 4>And anger is a good response to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because anger is partly.</v>

1768
01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:42.390
<v Speaker 4>It's partly an advanced emotion because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got a positive emotion element,</v>

1769
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:44.430
<v Speaker 4>which is why anger can be righteous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1770
01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:48.270
<v Speaker 4>but it's got a negative element to it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative emotion and positive emotion at</v>

1771
01:33:48.271 --> 01:33:49.890
<v Speaker 4>the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same time.</v>

1772
01:33:49.891 --> 01:33:52.350
<v Speaker 4>So it's like the canonical stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion.</v>

1773
01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:54.840
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's very hard on people.</v>

1774
01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.960
<v Speaker 4>Anger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very cycle physiologically </v>

1775
01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:02.301
<v Speaker 4>demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I started with that model and then I </v>

1776
01:34:02.301 --> 01:34:03.240
<v Speaker 4>developed it into this model which I </v>
<v Speaker 4>liked better.</v>

1777
01:34:03.241 --> 01:34:08.241
<v Speaker 4>So you're moving from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you haven't seen this because it's not </v>

1778
01:34:08.241 --> 01:34:11.301
<v Speaker 4>in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moving from point a to point B and </v>

1779
01:34:11.301 --> 01:34:12.330
<v Speaker 4>you're using your actions that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>known actions to get there.</v>

1780
01:34:12.330 --> 01:34:13.730
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what happens you,</v>

1781
01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:16.860
<v Speaker 4>you run into an anomaly and it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hole.</v>

1782
01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:22.010
<v Speaker 4>It's a hole through the map.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a whole is burned in it or </v>

1783
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.350
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the maps no longer relevant.</v>

1784
01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:27.620
<v Speaker 4>And so what happens while you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>positive emotion systems are activated </v>

1785
01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:31.490
<v Speaker 4>or disinhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a better way of thinking about </v>

1786
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:33.801
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your negative emotion systems are </v>

1787
01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:33.801
<v Speaker 4>disinhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what might those be?</v>

1788
01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:38.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in positive emotion you have hope and </v>

1789
01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:39.210
<v Speaker 4>interest in exhilaration and curiosity </v>
<v Speaker 4>and confidence.</v>

1790
01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.600
<v Speaker 4>And in the negative emotional space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have anxiety and fear and hurt and </v>

1791
01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.290
<v Speaker 4>anger and guilt and shame and </v>
<v Speaker 4>disappointment in disgust,</v>

1792
01:34:46.291 --> 01:34:51.291
<v Speaker 4>like there's quite a stacking of </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotions and you don't know which of </v>

1793
01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:54.291
<v Speaker 4>those is going to be useful and relevant</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it all emerges at the same time.</v>

1794
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:57.000
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1795
01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:01.940
<v Speaker 4>the questions that was being bagged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say by this discussion,</v>

1796
01:35:01.941 --> 01:35:06.941
<v Speaker 4>was the idea of the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 4>these frames of reference to one </v>

1797
01:35:06.941 --> 01:35:11.741
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to describe that relationship </v>

1798
01:35:11.741 --> 01:35:16.360
<v Speaker 4>because one of the things that I want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>describe to you is how you determine how</v>

1799
01:35:16.881 --> 01:35:18.690
<v Speaker 4>upset you should be when something </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal.</v>

1800
01:35:18.691 --> 01:35:21.770
<v Speaker 4>This happens because it's really hard to</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out.</v>

1801
01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.420
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because,</v>

1802
01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:28.660
<v Speaker 4>well you see this often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're unsophisticated in </v>

1803
01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:29.480
<v Speaker 4>dispute settlement with an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>partner,</v>

1804
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:34.990
<v Speaker 4>every little bump and the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the potential disillusion of the </v>

1805
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:36.200
<v Speaker 4>entire relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's actually why people get married,</v>

1806
01:35:36.201 --> 01:35:37.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just so you know,</v>

1807
01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:44.980
<v Speaker 4>because this is built into marital vows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not leaving ever no matter what.</v>

1808
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.200
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1809
01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 4>well that definitely puts a boundary </v>
<v Speaker 4>around our arguments,</v>

1810
01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:55.780
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I can't say every time you </v>

1811
01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:58.121
<v Speaker 4>manifest one of your flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you're likely to do just as often </v>

1812
01:35:58.121 --> 01:35:58.670
<v Speaker 4>as me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well enough of this,</v>

1813
01:35:58.940 --> 01:35:59.930
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's horrible,</v>

1814
01:35:59.931 --> 01:36:04.931
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your whole life is while every time </v>

1815
01:36:04.931 --> 01:36:04.931
<v Speaker 4>you get out of line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm out of here.</v>

1816
01:36:04.931 --> 01:36:05.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the hell are you?</v>

1817
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:10.450
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to admit to ever doing </v>

1818
01:36:10.450 --> 01:36:10.450
<v Speaker 4>anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Second,</v>

1819
01:36:10.450 --> 01:36:12.340
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be on your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1820
01:36:12.370 --> 01:36:13.670
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a scared cat.</v>

1821
01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:16.160
<v Speaker 4>The entire relationship because well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

1822
01:36:16.161 --> 01:36:17.930
<v Speaker 4>It could just come to an end at any </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

1823
01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:19.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1824
01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:20.240
<v Speaker 4>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1825
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.150
<v Speaker 4>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the possibility of divorce is open,</v>

1826
01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:24.650
<v Speaker 4>it makes you free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1827
01:36:24.651 --> 01:36:25.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you want.</v>

1828
01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:27.140
<v Speaker 4>You want to be free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A really,</v>

1829
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:30.440
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can't predict anything.</v>

1830
01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:34.130
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a vow and it says,</v>

1831
01:36:34.131 --> 01:36:39.131
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that your trouble me too,</v>

1832
01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:43.970
<v Speaker 4>so we won't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter what happens.</v>

1833
01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.530
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a hell of a vowel,</v>

1834
01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:50.531
<v Speaker 4>but that's why it's about right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you take it in front of a </v>

1835
01:36:50.531 --> 01:36:52.961
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's supposed to be a sacred </v>

1836
01:36:52.961 --> 01:36:52.961
<v Speaker 4>act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1837
01:36:52.961 --> 01:36:53.780
<v Speaker 4>what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the alternative?</v>

1838
01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Everything is mutable and changeable at </v>
<v Speaker 4>any moment.</v>

1839
01:36:57.710 --> 01:36:58.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>

1840
01:36:58.341 --> 01:36:59.060
<v Speaker 4>You liver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your liver,</v>

1841
01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:01.940
<v Speaker 4>your life like that and see what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you're 50 Jesus.</v>

1842
01:37:01.941 --> 01:37:03.920
<v Speaker 4>It's dismal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two or three divorces.</v>

1843
01:37:03.921 --> 01:37:07.010
<v Speaker 4>Your family's fragmented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got no continuity of narrative.</v>

1844
01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.260
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not good for the kids,</v>

1845
01:37:09.261 --> 01:37:14.261
<v Speaker 4>not by any stretch of the imagination </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it's a form of voluntary </v>

1846
01:37:14.901 --> 01:37:18.530
<v Speaker 4>enslavement I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also equivalent to the adoption</v>

1847
01:37:18.531 --> 01:37:20.720
<v Speaker 4>of a responsibility and there's more to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it than that.</v>

1848
01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:23.750
<v Speaker 4>If you can't run away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can solve your problems because</v>

1849
01:37:23.751 --> 01:37:24.500
<v Speaker 4>it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1850
01:37:24.501 --> 01:37:28.460
<v Speaker 4>well I'm stuck with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so how about we fix things</v>

1851
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.000
<v Speaker 4>because the alternative is we're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be in a boxing match for the next 40 </v>

1852
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:35.160
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the alternative.</v>

1853
01:37:35.610 --> 01:37:40.610
<v Speaker 4>So and you think you're going to fix </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems without something like that </v>

1854
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:41.490
<v Speaker 4>hanging over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There isn't a chance.</v>

1855
01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:43.530
<v Speaker 4>You'll just avoid them because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what people do.</v>

1856
01:37:43.531 --> 01:37:45.420
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To solve problems,</v>

1857
01:37:45.421 --> 01:37:48.270
<v Speaker 4>especially in relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're having a fight and I find out that</v>

1858
01:37:48.271 --> 01:37:53.271
<v Speaker 4>it's because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were abused by your uncle when you </v>

1859
01:37:53.271 --> 01:37:53.310
<v Speaker 4>were five or some God damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1860
01:37:53.311 --> 01:37:58.311
<v Speaker 4>it's like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very to third sort of thing </v>

1861
01:37:58.311 --> 01:37:58.311
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1862
01:37:58.311 --> 01:38:01.980
<v Speaker 4>there's the partner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your partner's manifesting some weird </v>

1863
01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.541
<v Speaker 4>anomalous behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just can't make heads or tails of </v>

1864
01:38:05.541 --> 01:38:05.541
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't seem related to what you're</v>

1865
01:38:05.541 --> 01:38:07.170
<v Speaker 4>doing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to talk about it.</v>

1866
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:09.630
<v Speaker 4>And so as soon as you bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get mad.</v>

1867
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:10.800
<v Speaker 4>Then you bring it up again.</v>

1868
01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.920
<v Speaker 4>They even get mad or and they tell you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're not going to talk about that</v>

1869
01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:16.350
<v Speaker 4>or they're going to leave and so maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>you really,</v>

1870
01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:21.351
<v Speaker 4>really persistent because you're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a son of a bitch and then they break </v>

1871
01:38:21.351 --> 01:38:21.600
<v Speaker 4>down and cry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1872
01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:26.660
<v Speaker 4>and then they have this horrible memory </v>
<v Speaker 4>that comes flooding forward that's </v>

1873
01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:30.411
<v Speaker 4>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what to do with it and </v>

1874
01:38:30.411 --> 01:38:30.411
<v Speaker 4>then you have to sort it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1875
01:38:30.411 --> 01:38:31.560
<v Speaker 4>you think you're going to do that unless</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a good reason.</v>

1876
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:37.310
<v Speaker 4>You have to know we better start this </v>
<v Speaker 4>out or we're going to be carrying it </v>

1877
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:38.550
<v Speaker 4>around for the next 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That may be is enough motivation,</v>

1878
01:38:38.551 --> 01:38:40.860
<v Speaker 4>so you'll actually try hard to solve a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

1879
01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:43.920
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot easier to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well sorry,</v>

1880
01:38:43.921 --> 01:38:45.820
<v Speaker 4>we're not going there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then good.</v>

1881
01:38:45.821 --> 01:38:47.640
<v Speaker 4>And you'll have it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every day,</v>

1882
01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:49.650
<v Speaker 4>every God damn day for the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1883
01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.300
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to this.</v>

1884
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:59.840
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what's the relationship between your </v>

1885
01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.450
<v Speaker 4>frames of reference?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1886
01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:01.500
<v Speaker 4>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can.</v>

1887
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:03.870
<v Speaker 4>Well we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do it this way.</v>

1888
01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if I can think of a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a good example.</v>

1889
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Why did you get up this morning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1890
01:39:13.791 --> 01:39:18.791
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you want to come to class this </v>

1891
01:39:21.541 --> 01:39:22.650
<v Speaker 2>class?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1892
01:39:22.651 --> 01:39:24.360
<v Speaker 2>so why do you want to come?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a serious question.</v>

1893
01:39:24.361 --> 01:39:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Why did you want to come to class?</v>

1894
01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:30.200
<v Speaker 1>To get the knowledge that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1895
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:33.730
<v Speaker 1>That is something I'm going to be tested</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1896
01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1897
01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any reason other than the </v>

1898
01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:43.001
<v Speaker 2>testing that you came to class?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

1899
01:39:44.491 --> 01:39:46.050
<v Speaker 2>You can start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a trap.</v>

1900
01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:48.750
<v Speaker 2>You can say whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just sitting there just they're just</v>

1901
01:39:48.751 --> 01:39:53.751
<v Speaker 2>straight questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1902
01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:01.310
<v Speaker 2>So let's say no for the time being or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not for reasons that you can immediately</v>

1903
01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.380
<v Speaker 2>bring to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1904
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Why does the test matter?</v>

1905
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:07.270
<v Speaker 1>For the degree?</v>

1906
01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does,</v>

1907
01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:11.280
<v Speaker 2>why do you care about the degree?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To get a job.</v>

1908
01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whose decision was it that you took?</v>

1909
01:40:14.281 --> 01:40:17.460
<v Speaker 2>The degree that you're taking your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1910
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Did your parents have any influence on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1911
01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:20.890
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No?</v>

1912
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1913
01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:24.270
<v Speaker 2>What job are you after?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychology,</v>

1914
01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.390
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinical clinical psychologist.</v>

1915
01:40:27.391 --> 01:40:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want to do that again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

1916
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:33.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna question you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until you run out of answers,</v>

1917
01:40:33.241 --> 01:40:35.370
<v Speaker 2>you will run out of answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if this is the time,</v>

1918
01:40:35.371 --> 01:40:36.420
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want to.</v>

1919
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to do clinical psychology to</v>
<v Speaker 2>help people?</v>

1920
01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:40.950
<v Speaker 2>To help people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1921
01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that more important to you than </v>

1922
01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:46.040
<v Speaker 2>making money?</v>

1923
01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Because it helps me in interact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it sort of makes me happy to see </v>

1924
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>other people get over</v>

1925
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.310
<v Speaker 4>their pro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1926
01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1927
01:40:56.111 --> 01:40:56.710
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1928
01:40:56.770 --> 01:40:59.830
<v Speaker 4>Well that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had lots of answers so sometimes you</v>

1929
01:40:59.831 --> 01:41:02.140
<v Speaker 4>can run people out of answers with about</v>
<v Speaker 4>three questions.</v>

1930
01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:03.350
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>

1931
01:41:03.370 --> 01:41:08.370
<v Speaker 4>So small action perception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nested in larger action perception,</v>

1932
01:41:10.001 --> 01:41:13.650
<v Speaker 4>nested in larger action perception all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way out to well,</v>

1933
01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:15.370
<v Speaker 4>until you run out of answers </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally,</v>

1934
01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1935
01:41:16.241 --> 01:41:19.390
<v Speaker 4>and that's where it's at the edge where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you run out of answers,</v>

1936
01:41:19.391 --> 01:41:23.680
<v Speaker 4>that's where metaphysics takes over </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's not an irrational domain</v>

1937
01:41:23.681 --> 01:41:28.681
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in a metaphysical domain at that </v>

1938
01:41:28.681 --> 01:41:30.661
<v Speaker 4>point and so you have implicit </v>
<v Speaker 4>assumptions that you don't even know </v>

1939
01:41:30.661 --> 01:41:31.420
<v Speaker 4>about that are working on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the fringes.</v>

1940
01:41:31.690 --> 01:41:33.250
<v Speaker 4>And we'll talk about that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1941
01:41:33.251 --> 01:41:37.600
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then we can take a category like,</v>

1942
01:41:39.210 --> 01:41:39.450
<v Speaker 5>hmm,</v>

1943
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:45.250
<v Speaker 4>we'll do a micro analysis the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're at home and you're tickling </v>

1944
01:41:45.501 --> 01:41:46.940
<v Speaker 4>the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>

1945
01:41:46.941 --> 01:41:49.010
<v Speaker 4>So we'll note first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not an abstraction,</v>

1946
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:51.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an actual baby and you're moving</v>

1947
01:41:51.321 --> 01:41:56.321
<v Speaker 4>your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's not just an abstract </v>

1948
01:41:56.321 --> 01:41:58.820
<v Speaker 4>conceptualization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also where your consciousness ends.</v>

1949
01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:01.610
<v Speaker 4>You're tickling the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't know how you're doing it.</v>

1950
01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:06.640
<v Speaker 4>You don't know the musculature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know how to manipulate the </v>

1951
01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.190
<v Speaker 4>little organs and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just do it.</v>

1952
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:12.310
<v Speaker 4>So Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're out of the perceptual domain at </v>

1953
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.860
<v Speaker 4>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It grounds out in voluntary action.</v>

1954
01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:14.810
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're tickling the baby.</v>

1955
01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:20.500
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing when you're tickling </v>
<v Speaker 4>the baby while you're making the baby </v>

1956
01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:20.500
<v Speaker 4>laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1957
01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:20.750
<v Speaker 4>that's one way you're playing with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>baby.</v>

1958
01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fine.</v>

1959
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:26.870
<v Speaker 4>That's a subset of the activity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Play with baby and you can play peekaboo</v>

1960
01:42:26.871 --> 01:42:27.530
<v Speaker 4>with the baby.</v>

1961
01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:32.530
<v Speaker 4>You can tickle the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can clean the baby and all of that </v>

1962
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:32.750
<v Speaker 4>can be part of playing and you might </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1963
01:42:32.751 --> 01:42:37.751
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing when you're playing </v>

1964
01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:37.751
<v Speaker 4>with a baby?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you'd say,</v>

1965
01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:38.000
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking care of my family and fine,</v>

1966
01:42:38.001 --> 01:42:39.710
<v Speaker 4>and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what?</v>

1967
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:41.750
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing when you're taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>care of your family?</v>

1968
01:42:41.751 --> 01:42:42.410
<v Speaker 4>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1969
01:42:42.411 --> 01:42:44.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm being a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you might say,</v>

1970
01:42:44.901 --> 01:42:46.820
<v Speaker 4>well what am I doing when I'm being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good parent?</v>

1971
01:42:46.821 --> 01:42:47.390
<v Speaker 4>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1972
01:42:47.391 --> 01:42:50.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm being a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you could say,</v>

1973
01:42:50.031 --> 01:42:52.940
<v Speaker 4>well why should you be a good person?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we won't go any farther than that.</v>

1974
01:42:52.941 --> 01:42:54.740
<v Speaker 4>It's of because you can see that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of the.</v>

1975
01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:57.680
<v Speaker 4>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an ultimate level of abstraction.</v>

1976
01:42:58.550 --> 01:43:00.200
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you could.</v>

1977
01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:03.080
<v Speaker 4>What do you do if someone comes up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and you're tickling the baby and you</v>

1978
01:43:03.081 --> 01:43:03.410
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1979
01:43:03.411 --> 01:43:05.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm being a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ask,</v>

1980
01:43:05.210 --> 01:43:06.710
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm being a good person.</v>

1981
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:11.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's a bit disjointed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't what the person would expect </v>

1982
01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:14.180
<v Speaker 4>as an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They expect something more local,</v>

1983
01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:19.420
<v Speaker 4>but it's still true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what's interesting is that when </v>

1984
01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:20.990
<v Speaker 4>you're doing something that's</v>

1985
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:24.080
<v Speaker 5>what.</v>

1986
01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:25.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say worthwhile.</v>

1987
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:28.140
<v Speaker 4>That's probably the right way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it.</v>

1988
01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:33.380
<v Speaker 4>You're doing a whole bunch of things </v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously and you're not really </v>

1989
01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.770
<v Speaker 4>aware of all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you are in some sense,</v>

1990
01:43:34.771 --> 01:43:35.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if the person,</v>

1991
01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:41.300
<v Speaker 4>someone might come along and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what kind of idiot tickles a baby </v>

1992
01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:41.300
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1993
01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:42.870
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have they said?</v>

1994
01:43:43.170 --> 01:43:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Well they've kind of nailed you here </v>
<v Speaker 4>down on the micro tickle level,</v>

1995
01:43:46.770 --> 01:43:48.000
<v Speaker 4>but there are sort of also</v>

1996
01:43:49.410 --> 01:43:53.000
<v Speaker 4>taking a pretty good crack at this high </v>
<v Speaker 4>level system as well now.</v>

1997
01:43:53.170 --> 01:43:54.710
<v Speaker 4>And that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say,</v>

1998
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:57.740
<v Speaker 4>well good parent is a subset of being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good person,</v>

1999
01:43:57.741 --> 01:44:01.730
<v Speaker 4>but there's all sorts of other baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be a good partner.</v>

2000
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:06.290
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you have to be a good daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you have to be a good nice,</v>

2001
01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.780
<v Speaker 4>you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2002
01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:14.560
<v Speaker 4>your ability to function as a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>person is composed of a very large </v>

2003
01:44:14.631 --> 01:44:17.150
<v Speaker 4>number of hierarchically nested </v>
<v Speaker 4>subsystems.</v>

2004
01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:20.750
<v Speaker 4>And so when the person goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only an idiot would tickle the baby like</v>

2005
01:44:20.751 --> 01:44:22.850
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they go after that.</v>

2006
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.690
<v Speaker 4>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2007
01:44:23.691 --> 01:44:26.940
<v Speaker 4>how upset you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should you get an answer is well,</v>

2008
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:28.910
<v Speaker 4>how valid do you think their complaint </v>
<v Speaker 4>is?</v>

2009
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:32.360
<v Speaker 4>So let's say maybe it only an idiot </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't take all the baby like that and</v>

2010
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:35.450
<v Speaker 4>you happened to be that idiot and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe you're not a good person.</v>

2011
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:40.450
<v Speaker 4>And so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means that the map that consists of </v>

2012
01:44:40.450 --> 01:44:42.620
<v Speaker 4>all these nested subsistence has now </v>
<v Speaker 4>become unreliable.</v>

2013
01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.740
<v Speaker 4>And so how upset are you going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that?</v>

2014
01:44:45.741 --> 01:44:46.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2015
01:44:46.281 --> 01:44:51.281
<v Speaker 4>maybe you had a bad day at work and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're kind of hypoglycemic and you had </v>

2016
01:44:51.281 --> 01:44:51.281
<v Speaker 4>too much to drink the night before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so someone says,</v>

2017
01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:53.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not how you take a baby.</v>

2018
01:44:53.151 --> 01:44:55.520
<v Speaker 4>You idiot and you cry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2019
01:44:55.521 --> 01:44:57.080
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2020
01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:01.730
<v Speaker 4>it's a pretty high level blow and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the sort of thing you want to do if</v>

2021
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:03.230
<v Speaker 4>you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to hurt someone,</v>

2022
01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:08.260
<v Speaker 4>it's not a good way to teach someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you teach them down at the </v>

2023
01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:08.660
<v Speaker 4>smallest possible level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The micro,</v>

2024
01:45:08.661 --> 01:45:08.990
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2025
01:45:08.991 --> 01:45:13.991
<v Speaker 4>you don't take all the baby like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tickle a baby like this and you're </v>

2026
01:45:13.991 --> 01:45:16.460
<v Speaker 4>doing a good job on everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're going to tickle the baby,</v>

2027
01:45:16.461 --> 01:45:18.170
<v Speaker 4>this is how you go about it and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>person thinks,</v>

2028
01:45:18.171 --> 01:45:18.710
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2029
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:22.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing a fairly good job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's got this little thing I have to</v>

2030
01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:27.020
<v Speaker 4>work on and maybe I can manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that works and that works and you</v>

2031
01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:29.840
<v Speaker 4>can have some sympathy for the person at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same time because you might say,</v>

2032
01:45:29.841 --> 01:45:31.060
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to take a baby.</v>

2033
01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:32.830
<v Speaker 4>He's like an idiot too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know it's,</v>

2034
01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.150
<v Speaker 4>it's fixable and most of use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2035
01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.870
<v Speaker 4>And that's a nice thing to do when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're arguing with someone.</v>

2036
01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:38.510
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2037
01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:46.820
<v Speaker 4>here's a bunch of things you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>right that are related to this that are </v>

2038
01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.761
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's this small thing that maybe you </v>

2039
01:45:49.761 --> 01:45:50.490
<v Speaker 4>could alter slightly and it would make </v>
<v Speaker 4>me happy and maybe I'll return the favor</v>

2040
01:45:50.491 --> 01:45:54.410
<v Speaker 4>at some point and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well maybe,</v>

2041
01:45:54.810 --> 01:45:59.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll do that maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they practice doing it and you </v>

2042
01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:00.570
<v Speaker 4>can give them a pat on the head and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're both happy about that.</v>

2043
01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:03.930
<v Speaker 4>That really works with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really works.</v>

2044
01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:09.230
<v Speaker 4>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what you see is that these high level</v>

2045
01:46:10.861 --> 01:46:13.620
<v Speaker 4>abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call them ethical abstractions,</v>

2046
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:19.430
<v Speaker 4>are related to actions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're related and so you can see that </v>

2047
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:23.931
<v Speaker 4>relationship from the good person to </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing something like tickle the baby </v>

2048
01:46:23.931 --> 01:46:25.890
<v Speaker 4>properly and then you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can conceptualize it this way,</v>

2049
01:46:25.891 --> 01:46:30.060
<v Speaker 4>that you have this massive overarching </v>
<v Speaker 4>map which is something like the story of</v>

2050
01:46:30.061 --> 01:46:32.880
<v Speaker 4>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including its extension,</v>

2051
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
<v Speaker 4>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it consists of these </v>

2052
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.310
<v Speaker 4>subordinate maps which can be broken </v>
<v Speaker 4>down all the way down to the level of </v>

2053
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:43.971
<v Speaker 4>actions and so then that explains to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>to some degree how you can do the </v>

2054
01:46:43.971 --> 01:46:46.920
<v Speaker 4>impossible job of calibrating your </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotional response.</v>

2055
01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:52.700
<v Speaker 4>Because roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotional response should be </v>

2056
01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:54.510
<v Speaker 4>proportionate to the level that's being </v>
<v Speaker 4>assaulted by the anomaly,</v>

2057
01:46:54.930 --> 01:46:56.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's way up here,</v>

2058
01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:59.850
<v Speaker 4>you wrote your amcap because you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to medical school,</v>

2059
01:46:59.910 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so now the envelope comes and you're</v>

2060
01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:05.430
<v Speaker 4>shaking away and the open ended,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you got 25th percentile,</v>

2061
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:08.040
<v Speaker 4>just like a quarter of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>take the test.</v>

2062
01:47:08.670 --> 01:47:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2063
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:11.160
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2064
01:47:11.850 --> 01:47:14.460
<v Speaker 4>this is all blown to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

2065
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.670
<v Speaker 4>And so God only knows how many of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things are going to go to.</v>

2066
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Maybe your study habits really need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

2067
01:47:20.690 --> 01:47:25.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to reconstitute yourself all </v>

2068
01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:25.690
<v Speaker 4>the way down to the level of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>habits.</v>

2069
01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:26.970
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can be devastating news.</v>

2070
01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:32.150
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the ways to protect yourself </v>

2071
01:47:32.150 --> 01:47:32.160
<v Speaker 4>against something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like don't have one plan,</v>

2072
01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:38.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to stake yourself on </v>

2073
01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:38.120
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should throw a couple of alternative</v>

2074
01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.020
<v Speaker 4>scaffolds up beside you so that you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere to go.</v>

2075
01:47:40.230 --> 01:47:41.940
<v Speaker 4>You want to be a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2076
01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:44.880
<v Speaker 4>well you could be a nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's not a doctor,</v>

2077
01:47:44.881 --> 01:47:49.881
<v Speaker 4>but it needs cutting your throat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're still doing 80 percent of what </v>

2078
01:47:49.881 --> 01:47:54.171
<v Speaker 4>you wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you want to and you want to think </v>

2079
01:47:54.171 --> 01:47:54.171
<v Speaker 4>about this during your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2080
01:47:54.171 --> 01:47:58.311
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to take a high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to scaffold yourself in other </v>

2081
01:47:58.311 --> 01:48:00.150
<v Speaker 4>areas so that if it fails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't bother them,</v>

2082
01:48:00.151 --> 01:48:04.500
<v Speaker 4>doesn't drop out and you die and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>also very much worth thinking about with</v>

2083
01:48:04.501 --> 01:48:06.510
<v Speaker 4>regards to setting up your life in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

2084
01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:11.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you concentrate solely on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your career,</v>

2085
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:17.870
<v Speaker 4>you can get along way in your career and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that that's a strategy that </v>

2086
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:21.360
<v Speaker 4>a minority of men preferentially do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all they do.</v>

2087
01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 4>They worked like 70,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 hours a week.</v>

2088
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.440
<v Speaker 4>They'd go flat out on their career.</v>

2089
01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.680
<v Speaker 4>They're staking everything on the small </v>
<v Speaker 4>probability of exceptional status in a </v>

2090
01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.190
<v Speaker 4>narrow domain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

2091
01:48:32.191 --> 01:48:34.110
<v Speaker 4>It's hard on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have a life.</v>

2092
01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:36.090
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult for them to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>

2093
01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:41.180
<v Speaker 4>They don't know how to take any leisure </v>
<v Speaker 4>activity like they get very one </v>

2094
01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:41.180
<v Speaker 4>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2095
01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:45.140
<v Speaker 4>it may be that that unit dimensionality </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the price you have to pay to be </v>

2096
01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:46.050
<v Speaker 4>exceptional at one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2097
01:48:46.051 --> 01:48:51.051
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're going to be something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a genius level mathematician and </v>

2098
01:48:51.051 --> 01:48:51.960
<v Speaker 4>you want to do that for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or scientists say,</v>

2099
01:48:52.170 --> 01:48:55.200
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're in your lab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in your lab all the time.</v>

2100
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:57.600
<v Speaker 4>You're working 70 hours a week or 80 </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours a week,</v>

2101
01:48:57.630 --> 01:48:59.430
<v Speaker 4>you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dedicated,</v>

2102
01:48:59.431 --> 01:49:04.431
<v Speaker 4>you're unidimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's how you get to beat all the </v>

2103
01:49:04.431 --> 01:49:05.370
<v Speaker 4>other people who are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the only way,</v>

2104
01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:07.410
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is you don't get a life.</v>

2105
01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.800
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you love being a scientist and you </v>

2106
01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:14.160
<v Speaker 4>have that kind of focus of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well first of all,</v>

2107
01:49:14.161 --> 01:49:16.590
<v Speaker 4>you're a rare person and second you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to pay for it,</v>

2108
01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:18.600
<v Speaker 4>but fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More power to you.</v>

2109
01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:21.540
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

2110
01:49:21.541 --> 01:49:24.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a risky business to do that.</v>

2111
01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:26.880
<v Speaker 4>You sacrifice a lot for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2112
01:49:26.881 --> 01:49:31.881
<v Speaker 4>and I would say most often if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking about having a healthy life,</v>

2113
01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:34.860
<v Speaker 4>that isn't what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You spread yourself out more.</v>

2114
01:49:34.861 --> 01:49:36.390
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a family,</v>

2115
01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:41.780
<v Speaker 4>you have some things that you do outside</v>
<v Speaker 4>of work that are meaningful to you and </v>

2116
01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:42.900
<v Speaker 4>useful you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a network of friends,</v>

2117
01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:44.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2118
01:49:44.630 --> 01:49:45.660
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those three things,</v>

2119
01:49:45.661 --> 01:49:47.680
<v Speaker 4>a loaner for things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a loner,</v>

2120
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.980
<v Speaker 4>plenty to keep you well oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if one of those things </v>

2121
01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:52.980
<v Speaker 4>collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2122
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:57.130
<v Speaker 4>everything doesn't go now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The price you pay for that is,</v>

2123
01:49:57.430 --> 01:50:00.070
<v Speaker 4>the more you strive to optimize that </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance,</v>

2124
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:05.310
<v Speaker 4>the less likely you are to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>fantastically successful at any single </v>

2125
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:05.310
<v Speaker 4>one of them.</v>

2126
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:06.310
<v Speaker 4>But you might have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2127
01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:08.770
<v Speaker 4>if you can consider your life as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole,</v>

2128
01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:13.150
<v Speaker 4>that might be a winning strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things Carl Young said,</v>

2129
01:50:13.151 --> 01:50:18.151
<v Speaker 4>I really liked this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought that men went after </v>

2130
01:50:18.151 --> 01:50:20.800
<v Speaker 4>perfection and when women went after </v>
<v Speaker 4>wholeness,</v>

2131
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:24.600
<v Speaker 4>so there are different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're different value there,</v>

2132
01:50:24.670 --> 01:50:29.670
<v Speaker 4>there are different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something different at the top </v>

2133
01:50:29.670 --> 01:50:31.921
<v Speaker 4>of the value hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So perfection would be steak it all on </v>

2134
01:50:31.921 --> 01:50:33.680
<v Speaker 4>one thing and look for radical success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not all,</v>

2135
01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.380
<v Speaker 4>not that all men do that because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

2136
01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.940
<v Speaker 4>But what we're talking about extremes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least with regards to the men that do</v>

2137
01:50:39.941 --> 01:50:42.160
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wholeness ideas more like,</v>

2138
01:50:42.161 --> 01:50:42.890
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>

2139
01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:46.120
<v Speaker 4>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I want one thing in my life to</v>

2140
01:50:46.121 --> 01:50:51.121
<v Speaker 4>be 150 percent or I want five things in </v>
<v Speaker 4>my life to be 80 percent.</v>

2141
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:58.330
<v Speaker 4>Well there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot more richness in a life </v>

2142
01:50:58.330 --> 01:50:59.120
<v Speaker 4>where you have five things operating at </v>
<v Speaker 4>80 percent,</v>

2143
01:50:59.121 --> 01:51:02.510
<v Speaker 4>but you're not operating in any at any </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them at 150 percent.</v>

2144
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:08.050
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I really believe this because I've </v>

2145
01:51:08.050 --> 01:51:10.241
<v Speaker 4>watched men and women go through their </v>
<v Speaker 4>careers now for a long period of time </v>

2146
01:51:10.241 --> 01:51:13.571
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of things that produced </v>

2147
01:51:13.571 --> 01:51:17.531
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things that I've noticed </v>

2148
01:51:17.531 --> 01:51:20.531
<v Speaker 4>is that mostly women in their thirties </v>
<v Speaker 4>bear bail out of unit dimensional </v>

2149
01:51:20.531 --> 01:51:21.260
<v Speaker 4>careers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They won't do them.</v>

2150
01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:26.920
<v Speaker 4>They won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They won't put in the 80 hours a week </v>

2151
01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:29.030
<v Speaker 4>that they would have to put in in order </v>
<v Speaker 4>to dominate that particular area.</v>

2152
01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:34.180
<v Speaker 4>And it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that they won't do it is </v>

2153
01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:36.431
<v Speaker 4>because they decide it's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And no wonder because why would that be </v>

2154
01:51:36.431 --> 01:51:38.570
<v Speaker 4>worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to ask yourself that.</v>

2155
01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:39.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2156
01:51:39.711 --> 01:51:41.330
<v Speaker 4>you want to be an outstanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists.</v>

2157
01:51:41.331 --> 01:51:42.020
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2158
01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:45.350
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really that's what you want because that</v>

2159
01:51:45.351 --> 01:51:46.790
<v Speaker 4>means that's what you do</v>

2160
01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.680
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're competing with other people,</v>

2161
01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:50.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're smart,</v>

2162
01:51:50.761 --> 01:51:53.070
<v Speaker 4>they're hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you want to be at the top,</v>

2163
01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:55.620
<v Speaker 4>you have to be smarter and work harder </v>
<v Speaker 4>than any of them.</v>

2164
01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:58.140
<v Speaker 4>And working hard means working long </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

2165
01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:02.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean it also means working diligently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the final analysis,</v>

2166
01:52:02.611 --> 01:52:07.611
<v Speaker 4>it's also an additive issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'm smart and hardworking and I can </v>

2167
01:52:07.611 --> 01:52:10.050
<v Speaker 4>crank out for 70 hours a week and you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it for 30,</v>

2168
01:52:10.370 --> 01:52:12.540
<v Speaker 4>it's like in two years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so far ahead of you.</v>

2169
01:52:12.541 --> 01:52:17.250
<v Speaker 4>You will never ever catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways.</v>

2170
01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:22.540
<v Speaker 4>And I think partly maybe part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason too that women are oriented that </v>

2171
01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:22.570
<v Speaker 4>way more than men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's two reasons.</v>

2172
01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:26.590
<v Speaker 4>One is socioeconomic status does not </v>
<v Speaker 4>make women more attractive on the mating</v>

2173
01:52:26.610 --> 01:52:28.590
<v Speaker 4>market,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it does make men more attractive.</v>

2174
01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:31.290
<v Speaker 4>And the second is women's timeframe is </v>
<v Speaker 4>compressed,</v>

2175
01:52:32.130 --> 01:52:33.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because guys can always say,</v>

2176
01:52:33.301 --> 01:52:38.301
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll have kids later and they can say </v>

2177
01:52:38.301 --> 01:52:38.301
<v Speaker 4>that until they're like 80.</v>

2178
01:52:38.301 --> 01:52:38.301
<v Speaker 4>Whereas women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2179
01:52:38.301 --> 01:52:38.940
<v Speaker 4>no way man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta get it.</v>

2180
01:52:38.970 --> 01:52:40.560
<v Speaker 4>You gotta get it together by the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2181
01:52:40.650 --> 01:52:43.140
<v Speaker 4>let's say 40,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but really probably by 35,</v>

2182
01:52:43.141 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 4>but definitely by 40 because it ain't </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

2183
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:51.430
<v Speaker 4>And that's bloody dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the most unhappy people you ever </v>

2184
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:52.190
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2185
01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:58.840
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the common roots to extreme </v>

2186
01:52:58.840 --> 01:52:59.300
<v Speaker 4>unhappiness is to want children and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the.</v>

2187
01:52:59.390 --> 01:53:01.460
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't recommend that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2188
01:53:01.461 --> 01:53:03.020
<v Speaker 4>you see couples who were in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>thirties,</v>

2189
01:53:03.021 --> 01:53:07.370
<v Speaker 4>one couple in three over the age of 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>has fertility problems that's defined as</v>

2190
01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:11.330
<v Speaker 4>an inability to conceive after one year </v>
<v Speaker 4>of trying one in three.</v>

2191
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:14.270
<v Speaker 4>So it's worth thinking about because </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are very,</v>

2192
01:53:14.271 --> 01:53:16.850
<v Speaker 4>very unhappy if they want to have kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they can't,</v>

2193
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:19.040
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the medical mill for 10 years,</v>

2194
01:53:19.041 --> 01:53:20.810
<v Speaker 4>if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's what happens to you.</v>

2195
01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:22.160
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2196
01:53:22.161 --> 01:53:23.450
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to this.</v>

2197
01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I think what I'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what time it is,</v>

2198
01:53:30.251 --> 01:53:33.720
<v Speaker 4>it is it because I'd have to open up </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole new can of worms,</v>

2199
01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:35.850
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do the next part.</v>

2200
01:53:35.851 --> 01:53:40.851
<v Speaker 4>So I think actually what I'm going to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just recap what we did and then stop </v>

2201
01:53:40.851 --> 01:53:42.990
<v Speaker 4>or maybe we can have some questions or </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we can call it an early day.</v>

2202
01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:44.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what,</v>

2203
01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:49.050
<v Speaker 4>what is the fundamental issue here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did we discuss today?</v>

2204
01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:54.440
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're in a frame and we've laid out </v>

2205
01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:55.150
<v Speaker 4>its characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has a goal in it,</v>

2206
01:53:55.151 --> 01:53:58.620
<v Speaker 4>it has a current position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has rules for operating within it.</v>

2207
01:53:59.390 --> 01:54:04.390
<v Speaker 4>It governs your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really critical thing to </v>

2208
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:05.730
<v Speaker 4>understand and we're all governing your </v>
<v Speaker 4>perceptions.</v>

2209
01:54:05.731 --> 01:54:10.731
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tells you what's useful to you and </v>

2210
01:54:10.731 --> 01:54:10.731
<v Speaker 4>what gets in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most importantly,</v>

2211
01:54:10.731 --> 01:54:11.220
<v Speaker 4>it tells you what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to pay attention to it.</v>

2212
01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:13.290
<v Speaker 4>So as long as your damn frame is </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional,</v>

2213
01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:18.470
<v Speaker 4>you can ignore most of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that means your stress level is way </v>

2214
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:19.110
<v Speaker 4>lower than it would normally be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2215
01:54:19.410 --> 01:54:21.360
<v Speaker 4>So perception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation,</v>

2216
01:54:21.361 --> 01:54:23.250
<v Speaker 4>all of that's integrated into those </v>
<v Speaker 4>frames.</v>

2217
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:28.550
<v Speaker 4>And then the emotional element comes out</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that with you when you're within a </v>

2218
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:32.031
<v Speaker 4>frame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that move you forward and </v>

2219
01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:34.761
<v Speaker 4>validate the framer positive and things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that get in your way and invalidate the </v>

2220
01:54:34.761 --> 01:54:35.850
<v Speaker 4>frame are negative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the next issue is,</v>

2221
01:54:35.851 --> 01:54:39.030
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your frame is invalidated,</v>

2222
01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:44.120
<v Speaker 4>exactly what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can't answer that without </v>

2223
01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:44.580
<v Speaker 4>thinking about the hierarchy of frames </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you're lucky,</v>

2224
01:54:44.581 --> 01:54:49.581
<v Speaker 4>it just means your frame needs a minor </v>
<v Speaker 4>alteration that would be equivalent to </v>

2225
01:54:49.581 --> 01:54:52.080
<v Speaker 4>piaget in assimilation in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2226
01:54:52.290 --> 01:54:54.630
<v Speaker 4>You can stay in the frame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just make a small adjustment.</v>

2227
01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:00.920
<v Speaker 4>I think the Piaget Eddie and distinction</v>
<v Speaker 4>between assimilation and accommodation </v>

2228
01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:03.750
<v Speaker 4>is technically inaccurate because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>continuum,</v>

2229
01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:04.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2230
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:07.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I want to grab your pen,</v>

2231
01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:11.430
<v Speaker 4>I have a little frame that will enable </v>
<v Speaker 4>me to do that.</v>

2232
01:55:11.431 --> 01:55:11.880
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2233
01:55:11.881 --> 01:55:14.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm staying within the frame to move </v>
<v Speaker 4>that out of the way,</v>

2234
01:55:14.190 --> 01:55:17.820
<v Speaker 4>but actually I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm doing is doing a very.</v>

2235
01:55:18.210 --> 01:55:21.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing a small micro revolution in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the frame.</v>

2236
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:24.600
<v Speaker 4>Moving that to pick that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's.</v>

2237
01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I think accommodation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no hard distinction between </v>

2238
01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:31.620
<v Speaker 4>assimilation and accommodation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a continuum.</v>

2239
01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:32.880
<v Speaker 4>So you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2240
01:55:32.881 --> 01:55:35.250
<v Speaker 4>if the top end of your map gets blown </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

2241
01:55:35.251 --> 01:55:40.251
<v Speaker 4>that requires accommodation and if it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just a little micro change at the </v>

2242
01:55:40.251 --> 01:55:40.260
<v Speaker 4>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's assimilation,</v>

2243
01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:45.530
<v Speaker 4>but there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no real difference between </v>

2244
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:46.290
<v Speaker 4>except for scale and there's kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>continual scale,</v>

2245
01:55:46.291 --> 01:55:48.990
<v Speaker 4>not an absolute dichotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2246
01:55:49.330 --> 01:55:50.400
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

2247
01:55:50.490 --> 01:55:55.490
<v Speaker 4>back to the back to the emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something happens and it isn't what you </v>

2248
01:55:55.861 --> 01:55:57.720
<v Speaker 4>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

2249
01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:00.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could mean anything.</v>

2250
01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.680
<v Speaker 4>What you do is you start trying to micro</v>
<v Speaker 4>adjust the frame at the highest level of</v>

2251
01:56:04.681 --> 01:56:09.681
<v Speaker 4>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you might find that you can't </v>

2252
01:56:09.681 --> 01:56:09.681
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to jump up to the next one.</v>

2253
01:56:09.681 --> 01:56:12.330
<v Speaker 4>You have to jump up to the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to jump up to the next one.</v>

2254
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:16.230
<v Speaker 4>And each time you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychophysiological cost increases.</v>

2255
01:56:17.010 --> 01:56:17.490
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2256
01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:25.700
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2257
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:30.790
<v Speaker 4>so we talked about the cost end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>spectrum and then we also talked about </v>

2258
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:31.920
<v Speaker 4>the engagement end of the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea would be,</v>

2259
01:56:32.190 --> 01:56:33.660
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

2260
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:36.690
<v Speaker 4>if you're very much engaged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say in,</v>

2261
01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:40.420
<v Speaker 5>let's go do that again.</v>

2262
01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:45.830
<v Speaker 4>If you find it very engaging to play </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your baby,</v>

2263
01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:52.180
<v Speaker 4>then you might be doing it in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in indicating that you're taking </v>

2264
01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:53.180
<v Speaker 4>good care of your family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're being a good parent and that</v>

2265
01:56:53.181 --> 01:56:55.340
<v Speaker 4>you're being a good person all </v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously,</v>

2266
01:56:55.540 --> 01:57:00.540
<v Speaker 4>where there's rich meaning in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're the systems that orient you </v>

2267
01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:00.710
<v Speaker 4>with regards to meaning or saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2268
01:57:00.711 --> 01:57:05.711
<v Speaker 4>you're doing this microaction in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that benefits the maintenance and maybe </v>

2269
01:57:05.711 --> 01:57:07.820
<v Speaker 4>even the expansion of all the frames </v>
<v Speaker 4>that exist above it.</v>

2270
01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:09.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2271
01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:14.440
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to be doing that all the time </v>

2272
01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:17.111
<v Speaker 4>if you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that implies that you want to </v>

2273
01:57:17.111 --> 01:57:19.451
<v Speaker 4>delineate out a pretty well developed </v>
<v Speaker 4>value system so that you're not acting </v>

2274
01:57:20.181 --> 01:57:25.181
<v Speaker 4>at odds with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you also want to have that </v>

2275
01:57:25.181 --> 01:57:28.151
<v Speaker 4>integrated within the broader society so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that society isn't existing towards you </v>

2276
01:57:28.581 --> 01:57:32.060
<v Speaker 4>as a continual obstacle then making your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life miserable.</v>

2277
01:57:32.510 --> 01:57:34.130
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2278
01:57:35.630 --> 01:57:40.630
<v Speaker 4>good questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any of that not make sense?</v>

2279
01:57:43.561 --> 01:57:48.561
<v Speaker 4>Or do you have any objections to it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>

2280
01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:54.200
<v Speaker 4>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned the word matter,</v>

2281
01:57:54.201 --> 01:57:55.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because things are made out of matter or</v>

2282
01:57:55.941 --> 01:57:58.940
<v Speaker 4>maybe they're made out of what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the word object is the same thing.</v>

2283
01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:02.870
<v Speaker 4>You could say that the world is made out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of objects or you can say that the world</v>

2284
01:58:02.871 --> 01:58:06.620
<v Speaker 4>has made out of what objects and both of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

2285
01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:08.250
<v Speaker 4>both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weirdly enough,</v>

2286
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:10.220
<v Speaker 4>furry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're equally true in some sense.</v>

2287
01:58:10.330 --> 01:58:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Question,</v>

2288
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.730
<v Speaker 5>were you?</v>

2289
01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:18.240
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2290
01:58:20.410 --> 01:58:21.640
<v Speaker 5>Queen b?</v>

2291
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:30.140
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the serotonin system in all </v>

2292
01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:30.140
<v Speaker 4>likelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So serotonin seems.</v>

2293
01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:33.630
<v Speaker 4>So the question was positive emotions </v>
<v Speaker 4>mediated by dopamine.</v>

2294
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:36.240
<v Speaker 4>When you're advancing towards something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2295
01:58:36.241 --> 01:58:38.670
<v Speaker 4>or when you have a cue that something </v>
<v Speaker 4>good is about to happen.</v>

2296
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 4>What is the system that mediates emotion</v>

2297
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:43.360
<v Speaker 2>at the satiation level</v>

2298
01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:46.400
<v Speaker 6>be negative?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

2299
01:58:49.890 --> 01:58:50.100
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

2300
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2301
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's start with the satiation issue </v>

2302
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.550
<v Speaker 2>that seems most deregulated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin.</v>

2303
01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:02.780
<v Speaker 2>The opiate issue is there are other </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of specific reward that don't seem</v>

2304
01:59:02.791 --> 01:59:06.570
<v Speaker 2>to be merely motivated or merely </v>
<v Speaker 2>underpinned by dopamine.</v>

2305
01:59:07.050 --> 01:59:08.700
<v Speaker 2>And the opiate system would be one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

2306
01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:13.880
<v Speaker 2>There's an oxytocin system as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are other biochemical systems </v>

2307
01:59:14.911 --> 01:59:17.490
<v Speaker 2>that are involved in more specific forms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of reward,</v>

2308
01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:22.820
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that's common among </v>
<v Speaker 2>instances that make it appear that </v>

2309
01:59:24.961 --> 01:59:27.060
<v Speaker 2>you're moving forward is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dopaminergic element,</v>

2310
01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:28.230
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

2311
01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:29.360
<v Speaker 5>and then</v>

2312
01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:35.400
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happens if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiring serotonin because you're more </v>

2313
01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:39.241
<v Speaker 2>dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you're more satiated all the </v>

2314
01:59:39.241 --> 01:59:41.341
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why people who are low in the </v>

2315
01:59:41.341 --> 01:59:43.621
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy with decreased </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of Serotonin are more impulsive </v>

2316
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:47.800
<v Speaker 2>and also more emotionally dysregulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more impulsive because,</v>

2317
01:59:48.370 --> 01:59:53.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take your positive thing when you </v>

2318
01:59:53.370 --> 01:59:53.370
<v Speaker 2>can get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they're.</v>

2319
01:59:53.370 --> 01:59:57.970
<v Speaker 2>They're more dissatisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more looking for anything that </v>

2320
01:59:57.970 --> 01:59:57.970
<v Speaker 2>will produce a positive</v>

2321
01:59:57.970 --> 01:59:59.440
<v Speaker 5>outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then</v>

2322
01:59:59.850 --> 02:00:03.870
<v Speaker 2>they're also more likely to experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>dyfs negative emotion.</v>

2323
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Partly because their serotonin systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>are lower,</v>

2324
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:11.130
<v Speaker 2>indicating their tenuous status in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>

2325
02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Meaning that everything they do that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertain is far more dangerous.</v>

2326
02:00:17.610 --> 02:00:22.610
<v Speaker 2>So this is also why it's very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>often when you're trying to treat </v>

2327
02:00:22.610 --> 02:00:26.271
<v Speaker 2>someone who's depressed because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could say there's not much difference </v>

2328
02:00:26.271 --> 02:00:28.260
<v Speaker 2>between being depressed and existing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the biochemical state.</v>

2329
02:00:28.290 --> 02:00:31.170
<v Speaker 2>That being at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy would produce,</v>

2330
02:00:31.710 --> 02:00:34.920
<v Speaker 2>in fact they're the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then the question is,</v>

2331
02:00:34.921 --> 02:00:39.390
<v Speaker 2>are you depressed or are you just at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of a dominance hierarchy?</v>

2332
02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Because those are not like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptomatology is very,</v>

2333
02:00:44.581 --> 02:00:49.581
<v Speaker 2>very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the cause and the cure are not the </v>

2334
02:00:49.581 --> 02:00:50.210
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2335
02:00:50.211 --> 02:00:52.920
<v Speaker 2>because you might be at the bottom of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant Turkey because you just.</v>

2336
02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Everything about your life is ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2337
02:00:57.151 --> 02:00:59.250
<v Speaker 2>And of course your suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you depressed,</v>

2338
02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:00.720
<v Speaker 2>sir?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2339
02:01:01.110 --> 02:01:03.690
<v Speaker 2>not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have nowhere to go.</v>

2340
02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:05.490
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2341
02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:09.450
<v Speaker 2>other questions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2342
02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:15.840
<v Speaker 6>Why pursue motivations that don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>produce this residence?</v>

2343
02:01:19.710 --> 02:01:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the question is why don't,</v>

2344
02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:24.990
<v Speaker 2>why do people pursue rewards that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce this resonance?</v>

2345
02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:28.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a value hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pleasure island.</v>

2346
02:01:29.850 --> 02:01:34.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those kids that were brought there were </v>

2347
02:01:34.850 --> 02:01:34.850
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't,</v>

2348
02:01:34.850 --> 02:01:38.250
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have anywhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have an identity.</v>

2349
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:41.450
<v Speaker 2>So they default to local pleasure</v>

2350
02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:47.900
<v Speaker 2>and that's better than none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although the problem with local </v>

2351
02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:50.721
<v Speaker 2>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while as the narrative made clear is </v>

2352
02:01:50.721 --> 02:01:53.151
<v Speaker 2>that you better look out if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive because it's going to kick </v>

2353
02:01:53.151 --> 02:01:56.751
<v Speaker 2>back on you heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason is you're only </v>

2354
02:01:56.751 --> 02:01:57.690
<v Speaker 2>considering the immediate timeframe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is,</v>

2355
02:01:57.691 --> 02:02:01.920
<v Speaker 2>is that things propagate across all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeframes and so just because something</v>

2356
02:02:01.921 --> 02:02:03.750
<v Speaker 2>works really well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this second,</v>

2357
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:08.990
<v Speaker 2>cocaine for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean that it's a tenable </v>

2358
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:12.621
<v Speaker 2>solution to the class of all problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So usually often people pursue local </v>

2359
02:02:15.571 --> 02:02:18.270
<v Speaker 2>pleasure because that's the best they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could imagine.</v>

2360
02:02:18.271 --> 02:02:21.480
<v Speaker 2>It's the best they've been taught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't see another alternative.</v>

2361
02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:26.780
<v Speaker 2>So it could be ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be they don't want to adopt the </v>

2362
02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:29.331
<v Speaker 2>responsibility because part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with working at every level of </v>

2363
02:02:29.331 --> 02:02:31.350
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy simultaneously is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2364
02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:33.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2365
02:02:33.330 --> 02:02:36.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like dancing to a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>waltz.</v>

2366
02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be paying attention to a </v>

2367
02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.600
<v Speaker 2>very large number of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously and doing things right.</v>

2368
02:02:42.601 --> 02:02:46.610
<v Speaker 2>It requires responsibility and so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that's</v>

2369
02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:50.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weight.</v>

2370
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason people drink alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to get rid of their responsibility.</v>

2371
02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you hear people drink </v>

2372
02:02:59.720 --> 02:02:59.720
<v Speaker 2>because they have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2373
02:02:59.720 --> 02:02:59.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2374
02:02:59.850 --> 02:03:04.850
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people drink because they're </v>

2375
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:06.480
<v Speaker 2>anxious and alcoholics drink because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in withdrawal,</v>

2376
02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:11.780
<v Speaker 2>but young people drink because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick and tired of being responsible </v>

2377
02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:12.210
<v Speaker 2>because it's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2378
02:03:12.211 --> 02:03:17.211
<v Speaker 2>so I'll drink enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't care about the medium to </v>

2379
02:03:17.211 --> 02:03:18.090
<v Speaker 2>longterm consequences because alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what alcohol does.</v>

2380
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:22.620
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you inderal of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>medium to longterm consequences,</v>

2381
02:03:23.130 --> 02:03:26.760
<v Speaker 2>but it makes you not care about them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly it's because it dampens anxiety,</v>

2382
02:03:27.150 --> 02:03:32.150
<v Speaker 2>so it dampens anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves your positive emotion circuits </v>

2383
02:03:32.150 --> 02:03:34.890
<v Speaker 2>intact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you can go out there and do </v>

2384
02:03:34.890 --> 02:03:34.890
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun things and that's like,</v>

2385
02:03:34.890 --> 02:03:36.420
<v Speaker 2>that's a party really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go do stupid fun things.</v>

2386
02:03:36.630 --> 02:03:41.630
<v Speaker 2>That's a party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the medium to longterm consequences </v>

2387
02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:44.390
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's risky.</v>

2388
02:03:45.590 --> 02:03:47.450
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's risky.</v>

2389
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:50.090
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know better.</v>

2390
02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:54.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the answer I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes.</v>

2391
02:03:56.070 --> 02:04:01.070
<v Speaker 7>You were talking about responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It seems like that balance of burst into</v>

2392
02:04:02.181 --> 02:04:04.430
<v Speaker 7>a certain frame and</v>

2393
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:09.910
<v Speaker 2>now that's where conservatives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals don't get along because </v>

2394
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:11.610
<v Speaker 2>conservatives do bind themselves to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular frame.</v>

2395
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:17.510
<v Speaker 2>They're conscientious and low in </v>
<v Speaker 2>openness and the liberals say doesn't </v>

2396
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:18.750
<v Speaker 2>that just bind you to a particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>frame?</v>

2397
02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.930
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah it does and that's a problem.</v>

2398
02:04:22.170 --> 02:04:23.010
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

2399
02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:29.180
<v Speaker 7>but in terms of being aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>multiple levels it takes within a frame </v>

2400
02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:35.430
<v Speaker 7>takes certain amount of tolerance of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>unbearable president for that to reach </v>

2401
02:04:37.651 --> 02:04:42.651
<v Speaker 7>the edge of that frame to force a person</v>
<v Speaker 7>to see a different frame because that's </v>

2402
02:04:42.651 --> 02:04:42.990
<v Speaker 7>something that sentence.</v>

2403
02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually where I stopped </v>

2404
02:04:48.110 --> 02:04:48.660
<v Speaker 2>today because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>

2405
02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:53.720
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're good because both the questions </v>

2406
02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:53.720
<v Speaker 2>you asked indicated that you're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the next step in the,</v>

2407
02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:58.570
<v Speaker 2>in the logic process because you asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the relationship between these </v>

2408
02:04:58.570 --> 02:05:01.971
<v Speaker 2>frames with you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to one another and that </v>

2409
02:05:01.971 --> 02:05:01.971
<v Speaker 2>is the next issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2410
02:05:02.290 --> 02:05:07.290
<v Speaker 7>but responsibility and individuality,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm curious about responsibility </v>

2411
02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:09.420
<v Speaker 7>implies a connection to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2412
02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Well what are the things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we are going to talk </v>

2413
02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:15.930
<v Speaker 2>about in the classes is how you address </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem that you just described,</v>

2414
02:05:15.931 --> 02:05:18.900
<v Speaker 2>which is that this is the Peter Pan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Story.</v>

2415
02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking is Peter Pan is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>magical boy.</v>

2416
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Pan Means Pan is the god of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

2417
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:31.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not an accident that he has </v>

2418
02:05:31.130 --> 02:05:33.030
<v Speaker 2>the name Pan and he's the boy that won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow up and he's magical.</v>

2419
02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because children are magical.</v>

2420
02:05:34.801 --> 02:05:39.801
<v Speaker 2>They can be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're nothing but potential and Peter </v>

2421
02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Pan doesn't want to give that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2422
02:05:42.210 --> 02:05:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got some adults around them,</v>

2423
02:05:44.131 --> 02:05:47.100
<v Speaker 2>but the main adult is captain hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2424
02:05:47.101 --> 02:05:49.050
<v Speaker 2>who the hell wants to grow up to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>Captain Hook?</v>

2425
02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:54.260
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to hook second year a tyrant </v>

2426
02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:58.550
<v Speaker 2>and third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're chased by the dragon of chaos </v>

2427
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.590
<v Speaker 2>with a clock in its stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2428
02:05:58.590 --> 02:06:00.480
<v Speaker 2>The crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already got a piece of you.</v>

2429
02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens when you get older.</v>

2430
02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Time has already got a piece of you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually it's going to taste for you </v>

2431
02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:12.321
<v Speaker 2>and eventually it's going to eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so hook is so traumatized by now </v>

2432
02:06:12.321 --> 02:06:16.970
<v Speaker 2>that he can't help but be a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Peter Parent looks at </v>

2433
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:18.270
<v Speaker 2>traumatized Herc and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2434
02:06:18.271 --> 02:06:23.271
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sacrificing my childhood for </v>

2435
02:06:23.271 --> 02:06:23.271
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's fine.</v>

2436
02:06:23.271 --> 02:06:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Except the ends up Kenya lost boys it </v>
<v Speaker 2>Neverland,</v>

2437
02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:27.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neverland doesn't exist and who the hell</v>

2438
02:06:27.301 --> 02:06:32.301
<v Speaker 2>wants to be king of the lost boys and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>also sacrifice is the possibility that </v>

2439
02:06:32.301 --> 02:06:36.841
<v Speaker 2>it held a real relationship with a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's Wendy Wright and she's </v>

2440
02:06:36.841 --> 02:06:40.260
<v Speaker 2>kind of conservative middleclass London </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwelling girl.</v>

2441
02:06:40.410 --> 02:06:42.330
<v Speaker 2>She wants to grow up and have kids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a life.</v>

2442
02:06:42.331 --> 02:06:45.450
<v Speaker 2>She accepts her mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She accepts her maturity.</v>

2443
02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Peter Pan has to contend himself with </v>
<v Speaker 2>tinker bell.</v>

2444
02:06:49.770 --> 02:06:51.660
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

2445
02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:56.940
<v Speaker 2>she's like the fairy of porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't exist.</v>

2446
02:06:57.690 --> 02:07:00.870
<v Speaker 2>She's the substitute for the real thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

2447
02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:02.820
<v Speaker 2>but the dichotomy that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2448
02:07:02.821 --> 02:07:07.230
<v Speaker 2>it's very tricky because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificial element in maturation,</v>

2449
02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:12.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to sacrifice the pleura </v>

2450
02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:15.321
<v Speaker 2>potentiality of childhood for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actuality of a frame and the question </v>

2451
02:07:17.461 --> 02:07:17.790
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2452
02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:18.900
<v Speaker 2>why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2453
02:07:18.901 --> 02:07:21.450
<v Speaker 2>one reason is it happens to you whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it or not.</v>

2454
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:26.750
<v Speaker 2>You can either choose your damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitation or you can let it take you </v>

2455
02:07:26.911 --> 02:07:31.911
<v Speaker 2>unaware when you're 30 or even worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're 40 and then that is not a </v>

2456
02:07:33.061 --> 02:07:34.860
<v Speaker 2>happy day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

2457
02:07:34.890 --> 02:07:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I people like this and I think it's more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more common in our culture because </v>

2458
02:07:39.890 --> 02:07:42.190
<v Speaker 2>people can put off matt maturity without</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering and immediate penalty,</v>

2459
02:07:42.430 --> 02:07:46.660
<v Speaker 2>but all that happens is the penalty </v>
<v Speaker 2>accrues and then when it finally hits it</v>

2460
02:07:46.661 --> 02:07:49.990
<v Speaker 2>just wallops you because when you're 25 </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be an idiot.</v>

2461
02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:53.770
<v Speaker 2>It's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when you're out in a job search,</v>

2462
02:07:53.771 --> 02:07:54.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2463
02:07:54.101 --> 02:07:55.930
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any experience in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of clueless.</v>

2464
02:07:55.931 --> 02:07:56.290
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2465
02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:57.250
<v Speaker 2>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2466
02:07:57.251 --> 02:07:58.240
<v Speaker 2>it's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can.</v>

2467
02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:00.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what young people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're full of potential.</v>

2468
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now you're the same person at 30.</v>

2469
02:08:04.270 --> 02:08:06.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like people aren't so thrilled </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you at that point.</v>

2470
02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:11.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell have you been doing for </v>

2471
02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:11.720
<v Speaker 2>the last 10 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2472
02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm just as clueless as I was when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>22.</v>

2473
02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:12.310
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2474
02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:15.640
<v Speaker 2>but you're not 22.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an old infant.</v>

2475
02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an ugly thing and old infant.</v>

2476
02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:21.860
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason,</v>

2477
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:26.940
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason you choose your damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice because the sacrifice is </v>

2478
02:08:27.311 --> 02:08:32.311
<v Speaker 2>inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least you get to choose it and </v>

2479
02:08:32.311 --> 02:08:35.011
<v Speaker 2>then there's something that's even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex than that in some sense is that </v>

2480
02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:39.100
<v Speaker 2>the problem with being a child is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>all you are is potential and it's really</v>

2481
02:08:39.101 --> 02:08:40.060
<v Speaker 2>low resolution.</v>

2482
02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:42.070
<v Speaker 2>You could be anything but you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2483
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:45.430
<v Speaker 2>So then you go and you do adopt an </v>
<v Speaker 2>apprenticeship,</v>

2484
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:51.060
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you become at least you become </v>

2485
02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:53.350
<v Speaker 2>something and when you're something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes the world open up to you again,</v>

2486
02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:56.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a really good plumber,</v>

2487
02:08:57.010 --> 02:08:59.080
<v Speaker 2>then you ended up being far more than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plumber,</v>

2488
02:08:59.081 --> 02:09:00.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ended up being a good employer.</v>

2489
02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that plumbers are not putting </v>

2490
02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:05.760
<v Speaker 2>plumbers down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like more power to plumbers.</v>

2491
02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:09.280
<v Speaker 2>They've saved more lives than doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hygiene,</v>

2492
02:09:09.281 --> 02:09:10.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2493
02:09:10.931 --> 02:09:13.270
<v Speaker 2>if you're a really good plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you have some employees.</v>

2494
02:09:13.271 --> 02:09:14.530
<v Speaker 2>You run a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2495
02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.450
<v Speaker 2>you make you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you train some other people,</v>

2496
02:09:16.451 --> 02:09:21.451
<v Speaker 2>you enlarge their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of a pillar of the </v>

2497
02:09:21.451 --> 02:09:21.451
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your family.</v>

2498
02:09:21.451 --> 02:09:25.801
<v Speaker 2>It's you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you pass through that narrow </v>

2499
02:09:25.801 --> 02:09:30.030
<v Speaker 2>training period which narrows you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>constricts you and develops you at the </v>

2500
02:09:30.030 --> 02:09:31.030
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can come out the other end with</v>

2501
02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:35.620
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of new possibility at help at </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand and young talked about that,</v>

2502
02:09:35.621 --> 02:09:40.621
<v Speaker 2>a thought that the proper part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper path of development in the last </v>

2503
02:09:41.710 --> 02:09:46.710
<v Speaker 2>half of life was to rediscover that </v>
<v Speaker 2>child that you left behind as you were </v>

2504
02:09:46.710 --> 02:09:51.571
<v Speaker 2>apprenticing and so then you get to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and regain that potential at </v>

2505
02:09:52.451 --> 02:09:53.140
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

2506
02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart.</v>

2507
02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was very,</v>

2508
02:09:55.091 --> 02:09:57.680
<v Speaker 2>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very wise,</v>

2509
02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:03.070
<v Speaker 2>very wise thing to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yep.</v>

2510
02:10:04.100 --> 02:10:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk more about that too.</v>

2511
02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:11.390
<v Speaker 2>You get to pick your damn sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

2512
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:16.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to not make what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificial whether you want to be or </v>

2513
02:10:16.450 --> 02:10:18.200
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing to know as well.</v>

2514
02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:20.490
<v Speaker 2>So even though it's rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2515
02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.200
<v Speaker 2>it's rough thing to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other questions</v>

2516
02:10:32.150 --> 02:10:32.390
<v Speaker 5>I have</v>

2517
02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:34.330
<v Speaker 6>no one else.</v>

2518
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2519
02:10:35.090 --> 02:10:40.090
<v Speaker 6>That thing you just said about noticing </v>
<v Speaker 6>it more and more people live into their </v>

2520
02:10:40.090 --> 02:10:40.820
<v Speaker 6>20 [inaudible] yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think about that?</v>

2521
02:10:40.821 --> 02:10:43.790
<v Speaker 6>Where do you think that comes from in </v>
<v Speaker 6>terms of culture?</v>

2522
02:10:43.791 --> 02:10:44.240
<v Speaker 6>We live in,</v>

2523
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:49.930
<v Speaker 2>think universities facilitate it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go to university to not be </v>

2524
02:10:50.401 --> 02:10:55.401
<v Speaker 2>something instead of going to university</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be something and that's it's pleasure</v>

2525
02:10:55.641 --> 02:10:55.970
<v Speaker 2>island</v>

2526
02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:00.250
<v Speaker 2>and the price you pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the U.</v>

2527
02:11:00.250 --> 02:11:04.530
<v Speaker 2>S is debt and you're enticed into it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the administrators can pick your</v>

2528
02:11:04.531 --> 02:11:09.531
<v Speaker 2>pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they rob your future self while </v>

2529
02:11:09.531 --> 02:11:11.640
<v Speaker 2>allowing you to pretend that you have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

2530
02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very nasty and you can't declare </v>

2531
02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:17.670
<v Speaker 2>bankruptcy with your student loans in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the US,</v>

2532
02:11:17.730 --> 02:11:22.170
<v Speaker 2>it's indentured servitude and it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely pleasure island.</v>

2533
02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:27.200
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so tuition fees of short way out of </v>

2534
02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:30.981
<v Speaker 2>control and part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities don't make more demands on </v>

2535
02:11:30.981 --> 02:11:32.520
<v Speaker 2>their students and let them get away </v>
<v Speaker 2>with all the things.</v>

2536
02:11:32.521 --> 02:11:34.860
<v Speaker 2>They let them get away with it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're basically,</v>

2537
02:11:35.130 --> 02:11:39.420
<v Speaker 2>why the hell would you chase them out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are $100,000</v>

2538
02:11:40.050 --> 02:11:45.050
<v Speaker 2>or more so they can do whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want as long as you get to sell them to </v>

2539
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:47.370
<v Speaker 2>the salt mines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2540
02:11:49.150 --> 02:11:49.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2541
02:11:49.991 --> 02:11:54.991
<v Speaker 2>it's not the only reason because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other thing that's happened is that the </v>

2542
02:11:54.991 --> 02:11:57.991
<v Speaker 2>rate of technological transformation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>so fast now and the rate of turnover of </v>

2543
02:11:57.991 --> 02:12:01.771
<v Speaker 2>things is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is genuinely harder for people who </v>

2544
02:12:01.771 --> 02:12:01.771
<v Speaker 2>are say 18 to 20.</v>

2545
02:12:02.110 --> 02:12:04.000
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

2546
02:12:04.001 --> 02:12:06.120
<v Speaker 2>the kind of rough patch for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

2547
02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:09.550
<v Speaker 2>for life was probably 14 to 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2548
02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 18 to 25,</v>

2549
02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:17.640
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason for that is that </v>

2550
02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:20.940
<v Speaker 2>all the jobs that the bloody hippies </v>
<v Speaker 2>complained about being doomed to in the </v>

2551
02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:22.540
<v Speaker 2>19 sixties have now disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their problem was,</v>

2552
02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:27.600
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to work for a </v>

2553
02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>corporation and get a salary for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of my life,</v>

2554
02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll just end up in with a </v>

2555
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:33.000
<v Speaker 2>pension and that'll be my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2556
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.471
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a lot better deal than an </v>

2557
02:12:37.471 --> 02:12:38.940
<v Speaker 2>endless round of part time starbucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

2558
02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.190
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2559
02:12:41.191 --> 02:12:44.010
<v Speaker 2>some of it is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2560
02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:44.830
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2561
02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:47.410
<v Speaker 2>there is a space now in our culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2562
02:12:47.950 --> 02:12:52.420
<v Speaker 2>that is lacking for people to make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation from,</v>

2563
02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:55.390
<v Speaker 2>from adolescence into adulthood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's just,</v>

2564
02:12:55.870 --> 02:12:58.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the cost of that is for stalled,</v>

2565
02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:02.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good thing</v>

2566
02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:11.220
<v Speaker 6>they're seeing this person's eft,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I've heard about things.</v>

2567
02:13:17.530 --> 02:13:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2568
02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:21.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees is that everyone has one.</v>

2569
02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:23.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which.</v>

2570
02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:26.710
<v Speaker 2>So because scarcity matters obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2571
02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:32.460
<v Speaker 2>the second thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the match between the degree in </v>

2572
02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:33.000
<v Speaker 2>the workplace has less and less self </v>
<v Speaker 2>evident.</v>

2573
02:13:33.370 --> 02:13:38.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should happen when you go to </v>

2574
02:13:38.370 --> 02:13:38.640
<v Speaker 2>university is you should learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think and formulate arguments.</v>

2575
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:40.980
<v Speaker 2>You should learn to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak and write.</v>

2576
02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:44.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what the humanities are for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're to make you dangerous,</v>

2577
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:49.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you can think and speak and </v>

2578
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:51.660
<v Speaker 2>write your deadly in a complex job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're exactly what's necessary.</v>

2579
02:13:51.930 --> 02:13:56.930
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like what the hell good is the </v>

2580
02:13:56.930 --> 02:13:56.930
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

2581
02:13:56.930 --> 02:13:58.980
<v Speaker 2>a degree in English literature doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare you for a job,</v>

2582
02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:02.280
<v Speaker 2>it could make you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write and speak,</v>

2583
02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:05.640
<v Speaker 2>which prepares you for any complex job </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what's supposed to happen.</v>

2584
02:14:05.641 --> 02:14:09.690
<v Speaker 2>But increasingly I think that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen</v>

2585
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:13.820
<v Speaker 2>and the employers are waking up to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>

2586
02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:15.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

2587
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:17.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've already known that most for most</v>

2588
02:14:17.211 --> 02:14:19.370
<v Speaker 2>complex positions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to train their people.</v>

2589
02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Now they're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2590
02:14:21.081 --> 02:14:23.540
<v Speaker 2>why do I have to bother with the degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to train them,</v>

2591
02:14:23.541 --> 02:14:25.850
<v Speaker 2>if it isn't bringing anything of value?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this.</v>

2592
02:14:25.851 --> 02:14:30.851
<v Speaker 2>And even fields like law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went to do a debate at Queen's </v>

2593
02:14:30.851 --> 02:14:33.791
<v Speaker 2>university three weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they couldn't get anybody to </v>

2594
02:14:33.791 --> 02:14:33.791
<v Speaker 2>debate me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2595
02:14:33.791 --> 02:14:34.330
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy had to pay,</v>

2596
02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:37.030
<v Speaker 2>play devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about bill [inaudible].</v>

2597
02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:37.850
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

2598
02:14:37.851 --> 02:14:40.400
<v Speaker 2>that's so pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about legal matters.</v>

2599
02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:45.700
<v Speaker 2>And I meant the world greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the greatest universities in the </v>

2600
02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:45.700
<v Speaker 2>West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2601
02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the top 200,</v>

2602
02:14:46.281 --> 02:14:47.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2603
02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get someone to argue with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid psychology professor about law,</v>

2604
02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:56.000
<v Speaker 2>had to get a devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that was really</v>

2605
02:14:56.001 --> 02:15:00.380
<v Speaker 2>disheartening talking to the students </v>
<v Speaker 2>was they told me four or five of them,</v>

2606
02:15:00.381 --> 02:15:01.850
<v Speaker 2>they're not learning a damn thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

2607
02:15:01.851 --> 02:15:04.760
<v Speaker 2>It's all social justice nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

2608
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:07.370
<v Speaker 2>well good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll do it in the profession.</v>

2609
02:15:07.371 --> 02:15:10.670
<v Speaker 2>It's being done in any ways because </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyers being replaced by automation.</v>

2610
02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:13.880
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of what they do is dig up </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

2611
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:15.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can do that on your own.</v>

2612
02:15:15.741 --> 02:15:20.360
<v Speaker 2>And forms are proliferating like Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the law school should be teaching you</v>

2613
02:15:20.361 --> 02:15:21.620
<v Speaker 2>to be a monster.</v>

2614
02:15:23.410 --> 02:15:26.590
<v Speaker 2>You better be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you come out,</v>

2615
02:15:26.591 --> 02:15:29.200
<v Speaker 2>you're concerned with social welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2616
02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:30.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2617
02:15:30.731 --> 02:15:35.731
<v Speaker 2>there's just nothing to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can come out and say </v>

2618
02:15:35.731 --> 02:15:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be nice to people.</v>

2619
02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Well that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2620
02:15:37.391 --> 02:15:42.391
<v Speaker 2>You go right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like I'll go find someone who can </v>

2621
02:15:42.391 --> 02:15:43.990
<v Speaker 2>do something and you can go be nice to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and see how effective that is.</v>

2622
02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:48.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiring in the same direction.</v>

2623
02:15:49.150 --> 02:15:51.310
<v Speaker 2>People don't have to get married to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

2624
02:15:53.110 --> 02:15:55.030
<v Speaker 2>so we have no idea what that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2625
02:15:55.031 --> 02:16:00.031
<v Speaker 2>Although we know one thing it's done is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only people that get married now or </v>

2626
02:16:00.031 --> 02:16:00.250
<v Speaker 2>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2627
02:16:00.251 --> 02:16:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Which is another thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>comical because the feminist idea in the</v>

2628
02:16:03.731 --> 02:16:05.740
<v Speaker 2>sixties was that marriage was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive,</v>

2629
02:16:06.070 --> 02:16:07.750
<v Speaker 2>oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal institution.</v>

2630
02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:08.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2631
02:16:08.411 --> 02:16:13.411
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then why do only rich women get married </v>

2632
02:16:13.411 --> 02:16:13.411
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's.</v>

2633
02:16:13.411 --> 02:16:15.820
<v Speaker 2>That is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for poor women,</v>

2634
02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:19.210
<v Speaker 2>the dissolution of marriage has been an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute catastrophe.</v>

2635
02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:22.480
<v Speaker 2>They are so screwed because they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

2636
02:16:23.170 --> 02:16:26.080
<v Speaker 2>So they're working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got their 90 hour work week,</v>

2637
02:16:26.081 --> 02:16:27.130
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

2638
02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.170
<v Speaker 2>They're much less attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>

2639
02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:33.670
<v Speaker 2>So they get low quality men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often parasitical and predatory.</v>

2640
02:16:34.450 --> 02:16:38.650
<v Speaker 2>So they often have like jobs in retail </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2641
02:16:38.651 --> 02:16:43.651
<v Speaker 2>which are just dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what your schedule </v>

2642
02:16:43.651 --> 02:16:43.651
<v Speaker 2>is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get paid hardly anything,</v>

2643
02:16:43.651 --> 02:16:44.650
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really.</v>

2644
02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:47.590
<v Speaker 2>But if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the women who,</v>

2645
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:52.950
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are outspoken feminists are on the </v>

2646
02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:56.260
<v Speaker 2>successful end of the associate economic</v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>

2647
02:16:56.310 --> 02:16:58.270
<v Speaker 2>There are university students or people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

2648
02:16:58.330 --> 02:17:03.330
<v Speaker 2>they don't even know any poor women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have no idea what their lives </v>

2649
02:17:03.330 --> 02:17:05.770
<v Speaker 2>are like and you would never know </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're at home working,</v>

2650
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're either at their horrible job or </v>

2651
02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:10.830
<v Speaker 2>they're at home slaving away with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

2652
02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:12.670
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like they're out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you what's wrong with them.</v>

2653
02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:13.900
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2654
02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:21.020
<v Speaker 6>fix this Ita.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So sometimes he listed it as a lack of </v>

2655
02:17:21.020 --> 02:17:25.750
<v Speaker 6>critical thinking and language.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like it's like a logic </v>

2656
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:31.030
<v Speaker 6>association with punctuation of herbs </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it feels sometimes they're lacking </v>

2657
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:33.500
<v Speaker 6>in this basic knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just put two and two together.</v>

2658
02:17:35.470 --> 02:17:40.470
<v Speaker 2>The best way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way to teach people critical </v>

2659
02:17:40.470 --> 02:17:42.751
<v Speaker 2>thinking is to teach them to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I made this little thing that I put </v>

2660
02:17:42.751 --> 02:17:42.880
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2661
02:17:43.530 --> 02:17:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if maybe it is it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>site for 34 website.</v>

2662
02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Did I post that rubric for Essay </v>
<v Speaker 2>Writing?</v>

2663
02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:52.660
<v Speaker 8>I don't think it actually went through.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it is still on 4:30.</v>

2664
02:17:52.661 --> 02:17:52.840
<v Speaker 8>That's fine.</v>

2665
02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Is it not on for 34?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that not working?</v>

2666
02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:01.210
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's still in corporate before 30.</v>

2667
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2668
02:18:02.700 --> 02:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Well there's an essay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hope that's too bad.</v>

2669
02:18:05.250 --> 02:18:10.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not on the site for 34 website even</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I updated it anyways.</v>

2670
02:18:10.171 --> 02:18:13.740
<v Speaker 2>I have this guide to writing this that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it isn't on the 4:34</v>

2671
02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:15.870
<v Speaker 2>website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is definitely on the 4:30</v>

2672
02:18:15.871 --> 02:18:20.871
<v Speaker 2>website and it steps people through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of writing because what's </v>

2673
02:18:21.391 --> 02:18:26.391
<v Speaker 2>happened now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to teach people to write </v>

2674
02:18:26.391 --> 02:18:28.350
<v Speaker 2>because it's unbelievably time intensive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like writing marketing a good essay.</v>

2675
02:18:28.410 --> 02:18:30.420
<v Speaker 2>That's really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check a.</v>

2676
02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:32.330
<v Speaker 2>You did everything right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2677
02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Marketing a bad essay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2678
02:18:34.890 --> 02:18:36.480
<v Speaker 2>The words are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The phrases are wrong.</v>

2679
02:18:36.490 --> 02:18:41.490
<v Speaker 2>The sentence is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not ordered right in the </v>

2680
02:18:41.490 --> 02:18:43.311
<v Speaker 2>paragraphs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The paragraphs aren't coherent and the </v>

2681
02:18:43.311 --> 02:18:45.501
<v Speaker 2>whole thing makes no sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so trying to tell the person what they </v>

2682
02:18:45.501 --> 02:18:45.660
<v Speaker 2>did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2683
02:18:45.661 --> 02:18:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did everything wrong.</v>

2684
02:18:46.861 --> 02:18:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Everything about this essay is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not helpful either.</v>

2685
02:18:51.090 --> 02:18:56.090
<v Speaker 2>You have to find the few little things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they did half right and you have to </v>

2686
02:18:56.161 --> 02:19:01.161
<v Speaker 2>teach them what they did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really expensive and so what I did </v>

2687
02:19:01.161 --> 02:19:05.310
<v Speaker 2>with this rubric was trying to address </v>
<v Speaker 2>that from the production side instead of</v>

2688
02:19:05.311 --> 02:19:10.311
<v Speaker 2>the grading side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the best thing you can do is teach </v>

2689
02:19:10.311 --> 02:19:11.580
<v Speaker 2>people to write because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between that and thinking and</v>

2690
02:19:11.581 --> 02:19:16.581
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that just blows me </v>
<v Speaker 2>away about universities is that no one </v>

2691
02:19:16.581 --> 02:19:18.540
<v Speaker 2>ever tell students why they should write</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2692
02:19:19.020 --> 02:19:19.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2693
02:19:19.471 --> 02:19:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you have to do this assignment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2694
02:19:21.590 --> 02:19:22.710
<v Speaker 2>why are you writing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2695
02:19:22.711 --> 02:19:23.700
<v Speaker 2>you need the grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2696
02:19:23.701 --> 02:19:28.701
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to learn to think because </v>

2697
02:19:28.701 --> 02:19:30.380
<v Speaker 2>thinking makes you act effectively in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

2698
02:19:30.381 --> 02:19:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Thinking makes you win the battles you </v>
<v Speaker 2>undertake and those could be battles for</v>

2699
02:19:33.651 --> 02:19:36.230
<v Speaker 2>good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can think and speak and write,</v>

2700
02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:39.200
<v Speaker 2>you are absolutely deadly.</v>

2701
02:19:39.590 --> 02:19:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Nothing can get in your way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you learned to write.</v>

2702
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:48.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that people aren't just </v>

2703
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.540
<v Speaker 2>told that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2704
02:19:48.541 --> 02:19:53.541
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's the most powerful weapon </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can possibly provide someone with.</v>

2705
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:59.710
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know lots of people who've been </v>

2706
02:19:59.710 --> 02:19:59.710
<v Speaker 2>staggeringly successful and watched them</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout my life.</v>

2707
02:19:59.710 --> 02:20:04.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to have an argument with </v>

2708
02:20:04.511 --> 02:20:07.121
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll just slash you into pieces and </v>

2709
02:20:07.121 --> 02:20:10.220
<v Speaker 2>not in a malevolent way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're gonna make your </v>

2710
02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:10.220
<v Speaker 2>point and they're going to make their </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

2711
02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:14.740
<v Speaker 2>You better have your points organized </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you are going to look </v>

2712
02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:19.120
<v Speaker 2>like and be an absolute idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are not going to get anywhere.</v>

2713
02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:23.570
<v Speaker 2>And if you can formulate your arguments </v>
<v Speaker 2>coherently and make a presentation,</v>

2714
02:20:23.571 --> 02:20:26.810
<v Speaker 2>if you can speak to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can lay out a proposal,</v>

2715
02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:28.610
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people give you money,</v>

2716
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:31.910
<v Speaker 2>they give you opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have influence.</v>

2717
02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:37.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what you were at university for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what you do is you </v>

2718
02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:37.840
<v Speaker 2>urinate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in English,</v>

2719
02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:39.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in your new languages anyways.</v>

2720
02:20:39.801 --> 02:20:40.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2721
02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:46.160
<v Speaker 2>teach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teach people to be articulate because </v>

2722
02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:47.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the most dangerous thing you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly be.</v>

2723
02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:49.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's motivating.</v>

2724
02:20:49.431 --> 02:20:50.630
<v Speaker 2>If people know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2725
02:20:50.631 --> 02:20:52.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you learning to write?</v>

2726
02:20:52.371 --> 02:20:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Because your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's your sword,</v>

2727
02:20:54.081 --> 02:20:55.850
<v Speaker 2>here's your [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2728
02:20:55.851 --> 02:20:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Here's your bulletproof vest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're learn how to use them,</v>

2729
02:21:01.150 --> 02:21:05.450
<v Speaker 5>but it's just,</v>

2730
02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:11.760
<v Speaker 2>it's an endless mystery to me why that </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't made self evident.</v>

2731
02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:14.660
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2732
02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:16.610
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of thing that can drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>you mad.</v>

2733
02:21:16.611 --> 02:21:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Trying to sort out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people are,</v>

2734
02:21:19.490 --> 02:21:24.490
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a conspiracy to bring people </v>

2735
02:21:24.490 --> 02:21:24.490
<v Speaker 2>into the education system to make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaker.</v>

2736
02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:25.640
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2737
02:21:27.180 --> 02:21:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I guess that keeps the competition down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's one way of thinking about </v>

2738
02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:34.560
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your students are stupid,</v>

2739
02:21:34.561 --> 02:21:35.700
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to challenge you.</v>

2740
02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:42.800
<v Speaker 5>So other questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>disagreements.</v>

2741
02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a pretty harsh indictment of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university system.</v>

2742
02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:56.040
<v Speaker 9>You get depleted points that if you stay</v>
<v Speaker 9>a,</v>

2743
02:21:57.780 --> 02:22:01.000
<v Speaker 9>which is of course a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You,</v>

2744
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:04.360
<v Speaker 9>you have mobile mobility solution,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

2745
02:22:04.430 --> 02:22:08.480
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But then is also like April.</v>

2746
02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:11.830
<v Speaker 9>It's also assuming that you will always </v>
<v Speaker 9>get to a solution.</v>

2747
02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:13.210
<v Speaker 9>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 9>true.</v>

2748
02:22:15.810 --> 02:22:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2749
02:22:17.450 --> 02:22:17.800
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2750
02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:19.800
<v Speaker 9>Analytic solution that will keep them</v>

2751
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.800
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2752
02:22:21.801 --> 02:22:22.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there used to be,</v>

2753
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:24.980
<v Speaker 2>before the divorce laws were really </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalized,</v>

2754
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:29.760
<v Speaker 2>there were there you could sue for </v>
<v Speaker 2>irreconcilable differences and sometimes</v>

2755
02:22:29.761 --> 02:22:31.770
<v Speaker 2>people do find themselves in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

2756
02:22:31.771 --> 02:22:34.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like one person wants children in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other person doesn't.</v>

2757
02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:38.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough one to negotiate,</v>

2758
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:44.270
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not saying that just </v>

2759
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:48.090
<v Speaker 2>because you lock yourself into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two cats in a barrel that,</v>

2760
02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:53.600
<v Speaker 2>that will make you solve your problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>because problems are hard to solve and </v>

2761
02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:57.411
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you can't solve them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just pointing out what the cost </v>

2762
02:22:57.411 --> 02:23:01.311
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of leaving the back door or what the </v>

2763
02:23:01.311 --> 02:23:02.700
<v Speaker 2>cost of leaving the back door open is </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a big cost and you know,</v>

2764
02:23:02.701 --> 02:23:07.701
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I see too is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's identities fragment </v>

2765
02:23:07.701 --> 02:23:08.300
<v Speaker 2>increasingly across time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2766
02:23:08.370 --> 02:23:13.370
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you have as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>age is something like the continuity of </v>

2767
02:23:14.041 --> 02:23:15.810
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2768
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:16.250
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2769
02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:21.320
<v Speaker 2>you have someone that you're with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've tied your story together with </v>

2770
02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:21.320
<v Speaker 2>theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have children,</v>

2771
02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:25.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe they have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's this continual payoff,</v>

2772
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:30.830
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in quality that you obtained from </v>

2773
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:34.760
<v Speaker 2>staying within that frame and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump out of that.</v>

2774
02:23:34.921 --> 02:23:37.350
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose to some degree that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>provides freedom,</v>

2775
02:23:37.351 --> 02:23:39.510
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't obvious to me that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>does that for people.</v>

2776
02:23:41.450 --> 02:23:46.450
<v Speaker 9>One specific relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a email.</v>

2777
02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:49.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2778
02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:54.420
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the case that sequential </v>

2779
02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:56.851
<v Speaker 2>relationships are unlikely to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

2780
02:23:57.111 --> 02:23:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2781
02:23:57.631 --> 02:23:58.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not make,</v>

2782
02:23:58.721 --> 02:24:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely not making a utopian case</v>
<v Speaker 2>for marriage.</v>

2783
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:08.830
<v Speaker 9>I would like to hear the case for the </v>
<v Speaker 9>boys from you because he made a really </v>

2784
02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:09.000
<v Speaker 9>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

2785
02:24:09.001 --> 02:24:14.001
<v Speaker 9>It says top points,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but at the same time I think there are </v>

2786
02:24:14.001 --> 02:24:16.020
<v Speaker 9>relationships that are one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yup.</v>

2787
02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:19.560
<v Speaker 9>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if that's the case,</v>

2788
02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:24.860
<v Speaker 9>then insistent them a cannot be good.</v>

2789
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

2790
02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:27.830
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely the alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

2791
02:24:27.831 --> 02:24:31.580
<v Speaker 2>And of course there are strong things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be said on both sides,</v>

2792
02:24:32.170 --> 02:24:37.170
<v Speaker 2>but see there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some additional problems with </v>

2793
02:24:41.801 --> 02:24:45.340
<v Speaker 2>divorce that people don't really grasp </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're young.</v>

2794
02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that you can be divorced </v>
<v Speaker 2>once you have children.</v>

2795
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:51.880
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of a stupid idea because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

2796
02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:53.770
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

2797
02:24:54.250 --> 02:24:59.250
<v Speaker 2>you can find a limited substitute for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your initial freedom,</v>

2798
02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:05.280
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have kids and you try to get </v>

2799
02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:07.981
<v Speaker 2>divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that that's going to </v>

2800
02:25:07.981 --> 02:25:07.981
<v Speaker 2>demolish your life is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>

2801
02:25:07.981 --> 02:25:09.580
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly expensive.</v>

2802
02:25:10.060 --> 02:25:14.500
<v Speaker 2>So one or both of you is going to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that poor and</v>

2803
02:25:16.450 --> 02:25:20.050
<v Speaker 2>your market value has declined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're the woman who takes the</v>

2804
02:25:20.051 --> 02:25:25.051
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your market value has declined </v>

2805
02:25:25.051 --> 02:25:25.051
<v Speaker 2>radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be poorer.</v>

2806
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:29.230
<v Speaker 2>The man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a screwed because he is now an</v>

2807
02:25:29.231 --> 02:25:32.050
<v Speaker 2>indentured servant and there's no escape</v>
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>

2808
02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:36.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not so bad if you can negotiate</v>

2809
02:25:36.311 --> 02:25:38.320
<v Speaker 2>a peaceful separation and some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

2810
02:25:38.321 --> 02:25:40.870
<v Speaker 2>but lots of times if you have a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

2811
02:25:41.170 --> 02:25:44.230
<v Speaker 2>it's not like negotiating and peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 2>separation is all that easy,</v>

2812
02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:47.770
<v Speaker 2>but if you're at each other's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck to you.</v>

2813
02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it's roughly equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>having non fatal cancer.</v>

2814
02:25:52.210 --> 02:25:55.300
<v Speaker 2>It is not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a 10 year process,</v>

2815
02:25:55.301 --> 02:25:58.270
<v Speaker 2>15 year process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll cost you $250,000</v>

2816
02:25:58.510 --> 02:26:03.510
<v Speaker 2>and it'll tear a big chunk out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and also it will really disrupt </v>

2817
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:05.830
<v Speaker 2>your relationship with your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2818
02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:07.330
<v Speaker 2>you bring kids into a step.</v>

2819
02:26:07.330 --> 02:26:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Parent family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do not do as well.</v>

2820
02:26:09.730 --> 02:26:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Step parents are not as good as parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as biological parents.</v>

2821
02:26:13.031 --> 02:26:14.680
<v Speaker 2>And the data on that is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2822
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:19.710
<v Speaker 2>obviously there are exceptions because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are terrible biological parents </v>

2823
02:26:19.710 --> 02:26:21.850
<v Speaker 2>and there are wonderful step parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look in aggregate,</v>

2824
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:26.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to care for children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need everything.</v>

2825
02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:31.450
<v Speaker 2>You can binding you to them and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's someone else's children,</v>

2826
02:26:33.010 --> 02:26:35.710
<v Speaker 2>mostly they get in the way of the person</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you love,</v>

2827
02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2828
02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:40.840
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you have a child,</v>

2829
02:26:41.410 --> 02:26:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll be right out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you have a child and I want to</v>

2830
02:26:44.111 --> 02:26:49.111
<v Speaker 2>go out with you every second you spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that child is the second you don't </v>

2831
02:26:49.111 --> 02:26:51.790
<v Speaker 2>spend with me and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's gonna be a price for that.</v>

2832
02:26:51.791 --> 02:26:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2833
02:26:53.790 --> 02:26:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and if I have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel exactly the same </v>

2834
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.790
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

2835
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.790
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love children.</v>

2836
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:59.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2837
02:26:59.051 --> 02:27:00.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

2838
02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:02.710
<v Speaker 2>sure you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it.</v>

2839
02:27:03.250 --> 02:27:05.160
<v Speaker 2>You might love your child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2840
02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:07.750
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty specific the way that people</v>

2841
02:27:07.751 --> 02:27:09.490
<v Speaker 2>loved children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2842
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:14.370
<v Speaker 2>and the rate of abuse for kids in step </v>
<v Speaker 2>parent families is way higher than it is</v>

2843
02:27:14.371 --> 02:27:16.870
<v Speaker 2>in biological families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not even any comparison.</v>

2844
02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:19.900
<v Speaker 2>So anyways.</v>
