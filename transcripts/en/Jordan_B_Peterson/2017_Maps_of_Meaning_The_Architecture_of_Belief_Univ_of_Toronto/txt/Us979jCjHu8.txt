Speaker 1:          00:00:13       Okay, so the last time we were here we got about maybe a third of the way through his story, his story of no kill and the transformation of a marionette into something hypothetically real. And I'm gonna backtrack a few slides and it'll get us into it again. So you remember that. Um, the blue fairy. So I would say the benevolent element of Mother Nature in the ski matter that we're going to use to investigate mythology had more or less been allowed her entrance because Japan was a good guy and because he wished for the right thing. And so in some sense here, here's a way of thinking about that, you know, genetic studies, genetic slash environmental studies of children's temperament have revealed something quite interesting, which is that the shared environment that children have within a family. So that would be what's the same about your environment and your brother's environment.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       The Se doesn't have that much effect on your temperament or his temperament because the presumption always was that within a family there was a shared environment, right? That something was common about the environment to every child within that environment. But, but there isn't much of a shared environmental effect on temperament and so then you could say, well, that makes it appear as though parenting isn't that relevant in relationship to the development of temperament, but you could also suggest something else. You could suggest that if parenting is occurring properly, the effect of the shared environments should be very close to zero and the reason for that is that you establish an identity on an individual relationship with each child and the environment is actually a microenvironment that's composed of your observations of your child and that specific child's interaction with you and to some degree, if there is a shared environment that means that you're enforcing the same principles on every child.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       And so my suspicions are, although I don't know this because the research hasn't been done that in bad families there is a shared environmental effect, but in good families there are there that minimize it. And so that lets the child's biological predisposition roughly manifest itself with support and in some positive manner. Well, I don't want to extend the analogy too far, but you could imagine that if, and this is what this film proposes, is that if you aim properly in relationship to your child, what you're trying to do is to establish an individual relationship and to allow them to move towards whatever their particular expression of individuality happens to be and that's while that would be the same as allowing nature to take its course in some sense at nature and it's positive guys, and that's exactly what happens here. Now the other thing that happens of course, is that the cricket for reasons that aren't clear precisely is knighted by the Blue Fairy and serves as Pinocchio's conscience.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       Although he isn't very good at it, which is a very peculiar thing and quite a market, a point that the film is making that that conscience actually has something to learn too and there's actually a Friday and element to that. You know, because Freud thought of the Super Ego as the internalization roughly speaking of the father, and it could be very severe, the superego. So it'd be like a really strict father, really tyrannical father. Inside your head, although I think it's better to think about the Super Ego as the internalized representation of society at large mediated to some degree through your parents because it's not as if your father even assuming he's too radical, is the inventor of all those tyrannical rules. He's the propagator of them, but he's actually a proxy voice if he even if it's just for the harsh side of society. He's proxy voice for society and because we are social creatures, the the utility of having an internal social voice to guide you.

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       Although again, you seem to be able to follow it or not follow it, which I also find spectacularly interesting because obviously if it was an unerring guide, you could just follow it and if it was an unerring guide, well you wouldn't need freewill either because you could just act out the dictates of this internal representation and that isn't what you do. So anyways, the proposition here is that the conscience exists but it's a relatively flawed entity and it needs to be modified as well by nature. Which is quite interesting because the blue fairy night, Sam, because you also might think of the conscience as only something that's socially constructed, right? Which is the more typical viewpoint. But I don't buy that for a second because I believe firmly and I think, I think the pig jetty and interpretation of child development more or less bears this out, is that there are parameters within which conscience has to operate and that it's sort of like this.

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       It's like the same parameters that govern fairplay will say that. And so you can say there's fairplay within a game and there's fairplay across sets of games and the set of games is pretty much indistinguishable from the actual environment, right. If you think about all the things you do is nested games at, at some point, the spread of that is large enough so it encompasses everything you do, which includes the environment. And so, uh, I believe that you're adapted to the set of all possible games, roughly speaking all possible playable games, something like that. And that, you know, the rules for that, which is why we talked about this a little bit. Why you're so good at identifying cheaters, you have a module for that. According to the evolutionary psychologists send you, not only do identify the but really remember them. It really sticks in your mind and there's other evidence to so one piece of evidence that I love.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       I think it's so well there's a couple. One I would derive from friends to wall who's a famous primatologist and he studied. He studied the prototype morality that emerges in chimpanzees and it's very much rest nested in their dominant structures, you know, because you could think of morality in some sense as the understanding of the rules by which the dominance hierarchy operates. Right? And so you could say, well, the biggest, ugliest, meanest chimp and the male dominance hierarchies in chimps seemed to be the predominant ones. Although the females also have a dominance hierarchy in it. It's not quite so clear in Bonobos, which seemed to be more female dominated. But in any case, I'm the champ. Primary chimp dominant structure is male and you could think, well, it's like the cave man champion whose biggest and toughest to necessarily rules and who rules longest, but that isn't what the wall filed.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       See, the problem with being mean, let's say, and not not negotiating your social landscape and not trading reciprocal favors, is that no matter how powerful you are as an individual to pete, to individuals, three quarters of your power can do you in, and that happens with the chimps fairly regularly. If the guy on top is to tyrannical and doesn't make social connections than weaker chimps, males make good social connections and when he's not in such good shape, they take them down and viciously to, to wall has, has documented some unbelievably horrendous acts of, let's call it regicide in among the chimpanzee troops that he studied mostly in the Arnhem Zoo. They have a big troop there that's been there a long time, but he's very interested in prototypical morality. And here's some other examples of prototypical morality emerging among animals. There's many of them, but one is um, you know, have two wolves have a dominance dispute that again, that would be more likely among the male wolves, but it doesn't really matter.

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       They basically display their size and they grow for all shipley and puff up their hair so they look bigger and you know, you can see cats do that when they're, they go into fight or flight, right? Not only do they puff up including their tail, but they stand sideways and the reason they do that is because they look bigger, right? Because they're trying to put out the most intimidating possible front. So anyways, if two wolves are going at it, they're. What they're really trying to do is to size each other up and they're trying to scare each other into backing off fundamentally because see, the worst case scenario is like your world for number one and number two. And we tear each other to shreds, but I win, but I'm so damaged after that, that wolf number three comes in and takes me out. So like there's a big cost to be paid even for victory in a dominance dispute.

Speaker 1:          00:08:42       If a degenerates into violence and animals and human beings, but animals in particular have evolved very, very specific mechanisms to escalate dominance disputes towards violet by step so that they don't so that the victor doesn't risk incapacitating himself by winning. So what happens with the wolves is that, you know, they growl at each other and posture and display and maybe they even snap at each other, but the probability that they're going to get into a full fledged fight is pretty low. And what happens is one of the wolves backs off and flips over and shows his neck. And that basically means all right, tear it out. You know. And the other wolf says, of course he doesn't, while you're kind of an idiot and you're not that strong, but we might need you to take down a moose in the future. And so, you know, despite your patheticness I won't tear out your throat.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       And then they've established their dominant position. And then from then on, at least for some substantial period of time, this subordinate wolf gives way to the dominant wolf. But at least the subordinate wolf is alive. And you know, he might be dominant over other wolves and so everyone in the whole hierarchy is sorted that out through either through mark combat or through combat itself and you know, the low ranking members aren't in the best possible position, but at least they're not getting their heads turn off every second of their existence. And so there's even some utility in this stability of the dominance hierarchy for the low ranking members because at least they're not getting pounded. They're getting threatened, which is way better. I mean it's not good, but it's way better than actual combat. And then there's the example of rats, which I love. This is Jaak Panksepp work and he wrote a book called affective neuroscience, would I, which I would highly, highly recommend.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       I have a list of readings, recommended readings on my website. It's a brilliant book and he's a brilliant psychologist. Really one of the top top psychologist as far as I'm concerned, both theoretically and experimentally. A real genius, Huh? He's the guy who discovered that rats laugh when you tickle them. They laugh ultrasonically. So you can't actually hear them, but if you record it and slow it down, then you can hear them giggling away when you take a look with an eraser, which is sort of like their mother's tongue. It's often what lab people use as a substitute for the licking of the little wrapped by the mother. So, so, and he discovered the place circuit and in mammals, which is like a major deal, right? He should get a Nobel prize for that. That's a big deal to discover an entire motivational circuit whose existence no one had really predicted, you know, apart from the fact that obviously mammals play and uh, even lizards, maybe some of the more social lizard seemed to play, you know, so anyhow, but panksepp observed, I think this is a brilliant piece of science, is that first of all, juvenile male routes in particular, like too rough and tumble play.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       They like to wrestle and they actually pin each other just like little kids do. Or like adult wrestlers do. They pin their shoulders down and that basically means you win. And so, okay. So that's pretty cool. But what's even cooler, I think while there's three things, one is the rats will work for an opportunity to get into an arena where they know that play might occur, and so that's one of the scientific ways of testing in animals motivation, right? So imagine you have a starving route and it knows that it's got food down the end of a corridor. You can put a little spring on its tail and measure how hard it pulls and that gives you an indication of it's motivational force. Now imagine the starving rat that's trying to get to some food and you have a little spring on his tail and you walked in some cat odor.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       So now that route is starving and wants to get out of there. He's going to try to pull even farther towards the food. So getting away plus getting forward are separate motivational systems and if you can add them together, it's real potent. And part of the reason why in the future authoring exercise that you guys are going to do as the class progresses, you're asked to outline the place you'd like to end up, which is your desired future, and also the place that you could end up if you let everything fall apart is so that your anxiety chases you and your approach systems pull you forward. You're maximally motivated, dead, and it's important because otherwise you can be afraid of pursuing the things that you want to pursue. Right? And that's very common. And so then the fear inhibits you as the promise pulls you forward, but it makes you weak because you're afraid.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       You want to get your fear behind you, pushing you. And so what you want to be as afraid, more afraid of not pursuing your goals than you are of pursuing them. It's very, very helpful. And lots of times in life, and this is something really worth knowing, you know, and this is one of the advantages to being an autonomous adult, is you don't get to pick the best thing. You get to pick your poison. You have two bad choices and you get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through and every choice has a bit of that element in it, and so if you know that, it's really freeing because otherwise you torture yourself by thinking, well, maybe there's a good solution to this. You know, compared to the bad solution. It's like, Nah, Nah. Sometimes there's just risky solution, one and risky solution to and sometimes both of them are really bad, but you at least get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through and that's.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       That actually makes quite a bit of difference because you're also facing it voluntarily then instead of chasing you, and that is an entire different entirely different psychophysiological response. Challenge versus threat. It's not the same. Even if the magnitude of the problem is the same, and so putting yourself in a challenging, let's call it mind frame. You can't just do that by magic. Putting yourself in a challenging mindframe is much, much easier on you cycle physiologically because you don't produce. You don't go into the generalized stress response to the same degree and you're activating your exploratory and seeking systems which are dopaminergic mediated and that involved positive emotion. So if you can face something voluntarily rather than having to chase you, it's way better for you cycle physiologically. So that's partly why. Well, it's worthwhile to go find the dragon in its layer instead of waiting for it to come and eat you.

Speaker 1:          00:14:42       So and especially when you also add the idea that if you go find the dragon in it's layer, you might find it when it's a baby instead of a full fledged bloody monster that is definitely going to take you down. And so that's part of the reason why. Well, there's a whole bunch of things that, that, that emerge out of that observation, like don't avoid small problems that you know, are there, face them because they'll grow into big problems all by themselves. And you can think about, imagine the Tax Department sends you a notification. You owe them like $300. Well it's, you know, that's annoying. Maybe you don't even want to open the letter or maybe if you do, you just put it on the shelf, but that damn thing doesn't just sit there like a piece of paper on the shelf, right? You ignore that for five or six years.

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       It's going to be come attached to all sorts of horrible things and if you ignore it long enough, you get the idea, it's going to turn into something that is completely unlike the little piece of paper that it's written on and and many, many problems in life are like that. You'll see they'll, you'll see that they popped their ugly little head up and you know, and you might want to turn away, might not want not want to think about it, which is the easiest way of turning away, right? You just don't attend to it. It's not like you repress it or anything like that. You just failed to attend to it and that's a really as a longterm strategy. It's dismal. It's also something that I think that's more characteristic of people who are high in neuroticism and high in agreeableness. Agreeable people don't like conflict and people who were high in neuroticism, we were high negative emotion are hit harder per unit of uncertainty or threat, and so you know, that's partly why in psychotherapy, a lot of times the people you see need assertiveness training, so that would be the opposite of agreeableness or they need to help get their anxiety and emotional pain under control.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       It's. Those are not the only reasons. There's antisocial behavior, but you can't fix that in therapy. In all likelihood. There's alcoholism, there's lots and lots of other reasons, but those are two major reasons. So anyways, there is a that was all to tell you that. Oh yes, back to the rat. So okay. The rats are pulling on. You can measure rat motivation by how hard they pull on this on the spring, let's say, and they're more motivated if they're running away and running towards, but let's go back to play. So you can take juvenile routes who haven't been able to play for a while. Maybe they've been isolated or maybe they just haven't been able to engage in physical activity like many school children that you might be thinking about, um, neither allowed to play nor allowed to engage in physical activity. And there's a reason I'm telling you that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:15       So anyways, you get one of these little rats and you can measure all hardy wants, how hard it, he'll pull the go out and play or how many buttons he'll push, you know, and that gives you an indication of his motivation. So anyways, you can see that the play deprived juvenile route will fight harder to play than a non play deprived juvenile rat. And so you can infer that the rat wants to go play and uh, you know, you do that, you do the same measurement with everyone around you. If they want to do something, you're going to poke and prod out them to see what sort of things they're willing to overcome in order to go and do. You'll object even if you don't really object. It's like it's a measurement device. And if they're willing to overcome a bunch of your objections, then you think, oh well maybe they really want to.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       And that's another thing to really know if there's something you want, you need about five arguments about why you wanted, because the probability that the person who is opposing you will have five arguments about why you shouldn't have it, is very low. They just won't have thought it through enough. So the other thing that happens in the future authoring exercises that you're asked to articulate the reasons for all the goals that come out of your vision of the future. So you're asked like why would it be good for you? Why would it be good for your family? Why would it be good for broader society? And so that gives you the three levels of argumentation right there. And if you have it articulated down into detail and it's related to other important goals, then you're, you're a hell of a thing to argue with because people just aren't that deep.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       By which I mean they just don't have that many levels of explanation or objection. And it's also really useful in relationship to your own mind because if you want to do something that's difficult and that requires energy, a lot of different subsystems in your mind, you're going to throw up objections. It's like, well, maybe that isn't what you should be doing right now. Maybe you should be doing the dishes or vacuuming or watching TV or looking at youtube, or if you're really sneaky, when you're trying to do something hard, what your brain does is give you something else hard to do that's not quite as hard so that you can feel justified in not doing the thing you're supposed to because you're doing something else useful. And if you give into that temptation, which you often will, then it winds and because it winds, it gets a little dopamine kick and it grows stronger.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       Every anything you let when the internal argument grows and anything you let be defeated, shrinks because it's punished. It doesn't get to have its way. So that's another thing really to remember. Don't practice what you do not want to become. And because those are their neurological circuits, you build those things in there. Man, they're, they're not going anywhere. You can build another little machine to inhibit them. That's the best you can do. Once they're in there, you can't get them out. So. And then the ones you build to inhibit can be taken out by stress and the old habits will come back up. So you gotta be careful what you say and what you do because you, you build yourself that way. So anyways, back to the rats. Okay? So the little rat gets to go out there and play. Now imagine one little rat is paired with another route, but the little other little route is 10 percent.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       Finger can percent in juvenile rats is enough to obtain permanent dominant. So that 10 percent bigger wrap will win the first wrestling contest. Okay? And so that's what happens. And then the. So the little route gets pinned and maybe they play a bit and then they're done with it. And so you separate them, then you let them play again and the next time what happens is that the subordinate rat does the invitation to play and that's like, you know, like a dog does when it wants to play. You can recognize that kind of displays its feet apart and it up and looks interested in sort of dances around. And you can do with any kid that has a clue, you know, that hasn't been destroyed by adults. If you little three year old kid or four year olds are better for this. If you go like this, they know exactly what's going to happen, you know they're ready to dart back and forth and they'll usually smile and, and kids love rough and tumble play, which is now basically illegal in all daycares.

Speaker 1:          00:21:10       It seriously, it seriously is it. Kids need it so desperately because it teaches them the limits of their body and your body and it teaches them what's painful and what isn't. And it teaches them the dance of play. And without that they're just little disembodied blobs like they have no finance. What? That's what you're checking out when you dance with someone you know you're seeing if they have that, that fluency and facility for mutual reciprocal action in embodied in them, and if they're kind of like this, you know and just have no sense of rhythm and don't pay any attention to you and all of that. You have reason to question whether they actually inhabit their body and whether they can engage in a mutual interaction, the physical interaction that's going to be reciprocal and mutually satisfying. It's really important to check out and a lot of that rough and tumble play.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       Even interactions between a child and it's mother. If you have a happy mother and unhappy infant and you videotape them and you speed up the video tape, you'll see that they're dancing. So one response than the other response than the other responds. It might just be with eye-gaze and movement and all of that, but there's a dynamic interplay which you don't see with depressed mothers and their infants. So okay, so back to play. So the little rat who got is the subordinate one. He has to do the invitation and then the big rat can allow agreed to play because he's in the dominant position, but if you pair them repeatedly, and this is really we're thinking about, because see, morality emerges out of repeated interactions because you might say, well, if you're only interact with someone wants, he might as well just take advantage of them and run off.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       That's what a psychopath does by the way. And there is, there is room in an environmental niche for psychopaths, but they have to keep moving around because otherwise people figure out who they are so they just move around and they can take advantage of one person, you know, maybe five times or 10 times or something, and then the reputation spreads and they gotta get the hell out of there. But so it's not a good longterm strategy unless you can't think of a better one. So anyways, if you repeatedly pair these routes, unless the big rat lets the little rat win, at least 30 percent of the time, the little rat will not ask the big rat to play. And that is, it's a staggering discovery. It's a staggering discovery because you've got the emergence there of a of a implicit morality essentially that's even incarnated in rats that emerges across multiple play sessions.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       It's like, yes, exactly. That's exactly what Piaget said about the emergence of morality. It's exactly the same idea at the right level, so it's. It's a massively and the fact that there's a circuit, a separate neurophysiological circuit that's actually specialized for that sort of thing is also a big deal. Now, the other thing banks have figured out is that if you deprive juvenile rats have the opportunity to engage in rough and tumble play, their prefrontal cortex is don't develop properly and they become impulsive and restless and then you can fix them with methylphenidate or Ritalin and those are the drugs that are used to fix hyperactive kids, most of whom are male, and that's because, well really you're going to take your six year old, your five year old, you know, put them in a desk. You're going to get them to sit there for six hours.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       That's your plan, right? That's a stupid plan and there they are, denied the opportunity to engage in play and that means that their ability to become social is being impaired. It may cause neurological impairment. That's what the evidence suggests and then you suppress that within fed means because amphetamines actually don't activate the play circuit. They activate a different circuit which will suppress the place. So it's very, very. It's not very wise and I'm not going to go off on that tangent because I couldn't tell you why this school systems were set up that way, which I probably will at some point because it's quite an interesting story in and of itself and it's the reason all you guys are sitting in desks right now. Somebody laughingly referred to this one says Grade Fifteen, which I thought was pretty funny given the look at the bloody place, you know, a hideous and so now this is an interesting thing.

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       So you've got the emergence of morality and say, chimps, you've got the emergence of morality and wolves. He got the emergence of morality and rats and the morality governs sequential interactions or group interactions. They have to repeat because. Because it's an emergent property of social or repetitive interactions and that's why you can't just localize it in one instance to repeat it and uh, there's been computer simulations of this too, to help you figure out how you might attain victory across games across time. Maybe you need a strategy and that there's a very simple strategy which I believe is called modified tit for tat. So if you're nice to me, I'm nice back and if you do something bad to me, I do something bad back. But, but imagine you run that out in sequences of a behavior and see who who does best with what strategy across time or an alternative strategy.

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       Here's the best strategy. I trust you. You Trust me, we start interacting, you screw up, I whack you and then I forgive you. And we started getting that's modified, tit for tat. And so, and there hasn't been an issue. It's a very simple algorithm. No one has come up with a better algorithm in computer game, in, in the computerized simulation of game space that not particular strategy. So it's like trust, but don't be a pushover if someone violates the rules, you've got to nail them, but then you don't hold grudge. He opened the door to further interactions. So pretty smart, pretty smart and okay. So anyways, so what this means, because rats can't talk, can't talk and chimpanzees can't talk. And what that means, just as piaget suggested, was that the morality, the development of the morality precedes the development of the linguistic ability to describe the rules for the morality.

Speaker 1:          00:27:06       He said exactly the same thing about kids, right? As they learn how to play games before they know how, what the rules are to the games and so you see that with your playing peekaboo with a kid who they can pick that up like really young to get that right away and there's. You can play with kids almost immediately after they're born if you play simple enough games and so they've got that deep and they're unbelievably playful. So they've got that circuitry ready to go right off the bat. And it's one of the things that makes kids so much fun because they just liked to play all the time. And so if you're, if the play circuit and you hasn't died, which is a bad thing, then you can use that a lot with your kids. And it's one of the things that helps you love them.

Speaker 1:          00:27:47       So that's a good thing. So okay, so the point is that the dam morality emerges before the representation of the morality. It's a big deal to know that and that it emerges as a consequence of repeated social interaction. So it's not a top down thing. It's a bottom up thing. Now with Piaget says, well, it's not just bottom up because what happens with human beings is that they learn to play the games. His one of his experiments was watched seven year olds, I think that's the right age, play marbles. And then you notice that they can play with each other and that they can follow the rules. But then if you take the individual seven year olds out of the game and you say, what are the rules? They give incoherent and incomplete explanations of the rules, so what that means is they've it don't really represent the rules, but they can act them out and they have a partial representation of what they're acting out.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       Now when they get older, the rural representation starts to fall into alignment with the actual rules of the game and you can imagine that's why because when they're playing something like marbles, they're going to have discussions like your treat, your cheating or you're not allowed to do that because they're always going to be pushing the envelope a little bit and then the group is going to render a judgment on whether or not that's appropriate and out of that, the rules are going to emerge, but they're not rules to begin with their patterns of behavior. It's not the same thing as a rule. A rule describes a pattern of behavior, but a pattern of behavior. He has a pattern of behavior. It's something that's acted out, so there's the individual within the group and then the interactions of the individuals within the groups produces a hierarchical arrangement or multiple hierarchical arrangements.

Speaker 1:          00:29:26       Those are games, roughly speaking or stories nested inside an overarching story, which is the fundamental culture, right? And then that's nested in a whole bunch of competing cultures that have some commonalities or they would just be at war all the time, which you know, to some degree they are. So now you see that back to the movie, you see that happening in this movie. I mean it's very, very quick. But the, the um, the blue fairy terns the bug into the conscience and then the bug tries to explain to Pinocchio what the rules of morality are. But the thing is the bug doesn't know because he's just a bug and you know, he, he's, he's just not omniscient. So the best he can do is to come up with like a propaganda stick, semantic verbal representation that's internally contradictory. And when he tells Pinocchio, Pinocchio has no idea what he's talking about and neither does the bug.

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       That's the thing. And so, well, so what happens is this, that the cricket says, well pinnock maybe you and I had better, have a little heart to heart talk and a puppet says y. and the cricket says, well you want to be a real boy, don't you? Alright, sit down son. Now you see the world is full of temptations. Temptations, yes. Temptations. There the wrong things that seem right at the time. But even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the, the wrong things maybe right at the wrong time or vice versa, understand. No, no. And needed to cricket and, and, and that's actually very nicely done in that piece of the movie because as soon as you just want to slap him as soon as he starts talking like that, because while he gets up on his little matchbox and lectures and he's dull and tyrannical both at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       And so there's nothing genuine about what he's saying. He's sort of imitating. He's imitating something that isn't him. So he's really acting like a puppet at that point too. And it doesn't work at all. And so Pinocchio says, I'm going to try to be a good boy. And the cricket says, well that's, that's the spirit son. And then away they go. So all right, so then we're at the next day because this all happens in one night. We're at the next day and you know, it's a nice day and there's these birds flying around. That's actually, that's a bit of foreshadowing there. You know, so I'm not really. You have to remember when you watch something like this movie, not a single bit of it is random or accidental. None of it because you know they had to draw. I don't remember how many frames per second these things are 30.

Speaker 1:          00:32:03       Maybe. Maybe it's a little less than that, but it's high quality automation and so someone had to paint 30 pictures to get a second of this. You're not doing that accidentally. It's really expensive and everyone has to agree on exactly what's going to happen. And you might say, well do the people who are doing this consciously know what they're doing? And the answer to that is, well, sort of just like you do you know it's yes, they no, no they don't. And they know because they're really smart and gifted and all that, but they don't know because it's not all articulated. Plus, they're working in a group so they know and don't know just like you do when you're watching it and so and when you do anything else, so now they're also guided by what you might call they're guided by their unconscious in the in the Freudian and in the cognitive way, partly because your unconscious value structures determine the direction and content of your perceptions and so it's built right into the way you move your eyes because you tend to look at things you value right or things you're afraid of, like you look at things with valence and part of the decision about what has value is dependent on the implicit structure of your moral system, your purse, because morality is about what's good and what isn't, and that's been partly a conscious construction of you, but it's partly something you've been.

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       You've picked up by interacting with people like mad ever since you were born. You don't know all the rules anymore than the damn cricket did. You just don't and you can't because you're too complicated, but you act them out and then you also have representations of how people act in your imagination. Dreams are. That's what a dream is. That's what a fantasy is. That's what that little movie that plays inside your head when you remember what you did is, and you only remember the just you know, so even the the images stick representation of your behavior in your past, which is basically your episodic memory. It's already selecting and molding and turning it into a relatable story. It can't help but do that. It's the only way you can represent it and so you don't know how you do that or why you do that, but part of it's governed by this implicit morality that's part of your procedural memory system.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       Part of the way you act and part of the way you move your eyes and listen to things and focus on them and that's all been instantiated inside of you because of this immense social, your biology, but also this immense social project that you're continually engaged in and so that informs what you remembered. It informs what you imagined. It informs what we collectively imagine. It informs what we can collectively understand and partly what you're doing well, you become conscious of yourself is to map the implicit structures that already constitute you from society into explicit representation. That's what self understanding means and you know when you have that moment of insight about something you've done, it's like you're watching your this repetitive behavior that you've manifested probably that got you in trouble. You know it's your characteristic way of falling accidentally into chaos and you talk about your problems.

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       You talk about them with your friends, you talk about them and maybe you have dreams about them and you're, you're trying to relate them and you have memories about them that you can't get rid of because they're negatively tones. So you talk about them and then someone comes up with a little statement that links them together, causley and he thank God that's what I'm doing. And then maybe you can stop doing it or at least, or at least maybe. Then you can think of some strategies for not doing it anymore, but it's not like, you know, it's like you're acting it out, you know it that way, but until that's until the representation matches that pattern, that click of insight doesn't occur and that's like a revelation. It's a really good way of thinking about it because the knowledge is there and it's implicit forum and all of a sudden bang.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       It's been made explicit as a fantasy maybe or also as a, as a set of semantic statements. You know, maybe you're, you have a crush on someone and you don't notice it and maybe you find yourself having a fantasy about him. You Think, oh, that means something that indicates something. Maybe you don't want to know that that's what you want. But the fantasy will tell you. And one of the things you suggested, and this is sort of out of the Freudian tradition of free associations, is watch yourself. Watch your fantasies because they're always happening and so, and they'll tell you something. And so one of the things I do when when I'm interacting with my clients is we'll have a discussion and then they'll let their eyes will drift a little bit and I'll know that there, that something's flitted through their mind, you know, and that means we've touched on something that has multiple, a multiplicity of elements.

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       And so I'll stop and say, look, I noticed that you maybe you tear it up. That's another thing to really watch her. Maybe you laugh or you drifted. At least it's like it's because some other thought has entered your field of consciousness. And then if you can get the person to grab those thoughts, to notice them, then you can often figure out the avenues along which that particular conversation might unfold. That's a complex, that's a union complex or a psychoanalytic complex. It's like there's an emotional core that produces a whole range of associated ideas and that thing's got a life. It's like a micro personality and it might have resentment and it might have anger. It's often negative emotion tinge because the negative emotion tinge episodes are still problems and they will emerge automatically because your threat detection systems force them onto your consciousness essentially so you watch and where when you drift you will drift and the fantasy is partly a representation of the problem space.

Speaker 1:          00:37:36       You know that happens when you wake up at three in the morning and you're worried about things, right? Because actually what happens is you wake up during threat processing and if you're depressed actually that gets so intense you can't sleep, so then you just lay there all night worrying, not fun, and those are fantasies about the negative elements of your past, present and future, and the fantasies can also breed solutions. And that's partly why Freud regarding dreams as wish fulfillment. It's partly that and he wasn't. That was where he stopped. It's not correct. It, it's partially correct. It's like the fantasy will provide you with a problem and a potential solution, but they're more like problem identification mechanisms. The fantasies with the possibility of a solution built in. And so a way of thinking about that is that you can generate potential futures, so they're like each segregated environments according to the rules of your fantasy.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       Then you can generate little avatars of yourself that didn't have at each of those little universes and you can run them as simulations and then you can watch what happens in the simulation and if it's a catastrophe, then you don't have to act it out. And that's exactly not exactly. That's akin to what you're doing when you go watch a movie, except that is much more coherent and well thought through. And then just a dream which is often quite fragmentary. And that's partly because of the dream is willing to sacrifice coherence to play with category structures, you know? And that's why in dreams things can change from one thing into another. Really weirdly or scenes can change from one scene to another without a logic. The logic gets loosened so that the experience of your thinking can widen and it's, it's not. It's dangerous to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       And that's partly why you do it. When you're asleep and paralyzed, you don't run around and act out your, your suit, a puddle fantasies, you know where you're stretching yourself out into the world. There is no risk. Exactly and so although it can be bad enough so you'll wake up in terror, you know, but that's better than being in a crocodile's mouth by a large margin. Anyways, back to these, these birds, these are used later in the movie as a manifestations of the holy spirit, roughly speaking, and of course that's a standard Christian symbol. Although as I mentioned, the dove often represents the holy spirit and we'll talk about that later, but this movie has very strong pagan elements in it, as I mentioned before, as opposed to a strictly Christian symbolism. But, but that's a foreshadowing. And what it foreshadows is that while a new day has dawned, it's the emergence of new consciousness and everything last night went well really well.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       Everything in the, let's call it the unconscious say, after time stops, that all went well and so the new day is full of promise and so the birds are singing in, the sun is shining and like hooray. And so that's exactly so that sets. This is the next scene, right? So it sets the tenor for that scene just like the introductory song does. So. So anyways. Then you see all these kids playing and enthusiastic so they're off to school which is presented in a positive light and so that's where you get socialized is Pinocchio is ready to go beyond the boundaries of the familial home and he's ready because his father prepared amend because his mother prepared and so he goes off and he's not going off alone. He's going with his conscience and which is sort of the Internet. You could think about it again as the internalized representation of nature and society and so he's not going out there alone even though he's not very good at it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:12       And he's pretty excited about this. And so is Japan. See Japan is standing there paralyzed with terror and the kid isn't phobic of the outside world and so that's, he's, he's right. He's treating it as an adventure. I mean, even though, well, it's an adventure, but adventure's can be dangerous. What if the other, you can imagine a kid, especially one who's like high in neuroticism, who hasn't been encouraged sufficiently to overcome that? Let's say their primary idea might be, well, what if the other kids don't like me? That's a big one. What if the teachers don't like me? What if the other kids won't play with me? It's like, yeah, what if that's rough man? And if, if you're not a playful kid, it could easily be the case. So, but that's not Pinocchio. He's like spinning out, ready to go. And so good. Good.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       He's got naive but enthusiastic. Okay, well that at least gets the ball rolling. Now you've got these two evil creatures here, the Fox and the cat. Um, I think this one's based on one of the Marx brothers, actually Harpo Marx, who I believe never said anything, but be that as it may. There are these Ne'er do well characters, um, the Fox in particular, now fox is a standard trickster animal, right? It's a, it's a, it's, it's, it's a classic animal. Maybe because it's good at hiding and it's good at hunting. I don't know exactly why, but it's, and coyotes are like that too. They're classic trickster animals. Um, he's Kinda like Wiley Coyote, in fact, you know, the, the, the warner brothers character whose genius at large and of course whose arrogance continually gets him walloped and this character has a lot of features like that, but he, he's, he feigns being, uh, an English gentleman of the 18 nineties and pretends to be educated and, and, uh, it has our kind of high blown way of talking and he's a fraud through and through and he's got, he's got this, you know, sidekick who is barely there at all and he doesn't treat him that well, but he's got someone to Lord it over.

Speaker 1:          00:43:17       So that keeps his dominance hierarchy thing going well. And the fact that he's like a second rate companion while he never really noticed is that although he'll treat him contemptuously whenever he gets a chance. So anyways, they're walking down the street and, uh, the, uh, Fox is bragging away about some crooked thing that he's done and how he pulled the wool over someone's eyes. And he confuses that with a wisdom and intelligence. And one of the things that you see this is worth knowing too, because if you're preyed upon by a psychopath, which you will be to some degree at some point in your life, the psychopath who will be narcissistic will presume that you're stupid and, and, and that you deserve to be taken advantage of because you're naive and stupid. So it's actually a good thing that he's doing it. And, uh, he, his proof for, and I'm saying he, because there are more male psychopaths, um, the, uh, the proof that you're stupid naive is that he can take advantage of you.

Speaker 1:          00:44:14       And so like if you were wiser you, you'd be, you know, you'd, you'd know his tricks and then it wouldn't be morally necessary for him to show you just exactly who knows what about what. And so the psychopath will use his ability to fool you as proof of his own grandiose, grandiose omnipotence, omniscience and narcissism. And the problem with that is that you can be fooled by a psychopath and virtually anybody can. So that Robert Hare, for example, who studied psychopaths for a long time and interviewed a lot of them, like hundreds of them and videotape many of the interviews he said when he was talking to the psychopath, he always believed what they were saying. And then he'd watched the video afterwards and see where the conversation went off the rails. But you know, the pro, the proclivity to be polite in a conversation is very strong.

Speaker 1:          00:45:06       And if you're polite, you don't object to the way that the person unfolds their strategy. You know? And psychopaths are pretty good at figuring out how to manipulate obviously, how to manipulate people and the probability that you will be immune to that is extraordinarily low. Go Watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed by policemen on, on Youtube. That's bloody. That's enlightening man. Paul Bernardo, he's like the CEO of a meeting in that video, you know, he gives the cops hell. It gives lawyers hell. He protested his innocence. He basically tells them that they're rude and untrustworthy because they don't trust him because he did a few little things 17 years ago and he gets away with it. A few little things, right? I mean, he killed a bunch of people, including the sister of his girlfriend at the time and you know, he was a repeat sexual offender and murderer.

Speaker 1:          00:45:55       It's like, but he basically goes, well, you know, that's a long time ago. It's like we're, we're past that, aren't we? I mean, I'm having a discussion with you. I'm trying to solve help you solve some crimes, which by the way, I committed, but we won't bring that up. You know, and you're, you're, you're, you're accusing me of being a liar, like you're not playing fair what, what's up with you? And then when they answer, he looks at his fingernails, which is like, that's a lovely little manipulative thing because it basically means whatever happens to be under my fingernail at the moment is much higher priority than listening to your story and you watch, you'll see people do that to you and then you get a little insight into what they're up to. He's very good at that and so. Or he looks outside or, or are you just looking at his hands?

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       He looks out the window immediately. Dismissive and his nonverbal behavior pr. It's brilliant that the courts were forced to release that by the way, but look it up, Paul Bernardo on Youtube. Wow. It's, it's just mind boggling. It's he's so good at what he does and he's good looking and he's charismatic and he can really pull it off and you can't tell what's happening with the cops and the lawyers, whether they're just letting him play as a routine to get some information from them or whether he's actually setting them back on his heels. And I suspect it's a bit of both, but it's a masterful performance. If you didn't know who he was and you were watching it without the audio, you'd think he's the CEO of some company given its employees hell for not being up to scratch. That's all his body language, his eye contact, everything just speaks to that.

Speaker 1:          00:47:24       It's amazing. So anyways, you've got these two bit hoods here who think they're really something. They also think they're tough and dangerous and and they're not. They're just cowardly and cornered dwellers. And, and they confuse their unwillingness to abide by reasonable rules as indication of their heroic courage, which is something else that low rent hoods like to do. You know? And it's partly because lots of people who just attend to the law do do that because they're cowardly, which is a Nietzschean observation. Are you good? Are you just afraid? Let's start with afraid first before we proceed to good. And that the reason that you follow the rules is because you're afraid of getting caught. Yeah. Well, you know, those kids who I often university kids who are in like a hockey riot and they ended up breaking windows and stealing things and you know, they get nailed for it and afterwards they're really blown away by their own behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       It's like, well they're in that camp. It's like they think they're good people, but they're not. They're just never anywhere where you could be bad. And as soon as you put them somewhere where they could be bad, it's like, would it comes just like that? And that's, that's really worth thinking about because most of you, many of you but not all of you, I suspect have never really been somewhere that you could be really bad and get away with it. And so you might think, well, you wouldn't do it, but, but people do it all the time. So anyways, they're talking about some exploits and then they see that this character named Stromboli who's a Marionette, he has a puppet show, right? And uh, he's kind of a wheeler dealer to remember you. I showed you that, that mask that was glaring out Pinocchio when he got his voice, it's like Stromboli isn't one of his manifestations.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       These Fox here is another one of his manifestations and all of the negative characters throughout the movie are manifestations of the same thing. It's partly the adversarial individual and it's partly the theoretical aspect of society. It's the negative masculine that's, that's one way of thinking about it. So, and you know, when men go bad, they often go bad by being antisocial and tyrannical. So where there's way more antisocial men than are anti social women, which is why there's 20 times as many men in jail as there are women. So each gender, let's say each sex has its own path, characteristic pathologies. And there are some antisocial women, you know, and, and there are some high neuroticism guys who are, who are, or some guys who are really agreeable as well, so, but they're rarer. So anyways, he sees this, this a poster advertising strombolis puppet show.

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       So strombolis a puppet master. Now that's really worth thinking about because that's an archetypal theme or it's at least attached to an architectural theme. Some things behind the scenes pulling the strings. And everybody always wonders what that is. Right? What's actually going on? What's actually going on with trump? Who's actually in control? Is it Putin? I mean, that's, that's the, that's the fantasies of the left. It's potent. It's like, well, the question always is what's going on behind the seed? Right? And the question is, that's the case, certainly on the political landscape, the business landscape, interpersonal relations, what, what are you really up to? Everyone's always wondering that right there. That's why they're watching your eyes because your eyes pointed things and they can infer what you're interested in. And then what you're up to by looking at what you look at. And that's why your eyes have whites is so that we can see where you're pointing because gorillas don't.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       And so, so what that means roughly speaking, is that all of your ancestors whose eyes couldn't be reliably tracked were either killed or didn't mate. It's a big deal for us to see where people's eyes are pointed. And so we're always watching each other's eyes constantly. What are you up to? What are you up to? What are you looking at? What do you want? And I want to know because if I know what you want, I can predict how you're going to behave and that also means I can cooperate with you or I can compete with you or I can lie to you, but all the information is in the eyes of surrounded by the facial display, right? Because that's also an indication of motivation and emotion. And so we're trying like our eyes are so good at that. But for you guys sitting there in the back, I can tell if you're looking at my eyes or at my Chin and the deviation in your eyes is so tiny that it's.

Speaker 1:          00:51:53       It's a kind of miracle that we're capable of making that perceptual observation, so really important to us. So. And we have really good eyes. So that's another thing about us. So anyways, what's going on behind the scenes? Well, if you look at Stromboli, you might be thinking it's not clear he, someone you'd want to have pulling your strings, like there's a little bit of forced enthusiasm, let's say there. And he's just not a very savory look and character. So anyways, the Fox knows them and they start talking about Stromboli. That'll joker and then what they could, how they could possibly involve hidden in him in some sort of scam because he's back in town and then they see the puppet and the Fox does his equivalent of thinking, which is, you know, pretty sad but, and nasty, but that's what he does. And then they see this puppet with no strings and they think, hey man, a puppet master would pay a lot for something that is capable of semi autonomous movement like that.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       It would be kind of a miracle. And so they decided that they're going to take them to Stromboli. And so they grab them and he's, he's got an apple to take to the teacher, which I think it's the cat promptly eats and uh, that the FARC saw acts out this sort of false enthusiasm about what Pinocchio is up to and pretends that he's his friend, which is of course what your typical pedophile will do. And so this is in the same kind of category and it truly is. So one of the things that's to know about pedophiles and is that they're predatory, right? And so they don't go after kids that are assertive and likely to be noisy. They watch and they watch to see if they can find a kid who's defeated and that's good enough who's defeated and who is going to need a friend and who's not going to object.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       And so when they check out, these are the ones who do the stranger abductions, which are, by the way extraordinarily rare. They look for a victim type. They look for a kid who's going to be easy to take down. And so, you know, that's one thing you don't want. So you might think, well, one of the things that was really big and it's probably even worse now when I was a parent of young children, was to teach your kids how to be afraid of strangers. It's like a no wrong id. That is not what you teach them because all you do is teach the men to be timid and fearful and the real predatory types there are, there are pretty much thrilled about that because you'll also make them sheltered and naive, you know, so that is you make your kids courageous and you get the damn eyes open and that's the best thing you can do to protect them against people who are truly dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       So none of that terrifying that it's not a good idea. Anyways, they, the, the Fox befriends the puppet, and then they come up with this evil scheme to get them off to Stromboli, the puppet master and the way they go and they sing a little song about being an actor, an actor's life. For me, and this took me a long time to figure out, I thought they're taking Pinocchio away to be an actor. Now why in the world are actors getting such a rough time in this movie? It's like it's a Hollywood movie, you know, it's acting obviously the voiceovers and all that are acting. It's why. What is this thing about being an actor? And then I thought, oh, I get it. I see what's going on that they seem to Pinocchio about the delights of unearned celebrity. So He's, he's doesn't have to go and get an education.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       He doesn't have to take the difficult route. He can take the easy way to dominance, to success, two dominant success. He can circumvent all the hard work and go right to the top, you know, and when you think about phenomena like the Kardashians family and how popular they are, part of that is this desire that people have for unearned celebrity because you can get to the top without any sacrifices and without any work. And if you're really cynical, you know, you think that the people at the top are just there by accident anyways and it might as well be you. And of course there's a lot of naivety in that as well. And, and a fair bit of, you know, not a fair lack of wisdom and all of that, but the actor idea here is that you can, you can pretend to be something you're not and that that's the proper route of anyone wise to success.

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       It's the ultimate and cynicism and it's a nihilistic perspective as well and that's how they interact and they say, look, why are you going? Why are you bothering to go to school? That's going to take 18 years with all of your talents. You can just go on the stage, your name will be up in lights, you'll be out the top and no time. And what is the puppet? No. And plus he does have some talents. He is after all, a semi autonomous puppet. Now he doesn't exactly know how special that makes them, but the Fox can obviously see something in him and he's good at playing that, naive it often in offering these false promises. But see, the thing is one of the things that Carl Jung said that I thought was really interesting when he was talking about the whole situation and families. I never forgot this, so the eatables situation, roughly speaking is when I'll lay out the classic story is when a child is seriously overprotected, usually a male child by his mother.

Speaker 1:          00:57:18       Now the reverse can be the case and it can be a female child by the mother and all of that, but I'll just talk about the classic case to begin with. Now what Freud observed was that there were usually not very good boundaries in families like that and so the relationship between the husband and the wife was either strange or nonexistent and the wife would often turn to the child to be what she isn't getting from the husband, and so there's a great south park episode about this, a wonderful south park episode where they were. I don't remember that horrible little guy. Is that. That's him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And his mother brings in the dog whisperer to train him and it's brilliant. It's brilliant episode. If you want to learn about Freudian, Freudian eatable situation, you, you watch that. You've got it down cold because she brings in this expert who then she wants to have an affair with.

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       So that's a boundary issue and he basically separates her son from him and, and, and imposes the same discipline on him that he would do impose on a bad dog, although he also trains the dogs owners all the time because maybe it's not the dog, maybe it's the owner. There's a horse whisperer movie too, about the original horse whisperer that does a beautiful job of laying that out too because he's very good at fixing problem horses and unbelievably good at diagnosing psychopathology on the part of the owner. It's his, he's got a gift for it. But anyways, what happens in this South Park episode is that the dog whisperer gets cartland yeah, straightened out and he starts like dressing properly and doing his homework. And, and the mother is pursuing an affair with the dog whisperer, but he's professionally keeps his distance, like he keeps boundaries around them.

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       And uh, then he leaves. And then the first thing that she does when he leaves his bride cartman basically out of doing his homework so that he can accompany her to know a fast food restaurant or something like that. And so the reason she does that is because she's lonesome and it doesn't have anybody else around and you know, maybe she's also deeply, deeply, deeply terrified that if she helps that boy grow, he will leave and she'll have nothing, you know. And so mothers who don't have something say outside their infants, not merely their children are more likely to fall into that. And it's no wonder, you know, you got to think that through. And lots of women really, most women really fall in love with their babies, you know. And so even if they start growing into larger children, that can be threatening because, well, when the, when the child turns into, when the infant turns into a toddler that the infant is dead, there's the toddler is there now and you can radically interfere with that process.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       That happens all the time, all the time. That's the classic Freudian eatable nightmare. And that episode is brilliant. It's bloody brilliant. It just nails it. And some of you have been in my personality class and watched crumb the documentary crum. And that's another staggering exposition of exactly that kind of pathology. Anyways, one of the things young pointed out, so I knew this guy wants who had a mother who basically was trying that trick and she had lots of. She was very smart and had lots of tricks up our sleeves and there's just no way he was going to go for it. He rebelled at every possible moment and he basically became, I would say, somewhat hypermasculine in response, which is a, which is an interesting lesson with regards to the hypermasculinity that boys often develop if they're raised by single mothers because they tend to go one of two ways and he just fought her at every step of the way and it didn't happen.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       But one of the things you said, which I loved, and you can really see this in the chrome documentary, is that the oedipal mother basically entices. The child says, look, here's the deal. You don't have to do anything but you don't get to leave. But if you don't leave and you don't do these difficult things, then I'll take care of you. And the child has a choice all the way along there. I mean, obviously he's outclassed in some sense, but it's not as obvious as you'd think little kids are tough and they make decisions all the time and so young thought about it more as a conspiracy than as something imposed on the child by the mother. And I really like. It's actually a conspiracy between mother, father and child actually. And I think that's a good way of looking at it even though it's really rough because said, well, should you hold a child responsible?

Speaker 1:          01:01:36       Well, yes, but judiciously and not completely because then if you deal with someone like that as an adult and they're trying to escape from it, you have to go all the way back and figure out how the hell it happened. And then they have to adjust. They have to figure out where they opened the door, like inviting a vampire in because they can't come in unless you invite them in, you know, so don't invite them in because once they're in, they're really hard to get rid of and they'll take all your blood. So that's a cautionary tale. So anyways, Pinocchio doesn't know any better and he's got the egotism of, you know, of youth and he's offered the easy way to success, which is exactly what the Fox tells them and off they go to see Stromboli. So this is the song, I'm not going to read it all. It's great to be a celebrity and actor's life for me.

Speaker 2:          01:02:26       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       sleep till after to you promenade a big cigar, you tour the world in a private car, you dine on chicken and caviar and actor's life for me. So it's all this idea of, of wealth and public exposure and zero attention whatsoever to anything regarding responsibility or discipline or learning. And so it's a dual attraction, right? You get everything we want and you don't have to do anything. Jesus, what a deal. And so that's what the act or represents. It's, it's a liar. Fundamentally, it's someone who's acting out a, a deception there, a persona in the union sense. So the persona is the mask you wear in public that you might even think you are, but you're not. It's this mask and that's the act. That's the persona. So the Fox and the cat or inviting the puppet to only become a persona and and that's, that's see for young, you start as a persona and then when you start to investigate the parts of you that don't really fit in that persona, that would be the shadow.

Speaker 1:          01:03:32       Then you start understanding who you really are and that's shocking because the persona contains everything roughly speaking that you think is good and maybe even that your immediate culture thinks is good and then the shadow contains everything that's not part of that and some of that's really bad, but some of it is good, disguised as bad, and you can't break out of the persona and transcended until you incorporate a lot of what's in the shadow. And so for example, if you're an extraordinarily compassionate person, let's say 98th percentile will say you're going to be sacrificing yourself to other people all the time and there are people who will find that extraordinarily endearing and it will be under some circumstances. But the problem is is that you will sacrifice yourself and that's a really bad attitude to have. For example, towards adult males. It's a great thing for infants, but for adult males it is the wrong approach and so you will get taken advantage of continually by people who are looking for someone like you until you grow some teeth and you'll think, no, no.

Speaker 1:          01:04:35       That's the opposite of compassion. Being able to bite hard is the opposite of compassion, which it is, and so you'll have that pushed into the predatory category. I'm not doing that. I'm not getting angry. I don't like conflict. It's like until you bring that out of the depths and put it on so you can use it, you're going to be in trouble and that's kind of niches, idea of the reevaluation of good and evil, right? You have a sense of what's good in a sense of what isn't with your conscience, but it's not very smart. It's got things in the wrong boxes and a lot of the things that even nature itself, a lot of the things that you accept as untrammeled goods like compassion, let's say have a very dark side first of all and are not enough to get you through life. You need the opposite virtues to and so you have to develop them and so you get outside the persona to do that, but anyways, Pinocchio was invited to be a false persona, to take the gains of celebrity without having to do anything to be educated.

Speaker 1:          01:05:36       He's just going to go right to the top from right where he is and you know people are kind of fascinated by that idea. That's why you watch America's got talent or the x factor with your shows. I actually love, by the way you. You never see narcissism in its pure forms. Then you see it when you watch people who display an absolute lack of talent and become homicidal. When someone dares pointed out, right, accusatory and homicidal instantly, it's really something, and then now and then you do see one of these people who's so introverted and so out of society and have this unbelievable gift, which is also something really remarkable to see and it's no wonder those things are so popular, they're psychologically stored nearly interesting. So okay, so that's the actor first of the nokias temptations, and of course it's the first one because he's entering the social world and the temptation in the social world is to be exactly what other people want you to be and the thing that's cool about that is that is what you should be doing right?

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       When you go out in your peers, you should be not subjugating your individuality to your peers because that's not exactly right. That's kind of based on an inhibition model. You know you've got aggression that you've got bad habits. They have to be inhibited. You learn that by interacting with your peers. It's not the right model. PSJ, that's a Freudian model. Piaget was was correct about that. He basically pointed out that what should happen is let's say with your aggression and hopefully you have some, is that it gets socialized and so you learn how to play games, but you don't drop your drive to when you integrate that in the games and so you try to, when you try to play hard, but if you're defeated or you hit something negative, you don't respond negatively and you can keep that all bounded within being a fair, a good player, a fair, a fair player, and that means what's happening is you just learn how to play a game or a set of games that also includes the darker parts of you and they actually become part of your force of character.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       It's way better if you can pull that off. It's and, and that's what you definitely want to do as an adult. Like all you people are going to have to learn to negotiate on your own behalf and that that's really hard. It means that you have to know what you want. You have to be able to communicate it and you have to be able to say no and to say no. You have to be built on a solid foundation. You have to have options, so you've got to remember that as you go through your life is like if you don't have options, you can't negotiate with someone and if you're not willing to use them, they win period, because if you're asking your boss for more money, say the answer is no because he doesn't have any spare money lying around that he can just give to you and lots of other people are asking, so some of that zero some stuff, you know, not all of it because often you cooperate with people in the whole pot can grow, but some of it's zero sum and so you better have a case made.

Speaker 1:          01:08:31       It's like, here's why I should. Here's how much money I should have. Here's why. Here's the benefit to you that will accrue if you don't, if you do it, here's the consequences that you don't. They're actually real. They will cost you and I will do them. It's like then you can negotiate and you don't do that rudely, but those arguments, you better have them in order like so. For example, if you're going to negotiate for a raise or a or a status shift, you better have your resume out, hand all polished up and nowhere else you're going to look for a job and you better be able to get one because otherwise you're just. You're weak and you will not win the negotiation, and if you're too agreeable, so your conflict avoidant, you will make less money across time that's already been well established and that's because you don't have teeth, not enough, and so in the little micro contests that you're going to have every day, you're going to incrementally lose to people who are more aggressive, who have bigger teeth, and that's what happens so, so don't let that happen. You want to, you place yourself so you can negotiate because otherwise

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       you're just a facade and when a real battle of facade is just torn down right away. So yes, well say no more.

Speaker 1:          01:09:55       Well, the cricket, he's supposed to be helping to pop it out, but he overslept. It's like, that's just another indication that he's not everything he could be yet, and that's really, that took me a long time to puzzle out with regards to interpreting this movie. I could not figure out, alright, I told you this, if the bug is the person who opens the hero narrative and who can guide the transformations of time and who has the same initials as Jesus Christ, it's like, is like knighted by nature herself. Why is he such an idiot? It's a very difficult thing to figure out, but, but the idea that the conscience isn't omniscient, even though it has that sort of, that voice of, of let's say common sense. Uh, and that fits very nicely in with the Freudian idea of the Super Ego. Again, because the Super Ego can be flawed, it can be too harsh, it can not be, it can not be properly developed.

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       You see that often with people who are orderly, so they're high in conscientiousness, conscientiousness fragments into industriousness and orderliness orderly. People like willpower, they're very judgmental and they like things to be exactly where they're supposed to be, but they're also very self punitive. So conservatives are much more likely to be orderly by the way it's. It's one of the best predictors of conservative low openness is the best predictor, but right after that is high, high orderliness. So. And it's associated with disgust sensitivity, which is really an amazing thing. We'll talk about that later. Anyways, the cricket. Oh, he falls down on his first day on the job. He's not as conscientious a conscious. He's not as conscientious a conscience as he should be. So he's feeling pretty stupid. He's got his little millionaire clothes on there, but he's really not living up to them. So he does catch up to the Fox and the puppet however, and tries to dissuade Pinocchio from going down this road hand.

Speaker 1:          01:11:49       Of course the cat. Well you can see what the cat is doing. Mary's going to big hammer, big Mellott and he's gonna. He also shows you just exactly how much of a clue he has. He's going to wall up the bug who's sitting on the foxes hat, which I think he actually does and you know, then the farcs can't get out of his hat and has to talk through his hat, which basically is what he's doing the whole time. Anyways. So this I really like. So you see on the left here that cricket is speaking inside this flower, you know, and like I said, there's nothing accidental in these, in these representations. So these are artists who are coming up with these compositions and they fantasy has a structure and so the cricket is speaking out of this flower that has. Well, you could think about it as, it has a sexualized element.

Speaker 1:          01:12:37       So you can think about that as a part of it and not part of the feminine part of it. Well, they are flowers after all. They are the sex organs of plants. And so, and that's very much the same over here as this is the Yoni and lingam misses from, from, uh, from Hindu cultures. And so, and they see there's a snake wrapped around that. And so that's masculine and feminine with a snake wrapped around it and that's, that's a wholly representation, you know, sacred representation and it represents, it represents the deepest reality. That's one way of thinking about it, like chaos and order surrounded by the snake. It's the same. Exactly the same idea. And so the cricket speaks out of that already know that because the cricket is the conscience and he's been awakened in part by by Japan, Eto and the good father and awakened in part by the good fairy and nature.

Speaker 1:          01:13:26       And so he speaks with those voices and, and he's also a manifestation of, of the underlying chaos itself because nature and culture spring out of chaos. You know, I already showed you that schematic representation. Okay. So I'll just, I'll just end this scene and then we'll have like a 15 minute break. Okay. So anyways, the cricket tries to make a case for why Pinocchio shouldn't go off to be a celebrity, but you know, it's a hard case to make because the Fox is very manipulative and Pinocchio is naive and it sounds like a good offer. And also the Fox is actually quite forceful, you know, he basically takes them by the hand. So the temptation is, and this is something else I liked about the movie, you can't just say, well the puppet gets what he deserves because he's little naive and what he's facing is really malevolent, truly malevolent and physically overpowering. And so the movie does a nice job of not minimizing the threat that's posed by this particular temptation. And that's part of what makes it art. Okay, good. So we'll stop there. We'll have a break for 15 minutes and then we'll start with the stage. So. Alright. So here we are at the big event in Pinocchio is off to be a celebrity.

Speaker 1:          01:14:48       And the cricket is watching. And a Pinocchio basically. Well he's got some natural talent because he's, he's a puppet, he doesn't have strings and he goes on stage and with strings and then he drops his strings and the whole crowd was amazed. And the crowds should be amazed when that happens. Right. You can imagine when a kid goes to school and show some independence that that's actually gonna.

Speaker 1:          01:15:18       People are gonna notice that he's his peers are gonna notice that the teachers are going to notice that maybe it's too much independence even. Right, but it's still a. It is a remarkable thing to like. It's so interesting. You know, you can see marked signs of independence and children. Well, right from the time they're born basically because what's one of the things that's really funny about infants is that, you know, when they're crying you always say, oh, the baby's while you're crying. It's maybe sad. It's like, no, a lot of the time that maybe is angry and the way that we know that is because you could do facial expression coding on infants just like on, on adults and you can tell what emotion they're expressing and very frequently, like when the kid starts to recognize his mom explicitly because he or she knows the smell right away pretty much in the sound of the voice.

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       But visually, if someone comes in and it isn't who the baby wants, so generally it isn't mom, the baby will start to cry, but it's not [inaudible] the baby. Sad. Generally it's because it's angry that mom didn't show up and that's an early sign of will. It's like this kid has this kid wants things like and it's perfectly willing to tell you about that and of course a two year old who's having a temper tantrum is in some sense doing the same thing. It's poorly integrated will and independence obviously, but it certainly runs contrary to what you want. You don't want your two year old having a temper tantrum in the middle of the toy store. It's extraordinarily embarrassing for you and while for you, but it's also embarrassing for the two year old. That's one of the reasons I think that that sort of thing should be carefully socialized rapidly because it's actually humiliating for the kid because other people don't like that and they're very judgemental about like they won't say anything usually, but sometimes they will, but they're not happy about the fact that that's happening and they will judge the child negatively.

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       So you don't want your child to be behaving in a way in public that makes other people think badly of them. It's really, it's really not good and so you, you're part of your job as a parent is to not expose your child to that sort of experience, especially not repeatedly. It's really hard on them or they get narcissistic, which is also really hard on them. It's just, it takes a lot longer to manifest itself. So anyways, he's off on stage and Stromboli introduces him and talks about how wonderful this is going to be and Nokia, it comes out on stage with the strings on and drops them and then he falls down the steps and put his nose in the whole. It makes a fool out of himself and that's when Stromboli first time Stromboli shows his true character because he just really yells and screams at him and he has his back to the audience Stromboli while he's doing this.

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       So he's not noticing how the audience is reacting. Typical to radical parent, right? Who's not noticing that society is reacting a different way than in him and he's not happy about it. And Pinocchio of course is dazed and feels like a fool and he is a fool. So that's appropriate. But then Stromboli, here's the crowd laughing, and as soon as he turns around, he's like all smiles again, and so that's the first time you get insight into what sort of puppet master he is. He's there to please the crowd and that all and he's there to look good in public. But fundamentally he's a tyrant. And so, and I guess that's the problem, the problem with false celebrity is that the negative spirit of the crowd becomes your master, right? Because to be a celebrity you have to be a crowd pleaser. And if you're pleasing the kind of crowd who likes a celebrity like you, which is, and there's not much reason for that, then it's not exactly like you're appealing to the proper side of the crowd and you've become, it's puppet one way or another. And maybe it's rewarding you with wealth perhaps and with attention, but fundamentally it's not. It's not something I would recommend if you want to stay reasonably psychologically healthy for any reasonable amount of time, you're going to sell yourself out. And I don't mean not in any casual way, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:19:19       All right. So anyways,

Speaker 1:          01:19:21       Stromboli changes from the tyrant to the good father in half a second, He gives Pinocchio Pat on the head despite the fact that he's made a mistake, looks all kind and the show continues. Now, the cricket is not very happy about this. He's sitting in the stage watching. He's very angry and let's say disgusted by what's happening, partly because Pinocchio was making a fool of himself. Now that's an interesting thing. You know, human beings blush. In fact, if I remember correctly, the name Adam, you know, like Adam and eve is related to the capacity to blush. Now that, that comes from something I read a long time ago, and that might be wrong, but Adam does manifest shame in the sight of God. So there, there is a relationship there, but anyways, um, people do make fools of themselves for, for public display. And you can tell you've done that in some sense, not always if you blush because you've either said something you shouldn't have and you know, you realize that, which is more like you've, you've tried to be funny and gotten a little bit too far.

Speaker 1:          01:20:25       And sometimes that can be really funny, or you said something that you know, to be false, manipulative, deceitful beneath you or any of those things, and you'll have an automatic response to it. It'd be ashamed and blush. And one theory about that is that you can trust people who blush. And so because you know that their conscience will be trade that and so that even if they are lying, they tell you. And so it's an interesting theory, you know, because blush is definitely like, it's a facial display, you know, it's right out there where people can see it. So, you know, maybe that's true, maybe it isn't, but it's kind of an interesting idea. Anyways. The cricket is not happy with what's going on. He's not happy boats, Stromboli and he's not happy about the willingness of Pinocchio to make a fool of himself to support this false celebrity.

Speaker 1:          01:21:13       And so I actually think that's why the celebrity types like that often get narcissistic and arrogant. You know, it's because they, they aren't paying attention, they're not paying attention really to what's happening inside of them. They drowned it out because the glory. And the money and all that is so attractive and enticing. They don't notice. They refuse to notice what price they're paying for it and they magnify up their grandiosity and their arrogance to keep that stuff all under control. And then of course they get surrounded by sycophants, which is a really bad thing, right? They, they get surrounded by people who will tell them exactly what they want to hear and that's really bad if what you want to hear from other people is not good for you to surround yourself with people who won't offer you genuine criticism or even genuine reward. It's the same thing like you want for me, that I differentially reward and punish you in approximately the way that the good part of the crowd will.

Speaker 1:          01:22:12       That's what you want from all your friends because then your interactions with them can generalize out to the broader community in a productive way. And so a good friend, you know, I mean your friends tend to be on the supportive side and perhaps that's appropriate. Assuming there's reciprocity, but a good friend will also tell you when one way or another, when your behavior is starting to tilt in a direction that's going to make you unpopular with them and likely unpopular with other people, and of course that's what a parent is supposed. That's the prime job of a parent in my estimation. It's like, don't do that. Other people will hurt you if you do that by exclusion, by threat, by failure to offer you an opportunity, bad things will happen to you so you can't do that, and then you're a representative of the social situation, which is exactly what you should be, not a friend, so or at least not precisely a friend that doesn't make you an enemy.

Speaker 1:          01:23:10       It makes you better than a friend. Well, so minimal cues on stage, making a fool of himself and then he gets all tangled up in other puppet strings. That's what happens to them and the and then it all ends rather badly with everything being a tangled mess on stage, but it also turns out to be rather funny. It's funny because he's surrounded by angry Russians know, which you know, you could kind of view that as a potential lesson is that if you're a puppet on a stage and you mess around too much, you just might get tangled up with a bunch of angry Russians and these are costs acts. That's exactly what happened. So anyways, of course, no, that's not what's happening here, but it's still funny. So

Speaker 1:          01:23:54       Stromboli is not happy with the tangled mass, but then the crowd reacts very positively and then that confuses the conscience because he thinks, well look, this is horrible. This guy's a tyrant, like Pinocchio's making a fool of himself. Everything turns into a tangled mess, but the crowd goes crazy and well being a fool. That can be entertaining, right? So it's hard to tell when the crowd, especially at a spectacle, because that's this crowd is at a spectacle. You just don't know exactly why it is that they're responding positively, but you've definitely give them what you want. And you can see this look on strombolis face. It's like this false. Again, this false kindness and generosity, public facing and oh well anyways, the conscience is very confused and I really think this is an important thing because I've often thought I spent a lot of time thinking about Hitler and I was thinking, well, how do you get into a state like that? You know, can you think? Well, he was a dictator and he led his people down a bad path. It's like, that's not right. That is not what happened. They had a conspiracy together and went down a bad path. Now think about it this way.

Speaker 3:          01:25:03       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:25:04       If one person thinks something about you, it's like whatever. Right? But if five people tell you that, well, what? Then then to start to start not taken that seriously. It's kind of narcissistic. Right? And if it isn't five, let's say it's 15 people tell you the same thing or act the same way towards you. It's like probably you should clue in, well what if you're a politician and you're trying out a bunch of different ideas and you're good at interacting with the crowd, you're charismatic, you watch the crowd, but you're not necessarily all that articulate. You don't have your values all straightened out, but you're kind of angry too and maybe that's because you spent a bunch of time in World War One, world war one in the trenches which was like no joke and all your friends got blown up. You had when you were unemployed and then you tried to be an artist and that didn't work out even though you were moderately talented and then maybe the economy fell apart completely on you hyperinflation and then maybe there was a communist menace coming in from the east and they're genuinely was and so you're not the world's happiest clam at that point and you're talking to people who aren't that happy either because they were also badly defeated in world war one.

Speaker 1:          01:26:13       And then they had a terrible treaty. They had decided they lost part of their territory and so the crowd's not happy and neither are you. And there's reason for it, and so you start talking to them, you don't know what you're upset about and neither does the crowd, so you start to articulate some things about why you might be upset and some of them fall flat, but you're paying attention to the crowd. So you stop saying those things and some of the things make the crowd really wake up and listen. And so you start seeing more of those things. Right? It's an. It's an unconscious dialectic between you and the crowd. It's mediated by consciousness, but it's not like you're sitting there saying, although you might be, I'm going to tell this crowd more what it wants to hear. It's more sophisticated than that. And so you do that thousand times and you do that to ever increasing crowds and the crowd really starts to go mad and they basically tell you that you're the savior of the nation.

Speaker 1:          01:27:07       It's like at what? How many bloody people have to tell you that before you start to believe it, you know? I would say with a typical person, 100, we'll do it now. That'll get you going, man. If a hundred people tell you specifically why you're special, you're going to be thinking, even if you're kind of humbled to begin with, you're going to be thinking, gees, there's got to be something to this man, but if it's a million people and they're roaring their approval, well, and then when it's a whole nation, it's like good luck with standing that there's just not a chance. How are you going to withstand that? Now you could be like Gandhi and you could have taken that into account beforehand because he did he read tolstoy by the way, he was a student of tolstoy and that's, it's very interesting because tolstoy was the person who developed the techniques of nonviolence that Gandhi used.

Speaker 1:          01:27:58       And tolstoy was also a deeply religious writer apart from his novels, which are not, I wouldn't say really in the religious category, although they're profound, um, tolstoy stressed humility with nonviolence. He really stressed that. And that's what Gandhi took to heart. So he lived a very, very, very, very simple bare bones, ascetic life. And that was to kind of see if he could keep his damn ego tamp down. Well, the groundswell was building behind him, you know, and he dressed really simply and he didn't own much and he ate very simply and he just tried to stay away from the whole materialistic success element that would be an element of what would turn them into an actor and also inflate his ego and you know, he seemed to do that pretty well. You know, he certainly. Well, he led a nonviolent revolution that resulted in the, in the independence of India. It also produced a terrible civil war and the separate separation of the Muslim Indians from the Hindu Indians and. But I think you can precisely

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       laid out at the feet of Gandhi. Right? But, but what I'm saying is that you have to be an extraordinary person. You have to be extraordinarily wise and you have to take ridiculous precautions if you're going to put yourself in the public sphere like that and expose yourself to that kind of adulation without becoming a puppet of the crowd. And that's what happened to Hitler. I mean, it's not like he wasn't also a conscious manipulator and surrounded himself by people who were propagandists. And all of that, so there was a conscious element, but you've got to think these things through and see how that dialectic develops. Like he learned how to appeal to the darkest fantasies of the crowd. He was really, really good at it and that was a dialectic process, right? The crowd told them what they wanted to hear and it's the crowds a mob at that point. So I don't have to take responsibility for the fact that I'm screaming my approval when I'm surrounded by a million people so I can scream my approval for whatever I want forever. Whatever dark revengeful fantasy might be playing out in my imagination because I'm not going to be held accountable for it

Speaker 1:          01:30:07       anyways. The crickets confused and it's no wonder it's like the public has rendered its judgment and the judgment is positive. So when I wrote the book on which this course is based, I was thinking, how am I going to judge success? And then I thought, well, there's sort of four, there's a two by two matrix of success. You could say it's a great book. No one reads it. That happens. So what do you, what do you do about that? It's like Nietzsche and sold virtually nothing in his lifetime. Right? And you know, that's happened to lots of artists. So then it's a terrible book and everyone loves it. That happens too. And then it's a great book and everyone loves it and then it's a terrible book and everyone hates it. That's probably a better category actually, that like it's a terrible book that, and everyone loves it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       I mean, you wouldn't pick a terrible book that everyone hates if you had a choice, but at least the quality and the response match, at least it's truthful light, great book, good response. But the problem with those four categories is you can't really tell which category your production falls into, right? Because how do you know? And you know, I think you should assume horrible book, bad response because that's the most likely of all four of those categories. That's the one that's most likely to be true, but just purely on, on actuarial ground foot say so. Alright. So anyways, the cricket wanders away because he obviously, not only was he late for work that day, but he turned out to be wrong about everything. So we, let's Pinocchio go off and his adventure and Stromboli puts them in this little kind of like a, uh, uh, uh, traveling, touring wagon, you know, and away they go. And the cricket thinks, well, he is an of the conscience isn't needed anymore on this journey towards unearned celebrity.

Speaker 3:          01:31:55       Well, meanwhile,

Speaker 1:          01:31:58       back at the, as they say,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       um,

Speaker 1:          01:32:02       the puppet is supposed to come home after school, but he doesn't, he doesn't show up. And the kitten and the fish and Japan, we were all waiting there for him, ready to eat. Excuse me. But he doesn't show up. And so Japan goes out into the rain to look for him and he can't find them.

Speaker 1:          01:32:35       And then we're, we see the inside of the traveling show cart and Stromboli is having a snack and counting all the money that he's made from tonight's performance and hypothetically dividing it up with a puppet. So we've got this little stack of gold and uh, some of it's false. So somebody paid with a looks like a little Washer, like a mechanical Washer, and it's bent, and so he curses about that for awhile even though it's interesting because he's made all this money, it's been really successful. But this one little error is enough to enrage him, which is very ungrateful and tyrannical. It's like, look, you've got 100 gold pieces. Someone slipped you a fake one. It's like you could have had 101. It's still a pretty good day. All things considered, you know, you've got to make a bit of allowance for error, which is something a tyrant does not do. So and that's perfect because if you don't make allowance for error at all, then people are always guilty of something and if you're a tyrant that's exactly what you want and people are always guilty of something. So the tyrant who's willing to exploit that is always on solid ground. So

Speaker 1:          01:33:52       anyways, he doesn't share with Pinocchio and he puts them in a birdcage jail. And then he also shows them this other puppet that has an ax through him that was the previous puppet who didn't precisely perform as he was supposed to. And so there's a big threat there. It's like you stay in that jail, you do exactly what I want, or it's off to the woodpile for you to be burned. And so well that that's just we're thinking about because that's kind of what happens with tyrants and so and, and literally not just metaphorically so.

Speaker 1:          01:34:35       So the cricket is basically wondering what in the world he should do. And then the cart rolls by and he gets an inkling or is. And I don't quite remember this, that Pinocchio is in there and might be in trouble or he thinks that up. I'm sorry, I can't remember that. But he ends up anyways. He ends up inside the car and he, he finds the traveling part and he goes inside and then he tries to pick the lock because he's a bug you can climb inside. He tries to pick the lock. He tries to get Pinocchio out of the jail that he's been. And he sort of collaborated himself into, you know, and it's, it's interesting because if you read, for example, if you read Solzhenitsyn's Gulag archipelago, which I would highly recommend, one of the things you find is that if you were arrested by the, by the KGB, by the secret police and in the Soviet Union, and you were

Speaker 1:          01:35:27       hauled off to, uh, to uh, to, uh, like a tribunal, a Jew before a judge. They wanted you to admit that you were guilty. You had to, like, they torture you until you confessed, or you could just confess and that are always found that so mysterious. It's like the kick down your door, they know perfectly well that they haven't got any more on you than they've got on anyone else. And yet you have to go through the damn trial and you have to admit that they're right. It's like, why? Why do they even bother with that? Why don't they just throw your sorry ass into the camp, which is essentially what's going to happen anyways. Why do they need your collaboration? No, I've never quite figured that out. I think it's partly because they're not willing to let you stand in opposition to the rules because the mere fact that you will do that means that you exist as something that is allowed to exist outside the rules and they're not having any of that, so that's part of it,

Speaker 1:          01:36:31       but there's more to it. There's more to it than that. It's like the drama of collaboration. So one of the things I learned about societies like the Soviet Union, and this is true of all tyrannical societies, is that the idea that that's top down and that people are just following orders. They're good people, but they're just following orders. It's like you can forget about that. That's a stupid theory. When a society becomes tyrannical like that, the tyranny exists at every single level of the society. You tyrannized your own conscience. So let's say you're a true believer. You're a true believer in Marxist Utopia, let's say, or national socialist third, right? That's going to last a thousand years and be racially pure. You really believed that and that's supposed to be a perfect state and that's already been delivered to you. And so what that means is that in so far as you're a true believer, your own suffering becomes heretical because to the degree that you're suffering and you're living proof of the fact that the system is not delivering what it promised to deliver, and so you have to suppress that.

Speaker 1:          01:37:27       You have to become your own tyrant. You can't admit that anything's gone wrong, and of course you can't talk about a tier family because one out of three of them are government informers, just like one out of three of everyone. And you're certainly not going to mention it in the workplace because unless you're a devout communist party member, you're not going anywhere. And if any of your ancestors were like land owners or or bourgeoisie, it's like you're done. You're done class guilt, man. You're not going anywhere. And then every single level of the bureaucracy is exactly the same as that. And on the top there is a tyrant, but the tyrant is everywhere, everywhere from the peak to the soul. It's all tyranny. And everyone participates in that by lying about everything. And that's why you see what happens next. In the, in the movie, So Pinocchio was in jail and he, he's there because he was naive and he allowed himself to be enticed to because he did something that would've run contrary to his conscience, but the movie doesn't put up Straw man, you know, the poor damn puppet got tangled into this is conscience wasn't even around.

Speaker 1:          01:38:30       So you have to have some sympathy for them but doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because he ends up in jail and he can't get out. And the fact that it in some ways wasn't his fault, doesn't change the fact that he's in jail and he can't get out. And then his is. I was watching Louis c k the other night and he was talking about children lying. He was talking about his nine year old daughter lying. And he said, well, it's no, it's no wonder your children lie and it's no wonder it's impossible for you to stop them because you know, you're talking to someone who's his head would scrape the roof. They weigh like three times as much as you and they're capable of force and they're intimidating and they say to you something like, could you, could you take that last cookie after I told you not to?

Speaker 1:          01:39:23       And you're thinking, oh no, I took a cookie. What am I going to do? And then you, you, you get a genius idea in your head which children, smarter children learn to lie earlier. Children with high Iq is learned to lie younger and and Ck says, well, it's like you've just been handed a magic. Get out of jail free card. You can just say, no, I didn't take that cookie and worse than that, it works in every single situation. If you get away with it and now you're supposed to learn not to do that. I said, well great. So that's the thing about Comedians, you know, they'll tell you the underlying truth, which is why people think they're so funny, like the gesture and it King's court, right? He's the only one who's allowed to tell the king the truth because he's beneath contempt. That's what comedians do.

Speaker 1:          01:40:11       And so. Well, so what happens is, well, Pinocchio Pinocchio's not very happy about this, right? It's really breaking them up and the blue fairy appears again from the star. Same Way. So what this means is, is I think this is right, this is something you've talked about it and it was also extraordinarily brilliant. He said that it's one thing to break a rule when you don't really know the rule you can, for whatever reason, you seem to get a bit of a free pass for that, but if then you know the rule and then you break it anyways, you get hit a lot harder. And I know that's true and I even think I figured out why it was true at one point, but I can't remember the moment, but there's something, there's something about, it's like the severity of a moral error isn't quite as massive if you're genuinely ignorant and unconscious about the rule and maybe it's because you're not violating your own belief system as much when you engage in the activity.

Speaker 1:          01:41:09       It's something like that. So. So anyways, Pinocchio is in there and he, he's partly at fault at least because he's naive and, and he's very desperate about it, but it's also because his conscience isn't functioning very well, so he has his reasons and so whatever the blue fairy shows up again, mother nature steps in to aid him. And so, and that is true I would say because it's not like you get walloped or killed every time you make a mistake, right? It's, it's, it's kind of interesting. And especially that's the case with kids is like we have more leeway from, for them, whether nature does, that's a different issue. But I would say yes because you know, kids are really cute and they're appealing and so, and they're, they're naive and they're kind of helpless. They have those motions even that indicate helplessness and that's associated with the natural apprehension of cuteness.

Speaker 1:          01:42:06       Right? So cuteness is big eyes, small knows symmetrical features, baby like features. I'm helpless movements. Um, that elicits sympathy and compassion and it doesn't cross species. And so does the cry. And my roommate when I was in college, had a niece who is quite young, boat year and half old, I think, and we had a cat wildcat and uh, and it was really fighty cat, partly because of me because I would always play with it and it would let him fight with me quite a lot. So was a fighty cat. And, and, uh, that little girl would come over and, you know, maybe she'd cry that cat was like, they are right now trying to figure out what was wrong and the like, the cat would use its claws on me, but it would never use its claws on the little kid, you know. And I thought, well that's, that's indication of that cross species cuteness, you know, and, and you're all attracted to that more or less.

Speaker 1:          01:43:00       And the more maternal you are, the more you're attracted to such things. But you know, you see something on Youtube and you go, ah. And that's like, that's so cute. It's like, yeah, it is, it, it appeals to exactly this. It, it. If it appeals to this, couldn't commentation of infantile features. And, and, uh, it brings out compassion unless you're psychopathic, so it's a good thing, but you know, it can be manipulated, that's for sure. Women actually manipulate it with makeup, which is quite, quite sneaky and go to them. So anyways, so the blue fairy shows up, so that's nature. So what I'm saying is that nature will cut kids a break if you think of nature in the guise of, well their mother for example, but even the biology of other, because we're wired to accept behavior from children that we wouldn't accept from other people.

Speaker 1:          01:43:56       So nature will forgive. So she shows up in your heavenly guys and says what's going on? And Pinocchio again, because he's not youth, but also because he's not good. He's not evil either. He's, he's neither or both. It depends on how you look at it. And he also has no idea how smart he is and how smart he isn't or how smart the person he's talking to his. And uh, instead of admitting what he's done, he lies about it. And that's interesting because it does suggest that he understands at some level that he set himself up for this because you know, he could just say, he could have just told the truth, this horrible Fox kidnap me and sold me to this slave holder, which is true. It's a lot more true than the story he tells. He tells a story about some monster, you know, a fictional monster. He coulda told even three quarters of the truth and how it work. But he doesn't. He just obscures the story entirely. And this is the part of the movie that people remember. And I'd edited this out for years when I was talking about this movie. I forgot why it was so significant because nose grows right and it grows too ridiculous length. And why is that?

Speaker 1:          01:45:19       I think it was Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens, I think who said, one of the advantages to telling the truth is that you don't have to remember what you said and that God that's worth listening to because.

Speaker 1:          01:45:35       So there's a bunch of things I've learned as a clinician and one of them is because you're often in really weird situations with people if you're a clinician because things happen that don't happen normally and you don't know what to do. And so what I've learned is I just say what I just say, what's happening, whatever it is, regardless of what it is, you know, I'll just try to describe it as accurately as I can and not worry about in some sense, not worried about the consequences, you know, like I'm not going out of my way to cause trouble. But if you're in a really, and I'm telling you this can save your life at times, especially if you're dealing with someone who's paranoid, who's really paranoid, you do not lie to someone who's paranoid and violet. Because as soon as you lie, you're aligned with the forces that are persecuting them and they're going to be because paranoid it makes people hypervigilant, like they're on amphetamines.

Speaker 1:          01:46:21       In fact, you can make people paranoid by giving them enough amphetamines and you can make paranoid people more paranoid by giving them amphetamines. So they're hypervigilant. Because they feel that everything is predatory and against them, and so they're watching you like you would not believe way more than you're watching them. And if you flicker ally while you're talking to them and they're really on the edge, you, you're done. So it's what? It's one thing to really know if you're ever in a really bad situation and you don't know what to do, you tell the truth. Minimally you don't disclose too much. That's just another lie. You tell the truth minimally and carefully and hopefully, and you might get out of it, you might get out of it, but if you falsify it, look the hell out. So the truth is a real. It's a real mechanism of protection in dangerous situations. You know? So if someone's trying to intimidate you and you, you think they might get violent, that they ask you if you're afraid, then you tell them that you're terrified and that you hope that things will go okay. Or you say,

Speaker 1:          01:47:30       I'll give you an example. One time I was in an airport and uh, we're in this lineup to fly back to Canada that said international flights. And so as long line up like 50 people and we got it, I got about three from the front, it was still like 40 people behind me and the guy behind the counter decided that he was just going to shut down the line and that we could all go to this other line, which was like 300 people long and I suggested that he not do that because we'd been standing there for half an hour and that he could just deal with the 20 of us that were less than and like have a clue. So he called the sheriff right away and this was down in Florida and it wasn't that long after nine slash 11. And so these guys came up and they were armed and they came and said, looked at me because of course he told them that I was causing trouble, which I wasn't. I was just trying to not

Speaker 4:          01:48:23       left.

Speaker 1:          01:48:25       What would you say? An arrogant bureaucratic scum rat take advantage of me. So which is not the same as causing trouble. So anyways, as soon as the cops came up, I said, look, I'm going to do exactly what you tell me to do right now and I'm not going to cause any trouble, but I would like you to hear what actually happened. And so that, that's a good example of a situation like that. It's like if someone's got, you know, Bravo Bravado, it's a very bad idea and I was going to do exactly what they told me because you know,

Speaker 1:          01:48:58       they didn't know who I was and I didn't know what they had been told. So anyhow, the problem with lying is that it's a hydro and kids find this out very early because you tell one lie and what happens is it has one of the consequences that you expect. Maybe you'd get away with it, but it has three or four others that you don't expect. And so it's like it grows some, some complexity and then you have to tack a lie on each of those little complexity outcrops. And then they grow three more complexities and soon this little light turns into great big ball of lies. And at some point it becomes painfully evident to everyone, and by that time you're in such, you see this with politicians like that guy who was sexting. Um, Anthony Wiener. Yeah. Perfect name for him, man. It's so funny.

Speaker 1:          01:49:45       Uh, I shouldn't make that comment because it's so obvious, but it's still funny, but you know, he, that's exactly what happened to him. It's like, it wasn't even so much the event because people are stupid. They make mistakes. And actually the public is somewhat forgiving if you say, yeah, Jesus, I'm a real moron and you know, like really seriously, how could I do that? But I did. And like I'll try not to do it again. But what happens with politicians is, and I'm not speaking specifically of politicians, is they'll make an error and it gets exposed and then they make three others trying to cover it up. Happened with Nixon for example. And then the whole thing just turns into a complete scandal. And maybe they could have got out of it at the beginning by just telling the truth. It's like, yes, I'm an idiot. You know, I'll try not to do it again. Well that isn't what happens in this case in Pinocchio grows this elaborate series of lies and the ferry is willing to be a little generous to him because he's little and cute and he's still a puppet and she tells him

Speaker 1:          01:50:50       not to do that and that she's going to give them a pass this time, but that she isn't going to be able to intervene on his behalf again. And that's partly one of the things that's quite interesting about people who have roots, Soliah and ideas about children. So children are all good and they get corrupted by society, which is half true because they're also not good and they get shaped and, and discipline by society. But there were so many types. Softer are very interesting when their kids hit teenage years or when they're judging, like say criminal teenagers. It's like the child is perfect until they hit like 11. Then they turned into a teenager and then they're like thugs. So they go from good to thug in one move. You know? And, and you often see that in families too that have treated especially their daughters like a princess, you know, and then they hit puberty and the parents who have princess them to death have no idea what to do with them. And so then they become demonized and so the, the overly good that child turns into the overly wicked teenager and sometimes they lack that out to one of the things I've seen with girls who are

Speaker 1:          01:52:00       held in princess esteem when they're little and their parents have too tight of a grip on them and too much of a demand for good behaviors, they'll find some nasty character to associate with who will tear them out of the family. You know, bikers are really good for that sort of thing. So you. And especially if you have some vengeful thoughts towards your parents, nice biker is your perfect solution to that problem.

Speaker 1:          01:52:30       Okay. We'll go through this scene and then I think we'll call it a day. Okay. So now Pinocchio was gone free. He's been united with his conscience. He's learned a couple of lessons. Don't be an actor and don't lie. And those things are quite similar, right? And especially once you're caught in your actor trap, don't lie to get out because that will just make it worse. So that's the first of his trials, his moral trials on the road to becoming real. All right now, now here we are at a different place. We're at this, I think it's called the red lobster in. It's a shadowy place, right? It's kind of cave like, so it's like the, it's an underground entrance to somewhere that's not good. And so, and it's a foggy night and you can't really see. So everything's murky and, and gloomy. They're. And so inside we see the coachman and the Fox and uh, had an acat and the coachman.

Speaker 1:          01:53:25       The coachman is a bad guy. He's that mask that we saw. First of all, he's the archetype of that mask that was judgmental about Pinocchio having a voice. And it's like one of the things you said about the shadow, and this is I would say, one of the primary impediments to enlightenment is that if you start looking at your motives for, for misbehaving, and, and I mean by that, something very specific. I mean, I don't mean that you're misbehaving by someone else's standards. I don't mean that. I mean when you know by your own standards that you're doing something that's devious or malevolent or underhanded, you know it and you still do it. So it's your own judgment you're bringing to bear on yourself. If you look at why you're doing that, the longer you look at it, the deeper hole you dig. And so this is the Motif of Dante's inferno fundamentally.

Speaker 1:          01:54:16       So Dante is inferno is a story about, um, I can't remember his name, unfortunately, might be Dante, in fact, although I don't remember. He's led into hell by Virgil, who's an, who's an ancient, who was an ancient philosopher, thinker and hell has levels. And so the outer level is, this is a Christianized version of hell. Um, because there's hells of all sorts, but this is a christianized version version and so the on the outermost levels of hell, which is sort of like normal life are the ancient philosophers and they're still in hell because they weren't Christian, but it's kind of like, it's like cheap motel hell instead of the full pip thing, you know? And so then Dante goes deeper and deeper into hell until it gets right to the bottom of it. And it's been a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly, Satan himself is encased in ice at the bottom of hell, surrounded by people who betray others.

Speaker 1:          01:55:15       And so Dante, his notion was that the worst of all possible violations of moral behavior was betrayal and that they're in the deepest levels of hell. And I, I really liked that idea. I think it's true because if you trust me, then you're manifesting the necessary courage that put someone through life. You know, if you're smart, you don't trust me cause you're naive. You Trust me knowing that I've full of snakes and so are you. But maybe we could cooperate and move things along nicely, we know and we could reduce each other to the word to our word and we could cooperate, but you're awake, you know, and then I'd be trey that then I'm undermining your necessary faith in, in life and humanity and you can really hurt someone that way. Like the sometimes it's self betrayal, but you can really do someone in that.

Speaker 1:          01:56:06       We can really traumatize them. They can so that they can't recover and so it's a really terrible thing to do to someone and maybe it's the worst thing and that was don idea and it's tied in. That makes very interesting reading. If you read it at the same time as Milton's paradise lost because those are metaphysical explorations. This is what they are. They're metaphysical explorations of the terrible places you can end up and that people do end up and also a metaphysical explanation of what spirit takes you there. So because you might ask, well why do you be traced someone? And that is a deep question and so you'll have your specific reasons. But under that there'll be some other reasons. And under that, there'll be some other reasons and under that there'll be some other reasons and if you go all the way to the bottom, you come up with the ultimate reasons why you'd be trade someone.

Speaker 1:          01:56:54       And when you look at that, that will not be pretty. That's when your proclivity for evil, let's say you nights with the general human proclivity for evil and you discover just exactly what you're capable of. And so young's notion was that, well that was a full encounter with the shadow, which is I suppose partly what this course is about because one of the things that I believe I told you at the beginning was that I was going to try to help you understand how it might be that you could be in Auschwitz guard and to really understand that that's a horrifying thing to understand. But I'll tell you, if you want to grow some teeth, that's a really good thing to understand. So we were talking about your capacity to negotiate before. Like if you aren't a monster, you cannot negotiate. But if you, if you've got that under control, then you don't have to be a monster.

Speaker 1:          01:57:50       It's really paradoxical. So if you're just naive, well you end up in jail and marionette master has control over you. That's not helpful. So that's not good. That just means you're useless and you can be manipulated, won't go out of your way to be malevolent. But it's mostly because you just don't have the skills, the organizational skills or, or even the depth to do that. You know you're good because you're harmless. That's not good. That's easily manipulated. And so you think, well how do you get out of that? Well, partly you watch people because you know what their light because you know what you're like and that, but you also know what you could do and would do if you were pushed. And so you don't have to show much of that when you're negotiating with someone for them to take you really seriously. So it's a strange thing, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:58:39       But one of the things you pointed out too was that what you most need to know will be found where you least want to look. And that's because you haven't already looked there and so it's a little different for everyone, right? Because you're a particular place you'd want to look isn't going to be the same as your replace, but you're going to have a place you don't want to look and what you haven't discovered. That's where it is. And so that's partly going to be discovered by you looking at what you're capable of, what you're truly capable of. And you know, people especially on the Compassionate and say, well no, I could never be like brutal like that and that could be true, but you can kill people with compassion. No problem. It happens. That's the Freudian eatable situation. So think about working in a nursing home.

Speaker 1:          01:59:23       So there's actually a rule it's thumb, which I also use to guide my interactions with children and also with my clients. And I would say with people in general do not do anything for anyone that they can do themselves. All you do is steal. You just steal it from them. So imagine you're working with really elderly people. You know they have Alzheimer's. It's like really easy to do things for them because while it isn't, because it's really a hard job, but it might be easier to do something for them then to let them struggle through it, but you just speed their device. Right. By taking away the last vestiges of their independence and you do the same thing with kids. It's like struggle through it. Man. Did you ever see my left foot? That's a great movie. It's about this author whose name escapes me at the moment.

Speaker 1:          02:00:08       Brilliant. It's brilliant movie and the person who who played the part is Daniel Day Lewis. I think he went to academy award for it, but it's about this author in Ireland who was. I think he had cerebral palsy and all he could really do was use his left foot. That was it. The rest of him was pretty spastic and not in not controllable, but he was there. He was very intelligent. He was with it and his dad would not help him. He had to drag himself up the damn stairs with his left foot. He just would not help him. And what happened was he learned how to live, you know, he actually, he could function and the movie does the book, which is called my left foot and the movie does a lovely job of laying that out, but you have to be one hardhearted son of a bitch to let your son crawl up the stairs with his left foot over and over.

Speaker 1:          02:00:57       You think about that. But what's the alternative, you know, if he would have been. And of course he lays this out in the book, if he would have been catered to, he would have ended up just like you'd expect someone who is always catered to. So it's a very nice lesson in the triumph of fostering independence over the, over to casual compassion. That's what I would say. Oh, so you look at the coachman here kind of looks like a demented Santa Claus. You know, it doesn't have a beard, but he's, it's a nice touch on the animators parties. Even got the pipe and the red suit. And so he's listening to the Fox and the cat brag about how much money they made selling Pinocchio to the puppet master. And how evil and terrible they are, and they're bragging way and he's the real thing. Hey, he's, he's the real thing.

Speaker 1:          02:01:50       And he can see through their little petty, narcissistic, grandiose tales of criminality and has nothing but contempt for it. And you can see that in his facial expression. It's like you sitting back a bit thinking, keep talking. Bucko pretty soon I'm going to have, you're right where I want you. And so the Fox and the cat are drinking beer and smoking cigarettes and talking about how evil they are and, and bragging about how they got one over on the water, like a four year old real impressive guys. Real impressive. And uh, the, the, the coachman is thinking up his own nefarious schemes right now for what he might do with that puppet if he got his hands on him. And so that's what he reveals himself, right? So what you see filmmakers just do it for a second. And that's an archetype. Old trip. It's like you've got the Fox in the cat, they're sort of petty examples of, of criminality and evil.

Speaker 1:          02:02:39       And then you've got the coachman and he's the real thing, but he's not really shown anybody who he is. And then at one scene in the bar he lets his guard down and he lets them see what he's really like. And so you see this all teeth and predatory eyes and glee all at the same time. Right? That's a bad combination. I'm going to eat you and it's going to make me very happy. That's insanity. You do not want to see that look on someone's face. And so that's the look. And the Fox is traumatized by that. He just like, he thinks he's a bad guy and he's not. He's just, he just can't be a good guy. He hasn't got the talent to be a bad guy. So. And then he's talking to the coach when I'm bragging and the coach was, had enough of it and shows his real face and it's like, that's not good. The Fox gets a real glimpse into hell and that just terrifies. Like he's and, and then a coach when the other thing the coachman does is reveal his plans and his plans are to kidnap Pinocchio along with a bunch of other boys, had to take them to this place called pleasure island and the Fox knows what's going on there. And so it's, it's the foreshadowing of the next stage of the adventure.

Speaker 1:          02:03:55       And so after the Fox and the cat or terrified the coachman who takes you along with him, he has a little chat with them and they described exactly what they're going to do next and the Fox and the cat know perfectly well that they're over their head. But at this point in their misadventures there's no pulling back and I think we'll stop there even though it's a little early because that was a lot of material and this is a really good place to stop. And so I'd be happy to take some questions if you guys have some questions. We could take questions for like 10 minutes and then we'll call it a day. So. And you can me a question about anything you want.

Speaker 5:          02:04:39       It's the beginning of the lecture, but how do, how does morality from

Speaker 1:          02:04:46       stronger and weaker to what's good and what is it? Well, I think it depends to some degree on what you mean by stronger. So physical strength is one element and like if you look at mythological heroes, imagine that the stories of heroes are fragmented elements of, uh, of the archetype and so one kind of archetypal hero obviously as someone who's physically strong, you know, you see that there's a great movie that you could watch about this. It's called Hitman Hart. It's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen and it's about this guy named Bret Harte. Bret Harte was for a while the most famous Canadian on the planet and he was a worldwide wrestling foundation, I think. What do they call it? Wwf? Yeah, he was there like lead good guy. And so he and wrestling, I love the documentary because when I was a little kid, like four or five, I used to watch his father whose name was Stu Hart, who ran this channel, this wrestling confederation in Alberta.

Speaker 1:          02:05:49       And Stu Hart had, I think eight boys and he trained all of them to be pro wrestlers and part of the movie is extraordinarily funny because Stu Hart is in it and he's really old. He's like 85 and he's just barely. Can you imagine? He was like a pro wrestler for 40 years, like every joint is broken and he still big but he's just barely moving and this is this kid and another kid come over and stu is telling the story about how it used to take his boys into the basement and toughen them up. And I think Brent called that the journey to pain or something like that. His father would take all these kids down there and wrestle with them and push them right to the edge of their pain tolerance constantly. And so anyways, they grew up tough. There's no doubt about that. And uh, all his daughters married pro wrestlers to, and I think he had seven daughters.

Speaker 1:          02:06:37       So he's quite the character anyways. These two kids, they're like their late adolescence, early adulthood come over and one of them is pretty damn cocky and he's listening to Stewart. He says something smart like, well, you know, you were pretty, you were pretty tough with the old days. Hey, and stew looks at them and says, well, why? Why don't you come down to the basement with me? And he says, well look, I don't want to hurt you old man. And so, so the filmmakers follow them into the basement day and, and like they're kind of standing there and the old guy grabs him in a headlock, takes him like, he's like a snake, a, he's got her in a headlock like so fast and then the kid doesn't know what to do. And then. So stew, like, who knows how to put a headlock on someone. He's flexing his, his uh, his uh, his forearm.

Speaker 1:          02:07:22       Yeah. Which is still not so bad. A forearm and he's got this guy's face is just, he's just, he's like, he's stepped in a bear trap. Plus he's absolutely shocked that this old guy got him. And so he's kind of gasping. Stu says something like, you watch, if I flex this muscle just right, and you can see this vein on his forehead start to pop out. It's extraordinarily funny, 20 ways Bret Hart plays out the good guy archetype and Brett's like, he's a solid guy, but he's, I would say he's not particularly sophisticated and I'm not being cruel about that. I mean he had a great career and he's tough as a boot and so good for him. But he plays out this, this good guy archetype and he gets tangled up in it. And now I don't remember your damn question but I am trying to answer it. Tell me the question again.

Speaker 1:          02:08:15       Oh yes, yes. Okay. Exactly. Well, so one of the things I really liked about this movie was it showed me why people watched wrestling and I couldn't, I couldn't because certainly they are not appealing and I'm not being. There are different strata of conception of abstraction that any entertainment process has to appeal to. And you know, most people don't go to movies and that's actually because it really is because movies operate at a level of sophistication that are too high, that is too high for many people just like novels. I mean hardly anyone reads, you know, and if, if you about 15 percent of the population might be 20 percent cannot read well enough to follow written instructions and so [inaudible] and people who are, maybe it's 15 percent of the population or 10 percent have never finished a book, never. And so, and it is that high, but you still, you're still, the archetypes still needs to manifest itself at different levels and so it manifests itself in wrestling, but even there where it is physical force, it's not just physical force like it's a drama between good and evil and you can see this so clearly and in there Brett Hart documentary because he's the good guy and you know, the bad guys are really over the top bad.

Speaker 1:          02:09:28       It's a real drama. It's like it's good versus evil in the rain every time. And hopefully good winds but good often gets, you know, maybe the bad wrestler brings two of his friends in and they bring in chairs and they bashed the hell out of the good guy. And the whole audience is just outraged by this. And and the documentary does a lovely job of showing that, but so even at the level of physical combat, let's say you can't reduce what's good to what strong, it's just one element of it better to be strong than to be weak and so you can have a strong hero because it's better to be strong than to be weak, but it's better to be strong and kind than to be strong and it's better to be strong and kind and wise than to be strong and kind. And so.

Speaker 1:          02:10:10       And that's true not only for human beings but it's even true, let's say at the wolf for the chimpanzee level because one of the things you see with the chimp dominance hierarchies if, and I think I mentioned this before, is if the leader, the dominant male is really good at fostering social relations and being reciprocal in acts like grooming and also paying attention to the females and their offspring. His dynasty will be much more stable and so strong might be good for one battle. It might be good for two battles, but for 50 battles it's not optimized. Especially because no law, no matter how strong you are, someone can take you out. So, so what happens is the idea of what's ideal becomes increasingly complex across time, multifaceted, right, and so strength, wisdom, intelligence, vision, all these things are amalgamated into a single B and we'll talk a lot about that because I want to show you how that happened in Mesopotamia because that's one of the first places where we have documentation about how that ideally merged.

Speaker 1:          02:11:14       They have a god called Marduk and Martin had 50 names and as far as I can tell, the reason for that was that Martech was an amalgam of the tribal deities of at least 50 tribes and and when the tribes were brought together and civilized, each of their gods who were ideals had to be a male debated in something that was a single, a single dramatized representation of value. Or there was no way that all those people could have lived together. Right? There are different value structures would have fragmented them and they would have stated in a state of war. And so the question is, what's the question you're asking? If it's not strength than what is it? Well straight, there's an element, but the Egyptians figured out that it was vision is actually the capacity to pay attention. That was paramount and the Mesopotamians have that figured out more or less too because they're god Marduk had eyes all the way around his head. He could see everywhere. So seeing was a critical element of what should be on top. And the other thing for the Mrs Heyman's was the ability to speak. So by the time of Mesopotamia, people had already dramatized the idea that the cardinal human attributes, our vision and the ability to speak so and that'd be the ability to speak the truth, to not just speak. So other questions

Speaker 6:          02:12:36       mean that wasn't really aware of. So is that why we sort of considered, because we were talking earlier that different levels of obstruction of celebrity perspective, more like reality TV. Incredible being lower than a match than a theater actor. Then like a novelist.

Speaker 1:          02:13:01       Yes. That's exactly why. Because you see the less sophisticated the genre, the more the genre is like real life and the more sophisticated it is, the more it has abstracted out across instances of real life, the fundamental lessons. And that's what makes something profound and deep. It's abstracted from multiple. And that applies across multiple dimensions because that's what you want. So like, and here's why. Fundamentally, so there are, you have a problem, but that's not the problem. The problem is that there are problems. So the problem is a Meta problem. There are problems. You need a solution to that. That's not a solution to a problem, that's a medical solution to the class of problems. Right? Right. And that's what people have been trying to figure out ever since we were able to actually figure things out. It's not how do you solve a problem, how it's, how do you act so that you solve the problem of problems and that's basically at least the complexity of life and the fact that you're mortal and vulnerable. So,

Speaker 6:          02:14:17       so follow up question from your book. You have this sort of strata from play all the way up to religion and then beyond that sort of looking back practically with philosophy irrationality. Yes. Israel is.

Speaker 1:          02:14:37       Well, that's. That's a good one. A good. I would say,

Speaker 1:          02:14:43       wait, if you really want to think this through, the best way to do that is to read Nietzsche and Dostoevsky at the same time. Now I'm sure there's other ways of doing this, but Nisha was actually quite heavily influenced by Dostoevsky more than people knew. Although there are thought runs very parallel and so Dostoevsky is like the ultimate dramatist, right? He embodies his ideas and he has them act out in a dramatic space. It's literary whereas niche has taken that up one level of abstraction to this semantic. He says, well, here's what's going on in an articulated way, but he doesn't embody it in the story and you might say, well that's. That's higher, but it's only hire in a way. It's more abstract in that it's more like words. Whereas what Dostoevsky does is half words and half images, right? Because when you read a novel, what happens is that people say, and the postmodernist say, well, where the hell's the meaning in that novel?

Speaker 1:          02:15:34       It's like, it's not in the word, it's not in the phrase, it's not in the sentence. It's not in the paragraph, you know, where do you localize the meaning? Great question. Their answers sucks, but the questions great. So, but what happens partly when you're reading a book is that a novel is that the words trigger representations in your imagination and a lot of the information from which a lot of what you extract the information from is actually your images, stick representation of the words and that image is to representation is richer than the words because it's informed by all of your knowledge about people. And so you, you know, this happens because you go to a movie like the Harry Potter movies and you say, that's not how I imagined it, right? The probability that there'll be a one to one correspondence between your internal representation of the book and the movie is zero, and usually the movie is less rich than the book.

Speaker 1:          02:16:28       I, I love movies. And they have their own place, that's for sure, but they're well mini series or the series now are more approaching the complexity and depth of literature because they can extend across 20 hours, you know, and you know, they don't have to compress a 12 hour reading experience into two hours of action. So yeah. And so what I was trying to do with that hierarchy was to show how the knowledge moved. Like first of all, it's kind of implicit in your biology and then it's distributed into society and then by imitating society you make it part of your procedures and then you watch your own procedures and start to build a representation of them. And then you can articulate that representation. And it's a, it's a bootstrapping process too because once you've made the representation that can affect the way you behave.

Speaker 1:          02:17:19       And so they start to loop. And so like. So here's one thing, one idea. So imagine that, imagine that there's a type of male who tends to win dominance hierarchy contest and to merge at the top. While that's the case, that is the case. And that's why you're the way you are. And so what's happened among human beings, this is so cool, is that human females are choosy maters. So about twice as many men, men fail in their reproductive efforts as females fail. Okay? But the man who succeed are more successful. So women are on average, more successful and men are on average, more failures and more successful. And I'm talking strictly about reproduction here, although it generalizes to other areas, but I'm talking about reproduction. So how does it work exactly? Well, the women have a real trouble, real problem with mate selection. It's like who the hell are you going to have as a mate?

Speaker 1:          02:18:12       And it's too complex to work out. So women in their genius don't they let the men compete and then they peel from the top, acting out the assumption that the man who wins is the best man. And it's a good assumption because if you have a bunch of men competing, especially if they're competing across competitions and someone pops up at the top, you can think, well, they may not be worth much, but they're better than anyone else at whatever it is that they're doing, and that makes men at the top of dominance hierarchy is very attractive to women. And then the women accelerate that so you can imagine they're more likely to reproduce. And so what happens is that the proclivity to emerge at the top of the set of dominance hierarchies becomes inbuilt into the biology across time. And the women exaggerate that by differentially allowing them then to reproduce.

Speaker 1:          02:19:00       And that's also why their mother nature, they really are mother nature. There's, it's not just a metaphor. And so then the representation and the biology start to tangle together and that's like, well, that's the difference between a meme in an archetype, right? A meme is this idea that propagates itself, but an archetype is an idea that has propagated itself across such as massive span of time that it's actually shaped the course of evolution. And Man, you can tell you already how this, it isn't necessarily that you even have to compete with other men in order to see who wins as soon as you admire someone and that'll happen unconsciously. You won't, we won't be able to stop yourself. You've already elevated them in the dominance hierarchy contest. The act of admiration is your recognition that you've met someone who's better at what ever it is that happens to be driving your admiration than you are.

Speaker 1:          02:19:57       And so, and that's part, that's partly the manifestation of just the idea as the, as the, uh, what would you say as the representation of, as the ideal. And kids do that all the time. They hear a worship other kids usually like a four year old will latch onto some six year old who will just follow her show photo everywhere, do exactly what they do. And it's like, well, why? Well, because that person reps represents to that child their next ideal there, their conceptualization of the, of the, of the place forward. So, so. Okay, any other questions or should we maybe call it a day? Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:20:40       Oh, when you said that the guy who was the other thing was predatory bleeding, which is insanity. How do you define a Saturday in this?

Speaker 1:          02:20:51       Well, let's, let's call it what you don't want to counter alone in an alley at midnight and leave it at that. But that is what I mean in this context. That's exactly what I meet. And then not only is the person they're waiting for you, but they're looking forward to whatever might happen.

Speaker 6:          02:21:08       I just mean like in a psychological contract using that word safe because like as little connotation. So I was thinking straddling.

Speaker 1:          02:21:15       No, well the movie provides the, the frame for the interpretation in this particular situation and so he's the thing that hauls naive young boys off to their doom. Okay. So that's bounded. So yes.

Speaker 7:          02:21:30       If you can elaborate a bit on. You mentioned, you talked about this mental process where people do the thing that's hard, but let's, let's start, but still facing the shadow. That's actually a really productive way of procrastinating. Although it comes with its own problems of rationalization, so reinforces certain circuits. I'll put it in a way that says that those can go away, so you need to bring up the the other inhibitory circuits and they're just wondering if you could elaborate. Well, I can sure is in the realm of possibility around their understanding of, well, I've derived out partly from my study of addiction and also from my study of a

Speaker 1:          02:22:15       recovery from posttraumatic stress disorder, but let's talk about addiction. So there's a series of actions that occur before you take your cocaine. Some of those are local. They are the things that happened immediately before and some of those are distal. They're farther back in the chain of events and when you. When you have a hit of cocaine, it produces a dopaminergic burst and that feels really good, but it also makes the circuits that were immediately active before that grow. That's what reinforcement is, and then the growth is proportionate, not linearly, but it's proportionate to how long before that event occurred. The closer it is, the stronger they're going to get, but even the ones that are somewhat distal gets some reinforcement because you might say, well, what did you do before? You, you found your latest fix and the answer is well, how long before?

Speaker 1:          02:23:09       Well, the closer, the more reward and so what happens then is that, so if you take that person out of the normal environment, you put them into a treatment center, they're off. There are physical addiction, which is a weird thing in the case of cocaine, but I'm like not that long a week. I'll do it two weeks for sure. Even heroin and alcohol for sure, if you can get them through the seizure part without dying and so they're done. They're done on physiologically dependent anymore. But you let that person go and the first thing that happens is, is an old friend who he's always out doing drugs with shows up and bang, he's craving like mad and that's because that thing is in an area is not dead at all and it's. It's activated by the q and it's a. it's a circuit. It's not.

Speaker 1:          02:23:58       It's a personality. It only wants one thing at once. Cocaine, it's going to suppress any non related thoughts and it'll use lies. That's no problem. Especially if lies have been reinforced, which they certainly have. Where are you off to sun, you know you'll have a live for that and then 10 minutes later you have your drug and so that little lie has just grown or maybe you think you've tried to quit. You think to hell with it and every time, 10 minutes before you take your drug, you think to hell with it and you do that a thousand times. Well, believe me that to hell with it circuit, that sucker is strong and so it's alive and it's not like it just disappears. It can't. It's you. It's grown in there. Now you can build another circuit to shut it down and you can help it decompose across time by not giving it what it wants, but you're going to have to not give it what it wants and all of the multiple contexts that you've already associated with the drug.

Speaker 1:          02:24:55       Some of you have probably smoked and then tried to quit smoking and what you'll see is you get a craving when. Well, when you have a cup of coffee or when you're finished dinner, when you're done. Having a phone call or when you first get up in the morning or whenever you've regularly had the drug, whatever you had the drug in relationship to even complex things like ending a conversation will produce a cute craving and so then that can extinguish overtime if you punish it by either punishing it or not letting it what it's wants, but a lot you have to build another circuit to just shut it down and then that circuits kind of fragile and stress can often disrupt it so

Speaker 7:          02:25:32       that can be read about quitting smoking or things like,

Speaker 1:          02:25:38       oh sure. Well part of it while I begins a whole different thing because it seems to have a direct physiological effect, but you know, the, the, the addiction has a cognitive component. It's full of thoughts and desires and wants and you know, you may have to build a, you have may have to rebuild your whole personality in order to, to get that thing cornered. Religious conversion for example, is in a really effective treatment for alcoholism. That's partly why alcoholic alcoholics anonymous works for the people for whom it does work, but religious conversion, which is total personality conversion is actually one of the few things that we know of that's an effective treatment for alcoholism. We don't know how to induce it, but although that's not exactly true either because I'm in the early work with Lsd was lsd was quite promising as a treatment for for an alcohol addiction and there's recent work with psilocybin and showing that if you. If people have a mystical experience when you give them suicide and their success rate and quitting smoking is about 80 percent, which is way higher than any pharmacological intervention for smoking has ever beat. So. Alright, we should probably call it a day, so we'll see you in a week.
