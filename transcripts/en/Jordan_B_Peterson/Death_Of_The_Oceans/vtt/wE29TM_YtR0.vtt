1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.903
<v Speaker 1>Special privileges for me to welcome all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you to fins first event besides </v>

2
00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:05.374
<v Speaker 1>illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging the way we see marine </v>

3
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:07.414
<v Speaker 1>sustainability is also my great pleasure</v>
<v Speaker 1>to welcome our two speakers this </v>

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>evening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Arthur Hanson and Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson.</v>

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.723
<v Speaker 1>I'll be speaking a little bit more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of these gentlemen later on in the </v>

7
00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.950
<v Speaker 1>but what I would like to say now is from</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience working with Dr.</v>

9
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Peterson and from what I've seen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard about Dr.</v>

10
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Arthur Hansen is there to true </v>
<v Speaker 1>renaissance men.</v>

11
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>And we are very excited to have him here</v>
<v Speaker 1>this evening.</v>

12
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.970
<v Speaker 1>So before I get to our speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you a little bit about</v>

13
00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:37.804
<v Speaker 1>Finn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finn is not your conventional </v>

14
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.713
<v Speaker 1>environmental organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of our executive members have a </v>

15
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 1>background in psychology as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>

16
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.483
<v Speaker 1>environmental studies or biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this leads to some special benefits </v>

17
00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:53.764
<v Speaker 1>that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you about three </v>

18
00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well the special benefits are that,</v>

19
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can use our knowledge of the brain,</v>

20
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.963
<v Speaker 1>emotion and behavior to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovative angles on how to publicize </v>

21
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:09.694
<v Speaker 1>the problem of marine life decimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you about three </v>

22
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:13.564
<v Speaker 1>different psychological concepts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've tried to integrate into our </v>

23
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 1>advertising over the past couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

24
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.863
<v Speaker 1>So the first is that images of cute </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals induced positive emotion and </v>

25
00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:27.514
<v Speaker 1>narrow attentional focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably not what you were </v>

26
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:37.460
<v Speaker 1>expecting to see fred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fish doesn't quite do it for you,</v>

27
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>does he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had to be a little bit creative.</v>

28
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:42.674
<v Speaker 1>We had to approach this problem that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish and their appearance don't really </v>

29
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>draw that fuzzy emotion from you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you really want to help them out.</v>

30
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.440
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we took the approach that if,</v>

31
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.283
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if any of you have pets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you knew that when their food bowls </v>

32
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty happy.</v>

33
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Now if you take that food away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>

34
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>if fish were to suddenly be gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of their food sources,</v>

35
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>not so happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you add a slogan to it and there you</v>

36
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of our first advertisements.</v>

37
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.323
<v Speaker 1>So the second concept that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go over is one that we've actually </v>

38
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>borrowed from social psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

39
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that's called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door in the face technique.</v>

40
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.253
<v Speaker 1>So the gist of this technique is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you initially make a large request from </v>

41
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>an individual that's probably going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be shut down.</v>

42
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.923
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

43
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>That's probably going to be the answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to get.</v>

44
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>So then you follow up this request with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a much smaller,</v>

45
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.460
<v Speaker 1>more reasonable one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the behind that is that an individual</v>

46
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>is more likely to agree to the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>more reasonable request.</v>

47
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.213
<v Speaker 1>What is preceded by an outlandish one </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus has it had it been asked on its </v>

48
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.404
<v Speaker 1>own?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the final concept that I'm going to </v>

49
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.484
<v Speaker 1>go over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to require a little bit of </v>

50
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.614
<v Speaker 1>background knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to discuss and it's an </v>

51
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.764
<v Speaker 1>angle that we decided to take about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>health benefits that you receive when </v>

52
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>you ingest fish or possibly fish oil.</v>

53
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Now I imagine that many of you know who </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

54
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:33.660
<v Speaker 1>This is Tsai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>he's best known for his dancing Gangnam </v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

56
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.833
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ask your students on Monday or </v>

57
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>potentially your children tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very familiar with him.</v>

58
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>So gangnam style is essentially a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

59
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>it refers to a district in Seoul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea,</v>

60
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.853
<v Speaker 1>and the people who live there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a very affluent lifestyle and </v>

61
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>they achieve this wealth pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>

62
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>They didn't exactly have to work for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of this,</v>

63
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.233
<v Speaker 1>it's often related to this aphorism with</v>
<v Speaker 1>great power comes great responsibility </v>

64
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.683
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to work for their wealth and it </v>

65
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:13.264
<v Speaker 1>came overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really have a sense of their </v>

66
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:15.694
<v Speaker 1>social responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we decided to take this and related </v>

67
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>to fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to eating fish,</v>

68
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.923
<v Speaker 1>we're all live in Gangnam style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically what this means is that we </v>

69
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>were born into a world that has oceans </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were for this great resource.</v>

70
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were rich with fish,</v>

71
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>but because of this we didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop at the same time,</v>

72
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>that sense of responsibility that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to maintain our oceans and maintain</v>

73
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 1>their since sustainability.</v>

74
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.383
<v Speaker 1>So now to the psychological concept is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the offer is and that we decided to use </v>

75
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:52.290
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wanted to take it one step further.</v>

76
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're always doing are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

77
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 1>really pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you eat fish it helps with early</v>

78
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 1>brain development and the prevention or </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment of brain related problems.</v>

79
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.143
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>referring to the food chain like we did </v>

80
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:06.150
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how cats they fish.</v>

81
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 1>We had to think who really wants a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy brain zombies Zambizi brains and</v>

82
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:17.940
<v Speaker 1>they want them to be good as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy.</v>

83
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 1>And we're lucky because in Toronto we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of zombies.</v>

84
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>So you add that to the fact that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to dance Gangnam style.</v>

85
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>And now just to summarize and make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're following me,</v>

86
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I have zombies who need good brains and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that they need fish.</v>

87
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.873
<v Speaker 1>You add that to dancing gangnam style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You add that to the aphorism that we </v>

88
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:41.764
<v Speaker 1>developed about fish and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we're all living Gangnam style and </v>

89
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>the next logical progression that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to do.</v>

90
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Zombies dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gangam style,</v>

91
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>growing fish shirts with the catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase at the end.</v>

92
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Now you'd be surprised to know that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were actually beating to the punch.</v>

93
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>There was already a Zombie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dances,</v>

94
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.454
<v Speaker 1>Gangnam style and he does a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley as </v>

95
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had to we this idea,</v>

96
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.580
<v Speaker 1>but on a serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

97
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this truly has been one of the most </v>

98
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>rewarding but challenging projects I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had the opportunity to work on.</v>

99
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.943
<v Speaker 1>You soon learn that one 10th of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle is pulling together the correct </v>

100
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:22.574
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest is communication and finding </v>

101
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:25.364
<v Speaker 1>ways to make people listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that I quickly learned while </v>

102
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:29.474
<v Speaker 1>growing up and trying to get my parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see things my way is that everyone </v>

103
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:33.734
<v Speaker 1>has a different perspective and way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating that we all may speak a </v>

104
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:37.664
<v Speaker 1>particular language when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining a problem or inspiring </v>

105
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:41.774
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different things make sense and push </v>

106
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:44.534
<v Speaker 1>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some it is art such as image or </v>

107
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:48.734
<v Speaker 1>dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For others as it is an equation or a </v>

108
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 1>graph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some it is comedy and even others.</v>

109
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.453
<v Speaker 1>Reading and logic is fin school to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these mediums to raise public </v>

110
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>awareness about the decimation of marine</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

111
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.493
<v Speaker 1>Then with the help with every believer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to inspire change in Canada's </v>

112
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:07.454
<v Speaker 1>ocean management policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is something that we do not </v>

113
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:15.311
<v Speaker 1>plan to do by ourselves either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hope to create links not only between</v>

114
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>departments within the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>

115
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.793
<v Speaker 1>but also between all forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>postsecondary institutions across </v>

116
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:22.064
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arts and design schools as well as </v>

117
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>science and research institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>

118
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>we can reach out not only to communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>geographically across Canada,</v>

119
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>but also to the communities of </v>
<v Speaker 1>likeminded reasoning.</v>

120
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.273
<v Speaker 1>So on that note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to introduce now our first </v>

121
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:42.080
<v Speaker 1>speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

122
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.913
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He earned his phd in psychology at </v>

123
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:47.294
<v Speaker 1>Mcgill University and following his post</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor doctoral fellowship at Mcgill's </v>

124
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:51.643
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>served as a professor of psychology at </v>

125
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four years later,</v>

126
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.133
<v Speaker 1>he came to the University of Toronto </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he is a professor with two main </v>

127
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:00.824
<v Speaker 1>areas of study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychology of belief and the </v>

128
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:05.270
<v Speaker 1>assessment and improvement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

129
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.093
<v Speaker 1>His work has been supported by all three</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the main Canadian granting agencies </v>

130
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 1>as well as the Rotman Business School </v>
<v Speaker 1>Center for integrative thinking.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He has authored and coauthored over 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific articles including one book </v>

132

<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning the architecture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief and soon to be a second 42 Dr.</v>

133
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Peterson holds multiple order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching awards,</v>

134
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.503
<v Speaker 1>including a nomination for the Levinson </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching prize at a Harvard in 1998 and </v>

135

<v Speaker 1>nominations by Tvo as one of Ontario's </v>
<v Speaker 1>best university lectures each year from </v>

136
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>2005 to 2008 in addition to his clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

137
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

140
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.303
<v Speaker 1>He's also a frequent guest panelist on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tvo is the agenda and a popular source </v>

141
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>of information for other TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio programs,</v>

142
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:04.164
<v Speaker 1>and printed articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please welcome a man who through the </v>

143
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 1>years has inspired thousands of students</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pursue their dreams and instilled the</v>

144
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>belief and the members of fin that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can accomplish anything,</v>

145
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>so why not immediately started trying</v>

146
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.980
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] thanks Christine.</v>

147
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.273
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks to me like that's what we're </v>

148
00:09:40.361 --> 00:09:45.361
<v Speaker 3>facing over the next few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of an evocative phrase.</v>

149
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.990
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seems empty anyways because of course</v>

150
00:09:49.991 --> 00:09:51.850
<v Speaker 3>you can't see what's beneath the </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface,</v>

151
00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:56.851
<v Speaker 3>but before the depredations of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an amazing resource.</v>

152
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.150
<v Speaker 3>I started to learn about this and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to walk you through what I learned</v>

153
00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:05.984
<v Speaker 3>because I think it's a reasonable way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>introducing everyone to the basic </v>

154
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.180
<v Speaker 3>elements of familiarity that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary to understand what's happening</v>

155
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:20.660
<v Speaker 3>in the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess sometimes I've noticed that it's</v>

156
00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:21.494
<v Speaker 3>useful when you're teaching people not </v>
<v Speaker 3>to know a lot more than your audience </v>

157
00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:27.920
<v Speaker 3>does because if you start to develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>great expertise in an area,</v>

158
00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:31.580
<v Speaker 3>then you forget what people don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's easy to speak about things that</v>

159
00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:34.340
<v Speaker 3>aren't easy to fall on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't have any problem with that</v>

160
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:38.210
<v Speaker 3>tonight because as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a relative beginner in this area and</v>

161
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:41.540
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the things I learned were </v>
<v Speaker 3>really quite obvious things,</v>

162
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.730
<v Speaker 3>especially in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

163
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know them.</v>

164
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.473
<v Speaker 3>I got an opportunity to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>familiarizing myself with this </v>

165
00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:51.224
<v Speaker 3>particular issue because I was fortunate</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to work with the Canadian </v>

166
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.630
<v Speaker 3>subcommittee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

167
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.923
<v Speaker 3>that the secretary general of the UN set</v>
<v Speaker 3>up about three years ago on the </v>

168
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:05.090
<v Speaker 3>secretary general was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>producing a report and this is the final</v>

169
00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:05.540
<v Speaker 3>report.</v>

170
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.373
<v Speaker 3>Resilient people are resilient planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was sort of a followup to the </v>

171
00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:10.004
<v Speaker 3>1992 Brundtland Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the first real worldwide </v>

172
00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:18.230
<v Speaker 3>attempt to bring some order and </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence to ecological issues,</v>

173
00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:19.064
<v Speaker 3>some with a certain degree of success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that was followed up in Brazil in </v>

174
00:11:23.301 --> 00:11:26.870
<v Speaker 3>2012 with an ecological slash economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting.</v>

175
00:11:26.871 --> 00:11:31.850
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't precisely a raving success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this was the document that served as</v>

176
00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:35.360
<v Speaker 3>lead up to the 2012 20th anniversary of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

177
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.433
<v Speaker 3>of the Brundtland Commission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I was asked to serve on </v>

178
00:11:39.411 --> 00:11:41.900
<v Speaker 3>this committee was because the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who ran it,</v>

179
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:44.840
<v Speaker 3>it was headed by Jim ball silly who ran </v>
<v Speaker 3>Raymond Corporation.</v>

180
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.093
<v Speaker 3>The people who ran it didn't think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the underlying narrative of the report </v>

181
00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 3>was appropriate for the modern day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some sense it,</v>

182
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 3>it sort of felt like it had been written</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1984,</v>

183
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 3>which is actually quite a long time ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

184
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.213
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of north versus south </v>

185
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 3>ideology in it.</v>

186
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.413
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ideology that's less relevant now </v>

187
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.604
<v Speaker 3>that the less developed world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing at an incredible rate and </v>

188
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.503
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of left versus right </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology and it when it seems more </v>

189
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:14.524
<v Speaker 3>appropriate in the modern world to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that problems of this magnitude have to </v>

190
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 3>be solved by everyone regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their political orientation.</v>

191
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.773
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

192
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.020
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of underlying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlying implicit idea that the planet</v>

193
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 3>would be better off without the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it,</v>

194
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 3>which is not a position that I hold and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

195
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 3>which I also think is a dangerous one to</v>
<v Speaker 3>promote.</v>

196
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.660
<v Speaker 3>And so I had the opportunity to rephrase</v>
<v Speaker 3>the underlying structure of the document</v>

197
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:45.634
<v Speaker 3>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the degree that that's possible when </v>

198
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 3>you're working with multiple committees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

199
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.230
<v Speaker 3>but at least in part to stress some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the really great things that people have</v>

200
00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 3>accomplished over the last two decades.</v>

201
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.010
<v Speaker 3>And I want to start with that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's necessary to put things in context.</v>

202
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:00.844
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

203
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 3>we're assaulted by apocalypse is all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

204
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 50 years old now and I mean I can,</v>

205
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.653
<v Speaker 3>I've lived through at least five </v>
<v Speaker 3>probable apocalypse is none of which </v>

206
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.423
<v Speaker 3>thankfully it occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that is that it's </v>

207
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:15.664
<v Speaker 3>easy to get apocalypse overdose and in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense and to feel that you're assaulted </v>

208
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:21.544
<v Speaker 3>by catastrophes from so many directions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the only logical thing to do is to </v>

209
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:25.504
<v Speaker 3>ignore them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't think that's true because </v>

210
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.953
<v Speaker 3>people have been getting their act </v>
<v Speaker 3>together in multiple dimensions and </v>

211
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:34.960
<v Speaker 3>quite remarkable weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'll detail some of those.</v>

212
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:40.350
<v Speaker 3>In 1970 approximately 900 of the 3.5</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion people currently alive,</v>

213
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:42.274
<v Speaker 3>we're hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same number were hungry in 2008 </v>

214
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.953
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the population had doubled during that </v>

215
00:13:48.881 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

216
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 3>So the proportion of hungry people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the most rapid expansion of human</v>

217
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 3>population in history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty remarkable.</v>

218
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:57.574
<v Speaker 3>And it's not what people pr predicted </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the most dire environmental </v>

219
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.073
<v Speaker 3>estimates in the late 1960s were </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated on the idea that by the year </v>

220
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:06.994
<v Speaker 3>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the six or 7 billion people that </v>

221
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:11.670
<v Speaker 3>were likely to be around it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be widespread starvation.</v>

222
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:12.963
<v Speaker 3>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are better fed than they ever </v>

223
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:15.520
<v Speaker 3>have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

224
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 3>there are more obese people in the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>now than there are hungry people,</v>

225
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 3>which is really some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplishment even though it's,</v>

226
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damning in a sense with faint praise.</v>

227
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.513
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1981 about 52% of the world's </v>

228
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:32.020
<v Speaker 3>population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2 billion of 4.5</v>

229
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:37.140
<v Speaker 3>lived under the new World Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty cutoff estimates of a dollar and</v>

230
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 3>quarter a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By 2005,</v>

231
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:40.684
<v Speaker 3>that finger had decreased to 25% and </v>
<v Speaker 3>current estimates indicate that this </v>

232
00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 3>figure is moving down where it's at 2% </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the total world population per year,</v>

233
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 3>assuming one point percent which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative,</v>

234
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:58.210
<v Speaker 3>the percentage below the poverty cutoff </v>
<v Speaker 3>by now may have fallen to 15%.</v>

235
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.133
<v Speaker 3>So that's a staggering achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The proportion of people living in </v>

236
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:03.704
<v Speaker 3>poverty in East Asian Pacific has </v>
<v Speaker 3>decreased by more than 50% since 1990 </v>

237
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 3>and this after rates and already have in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the previous two decades,</v>

238
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.613
<v Speaker 3>lifespan has increased dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the spectacle in Africa now </v>

239
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:17.084
<v Speaker 3>where I read the economist a week and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>half ago that there are enough cell </v>

240
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 3>phones in Africa now so that three out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of four people have them.</v>

241
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 3>And that's brought tremendous economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantages to the people of Africa,</v>

242
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.993
<v Speaker 3>a contributing part to the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is almost impossible to believe </v>

243
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:35.900
<v Speaker 3>that the sub Saharan African countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>are now the fastest growing economies in</v>

244
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:36.734
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're actually in a position </v>

245
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:39.524
<v Speaker 3>maybe for the first time in human </v>
<v Speaker 3>history where the only reason for </v>

246
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:42.344
<v Speaker 3>starvation and hunger is political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's also been a staggering </v>

247
00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:47.894
<v Speaker 3>decrease in the number of antidem </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic or totalitarian states over </v>

248
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 3>the last 30 years.</v>

249
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 3>And it's partly because in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole idea of totalitarianism,</v>

250
00:15:57.231 --> 00:16:00.440
<v Speaker 3>whether it's on the left or the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has lost its essential validity.</v>

251
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:01.723
<v Speaker 3>Even the dictators themselves don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in there in the justifications </v>

252
00:16:04.521 --> 00:16:06.650
<v Speaker 3>they put forward for their abuse of </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

253
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:07.723
<v Speaker 3>And so what we've seen happening is </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible governments toppling one after </v>

254
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:13.670
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really a miraculous rate,</v>

255
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's all on top of the collapse of</v>

256
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:17.294
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet Union and the demolition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Iron Curtain and all these things </v>

257
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 3>that for someone my age seem absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>miraculous,</v>

258
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.293
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not dimension of course the opening up </v>

259
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:29.660
<v Speaker 3>of China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

260
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 3>three cheers for the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty damn good that we've managed</v>

261
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:35.930
<v Speaker 3>to put those sorts of successes </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

262
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.793
<v Speaker 3>Mean the UN had a millennium goal in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2000 to cut poverty in the world by </v>

263
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:41.204
<v Speaker 3>half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by 2015 they figured they hit that by </v>

264
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:47.780
<v Speaker 3>2011 so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things or just any,</v>

265
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:48.614
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any person with any sense would regard </v>

266
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:51.880
<v Speaker 3>that fundamentally as miraculous.</v>

267
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.713
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's massive economic productivity </v>

268
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 3>increases combined with massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>population increases.</v>

269
00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:00.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

270
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.280
<v Speaker 3>it's not all gloomy and so the UN and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the initial UN report had virtually none</v>

271
00:17:06.381 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 3>of that in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a real mistake.</v>

272
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:10.490
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because human beings,</v>

273
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got waste management problems and </v>

274
00:17:12.921 --> 00:17:14.940
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of us and we eat a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

275
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.290
<v Speaker 3>we're also trying as hard as we can to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put things together as fast as we can.</v>

276
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all things considered,</v>

277
00:17:19.611 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 3>there's always unreasonable people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

278
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:23.743
<v Speaker 3>for a bunch of creatures that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>separated from chimpanzees 7 million </v>

279
00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:27.861
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

280
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:28.694
<v Speaker 3>we're not doing that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't even understand oceanic be </v>

281
00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 3>called the g at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

282
00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 3>for acceptance into the last hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

283
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.380
<v Speaker 3>So we are trying to learn things as fast</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we can.</v>

284
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.333
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>credit where credit's due and there's a </v>

285
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 3>lot of credit do.</v>

286
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:49.160
<v Speaker 3>And it's also really important not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the case that everything's terrible</v>

287
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.770
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

288
00:17:50.771 --> 00:17:53.670
<v Speaker 3>it's a low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughtless case,</v>

289
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.893
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have to concentrate on things </v>

290
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 3>and differentiate between them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

291
00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.244
<v Speaker 3>the difference between things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems and things that aren't because </v>

292
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:02.694
<v Speaker 3>of everything's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you might as well just sit at home </v>

293
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 3>and drink gin because there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do about it.</v>

294
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth of the matter is,</v>

295
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 3>is that when we put our minds together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can actually fix things pretty fast.</v>

296
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.423
<v Speaker 3>And part of the necessity that precedes </v>
<v Speaker 3>fixing things is to become informed </v>

297
00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:18.864
<v Speaker 3>enough so that you understand at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>to some minimal degree what you're </v>

298
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:21.714
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm hoping that to some minimal </v>

299
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:25.560
<v Speaker 3>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm talking about him.</v>

300
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.930
<v Speaker 3>If I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping that Arthur Hansen,</v>

301
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:32.931
<v Speaker 3>who's a real expert on these matters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will correct me so well,</v>

302
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 3>what's still bad in the world?</v>

303
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>corruption still bad and it's a,</v>

304
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a cause of suffering that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely under addressed,</v>

305
00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:41.484
<v Speaker 3>I think often for political reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no doubt that we have a </v>

306
00:18:44.071 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Speaker 3>pollution problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say that's basically a waste</v>

307
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:47.514
<v Speaker 3>management problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the kind of problem that faces </v>

308
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:53.190
<v Speaker 3>really it a any creature because all </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures have to deal with their waste.</v>

309
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:54.024
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we produce a bit more of it than </v>

310
00:18:55.741 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 3>we should because we're pretty smart and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we build lots of things.</v>

311
00:18:58.501 --> 00:18:59.334
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is part and parcel of living in a </v>

312
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:06.030
<v Speaker 3>universe where the primary forces </v>
<v Speaker 3>thermodynamic deterioration,</v>

313
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hell of a thing to fight.</v>

314
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:12.600
<v Speaker 3>So it's not because we're innately evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we produce byproducts.</v>

315
00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 3>It's because life is very complex and </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to sustain and we want to live</v>

316
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:17.334
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wonder and we'd rather than everyone </v>

317
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:20.400
<v Speaker 3>didn't suffer any more than they had to.</v>

318
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's probably a good thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've got our reasons.</v>

319
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.150
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was going through all of this,</v>

320
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a couple of things that really</v>

321
00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:34.020
<v Speaker 3>stuck out for me and one of them was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>oceanic problem because,</v>

322
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a bunch of reasons.</v>

323
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:37.283
<v Speaker 3>The first was because I thought the data</v>
<v Speaker 3>indicating that what we were doing was </v>

324
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:41.784
<v Speaker 3>damaging was really in controvertible as</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to many of the issues that you </v>

325
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:49.740
<v Speaker 3>hear about from time to time or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly,</v>

326
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:50.843
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very clear that we're overfishing and </v>

327
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.623
<v Speaker 3>overfishing dramatically and that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing other things to the oceanic </v>

328
00:19:58.291 --> 00:19:59.124
<v Speaker 3>environment that are definitely not in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our medium or longterm interest to say </v>

329
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:04.074
<v Speaker 3>nothing about the creatures themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also thought that oceanic the oceanic </v>

330
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:08.874
<v Speaker 3>management problem was an appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem to consider from a more </v>

331
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:14.040
<v Speaker 3>practical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

332
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.100
<v Speaker 3>I thought a lot about global warming and</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

333
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to talk much about global </v>
<v Speaker 3>warming because that isn't what I'm here</v>

334
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 3>to talk about.</v>

335
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.913
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things I did realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>about global warming rapidly was that </v>

336
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:27.623
<v Speaker 3>the error in the estimates of the likely</v>
<v Speaker 3>warming of the planet over the next 60 </v>

337
00:20:31.801 --> 00:20:32.634
<v Speaker 3>years are so large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they're done by the best </v>

338
00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:38.370
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so large that even if we stopped</v>

339
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 3>using anything that produced carbon </v>
<v Speaker 3>dioxide now,</v>

340
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.950
<v Speaker 3>we would never know if that actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>helped.</v>

341
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 3>And when I looked at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

342
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:46.944
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how in the world are you going to sell </v>

343
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:50.170
<v Speaker 3>something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if it works,</v>

344
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:52.390
<v Speaker 3>you can't tell if it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus,</v>

345
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 3>you know that the time course of </v>
<v Speaker 3>improvement is over multiple decades and</v>

346
00:20:56.231 --> 00:21:01.231
<v Speaker 3>everyone uses hydro carbon energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a real killer to try to address.</v>

347
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 3>It seemed to me that it was more logical</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some ways to focus on problems.</v>

348
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:06.394
<v Speaker 3>It had a shorter horizon and some what </v>
<v Speaker 3>more immediate returns because that way </v>

349
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:11.704
<v Speaker 3>you can tell if all the effort that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're putting into solving the problem </v>

350
00:21:14.501 --> 00:21:15.334
<v Speaker 3>is actually having some sort of positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence and the oceanic management </v>

351
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:20.500
<v Speaker 3>problems seem to fit into that too.</v>

352
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.333
<v Speaker 3>It was wasn't intractable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a problem that was rapidly </v>

353
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 3>disappearing on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like world poverty seems to be,</v>

354
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:29.703
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could speed that up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the disappearance of poverty any </v>

355
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 3>more than it's been sped up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sorta hit maximum improvement.</v>

356
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:36.723
<v Speaker 3>So it's sort of falls into the category </v>
<v Speaker 3>of solvable problem with potentially </v>

357
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:42.850
<v Speaker 3>proper interventions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is,</v>

358
00:21:42.851 --> 00:21:45.940
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no losers to fixing this.</v>

359
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

360
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:48.304
<v Speaker 3>the oceanic mismanagement problem is of </v>
<v Speaker 3>such magnitude with the exception of </v>

361
00:21:52.721 --> 00:21:56.890
<v Speaker 3>certain species that if we keep up our </v>
<v Speaker 3>rate of fishing for the next 20 years,</v>

362
00:21:56.891 --> 00:21:58.930
<v Speaker 3>there's not going to be an awful lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

363
00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:02.800
<v Speaker 3>And that's not going to be very good for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the large corporations that you know,</v>

364
00:22:02.801 --> 00:22:03.634
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that make their economic living off the </v>

365
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:06.724
<v Speaker 3>oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's can be a real hard on us if we </v>

366
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:08.704
<v Speaker 3>want to eat.</v>

367
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.880
<v Speaker 3>And then of course there's the loss of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beauty and the diversity and,</v>

368
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.013
<v Speaker 3>and also the potential to truly </v>
<v Speaker 3>transform the nature of the ecosystems </v>

369
00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:19.960
<v Speaker 3>of the ocean in a way that really won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be good.</v>

370
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.123
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our planet's covered two thirds by </v>

371
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:23.374
<v Speaker 3>oceans and that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like we're messing with them in a </v>

372
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 3>really serious way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of the reason for that is,</v>

373
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:29.224
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish or fish and they've got scales and </v>

374
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:31.594
<v Speaker 3>they're not that brainy and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>after them with like 21st century </v>

375
00:22:34.481 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

376
00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 3>we use planes to spark them and sonar to</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out where they are and,</v>

377
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.960
<v Speaker 3>and you like ultrasonic mapping to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

378
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:44.863
<v Speaker 3>to check out the structure of the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ocean and massive nets and like </v>

379
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.640
<v Speaker 3>those bloody things don't have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not so good.</v>

380
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's inappropriate use of technology.</v>

381
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some real reasons for it.</v>

382
00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

383
00:22:59.321 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm a layperson and I read a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably read it called 40 books and a</v>

384
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:03.934
<v Speaker 3>whole pile of papers on this topic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>others and some of them were really </v>

385
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:07.804
<v Speaker 3>helpful and these are some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The end of the line is a great book and </v>

386
00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:13.170
<v Speaker 3>these are very straightforward books to </v>
<v Speaker 3>read there.</v>

387
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 3>They're very engaging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unnatural history to see.</v>

388
00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:20.140
<v Speaker 3>I love that the most important fish in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sea that's about this little herring</v>

389
00:23:20.141 --> 00:23:23.050
<v Speaker 3>like fish that lives off the Atlantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>coast called the Manhattan,</v>

390
00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:27.040
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of an in an inedible oily </v>
<v Speaker 3>beast of a herring.</v>

391
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:30.820
<v Speaker 3>And it it at least one time numbered in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hundreds of billions.</v>

392
00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 3>It might've been the most plentiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal on the surface of the planet,</v>

393
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.103
<v Speaker 3>maybe outnumbering all the other fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's at the very bottom of the food </v>

394
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:41.290
<v Speaker 3>chain and people can't really eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everything else does.</v>

395
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:42.123
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we're doing with the </v>

396
00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which seems,</v>

397
00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:46.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really not all that bright is vacuuming,</v>

398
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 3>vacuuming them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Mr.</v>

399
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.263
<v Speaker 3>Burns from the simpsons and grinding </v>
<v Speaker 3>them into fish fertilizer and spreading </v>

400
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 3>them all over the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

401
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:57.410
<v Speaker 3>when we have all sorts of other ways of </v>
<v Speaker 3>making fertilizer.</v>

402
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:58.740
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

403
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 3>we're stripping the whole bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>food chain out of the Atlantic coast.</v>

404
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:04.910
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that seems to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with political corruption in the eastern</v>

405
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:06.920
<v Speaker 3>US states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

406
00:24:06.921 --> 00:24:09.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a remarkable book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cod.</v>

407
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.740
<v Speaker 3>I love that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark Kurlansky,</v>

408
00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 3>he's a great author and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading about the devastation to the cod</v>

409
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:14.984
<v Speaker 3>fishery in the east coast is just enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make the bottom fall out of your </v>

410
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:20.840
<v Speaker 3>heart because it was so damn dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

411
00:24:20.841 --> 00:24:21.674
<v Speaker 3>everybody knew it was coming and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretended that it wasn't an we </v>

412
00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:25.094
<v Speaker 3>devastated rich resource that was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pride of the country and also a </v>

413
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:31.670
<v Speaker 3>mainstay of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world economy for five,</v>

414
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:33.110
<v Speaker 3>600 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

415
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 3>So it's a great book and I'm showing you</v>
<v Speaker 3>those books because that source material</v>

416
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:41.390
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of what I'm going to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

417
00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:42.224
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I learned about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oceans was that the oceans aren't that </v>

418
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:48.200
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not when you're talking about what lives</v>

419
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:49.034
<v Speaker 3>in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the ocean is actually have two </v>

420
00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:51.194
<v Speaker 3>kinds of structure and one structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>they call the pelagic zone and it only </v>

421
00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:58.310
<v Speaker 3>extends 50 miles from the shore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like this little skinny,</v>

422
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.323
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>offshoot of the continents essentially </v>

423
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.990
<v Speaker 3>maybe a note as the continental shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's only about 500 feet deep.</v>

424
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.280
<v Speaker 3>Now that's important because because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only that deep light can get to the</v>

425
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:11.114
<v Speaker 3>bottom from the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you need light for things to </v>

426
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 3>grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially plants.</v>

427
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:16.094
<v Speaker 3>And if plants can't grow then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals can't eat anything and then </v>

428
00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:19.340
<v Speaker 3>there aren't any animals.</v>

429
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.910
<v Speaker 3>So it turns out that all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the life fundamentally,</v>

430
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:23.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

431
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:27.470
<v Speaker 3>with a bit of an exception is within 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles from shore.</v>

432
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.590
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

433
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in these areas that are only,</v>

434
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:33.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>500 feet deeper last.</v>

435
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Now if you look at this map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the light blue areas,</v>

436
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 3>there are the pelagic zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

437
00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:40.124
<v Speaker 3>they look pretty big up in the Arctic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember this is all stretched out </v>

438
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 3>because it's not a very intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>projection,</v>

439
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.700
<v Speaker 3>but all the dark blue stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

440
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.730
<v Speaker 3>that's deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two miles deep on average.</v>

441
00:25:49.731 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 3>And it can be 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet deep and places.</v>

442
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that is it's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark.</v>

443
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.550
<v Speaker 3>No light gets down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really cold.</v>

444
00:25:58.551 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not much above freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really high pressure,</v>

445
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:04.310
<v Speaker 3>like higher pressure than the surface of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Venus.</v>

446
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.600
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not that hospitable for life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's not a lot around there.</v>

447
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.060
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that,</v>

448
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.620
<v Speaker 3>at least in part as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

449
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:15.530
<v Speaker 3>that's most of the ocean and be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly empty,</v>

450
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:19.460
<v Speaker 3>but because it's cold and dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that do live there,</v>

451
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.330
<v Speaker 3>well they're not very well understood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also grow very fast.</v>

452
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.180
<v Speaker 3>So if you do fish them and who we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing them,</v>

453
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:27.014
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fish them and it's like harvesting </v>

454
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 3>the trees that grow up in the Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

455
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.310
<v Speaker 3>they take forever to grow back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

456
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:36.980
<v Speaker 3>and as we fished out the pelagic zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which were,</v>

457
00:26:36.981 --> 00:26:37.814
<v Speaker 3>which were doing at a fairly rapid rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've increasingly turned to the </v>

458
00:26:40.671 --> 00:26:41.504
<v Speaker 3>neuritic zone with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with trawlers that can now </v>

459
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 3>reach 2000 meters down to the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean.</v>

460
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:47.760
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

461
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not high quality food.</v>

462
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:50.874
<v Speaker 3>Generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem too is we don't </v>

463
00:26:52.351 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 3>understand it well and it seems quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>easy to devastate.</v>

464
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.580
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a useful thing to know is that</v>

465
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.653
<v Speaker 3>there really isn't that much food </v>
<v Speaker 3>bearing ocean and that a lot of the </v>

466
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:05.520
<v Speaker 3>planet is sorta covered by water that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>too dark,</v>

467
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:06.354
<v Speaker 3>deep and cold to be of a lot of use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the things that really broke my </v>

468
00:27:11.341 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think reading this,</v>

469
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.123
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that these </v>

470
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:20.601
<v Speaker 3>books taught me was just how much there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was before we took it.</v>

471
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 3>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an anti human in any way,</v>

472
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Speaker 3>but the way this struck me was that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a catastrophic aesthetic and,</v>

473
00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:32.640
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and spiritual loss,</v>

474
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 3>a loss of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the absolute bounty of the planet and</v>

475
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 3>this sort of thing that that evokes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the viewer or the experience or the same</v>

476
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:41.394
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing that maybe is evoked when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look up at the sky and see the vast </v>

477
00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 3>array of stars sort of spread out before</v>
<v Speaker 3>you was the magnificence of nature.</v>

478
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.283
<v Speaker 3>And we're denying ourselves at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege of experiencing that </v>

479
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:55.440
<v Speaker 3>increasingly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me tell you what it was like when</v>

480
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 3>the Europeans first came to North </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

481
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.223
<v Speaker 3>You want to remember that this is even </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the native Americans had done a </v>

482
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:04.770
<v Speaker 3>fair bit of fishing and also after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europeans had already pretty much fished</v>

483
00:28:04.771 --> 00:28:08.350
<v Speaker 3>out their water's completely sturgeon </v>
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>

484
00:28:08.351 --> 00:28:09.184
<v Speaker 3>Sturgeon's a prehistoric fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been around about 60 million years </v>

485
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:14.040
<v Speaker 3>or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get really long and big.</v>

486
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 3>They get so big you have to haul them </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of rivers.</v>

487
00:28:16.021 --> 00:28:16.854
<v Speaker 3>With Oxen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can wait 1200 pounds and there are </v>

488
00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:21.270
<v Speaker 3>hardly any on the Atlantic coast </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

489
00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:22.104
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there are any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some steel in northwestern </v>

490
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live in the Fraser River,</v>

491
00:28:26.161 --> 00:28:27.710
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

492
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.290
<v Speaker 3>this was the potomac river in 1760 </v>
<v Speaker 3>potomac.</v>

493
00:28:31.291 --> 00:28:36.291
<v Speaker 3>I guess sturgeon and shad are in such </v>
<v Speaker 3>prodigious numbers that in one day,</v>

494
00:28:37.021 --> 00:28:37.854
<v Speaker 3>within the space of two miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only some gentlemen in canoes caught </v>

495
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:45.960
<v Speaker 3>about 600 of the former that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>sturgeon with hooks,</v>

496
00:28:45.961 --> 00:28:46.794
<v Speaker 3>which they let down to the bottom and </v>
<v Speaker 3>drew up at adventure when they perceive </v>

497
00:28:49.241 --> 00:28:51.930
<v Speaker 3>them to rub against the fish and of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ladder.</v>

498
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.823
<v Speaker 3>Shad about 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been caught in one single hole of </v>

499
00:28:55.681 --> 00:28:56.514
<v Speaker 3>the net,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was possible to cute cat 600 </v>

500
00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:00.054
<v Speaker 3>sturgeon in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd want imagine that 600 sturgeon are </v>

501
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:07.851
<v Speaker 3>caught now in the whole world in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alloway for herring in 1728 this is from</v>

502
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:09.924
<v Speaker 3>William Byrd when they spawn all streams</v>
<v Speaker 3>and waters are completely filled with </v>

503
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Speaker 3>them and one might believe when he sees </v>
<v Speaker 3>such terrible amounts of them that there</v>

504
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 3>was as great a supply of herring as </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is water in words.</v>

505
00:29:22.201 --> 00:29:23.034
<v Speaker 3>It is unbelievable indeed indescribable </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a whole so incomprehensible what </v>

506
00:29:27.991 --> 00:29:30.770
<v Speaker 3>quantity is found there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One must be hold oneself.</v>

507
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:31.703
<v Speaker 3>There are medieval pictures of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>herring run near the coast where people </v>

508
00:29:35.371 --> 00:29:36.204
<v Speaker 3>would put a Hallberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a kind of double headed ax </v>

509
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:38.994
<v Speaker 3>with on a on a pole in the water and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would stand because there were so many </v>

510
00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 3>herring around at the hearing themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>were packed in so tightly that the thing</v>

511
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:46.744
<v Speaker 3>would stay up in the water will you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would the hell of it is not much unlike </v>

512
00:29:51.731 --> 00:29:52.564
<v Speaker 3>a place or turd bought some being two </v>
<v Speaker 3>yards long and one wide and a foot </v>

513
00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 3>thick.</v>

514
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:57.363
<v Speaker 3>The plenty of better fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they had plenty of better fish than </v>

515
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:00.843
<v Speaker 3>halibut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the Europeans first came to North </v>

516
00:30:02.591 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 3>America make them little esteemed except</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head and fins,</v>

517
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:06.724
<v Speaker 3>which studer baked is very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These halibut's be little set by while </v>

518
00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:10.894
<v Speaker 3>Bass Bass is in season thorn back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>skates is given to the dogs being not </v>

519
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:15.724
<v Speaker 3>counted worth addressing in many places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should also know that when the </v>

520
00:30:18.381 --> 00:30:19.214
<v Speaker 3>Europeans first came to North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>salmon and lobster fell in the same </v>

521
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:23.044
<v Speaker 3>category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there were laws in New England about </v>

522
00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:29.740
<v Speaker 3>how many lobster you could feed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Convicts are slaves in a week because it</v>

523
00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:30.371
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

524
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 3>it was like feeding them bugs as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the new Englanders were concerned.</v>

525
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in salmon was so plentiful,</v>

526
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:36.934
<v Speaker 3>it was basically a junk fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these things that we now regard </v>

527
00:30:39.551 --> 00:30:43.070
<v Speaker 3>essentially is delicacies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially why wild salmon were there.</v>

528
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.903
<v Speaker 3>An absolutely unbelievable numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I lived in Boston for a little while </v>

529
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:51.430
<v Speaker 3>and I used to go up to the coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a place there called Cape Band,</v>

530
00:30:51.431 --> 00:30:52.264
<v Speaker 3>which was up where the whaling </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities used to be because it was a </v>

531
00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:58.330
<v Speaker 3>big whaling area and we used to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this beautiful beach that was like seven</v>

532
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 3>miles long and 300 yards wide and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>an absolutely pristine,</v>

533
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 3>gorgeous place and made the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the area,</v>

534
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:06.814
<v Speaker 3>recounts the nate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened to the beach after nor </v>

535
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.033
<v Speaker 3>easters and ignore Easter is like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurricane except it's the northern </v>

536
00:31:13.511 --> 00:31:16.240
<v Speaker 3>version of a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said after our good nor Easter,</v>

537
00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:17.074
<v Speaker 3>which happened around Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty often the beach there would be </v>

538
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.610
<v Speaker 3>covered with shellfish and other fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three feet deep and a hundred yards wide</v>

539
00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:28.710
<v Speaker 3>and seven miles long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why after there was a nor'easter,</v>

540
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.583
<v Speaker 3>the whole area would reek for months </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of all the rotting fish and </v>

541
00:31:32.221 --> 00:31:33.160
<v Speaker 3>self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shellfish.</v>

542
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.233
<v Speaker 3>I went to Cape and to the beach one time</v>
<v Speaker 3>after a nor eastern walked about three </v>

543
00:31:38.621 --> 00:31:40.690
<v Speaker 3>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found one starfish,</v>

544
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.530
<v Speaker 3>an empty lobster trap and a half dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>horseshoe crab.</v>

545
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.680
<v Speaker 3>And that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And normally walking on that beach,</v>

546
00:31:47.681 --> 00:31:48.514
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the degree to which the area </v>

547
00:31:51.581 --> 00:31:54.560
<v Speaker 3>had been essentially devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

548
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:55.563
<v Speaker 3>priest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrei Bernaul dads with Christopher </v>

549
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Columbus throat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that voyage,</v>

550
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:01.900
<v Speaker 3>they saw that there were many turtles </v>
<v Speaker 3>and very large,</v>

551
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.823
<v Speaker 3>but in those 20 leagues they saw very </v>
<v Speaker 3>many more for the sea was thick with </v>

552
00:32:05.771 --> 00:32:06.604
<v Speaker 3>them and they were of the largest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so numerous that it would seem that the </v>

553
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:12.790
<v Speaker 3>ships would run aground on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're as if bathing in them,</v>

554
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.893
<v Speaker 3>the Indians value them highly in regard </v>
<v Speaker 3>them as very good to eat unhealthy and </v>

555
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:17.374
<v Speaker 3>savory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Figured there were something on the </v>

556
00:32:19.211 --> 00:32:20.044
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood of two to 400 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>turtles in the Caribbean and they're </v>

557
00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:23.970
<v Speaker 3>pretty much all gone.</v>

558
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.623
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sea otters from San Francisco to the </v>

559
00:32:27.911 --> 00:32:28.744
<v Speaker 3>Santa Clara estuary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ground appeared covered with black </v>

560
00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:35.650
<v Speaker 3>sheets due to the great quantity of </v>
<v Speaker 3>orders which were there,</v>

561
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.353
<v Speaker 3>the disappearance of orders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were almost completely </v>

562
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.853
<v Speaker 3>wiped out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminated kelp forests because the </v>

563
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 3>order's eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the urchins,</v>

564
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:44.084
<v Speaker 3>which grains don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Kelp and removing the Kelp forest </v>

565
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:47.354
<v Speaker 3>swiped out steller sea cow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a 30 foot marine animal </v>

566
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.700
<v Speaker 3>similar to the manatee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except much larger.</v>

567
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:57.230
<v Speaker 3>It was wiped out the content along </v>
<v Speaker 3>habitat and hunting,</v>

568
00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.363
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>28 years after it's identification by </v>

569
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Europeans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

570
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 3>from California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a late 1850s,</v>

571
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:05.744
<v Speaker 3>a thousand gray whales a day passed </v>
<v Speaker 3>along the shore between December 15th </v>

572
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:13.130
<v Speaker 3>and February 1st.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are valid reports from all over</v>

573
00:33:13.131 --> 00:33:13.964
<v Speaker 3>the world before the whaling industry </v>
<v Speaker 3>really kicked in of whales being about </v>

574
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:18.014
<v Speaker 3>as common as porpoises are now when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see them swarming around the front of </v>

575
00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:22.280
<v Speaker 3>boats.</v>

576
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.380
<v Speaker 3>So there were whales absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

577
00:33:24.381 --> 00:33:27.180
<v Speaker 3>So you imagine that a thousand today for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

578
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.053
<v Speaker 3>for basically a three month period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So pairing 1776 when the main body has </v>

579
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:36.194
<v Speaker 3>arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's breadth and depth is such as to </v>

580
00:33:37.581 --> 00:33:38.414
<v Speaker 3>alter the very appearance of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is divided into distinct columns of </v>

581
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:45.650
<v Speaker 3>five or six miles in length and three or</v>
<v Speaker 3>four broad,</v>

582
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:46.933
<v Speaker 3>well the water before them curls up as </v>
<v Speaker 3>if forced out of it's been sometimes </v>

583
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:52.580
<v Speaker 3>they st for this base of 10 or 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

584
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Then rising into the surface and a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>weather,</v>

585
00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:56.624
<v Speaker 3>reflective variety of splendid colors </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a field be spangled with purple </v>

586
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 3>golden easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole water seems alive and it seems</v>

587
00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:07.760
<v Speaker 3>so blocked with them to a great distance</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the numbers seems inexhaustible.</v>

588
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.253
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were so many turtles swimming </v>

589
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:11.294
<v Speaker 3>towards the islands in the Caribbean is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when the sailors used to get lost </v>

590
00:34:13.701 --> 00:34:15.590
<v Speaker 3>in the fog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were close enough,</v>

591
00:34:15.591 --> 00:34:16.424
<v Speaker 3>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could sail to land by hearing the </v>

592
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:21.770
<v Speaker 3>turtles splash in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Along with the herring,</v>

593
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.173
<v Speaker 3>the herring schools of great magnitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were immense number of creditors </v>

594
00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:30.290
<v Speaker 3>because of course the herring is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>primary food for other fish.</v>

595
00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:34.040
<v Speaker 3>And so there were massive schools of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sharks and so on that would come along,</v>

596
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:38.690
<v Speaker 3>feed on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had doc from Goldsmith and 18,</v>

597
00:34:38.691 --> 00:34:39.524
<v Speaker 3>10 the annually visit the British coast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shows that sometimes extend along </v>

598
00:34:43.491 --> 00:34:47.750
<v Speaker 3>the shore a hundred miles in length and </v>
<v Speaker 3>300 miles in breadth</v>

599
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 3>in 1855 43 fishing schooners from </v>
<v Speaker 3>beverly,</v>

600
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts caught more cod south of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nova Scotia on the Scotian shelf.</v>

601
00:34:57.621 --> 00:34:58.454
<v Speaker 3>So these are just sailing ships than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire Canadian fleet caught there in </v>

602
00:35:01.791 --> 00:35:05.190
<v Speaker 3>1999,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six years later,</v>

603
00:35:05.191 --> 00:35:06.024
<v Speaker 3>34 schooners landed more card on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Maine coast between Penobscot Bay in </v>

604
00:35:09.481 --> 00:35:10.314
<v Speaker 3>Grand Manan that we're caught in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire Gulf of Maine from Cape Cod to </v>

605
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Canada in 1999.</v>

606
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.013
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

607
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.533
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you read those books that I showed </v>

608
00:35:19.891 --> 00:35:20.724
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just full of accounts of </v>

609
00:35:22.171 --> 00:35:25.830
<v Speaker 3>precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sorta makes painful reading.</v>

610
00:35:25.831 --> 00:35:26.664
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's Kurlansky also wrote a book </v>

611
00:35:28.921 --> 00:35:29.754
<v Speaker 3>called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

612
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.710
<v Speaker 3>the big oyster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about New York.</v>

613
00:35:31.711 --> 00:35:34.020
<v Speaker 3>And he talked about what Chesapeake Bay </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be like.</v>

614
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:35.703
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kurlansky claims that the average sized </v>

615
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.930
<v Speaker 3>oyster 300 years ago was as big as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner plate and had to be cut into four</v>

616
00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:43.764
<v Speaker 3>pieces before it could be water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so chesapeake bay was an absolutely </v>

617
00:35:48.181 --> 00:35:49.014
<v Speaker 3>staggering masterpiece of natural plenty</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's pretty much been reduced to </v>

618
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 3>nothing as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it makes pretty painful reading.</v>

619
00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:58.980
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I also learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

620
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:00.510
<v Speaker 3>and I'll talk about this a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>

621
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:01.344
<v Speaker 3>is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you hear estimates of fish stock </v>

622
00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:03.624
<v Speaker 3>depletion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear things like 95% since the </v>

623
00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 3>beginning of the 20th century.</v>

624
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.110
<v Speaker 3>But lots of these writers claimed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fish stocks had already been reduced</v>

625
00:36:10.111 --> 00:36:13.470
<v Speaker 3>by 95% or more by the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>20th century.</v>

626
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 3>So we're looking at a 95% reduction in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>95% reduction.</v>

627
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of hurts.</v>

628
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a lot of reasons for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them is called the tragedy of the</v>

629
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Commons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the tragedy of the Commons is,</v>

630
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.163
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that there's a field on which </v>

631
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:30.564
<v Speaker 3>anybody can graze their sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the logical thing to do is to get </v>

632
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:34.374
<v Speaker 3>your sheep out there and let them eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the grass before the next guy gets </v>

633
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:38.610
<v Speaker 3>his sheep out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he told the groks.</v>

634
00:36:38.611 --> 00:36:39.444
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the tragedy of the Commons is </v>

635
00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:45.330
<v Speaker 3>that when there's no fixed ownership of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a resource,</v>

636
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:46.283
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense economically for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who gets first access to the </v>

637
00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:51.270
<v Speaker 3>resource to take as much of it as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

638
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Because anything they leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in principle,</v>

639
00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:57.480
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be taken by someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And historically,</v>

640
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.270
<v Speaker 3>until at least 1978 the open ocean was </v>
<v Speaker 3>only seven miles off shore.</v>

641
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.433
<v Speaker 3>That's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the national jurisdiction and did </v>

642
00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:08.400
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rest of the sea was regarded as,</v>

643
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a free charactery in a sense.</v>

644
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:14.280
<v Speaker 3>So people can take whatever they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

645
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.980
<v Speaker 3>you can see that as a legal and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>structural problem.</v>

646
00:37:16.981 --> 00:37:21.981
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of the main contributors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another contributor right now to,</v>

647
00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:29.040
<v Speaker 3>to the continued decimation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world's fish stocks.</v>

648
00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:29.874
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>regulation difficult is what's being </v>

649
00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 3>described as technological creep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he say,</v>

650
00:37:35.401 --> 00:37:36.230
<v Speaker 3>it might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

651
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can limit your boat to 40 the </v>

652
00:37:38.761 --> 00:37:41.640
<v Speaker 3>boats that are allowed to fish to 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet in length or something like that.</v>

653
00:37:41.641 --> 00:37:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Instead of these massive factory boats </v>
<v Speaker 3>that go out and you know,</v>

654
00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:48.510
<v Speaker 3>sit on the ocean for months and vacuum </v>
<v Speaker 3>up everything in their trail.</v>

655
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.330
<v Speaker 3>The problem with technological creek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sounds like a,</v>

656
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:52.403
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe some kind of computer programmer </v>

657
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:54.534
<v Speaker 3>who's looking lurking in the bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that even your 40 foot keeps getting </v>

658
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 3>outfitted with better and better </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

659
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because as you know,</v>

660
00:38:04.711 --> 00:38:08.430
<v Speaker 3>how fast our technology increases and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have the same size boat that you</v>

661
00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:09.264
<v Speaker 3>had 10 years ago and the things like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>times as deadly as it was because you </v>

662
00:38:12.601 --> 00:38:13.434
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're outfitted with the latest gear </v>

663
00:38:14.641 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 3>and you can understand why the fishermen</v>
<v Speaker 3>are driven to that.</v>

664
00:38:17.431 --> 00:38:18.264
<v Speaker 3>But it's another structural problem that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that adds to this general overall </v>

665
00:38:23.341 --> 00:38:25.070
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

666
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.010
<v Speaker 3>the use of this sort of space age </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology has had a pretty catastrophic</v>

667
00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:30.210
<v Speaker 3>consequence too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

668
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing something that call,</v>

669
00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:34.170
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to,</v>

670
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.180
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing down the food chain.</v>

671
00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:39.130
<v Speaker 3>And so the way the food chains are set </v>
<v Speaker 3>up is there's like,</v>

672
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plankton at the bottom and neat whatever</v>

673
00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:42.570
<v Speaker 3>they can get their little hands on.</v>

674
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 3>And they're often a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't actually have handsome,</v>

675
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.533
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they also useful to synthesis and </v>

676
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.113
<v Speaker 3>they're there at the bottom of the food </v>
<v Speaker 3>chain is billions of the things being </v>

677
00:38:50.981 --> 00:38:51.731
<v Speaker 3>whales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat them,</v>

678
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:54.340
<v Speaker 3>some whales and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little fish eat those.</v>

679
00:38:54.341 --> 00:38:56.700
<v Speaker 3>And then bigger fish eat the little fish</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bigger fish eat,</v>

680
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the medium size fish and so on,</v>

681
00:38:58.661 --> 00:39:01.620
<v Speaker 3>all the way up to things like sharps and</v>
<v Speaker 3>swordfish and tuna and,</v>

682
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.810
<v Speaker 3>and human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what we're basically doing,</v>

683
00:39:04.811 --> 00:39:07.360
<v Speaker 3>we tend to like the fish that are higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>up on the,</v>

684
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.350
<v Speaker 3>on the food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

685
00:39:09.351 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 3>we tend to like the taste of predatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish cause they're hard muscle.</v>

686
00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.900
<v Speaker 3>And now the problem with that is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the higher you are,</v>

687
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:17.763
<v Speaker 3>you are up in the food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fewer there can be of you in part </v>

688
00:39:20.021 --> 00:39:20.854
<v Speaker 3>because you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your primary sources of food or limited </v>

689
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 3>by this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by this pyramid phenomena.</v>

690
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.213
<v Speaker 3>As we've got better and better from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological perspective at catching </v>

691
00:39:30.311 --> 00:39:31.930
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happened is we keep,</v>

692
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.853
<v Speaker 3>we are fishing down the food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go from the great big fish at the </v>

693
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:37.300
<v Speaker 3>top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the sharks,</v>

694
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 3>about 70 million a year of which right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now are killed for shark fin soup.</v>

695
00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.481
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

696
00:39:42.481 --> 00:39:44.410
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 million a year,</v>

697
00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:45.723
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna run out of sharks and no </v>

698
00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:48.700
<v Speaker 3>time flat if we keep things up at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>rate.</v>

699
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:49.893
<v Speaker 3>And so we fished down the food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take the big predators first and </v>

700
00:39:52.961 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 3>they're the most valuable fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we go after what they go after.</v>

701
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:58.540
<v Speaker 3>And then we go after what that fish has </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone after.</v>

702
00:39:58.541 --> 00:39:59.374
<v Speaker 3>And we go out farther afield and we go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out into the deep ocean and we find </v>

703
00:40:02.321 --> 00:40:03.154
<v Speaker 3>places that no one's fished before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're so damn good at it now that </v>

704
00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:07.414
<v Speaker 3>the time to exhaustion of the new fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>species from the time we discovered is </v>

705
00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:14.020
<v Speaker 3>about 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can discover a new species,</v>

706
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:16.450
<v Speaker 3>which is often given,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's half the inedible,</v>

707
00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:17.284
<v Speaker 3>it's given a real market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll name we go after it was facing </v>

708
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:22.340
<v Speaker 3>each technology and wipe it down to more</v>
<v Speaker 3>than two,</v>

709
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 3>less than 85% if it's previous numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>within 15 years,</v>

710
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.390
<v Speaker 3>we're really deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

711
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as we discover something,</v>

712
00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:30.904
<v Speaker 3>plus there's so many of us that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in serious trouble and pretty </v>

713
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 3>much no time flat</v>

714
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.423
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has been a global decline in the </v>

715
00:40:42.651 --> 00:40:47.120
<v Speaker 3>world's catch ever since about 1998 if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you control for Red China's data,</v>

716
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.730
<v Speaker 3>because the Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I've been able to determine,</v>

717
00:40:49.731 --> 00:40:52.010
<v Speaker 3>tend to inflate their production </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

718
00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a standard trick and totalitarian</v>

719
00:40:54.921 --> 00:40:56.540
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are,</v>

720
00:40:56.541 --> 00:40:59.530
<v Speaker 3>even though we switch our switching to </v>
<v Speaker 3>different species and,</v>

721
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:01.250
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty damn good at that.</v>

722
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:05.720
<v Speaker 3>We haven't been able to halt the decline</v>
<v Speaker 3>in overall catch despite the fact that,</v>

723
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our technology is improved a lot.</v>

724
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:10.490
<v Speaker 3>We're going after other species and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good thing.</v>

725
00:41:10.491 --> 00:41:13.250
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that's really worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>noting about fish,</v>

726
00:41:13.251 --> 00:41:14.084
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced me that there really was a </v>

727
00:41:15.801 --> 00:41:18.140
<v Speaker 3>problem was you guys might know about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

728
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.980
<v Speaker 3>the bat that was made by a star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stanford biologist,</v>

729
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.083
<v Speaker 3>Paul Erlick and an economist whose name </v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember in about 1968 and Paul </v>

730
00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Erlick had written this book called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Population Bob,</v>

731
00:41:29.901 --> 00:41:31.010
<v Speaker 3>where he predicted that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

732
00:41:31.011 --> 00:41:32.840
<v Speaker 3>we're all going to starve to death by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the year two.</v>

733
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.633
<v Speaker 3>And the economists always disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the biologist because economists think </v>

734
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:40.210
<v Speaker 3>we're real smart and can think our way </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of everything.</v>

735
00:41:40.211 --> 00:41:42.980
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so far they've been,</v>

736
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:44.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonably right.</v>

737
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 3>The biologist say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

738
00:41:46.101 --> 00:41:46.934
<v Speaker 3>it's just a time thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll Melle Mel fussell when eventually </v>

739
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:50.893
<v Speaker 3>and who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this economist Bet Erlick that by </v>

740
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:58.430
<v Speaker 3>the year 2000 and commodity prices would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have gone down instead of up.</v>

741
00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Cause Eric's idea was everything's </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting scarce.</v>

742
00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:01.484
<v Speaker 3>So from 1968 to the year 2000 all of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>commodities which are somewhat scarce </v>

743
00:42:05.361 --> 00:42:08.510
<v Speaker 3>are going to increase in price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Erlick got stomped.</v>

744
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:13.550
<v Speaker 3>The commodity prices plummeted between </v>
<v Speaker 3>1968 and 2000 so the economist had them,</v>

745
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:17.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beat him in no uncertain terms.</v>

746
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.540
<v Speaker 3>But the one thing that didn't work out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way is seafood.</v>

747
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean things like card used to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap,</v>

748
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seafood used to be cheap fish and chips.</v>

749
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.590
<v Speaker 3>That was the cheapest thing you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy on the menu.</v>

750
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:28.903
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not like that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See food is expensive and you know </v>

751
00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:34.640
<v Speaker 3>bloody well when something gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive that there actually isn't that</v>

752
00:42:34.641 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 3>much of it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good marker.</v>

753
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have global decline,</v>

754
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 3>global catch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>declining figures,</v>

755
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:43.663
<v Speaker 3>allied with pretty hard economic data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fish is a lot more expensive than </v>

756
00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:49.370
<v Speaker 3>it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus we're harvesting,</v>

757
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.413
<v Speaker 3>we're harvesting species that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have even considered edible a </v>

758
00:42:53.331 --> 00:42:54.290
<v Speaker 3>hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

759
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:55.124
<v Speaker 3>200 years ago they were complaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>about halibut and feeding it to their </v>

760
00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:58.274
<v Speaker 3>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's a high quality fish by </v>

761
00:42:59.781 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 3>our standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no doubt that this is a real,</v>

762
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.383
<v Speaker 3>this is a real phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's other awful things that </v>

763
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.220
<v Speaker 3>really are kind of difficult to tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you read about them.</v>

764
00:43:12.221 --> 00:43:17.221
<v Speaker 3>And trawling is one of them in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a nice description of trolling.</v>

765
00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.473
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically what a troll does is it's a </v>

766
00:43:23.331 --> 00:43:24.164
<v Speaker 3>huge net that's put behind a really big </v>
<v Speaker 3>boat and the net is weighted down and </v>

767
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:29.984
<v Speaker 3>has rollers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different kinds of </v>

768
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:31.964
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has rollers and you put it on the </v>

769
00:43:33.081 --> 00:43:33.914
<v Speaker 3>bottom of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of digs down to a depth of about </v>

770
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 3>eight inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you just drag the thing and you</v>

771
00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:42.110
<v Speaker 3>drag it till the net fills up and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it fill up with?</v>

772
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever's down there,</v>

773
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:45.770
<v Speaker 3>coral.</v>

774
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

775
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:47.873
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially now that they're fishing out </v>

776
00:43:49.231 --> 00:43:51.600
<v Speaker 3>the deeper areas of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the corals coming up,</v>

777
00:43:51.601 --> 00:43:54.720
<v Speaker 3>300 pound chunks of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they figured it takes 10,000</v>

778
00:43:54.721 --> 00:43:57.540
<v Speaker 3>years to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know that's habitat for,</v>

779
00:43:57.541 --> 00:44:00.420
<v Speaker 3>for fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You run a trawler over an area,</v>

780
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.460
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing left of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes everything.</v>

781
00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.290
<v Speaker 3>You haul it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens?</v>

782
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.910
<v Speaker 3>You take your 10% of the damn fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's in there that you want to eat and</v>

783
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.640
<v Speaker 3>you throw 90% back because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do by law.</v>

784
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.580
<v Speaker 3>So the bycatch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

785
00:44:14.581 --> 00:44:18.210
<v Speaker 3>which is what you don't want his 90% </v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

786
00:44:18.211 --> 00:44:19.044
<v Speaker 3>it goes into the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now remember I showed you the </v>

787
00:44:21.331 --> 00:44:22.164
<v Speaker 3>continental shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not that much of it while we've </v>

788
00:44:23.611 --> 00:44:24.444
<v Speaker 3>trolled most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that isn't stopping in the </v>

789
00:44:26.971 --> 00:44:27.804
<v Speaker 3>trawlers are getting bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something they call the super </v>

790
00:44:29.521 --> 00:44:32.490
<v Speaker 3>trawler that was heading down to despite</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of,</v>

791
00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:33.483
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>public outcry because the Australians </v>

792
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:36.480
<v Speaker 3>are fairly sensitive about this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

793
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:37.643
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get bigger and bigger and bigger </v>

794
00:44:38.761 --> 00:44:40.610
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly because they're,</v>

795
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:41.693
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they can and partly because </v>

796
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:44.790
<v Speaker 3>they're chasing and diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>resource.</v>

797
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.000
<v Speaker 3>So you imagine what would happen if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

798
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.270
<v Speaker 3>went through a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

799
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:53.271
<v Speaker 3>a nice bit of grassland or National Park</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a net 300 feet high and it was,</v>

800
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:55.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drag through by tractors.</v>

801
00:44:55.981 --> 00:44:57.810
<v Speaker 3>You just take everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trees,</v>

802
00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 3>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moose,</v>

803
00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 3>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insects,</v>

804
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.910
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull out the things you can eat,</v>

805
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.560
<v Speaker 3>let everything else rock Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was happening on the land,</v>

806
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 3>people would be shorting out and running</v>
<v Speaker 3>around in circles screaming.</v>

807
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:10.794
<v Speaker 3>But it's happening on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the bottom of the ocean and no one </v>

808
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 3>can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just happening once.</v>

809
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.863
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of places in the North Sea </v>
<v Speaker 3>which used to be clear and is no longer </v>

810
00:45:19.201 --> 00:45:21.480
<v Speaker 3>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's muddy because of the trawling,</v>

811
00:45:21.481 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 3>at least in part because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbance of the ocean floor.</v>

812
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.540
<v Speaker 3>That place is being trolled like three </v>
<v Speaker 3>or four times.</v>

813
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:29.370
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

814
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.830
<v Speaker 3>obviously that's not going to work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>very long.</v>

815
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 3>So here's our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the description.</v>

816
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.213
<v Speaker 3>Picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 2000 horsepower trawler targeting </v>

817
00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:38.184
<v Speaker 3>place or soul pulling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a beam trawl mounted with a rotating </v>

818
00:45:41.131 --> 00:45:41.964
<v Speaker 3>tickler with rotating tickler chains </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the featureless fans and gravels </v>

819
00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:47.064
<v Speaker 3>of the southern North Sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weight in troll and its chains </v>

820
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:55.850
<v Speaker 3>designed to beat flat fish out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheltering mud smashes up everything.</v>

821
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 3>It does not catch particularly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>burrowing animals in the sediment,</v>

822
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 3>disturbing them at depths of up to six </v>
<v Speaker 3>inches.</v>

823
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.533
<v Speaker 3>European Union scientists have </v>
<v Speaker 3>calculated that up to 16 pounds of </v>

824
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:07.134
<v Speaker 3>marine animals are killed by being </v>
<v Speaker 3>trawls to produce one pound of </v>

825
00:46:10.891 --> 00:46:13.620
<v Speaker 3>marketable soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sea urchins,</v>

826
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:16.680
<v Speaker 3>hermit crabs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brittle stars and razor shells or killed</v>

827
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.400
<v Speaker 3>or having part of their shells opened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made vulnerable to predators.</v>

828
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Starfish tend to be the survivors losing</v>
<v Speaker 3>a leg or two,</v>

829
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:24.390
<v Speaker 3>but escaping the net.</v>

830
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:25.583
<v Speaker 3>The winter and heavily traveled areas </v>
<v Speaker 3>are usually crabs which move in from </v>

831
00:46:28.561 --> 00:46:29.394
<v Speaker 3>other areas to eat damaged creatures and</v>
<v Speaker 3>worms that take over from the easily </v>

832
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:33.744
<v Speaker 3>damaged by valves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scientists have concluded that most </v>

833
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:38.184
<v Speaker 3>parts of the southern North Sea have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been disturbed by a beam trial at least </v>

834
00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:42.504
<v Speaker 3>once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The damage caused by phishing is </v>

835
00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:45.444
<v Speaker 3>estimated at 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>times greater than that of oil or gas </v>

836
00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Speaker 3>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's pretty much total devastation.</v>

837
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.620
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of distressing.</v>

838
00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:56.943
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they estimate about 25% of the </v>

839
00:46:58.981 --> 00:47:01.440
<v Speaker 3>world's total catch is hauled in by </v>
<v Speaker 3>trawls.</v>

840
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:02.813
<v Speaker 3>So that just doesn't seem like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly intelligent way of going </v>

841
00:47:06.151 --> 00:47:06.984
<v Speaker 3>about things now because the whole shelf</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been trawled and there's not a hell </v>

842
00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:12.330
<v Speaker 3>of a lot left there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've developed trawls and can go down</v>

843
00:47:12.331 --> 00:47:15.360
<v Speaker 3>to 2000 meters and 2000 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

844
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 3>that's getting to be a mile and a half.</v>

845
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's close to the average depth of the</v>

846
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 3>deepest part of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when you go way down in the ocean,</v>

847
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:24.803
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot there as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are places in the ocean floor </v>

848
00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:27.864
<v Speaker 3>that are seen mouths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they sort of poke up and when they </v>

849
00:47:29.921 --> 00:47:30.754
<v Speaker 3>poke up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>currents come up to them and there's a </v>

850
00:47:32.741 --> 00:47:33.574
<v Speaker 3>lot of food on the sea mount areas and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can map those out really nicely </v>

851
00:47:36.101 --> 00:47:37.270
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And with the deep sea trials,</v>

852
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:39.850
<v Speaker 3>they just go over the sea mounts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>take everything that's there.</v>

853
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:43.960
<v Speaker 3>So and perceives or are also pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating,</v>

854
00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:44.794
<v Speaker 3>especially when you combine them with </v>
<v Speaker 3>spotting new airplanes because the </v>

855
00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:49.480
<v Speaker 3>spotting airplanes go off the coast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they find a,</v>

856
00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a school and then the scenes,</v>

857
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.860
<v Speaker 3>the savings come in and they take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole school.</v>

858
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:55.323
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's also not really particularly a </v>

859
00:47:58.571 --> 00:48:00.550
<v Speaker 3>promising thing to be happening.</v>

860
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.953
<v Speaker 3>So then the next problematic form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing seems to be maybe longline </v>

861
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:07.923
<v Speaker 3>fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so long lines are pretty much </v>

862
00:48:10.211 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 3>exactly what they sound like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very long fishing lines and very</v>

863
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:18.670
<v Speaker 3>long means up to 40 miles long and with </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 hooks per mile.</v>

864
00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:21.400
<v Speaker 3>And so that's 1200 hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

865
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:22.263
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're often catching the kind of fish </v>

866
00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.530
<v Speaker 3>that you'd like to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the catch a lot of other things too,</v>

867
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:27.364
<v Speaker 3>like tens of thousands of seabirds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tens of thousands of turtles and all </v>

868
00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:34.540
<v Speaker 3>sorts of things in sharks and all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things that you know,</v>

869
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 3>will eat anything that's on a baited </v>
<v Speaker 3>hook.</v>

870
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 3>So the bike catch problem with longline </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing is also horrendous.</v>

871
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.930
<v Speaker 3>So that's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Kinda,</v>

872
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>miserable to apprehend as well.</v>

873
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.011
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

874
00:48:50.011 --> 00:48:50.844
<v Speaker 3>there's this thing I mentioned a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit earlier about the Manhattan and </v>

875
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:53.740
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

876
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:54.573
<v Speaker 3>that was a very distressing book to read</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're the Manhattan because </v>

877
00:48:58.111 --> 00:49:00.870
<v Speaker 3>they're at the bottom of the food chain </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

878
00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:01.704
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

879
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:03.690
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>near where the little fish are there.</v>

880
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it Manhattan.</v>

881
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.570
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our vegetarian,</v>

882
00:49:06.571 --> 00:49:09.230
<v Speaker 3>most fish aren't vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these guys are vegetarians.</v>

883
00:49:09.231 --> 00:49:11.660
<v Speaker 3>So that's what puts them at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the food chain.</v>

884
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:15.480
<v Speaker 3>They also take a lot of garbage out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water because they're vegetarian.</v>

885
00:49:15.481 --> 00:49:18.090
<v Speaker 3>And so if there's Algal blooms or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

886
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.983
<v Speaker 3>which there often is because of nitrogen</v>
<v Speaker 3>runoff from fertilizers from the land </v>

887
00:49:21.811 --> 00:49:22.644
<v Speaker 3>and the Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go in there and cleaned it up and </v>

888
00:49:24.271 --> 00:49:25.104
<v Speaker 3>then all the other official eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they take the Manhattan out to turn </v>

889
00:49:27.151 --> 00:49:29.460
<v Speaker 3>them into fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as I said already,</v>

890
00:49:29.461 --> 00:49:31.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to be served at least in part</v>

891
00:49:31.501 --> 00:49:32.334
<v Speaker 3>by corruption in the east coast states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do the same thing in Denmark with </v>

892
00:49:35.971 --> 00:49:36.804
<v Speaker 3>this thing called the Sandy Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's another one of these ugly </v>

893
00:49:38.461 --> 00:49:40.020
<v Speaker 3>little things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

894
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:43.020
<v Speaker 3>people wouldn't normally eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everything else does.</v>

895
00:49:43.021 --> 00:49:45.840
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sort of like the Manhattan,</v>

896
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.790
<v Speaker 3>they breed like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

897
00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:48.683
<v Speaker 3>they've been catching them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>catching those up a store and do it and </v>

898
00:49:50.491 --> 00:49:52.400
<v Speaker 3>often burning them for oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

899
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:53.843
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

900
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's us,</v>

901
00:49:56.411 --> 00:49:57.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

902
00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Canada is by no means an ecological </v>
<v Speaker 3>paradise.</v>

903
00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Like we like to pride ourselves on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that,</v>

904
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:03.724
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were there sort of great north with our </v>

905
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:07.960
<v Speaker 3>massive forests in our care for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

906
00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Most of that's pretty much rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

907
00:50:10.661 --> 00:50:15.340
<v Speaker 3>we have a far a smaller portion of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory devoted to,</v>

908
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.223
<v Speaker 3>to national parks in the American Stu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact that what 95% of the </v>

909
00:50:20.141 --> 00:50:24.040
<v Speaker 3>country is basically uninhabited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a pretty shocking statistic.</v>

910
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:24.874
<v Speaker 3>And the Americans have done a much </v>
<v Speaker 3>better job at managing their fisheries </v>

911
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:28.880
<v Speaker 3>than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

912
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:29.714
<v Speaker 3>we should have been shocked into what </v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassed action in 1992 when this </v>

913
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:37.250
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

914
00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cod fishery off the grand banks and </v>

915
00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:41.204
<v Speaker 3>being there for 400 years and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really one of the world's remarkable </v>

916
00:50:44.661 --> 00:50:46.160
<v Speaker 3>treasures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

917
00:50:46.161 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around before,</v>

918
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I guess 1978,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

919
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.490
<v Speaker 3>the limit to national sovereignty I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think was seven miles.</v>

920
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:58.310
<v Speaker 3>It's far as seven miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember exactly what,</v>

921
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.160
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Spanner Spaniards and the Portuguese</v>

922
00:51:01.161 --> 00:51:01.994
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and lots of European fishing boats were </v>

923
00:51:03.531 --> 00:51:04.364
<v Speaker 3>in the grand banks fishing like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course they'd been doing for </v>

924
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.233
<v Speaker 3>really almost 600 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Basques might've even got there </v>

925
00:51:10.641 --> 00:51:11.474
<v Speaker 3>before Christopher Columbus and not told</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody because they like to have all </v>

926
00:51:15.231 --> 00:51:16.160
<v Speaker 3>those fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:20.000
<v Speaker 3>and basks they're pretty sneaky people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

928
00:51:20.001 --> 00:51:20.834
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the Canadian government made a big </v>

929
00:51:22.221 --> 00:51:25.850
<v Speaker 3>fuss about the fact that all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreigners were out there taking out the</v>

930
00:51:25.851 --> 00:51:26.684
<v Speaker 3>card and they were part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the political force that got the </v>

931
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 3>national sovereignty zone extended to </v>
<v Speaker 3>200 miles off shore.</v>

932
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 3>So the candidate had manage its own cod </v>
<v Speaker 3>stocks.</v>

933
00:51:37.431 --> 00:51:39.560
<v Speaker 3>And of course we do it responsibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

934
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:40.603
<v Speaker 3>the first thing that happened was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>federal government modernize the </v>

935
00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Newfoundland fishing fleet and equipped </v>
<v Speaker 3>it with,</v>

936
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really outstanding boats in.</v>

937
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:50.480
<v Speaker 3>The second thing that happened was we </v>
<v Speaker 3>took all the fish.</v>

938
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:54.920
<v Speaker 3>And so by net while you see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened by basically by 1992,</v>

939
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.490
<v Speaker 3>so 2 billion fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the estimate.</v>

940
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of fish equal in weight to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire Canadian population.</v>

941
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 3>And these cod man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were magnificent animals.</v>

942
00:52:05.181 --> 00:52:07.370
<v Speaker 3>They figured the ones that were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

943
00:52:07.371 --> 00:52:08.204
<v Speaker 3>when the Europeans first came over to </v>
<v Speaker 3>North America or something like five </v>

944
00:52:10.851 --> 00:52:13.730
<v Speaker 3>feet lane in length,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more or less on average and teeth,</v>

945
00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:16.250
<v Speaker 3>three feet around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were big fish.</v>

946
00:52:16.251 --> 00:52:17.084
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both the size of a person and </v>

947
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:19.334
<v Speaker 3>they came and massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive schools and no one really knows </v>

948
00:52:22.251 --> 00:52:23.690
<v Speaker 3>why they haven't come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

949
00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is,</v>

950
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:30.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish in schools are like zebras.</v>

951
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:34.940
<v Speaker 3>You don't see zebras loans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zebras rate roaming the Serengeti,</v>

952
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:35.803
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you see as big clumps of zebras </v>

953
00:52:37.641 --> 00:52:40.850
<v Speaker 3>because they're herd animals and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>really are herd animals,</v>

954
00:52:40.851 --> 00:52:43.190
<v Speaker 3>which means the herd is their </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

955
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:47.870
<v Speaker 3>And so they can't live away from a heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>more or any less than people can.</v>

956
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.210
<v Speaker 3>And it looks like cod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're sort of like that.</v>

957
00:52:50.211 --> 00:52:54.140
<v Speaker 3>And other fish that live in schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

958
00:52:54.141 --> 00:52:56.690
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that happens with cod </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools is that,</v>

959
00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:57.883
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of subspecies of cod and </v>

960
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:00.703
<v Speaker 3>we don't know how old the schools are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of the schools might be who </v>

961
00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:04.184
<v Speaker 3>knows 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old as super organisms and they </v>

962
00:53:07.251 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 3>seem to actually kind of know the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which they swim as a collective unit.</v>

963
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.060
<v Speaker 3>And so they know where to go eat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know where,</v>

964
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:14.894
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know their habitat and more </v>

965
00:53:16.731 --> 00:53:20.300
<v Speaker 3>importantly the card arrange themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>in schools so that the big Carter in the</v>

966
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:21.134
<v Speaker 3>middle and the little card or sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside and then the predators pick off </v>

967
00:53:24.231 --> 00:53:27.390
<v Speaker 3>the little card but are useless anyways </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there are too young to breed.</v>

968
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.403
<v Speaker 3>So the school is structured so that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>main Carter protected second when the </v>

969
00:53:32.611 --> 00:53:35.760
<v Speaker 3>card May,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually use the school as a mating</v>

970
00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:36.594
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they organize their mating routines </v>

971
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.533
<v Speaker 3>on the outside of the school structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what that implies is that if you </v>

972
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:43.104
<v Speaker 3>blow out the structure of the school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the God don't know what to do and </v>

973
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 3>that's one potential reason they haven't</v>
<v Speaker 3>really managed to come back.</v>

974
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:50.754
<v Speaker 3>There's others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one being perhaps that if you really </v>

975
00:53:52.861 --> 00:53:53.694
<v Speaker 3>devastate a population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you change the ecological </v>

976
00:53:56.611 --> 00:53:57.444
<v Speaker 3>conditions of the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it turns out that the way an </v>

977
00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:05.580
<v Speaker 3>ecosystem sets itself up is dependent to</v>
<v Speaker 3>some degree on which creature gets their</v>

978
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:08.460
<v Speaker 3>first sort of which creature gets there </v>
<v Speaker 3>in what order.</v>

979
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.593
<v Speaker 3>And so if you wipe population like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>car down low enough than other animals </v>

980
00:54:13.351 --> 00:54:16.290
<v Speaker 3>move in to get the niche and now set the</v>
<v Speaker 3>card can't come back.</v>

981
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Now there's other theories too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

982
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:20.160
<v Speaker 3>some of which have to do with ocean </v>
<v Speaker 3>warming,</v>

983
00:54:20.161 --> 00:54:25.161
<v Speaker 3>but the point is we've left the car loan</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of because people are still allowed</v>

984
00:54:25.981 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Speaker 3>to fish a lot more for cod than you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

985
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.480
<v Speaker 3>We've kind of left them alone for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

986
00:54:30.481 --> 00:54:33.990
<v Speaker 3>And the consequences being pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimal,</v>

987
00:54:33.991 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 3>especially for an animal that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>

988
00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:38.490
<v Speaker 3>they lay a lotta eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're,</v>

989
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.940
<v Speaker 3>it's not like they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not able to reproduce.</v>

990
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:44.400
<v Speaker 3>They certainly know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

991
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:45.601
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

992
00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:47.550
<v Speaker 3>you think we might learn something from </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

993
00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:49.560
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't really appear that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

994
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:50.543
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that really struck </v>
<v Speaker 3>me as mind boggling when I was going </v>

995
00:54:54.361 --> 00:54:57.270
<v Speaker 3>through this material was exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada's record,</v>

996
00:54:57.271 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 3>which was so embarrassing and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

997
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:01.134
<v Speaker 3>it was like a personal blow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in 90 then I'm going to pretty much </v>

998
00:55:04.921 --> 00:55:05.910
<v Speaker 3>fold up with this.</v>

999
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:09.300
<v Speaker 3>In 1992 which was about when the cod </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishery collapsed,</v>

1000
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:14.960
<v Speaker 3>the Canada promised to protect 20% of </v>
<v Speaker 3>its oceanic territory.</v>

1001
00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:19.230
<v Speaker 3>So the idea was to put aside chunks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>oceanic territory,</v>

1002
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.060
<v Speaker 3>sorta like national parks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1003
00:55:21.061 --> 00:55:21.894
<v Speaker 3>where the animals that live there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ecosystems would be protected so </v>

1004
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:27.720
<v Speaker 3>that they could come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

1005
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:29.940
<v Speaker 3>fish come back pretty fast if you leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>them alone.</v>

1006
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I read something very amusing about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>very fact.</v>

1007
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.450
<v Speaker 3>how you heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe this is wrong,</v>

1009
00:55:36.451 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 3>but I read it several places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how you heard that the whole,</v>

1010
00:55:40.021 --> 00:55:40.854
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gulf of Mexico oil spill was such a </v>

1011
00:55:43.831 --> 00:55:45.990
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe for fish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:55:45.991 --> 00:55:46.824
<v Speaker 3>Well there were more fish the year after</v>
<v Speaker 3>this field in the year before and the </v>

1013
00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:52.830
<v Speaker 3>reason for that is no one fished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1014
00:55:52.831 --> 00:55:54.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty peculiar statistic,</v>

1015
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:56.220
<v Speaker 3>but it shows you two things.</v>

1016
00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:57.690
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many fish we take,</v>

1017
00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:58.673
<v Speaker 3>and B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how damn fast the fish can come back if </v>

1018
00:56:00.451 --> 00:56:02.980
<v Speaker 3>you leave them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing happened in the North Sea</v>

1019
00:56:02.981 --> 00:56:06.360
<v Speaker 3>in World War II was pretty much fished </v>
<v Speaker 3>out before World War II,</v>

1020
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:10.080
<v Speaker 3>but no one was fishing during World War </v>
<v Speaker 3>II because of German u boats.</v>

1021
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:13.110
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of fish in the North Sea</v>
<v Speaker 3>again after World War II.</v>

1022
00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:16.170
<v Speaker 3>So leave the things alone for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can come back.</v>

1023
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:17.303
<v Speaker 3>Canada promise to protect at least 20% </v>
<v Speaker 3>of its oceanic territory by 2012 in </v>

1024
00:56:23.381 --> 00:56:24.214
<v Speaker 3>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a series of major international </v>

1025
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:27.334
<v Speaker 3>forums where cannabis signed treaties in</v>
<v Speaker 3>1990 to 2002 2003 and 2005 so not only </v>

1026
00:56:35.591 --> 00:56:36.424
<v Speaker 3>did we promise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we promised frequently and in writing </v>

1027
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.563
<v Speaker 3>less than 1% is currently protected </v>
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact that Canada has one of </v>

1028
00:56:43.751 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 3>the longest international coastlines in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and is also home to multiple,</v>

1029
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:49.083
<v Speaker 3>you know how there are ecological zones </v>
<v Speaker 3>because each little geographic area has </v>

1030
00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:54.340
<v Speaker 3>its own peculiar characteristics.</v>

1031
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.173
<v Speaker 3>And so really what you need is you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to set aside a protected area that are </v>

1032
00:56:58.541 --> 00:57:01.330
<v Speaker 3>sort of representative and have all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different ecological zones.</v>

1033
00:57:01.331 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 3>And we have plenty of those ecological </v>
<v Speaker 3>zones.</v>

1034
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:04.923
<v Speaker 3>Zero action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>1% of our oceanic territory is </v>

1035
00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:09.490
<v Speaker 3>protected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1036
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:10.324
<v Speaker 3>And you can fish in 95% of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we've done in the aftermath of </v>

1037
00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:18.760
<v Speaker 3>the great cod catastrophe looks to me to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be pretty much absolutely nothing.</v>

1038
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.390
<v Speaker 3>And what's weird about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and at least in part,</v>

1039
00:57:22.391 --> 00:57:23.224
<v Speaker 3>I mean Kevin is a complicated place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Australians have actually </v>

1040
00:57:26.531 --> 00:57:31.531
<v Speaker 3>protected 20% of their oceanic area and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have promised 20% more recently.</v>

1041
00:57:31.601 --> 00:57:36.601
<v Speaker 3>And they actually seem to mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about a third as much territory</v>

1042
00:57:36.611 --> 00:57:37.444
<v Speaker 3>as Australia actually has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is actually possible to set aside </v>

1043
00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:44.110
<v Speaker 3>what are essentially national parks in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1044
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 3>in the ocean and let the damn fish come </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1045
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:48.123
<v Speaker 3>And in principle at least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would also be good for the </v>

1046
00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:53.350
<v Speaker 3>fishermen because they can hang around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the edges of the parks and you know,</v>

1047
00:57:53.351 --> 00:57:56.770
<v Speaker 3>the fish don't know where the boundaries</v>
<v Speaker 3>are and they can scoop them up once they</v>

1048
00:57:56.771 --> 00:57:57.604
<v Speaker 3>breed again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a rather cataclysmic and </v>

1049
00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:04.510
<v Speaker 3>staggering Sagat of insane </v>
<v Speaker 3>mismanagement.</v>

1050
00:58:04.511 --> 00:58:06.640
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's not,</v>

1051
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:07.743
<v Speaker 3>there's not much point in pointing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>finger one place or another because you </v>

1052
00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:13.150
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty much everybody's fault.</v>

1053
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:17.710
<v Speaker 3>But it sure seems to me to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things that you got to think about</v>

1054
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:20.350
<v Speaker 3>as being odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1055
00:58:20.351 --> 00:58:21.184
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hauntingly foolish because all of </v>

1056
00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 3>that could be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why wouldn't that be a good thing?</v>

1057
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.983
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there was the political will in </v>

1058
00:58:30.821 --> 00:58:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be done because other countries</v>

1059
00:58:33.191 --> 00:58:34.024
<v Speaker 3>have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for some reason this is just not an </v>

1060
00:58:35.951 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 3>on the radar issue.</v>

1061
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Even though it's a real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is actually happening.</v>

1062
00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.390
<v Speaker 3>It's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happening a lot.</v>

1063
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.590
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to have a lot of fish to</v>

1064
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.433
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The oceans are going to be a pretty </v>

1065
00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.960
<v Speaker 3>barren and dismal place and we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually do something about it.</v>

1066
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:58.410
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's why I decided to do this talk,</v>

1067
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.480
<v Speaker 3>even though I don't really know a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the oceans,</v>

1068
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:07.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't seem to me that the situation.</v>

1069
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:08.913
<v Speaker 3>And so he's dangerous talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>things when you sort of know something </v>

1070
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:12.634
<v Speaker 3>and most of the adult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seems to me that the situation </v>

1071
00:59:16.001 --> 00:59:16.834
<v Speaker 3>with the oceans is so obviously not good</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you actually don't have to be an </v>

1072
00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:26.291
<v Speaker 3>expert to notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what can be done about it?</v>

1073
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:27.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1074
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:29.420
<v Speaker 3>the only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the marine protected areas are a</v>

1075
00:59:29.421 --> 00:59:30.140
<v Speaker 3>good idea.</v>

1076
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:30.973
<v Speaker 3>It looked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that we have examples of </v>

1077
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:36.860
<v Speaker 3>countries doing it and it seems to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's already figured out that it's</v>

1078
00:59:36.861 --> 00:59:39.980
<v Speaker 3>a pretty good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With regards to national parks on land,</v>

1079
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 3>no one seems to really dispute that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although we know we could have some more</v>

1080
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:44.084
<v Speaker 3>national parks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the big problem about having </v>

1081
00:59:47.331 --> 00:59:48.590
<v Speaker 3>them out in the ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1082
00:59:48.591 --> 00:59:52.520
<v Speaker 3>and to preserve some of the coastline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to let the fish have a fighting chance.</v>

1083
00:59:52.521 --> 00:59:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Unless this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to have them around,</v>

1084
00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:59.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what we're facing in some ways while</v>

1085
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:03.740
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to process jelly fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>for food,</v>

1086
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.143
<v Speaker 3>because as we get rid of the fish that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole ecosystem starts to turn back </v>

1087
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:14.171
<v Speaker 3>to what it was like 400 million years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago before there were any fish and there</v>

1088
01:00:15.081 --> 01:00:15.914
<v Speaker 3>were lots of invertebrates and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could have an ocean full of </v>

1089
01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:19.514
<v Speaker 3>invertebrates and I hear they press up </v>
<v Speaker 3>into hockey stick hockey pucks size </v>

1090
01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:25.130
<v Speaker 3>disks pretty nicely.</v>

1091
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.203
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a lot of taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I suppose you'd have to be a pretty </v>

1092
01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:29.144
<v Speaker 3>good chef to make them animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we probably won't run out of </v>

1093
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.910
<v Speaker 3>jellyfish during our life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I dunno,</v>

1094
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:40.240
<v Speaker 3>maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to pen </v>
<v Speaker 3>and note to your mp or to the,</v>

1095
01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:44.120
<v Speaker 3>to the Minister of fisheries or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just note that,</v>

1096
01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroying a resource that we could </v>

1097
01:00:47.841 --> 01:00:48.674
<v Speaker 3>actually enjoy aesthetically and </v>
<v Speaker 3>practically w destroying that seems to </v>

1098
01:00:55.881 --> 01:00:59.750
<v Speaker 3>be not in anybody's best interest and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's actually happening at a pretty</v>

1099
01:00:59.751 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 3>rapid rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess that's partly what Finn is,</v>

1100
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:08.770
<v Speaker 3>emmy out and partly why I decided to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this talk and also to get involved in,</v>

1101
01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:11.180
<v Speaker 3>to invite Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hanson who's going to,</v>

1102
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.280
<v Speaker 3>who really knows what he's talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1103
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:14.383
<v Speaker 3>who's going to speak next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we should take a 10 minute break and </v>

1104
01:01:17.661 --> 01:01:20.390
<v Speaker 3>then we'll return and have darker Henson</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>

1105
01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:25.030
<v Speaker 3>There'll be a question and answer period</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the F at the end of Doctor</v>

1106
01:01:25.031 --> 01:01:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Hanson's talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1107
01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:32.220
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
