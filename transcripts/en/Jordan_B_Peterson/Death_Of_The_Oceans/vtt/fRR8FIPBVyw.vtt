00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 2>An event of major international </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance so occurred this week.</v>

3
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.123
<v Speaker 2>Australia announced plans to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost half its oceanic territory up </v>

4
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.474
<v Speaker 2>from an already stellar 20% the </v>
<v Speaker 2>announcement was made it real plus 20 </v>

5
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.543
<v Speaker 2>the world summit evaluating progress </v>
<v Speaker 2>made on environmental and economic </v>

6
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 2>issues since 1992 why is this so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important?</v>

7
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.523
<v Speaker 2>It's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're catching all the fish down the </v>

8
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 2>chain from large to small with high tech</v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidity.</v>

9
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.973
<v Speaker 2>It's a war on fish and we're winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marine protected areas give nature a </v>

10
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:48.894
<v Speaker 2>fighting chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Europeans first came to the new </v>

11
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they encountered see life and quantities</v>

12
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.584
<v Speaker 2>that stagger modern imagination lobsters</v>
<v Speaker 2>so common that only the poor would eat </v>

13
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reach 20 pounds.</v>

14
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Massive oyster beds yielded dinner plate</v>
<v Speaker 2>sized specimens in a single day.</v>

15
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 2>A fisherman could hook 600 giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>sturgeon,</v>

16
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 2>which could weigh a ton on cream beach </v>
<v Speaker 2>north of Boston.</v>

17
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 2>The shellfish would pile up three feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>thick after a nor'easter.</v>

18
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I've been there recently after a storm </v>
<v Speaker 2>on four miles of beach,</v>

19
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I found a lobster trap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a horseshoe crab dad and one starfish.</v>

20
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.723
<v Speaker 2>I found that painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of this exists anymore and more </v>

21
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 2>besides is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an environmental catastrophe,</v>

22
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.973
<v Speaker 2>but it's also an economic and aesthetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe and it's caused by </v>

23
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 2>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Particularly in Canada.</v>

24
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 2>We had one of the world's great </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources in the cod fishery for years.</v>

25
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.774
<v Speaker 2>We blamed it's decline on foreigners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 1982 we won the right to extend our </v>

26
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:53.574
<v Speaker 2>coastal limit from seven to 200 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By 1992 we had managed the cod to </v>

27
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 2>virtual extinction and the Atlantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>fishery was closed.</v>

28
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 2>40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people lost their jobs.</v>

29
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 2>We learned nothing from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada is willfully blind and it's ocean</v>

30
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:11.094
<v Speaker 2>management strategy and we keep lying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world about our intentions to do </v>

31
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.534
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 1992 we pledged to protect one fifth </v>

32
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 2>of our oceanic territory.</v>

33
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.723
<v Speaker 2>By 2012 we promised the same thing again</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2002 and 2003 and 2005 where are we </v>

34
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 2>after all these promises?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've reserved less than 1% and phishing</v>

35
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:34.974
<v Speaker 2>is still allowed in almost all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the radically business like </v>

36
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Americans have done better with 5% of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their oceans protected.</v>

37
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Does our word on the international stage</v>
<v Speaker 2>means so little,</v>

38
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 2>and if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

39
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.033
<v Speaker 2>Some of it is the consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological divide between </v>

40
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist's and those on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

41
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.673
<v Speaker 2>Harper's conservatives regard anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned with ecological issues as an </v>

42
00:02:58.741 --> 00:02:59.574
<v Speaker 2>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The in gratitude environmentalist's </v>

43
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.674
<v Speaker 2>typically show for the benefits of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern economy assures such a response </v>

44
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 2>we must get beyond such </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive enmity and quickly.</v>

45
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Proper management of the oceans would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for everyone.</v>

46
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Fishermen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tourist,</v>

47
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>businessmen and politicians alike.</v>

48
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 2>If we continue along our present path in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few years,</v>

49
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 2>there will be nothing but jellyfish left</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've started to eat those.</v>

50
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.923
<v Speaker 2>We should muster up the foresight of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australians adopt the processes they </v>

51
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.614
<v Speaker 2>have developed so successfully and </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage what we are responsible for </v>

52
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 2>gratefully and intelligently for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda with Steve Pakan,</v>
