1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,553
Yeah.

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,660
An event of major international 
significance so occurred this week.

3
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,123
Australia announced plans to protect 
almost half its oceanic territory up 

4
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:24,474
from an already stellar 20% the 
announcement was made it real plus 20 

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,543
the world summit evaluating progress 
made on environmental and economic 

6
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:36,090
issues since 1992 why is this so 
important?

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,523
It's simple.
We're catching all the fish down the 

8
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,050
chain from large to small with high tech
rapidity.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,973
It's a war on fish and we're winning.
Marine protected areas give nature a 

10
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:48,894
fighting chance.
When Europeans first came to the new 

11
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,750
world,
they encountered see life and quantities

12
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:55,584
that stagger modern imagination lobsters
so common that only the poor would eat 

13
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,010
them.
Reach 20 pounds.

14
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,130
Massive oyster beds yielded dinner plate
sized specimens in a single day.

15
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:10,020
A fisherman could hook 600 giant 
sturgeon,

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,280
which could weigh a ton on cream beach 
north of Boston.

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,150
The shellfish would pile up three feet 
thick after a nor'easter.

18
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,680
I've been there recently after a storm 
on four miles of beach,

19
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,070
I found a lobster trap,
a horseshoe crab dad and one starfish.

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,723
I found that painful.
None of this exists anymore and more 

21
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:36,810
besides is gone.
It's an environmental catastrophe,

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,973
but it's also an economic and aesthetic 
catastrophe and it's caused by 

23
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:43,110
ignorance.
Particularly in Canada.

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,940
We had one of the world's great 
resources in the cod fishery for years.

25
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,774
We blamed it's decline on foreigners.
In 1982 we won the right to extend our 

26
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:53,574
coastal limit from seven to 200 miles.
By 1992 we had managed the cod to 

27
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:02,220
virtual extinction and the Atlantic 
fishery was closed.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,740
40,000
people lost their jobs.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,260
We learned nothing from this.
Canada is willfully blind and it's ocean

30
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:11,094
management strategy and we keep lying to
the world about our intentions to do 

31
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,534
better.
In 1992 we pledged to protect one fifth 

32
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,890
of our oceanic territory.

33
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,723
By 2012 we promised the same thing again
in 2002 and 2003 and 2005 where are we 

34
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:34,140
after all these promises?
We've reserved less than 1% and phishing

35
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:34,974
is still allowed in almost all of that.
Even the radically business like 

36
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:41,940
Americans have done better with 5% of 
their oceans protected.

37
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,600
Does our word on the international stage
means so little,

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,270
and if so,
why?

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,033
Some of it is the consequence of the 
ideological divide between 

40
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,270
environmentalist's and those on the 
right.

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,673
Harper's conservatives regard anyone 
concerned with ecological issues as an 

42
00:02:58,741 --> 00:02:59,574
enemy.
The in gratitude environmentalist's 

43
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,674
typically show for the benefits of the 
modern economy assures such a response 

44
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,390
we must get beyond such 
counterproductive enmity and quickly.

45
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,260
Proper management of the oceans would be
good for everyone.

46
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,700
Fishermen,
tourist,

47
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:18,670
consumer,
businessmen and politicians alike.

48
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,600
If we continue along our present path in
a few years,

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,190
there will be nothing but jellyfish left
and we've started to eat those.

50
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,923
We should muster up the foresight of the
Australians adopt the processes they 

51
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,614
have developed so successfully and 
manage what we are responsible for 

52
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,230
gratefully and intelligently for the 
agenda with Steve Pakan,

53
