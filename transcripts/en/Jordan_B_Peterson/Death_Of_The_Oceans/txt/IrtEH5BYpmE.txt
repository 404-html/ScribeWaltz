Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Everyone could please take their seat again. Can everyone please take their seats?

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       All right, so I would now like to introduce our second speaker, Dr. Arthur Hansen. Now when I was reading through is through the accomplishments of Dr. Hansen, I have to admit that I was a little intimidated. One of the first questions that came to my mind was what was he doing at my age? Well, the answer is selling 75,000 pins with a slogan on them that he came up with. Give Earth the chance. Dr. Arthur Hanson is an officer of the order of Canada and distinguished fellow with the International Institute for Sustainable Development following his term as president and CEO from 1991 to 98 he has worked with a number of organizations around the world providing initial guidance, conducting research and advising on innovation for sustainable development, environment and economy relationships, biodiversity, oceans and international development. Dr. Hanson has a strong interest in linking science to public policy and works closely with government bodies in Canada, the United States and Asia.

Speaker 2:          00:01:33       On specifics on specific problems related to environmental management and mechanisms of accountability and governance. For sustainable development. In recent years. Much of his professional time has been spent working in with China. He initiated some of the largest environmental capacity building efforts currently underway in Indonesia, simultaneously working with the government, ngos, universities, and the private sector. Much of this effort has involved establishing graduate degree programs such as environmental law and environmental studies. He served two terms on Canada's national round table on the environment and economy and was Canada's ministerial ocean ambassador with the Department of fisheries and oceans and for years. Dr. Hanson served for 10 years as a member of the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and as a mentor in the Trudeau Foundation. He has provided advice to the office of the auditor general of Canada since 1990 and has chaired various national and international initiatives from 1978 to 1991 he was professor and director of the school for Resource and environmental studies at Dalhousie University. Dr. Hanson holds a phd from the University of Michigan in the field of fisheries, ecology and natural resources and a master's degree in zoology or fisheries from the University of British Columbia. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Arthur Hansen.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:03:09       thank you very much. When you were speaking earlier about how much it should cost to come to the lecture or whether you had mortgage your house, I have known people that have mortgaged their houses for the emotions. Um, but I just want to tell you one little story about this teaching on the environment at the University of Michigan, which the opening session of it was, eh, had attracted 18,000 people to an auditorium and we had to turn people away. But we had a special secret deal with the president of the university because nobody got this place for free. And I was a fundraiser for all of this. And uh, uh, it was a big week long event that I won't go into details on. But the funny thing about it was one night at home, I get this phone call from a guy who I didn't know and tall, and he introduced himself and he said, you know, I think it is a, he had read our perspectives, which had been published in some books and that, and, and he said, I think it's a righteous at the university, wants you to chart, wants to charge you $5,000 for one night.

Speaker 3:          00:04:10       And I explained to him, all of the university said, nobody, but nobody gets this for free. And, uh, you're no exceptions. We've, our group was called an act environmental action now. And so, uh, we were preparing to raise the money and he said, well, I really like what you're doing. I'm prepared to give you $5,000 to support it, but I want you to go to the university president and say my name, and then say, uh, he would give $10,000 if the university agreed not to, uh, to, uh, uh, charges 5,000 for the [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:04:45       So I phoned up the head of the university development, uh, who is president for that. And he immediately said, oh, he's, he phoned you. Yes, please come and see the president tomorrow. And so I go and the president of the University of Michigan, it was a labor negotiator and lawyer, I guess a very nice man. But, uh, I walked into his office and I have this kind of sheepish grin on his face. I knew before he opened his mouth that we'd won and it turned out this was one of the biggest benefactors to the university. And in fact, his, uh, his family on guy, his wife's family owned a newspaper chain running out of Chicago. And apparently her mother didn't want to give any money away. Her father wanted to give money away. So instead they gave it to the kids who gave it to good causes, like the University of Michigan.

Speaker 3:          00:05:35       And so we got our money. But the funny thing about all those pins and that and also the, uh, enough, this spin, but those things that they, the funny thing about that was that the, um, university put a condition that we could charge no more than 50 cents admission to this events event. So between selling the pins and the 50 cent admissions, I was the financial finances, uh, uh, chairman. So everyday I would go around campus and we had this great network of people that were selling pins and selling tickets for the event. And I had a suitcase, which I think we still have our own little silver suitcase. And there was a normal little suitcase, wasn't too big because it was filled with coins. So every afternoon I would try and casually walk across for fear of getting robbed because it was

Speaker 4:          00:06:20       fairly close to a rough city in Detroit. And I be trying to be casual and my arm was beginning, but

Speaker 3:          00:06:27       there was a Latin and I, I just gave a talk last night at, uh, w Pearson College on the West Coast to phd students from Royal Roads University and needs very, very bright and competent young people that go into the baccalaureate program and have the privilege of attending Pearson College. And so I tried to give them a talk on leaders, laggards in the rest of us. And I've been thinking about that already in what you're saying. Uh, Jordan, because in the oceans area we deal with leaders and there's lots of them and we deal with lots of laggards who see the world in very narrow sorts of ways. And, uh, we also see the rest of us who are the people in this room that you and me, because we can't all be experts in the oceans and I'm not expert on all sorts of things. I go out for a frequent kayak, writes and talks with a guy who's a physical oceanographer, one of the best in the field that this in Victoria. And, and uh, you know, he gets into discussions with me that I have no idea what he's talking about. And I try and

Speaker 4:          00:07:26       like 200 foot waves and things like this and I just don't understand because it's all

Speaker 3:          00:07:32       mathematical and it's all been said. So we're all learners. We're all people who want to do good, but we have to deal with some people who really have very strong vested interest as well and who are, it'd be happy to take the last fish out of the, see if they can put it into the money from that into their pocket. So I'm going to, I thought, first of all, I think we should give a Jordan and honorary something

Speaker 4:          00:07:59       in ocean studies, the ocean

Speaker 3:          00:08:01       sciences. But Ocean studies is different and we do need psychologists and people with human behavior understandings to bring the message out about the oceans. That's been one of the problems. Scientists don't do a very good job even though they're very good scientists and some of them do fortunately. And then there's people like Jacques Cousteau and so forth and many others like that and organizations, uh, that, that really try hard. Many of the big foundations, conservation international, a whole range of ocean oriented, uh, bodies and so forth. But it's still not enough and it won't be enough, I think until people, uh, who actually have a lot of interest in oceans but wa but still lack feel. They lack the means to do things about it. And, uh, and I would include, uh, not the MPs and that are members of parliament tend to understand the oceans.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       And some people say to me, they turn, if people, some people in some places in Canada to turn their backs in the oceans are more interested in agriculture and the things that happened on land. And that's a strong feeling that people have that uh, our parliamentarians have not risen to the challenge even though they've signed, the government has signed those things. And one of the things that differentiates us from Australia is that the Australians generally, they all live in the course is one thing, surf on it, fish from it, do everything near the water and, and, uh, they actually have the strong political will. There's politicians there, uh, who have taken the oceans as a cause and who are very powerful, uh, politicians. That's helped a lot. And I'll come to that later in the talk, but I want to start off. Um, and I, I've got a lot to say.

Speaker 3:          00:09:45       I'm going to try and say it as concisely as I can in watch the clock. So we'll have some time for discussion. Um, and I want to start generally looking at the global situation and then I want to home in on Canada because we as Canadian sitting here and, and maybe some students who are not from Canada here. Uh, this is the country where you're trying to understand right now how we do things and that's very, very important. Uh, I think we're going to learn a lot from other countries. Some of the Asian countries, good and bad, we'll learn that. I've worked with, have some very interesting models for fisheries management. China for example, they say they laugh at our fisheries models. Let me tell you the, and the, and the LLC for example, and they say, we haven't got the money or the time to be able to debate the finer points of the models that you have.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       What we do is we just stop all fishing during the spawning season for about two or three or four months. I forget exactly what it is in the summertime. Oh. And it isn't that they're doing it perfectly, but a lot of elements of that simple mechanism worked for them. Maybe sometimes we need simpler things rather than the very involved debate that goes on between the scientists, the fishery scientists who tend to be all concerned about fishing and population dynamics. People like myself that deal with ecosystems and think about food chains and think about habitat destruction and so forth. And, and then others who take yet another point of view, which is the fisheries economist who said they get the price rate, uh, individually transferable quotas and all sorts of exotica that I think are often useful. But there is no simple answer. So I'm going to be filling in the blanks here that Jordan has left me plenty to fill in.

Speaker 3:          00:11:27       Um, and, and I'm going to be focusing a lot on habitat a lot on the ecosystem because it's my belief that in addition to worrying about fishing, you have to worry about what's happening to where fish live, which is in the water feeding on things that in that marvelous food chain there was described there. And, and, uh, indeed, if we don't take that into account in our decision making about fisheries, then we only know about a quarter of what's really happening out there. So I just want to remind us first of all that, uh, it's fair to say that our planet is about water and the water is saltwater. Uh, 70% of the, uh, the earth's surface is covered by it. We depend on every single person in this planet, whether or not they live in Afghanistan, whether they live in British Columbia, Canada, or Indonesia or any of the other places.

Speaker 3:          00:12:23       Um, we depend on a variety of ecological services from the oceans. I won't go into that right now. Uh, but it's very important to recognize that. Secondly, it is a history book of the Earth. We look at the sediments, we know, understand where we get our oxygen from and so forth. And it's complex, but we can understand that. And we also depend on that as we look for the resources we explained. Where do we find out about how anchovies go up and down because of El Nino and La Nina from the ocean sediments. And we looked for the scales of the sometimes essential meets there. Sometimes they're not there. Um, and, and our use sediments and so forth. Well, all that oil that we use is basically from phytoplankton from the sea and other sea creatures. It. So, um, we have to do understand that it's a basis of natural wealth and of our prosperity, half the people in the planet live close to the ocean and that is always going to be the case.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       Um, their prosperity through trade, through fishing, through all sorts of different things we know about it. So the oceans government's trade settlement patterns and it, we now know and understand where they're clearly, it also governs climate and therefore climate change. But it's also the source of conflict, calamity and crises. And I don't like to talk about crises, but I have to. Uh, and particularly in this talk, people say the ocean is in crisis and I think it's true, frankly, despite all what we said at the beginning of your talk, Jordan and I would like to think that uh, um, uh, things are nice out there on the environment globally. They're in a downhill turn for sure, but there's a way of looking at crisis that I think it's very important. And I, again, I go back to some of the experiences that has been a lot of time in China.

Speaker 3:          00:14:18       China doesn't like to talk about barriers, about not being able to do things and so forth. What they cautioned me and say, look, talk about crisis. Yes. If you wish, we understand we face crisis for a long time. We face crises. How do you turn crisis into opportunity? And that's very important. Chinese do that all the time. Crisis to opportunity and they actually do it often. They're able to solve the crises and they're better off open new opportunities. I talked about what I call [inaudible] crisis to sustainability. How do we turn these things into a sustainable development pattern? Not easy, but not impossible. And particularly when I'm talking with an audience and includes people of the next generation, we're going to have to solve all the messes and problems and open the new opportunities that come with new technologies, etc. Um, I don't want to leave you with a message of failure and a message of impossibility.

Speaker 3:          00:15:18       It has to be a message of opportunity and then a message of hope and so forth. And I think we can apply that to the ocean. So some of the examples that I'm going to present or things that seem to be going better now than they were, say 10 years or 20 years ago. So please keep that in mind if it gets too gross and just remember, uh, I'm basically an optimist and want to see hope for the future and hope that the people who carry the burden forward and the institutions that I hope Finn can become as at one of those can make real contributions to that. I'm looking at Youth Finn,

Speaker 4:          00:15:58       like that person over there and some of the others that I met earlier this afternoon. I really am honored that I can be here to

Speaker 3:          00:16:07       kick off what I hope will be a successful effort on the part, not just a view of t students but students across the country. Because we need, we need this kind of support and understanding and real action that can come out of the bigger people who carry challenges forward into the next generation. The reason I was speaking at Pearson and happy to do so here's in college is that I am going further and further down the food chain. Um, I feel that, uh, we have to be working in a very intelligent way and communicating with people that are still in high schools, junior high schools and elementary schools so that they come into the, the university world with an attitude of responsibility to some extent, but understanding particularly of things where they can make a difference in the years ahead. So those are some preliminary, the points.

Speaker 3:          00:17:04       Okay. So now we get into the nasty stuff. Ocean health and decline. You're going to hear these things and there's a new index and I've given a, there's a lot of words in some of these slides. Don't even try and read them all, listened to me, but I'm just, we're trying to take a videotape of this and we're going to intersperse some of the slides. So I want a little bit more detail. That's why I put it in here. And also a ways that you can find this information easily. So there's this new thing that people have been trying for some time to get an integrated, uh, overview of ocean health. And you can see it's not very good overall in the world. 60 out of 100. And if you go on the website, you can find what each country, uh, where it's good and not good.

Speaker 3:          00:17:47       Interestingly, Canada gets 70 out a hundred. So, um, uh, maybe we can a trumpet a success in some areas, but I would say that, uh, certainly I don't see things in great shape right now in Canada in the same way that Jordan, uh, uh, an artist as well. And so let's, let's talk about health for just a second. Two quick examples. Beautiful place, a broken archipelago, uh, broaden archipelagos where, uh, Alexandra Morton and others, uh, feel that, uh, the cage salmon that are aquaculture there are carrying an excessive parasite load, that the wild salmon coming down the pink Simon for very remote rivers, uh, on the BC coast are picking up the parasite load and dying off. This is a big tussle between science and citizen science. Um, and, and, uh, I must say it's not a resolved issue. I'm kind of on Alexandra Morton side, I think on this.

Speaker 3:          00:18:45       But in general, the health of the oceans, the health of ecosystems and what it means to us, uh, brings it back right into economic terms. Now, this is another big puzzle. Uh, this man who I spend a day with, uh, several years ago took this picture and his doctor, Peter Ross, who's just lost this job because the whole group of people and toxicology, the deal with ocean toxicological issues paid for often by people from other countries like the United States or a, and give us data that's absolutely essential. Um, from monitoring different Adam mainly seals, but up and down the coast so you can see where pollutants are coming across from Asia because of they hit the northern stuff. You can find out the effects of drugs and diseases that come out in their sewage from cities like Vancouver. And then if you go down towards, um, uh, the southern part of what's now called the sailor's sea puget sound where they've been building naval ships and you can find all that heavy metal issues and so forth.

Speaker 3:          00:19:41       So, you know, I get a feeling for things. So there was a network that he was involved with, um, and they've all lost their job. We don't seem to want that information anymore. So, uh, are we getting the right kind of information on the health of the oceans? And I would submit if, if we don't have people like Peter Ross, um, then it's quite difficult to get that information. I should also add, it's a hilarious working with him. He goes, I'd wearing a hockey helmet because there's two ways that you get the seals and you don't really want to be the seal. The seal is going to live, but it's going to have a few scars after he's been visited or she from Peter Ross. So the, the one way he likes to do it, as you quietly go up in your boat and you, uh, put on your hockey helmet and then you run like hell into the water and uh, under the shore and grabbed the seal, they have to be of a certain size and they're standardized.

Speaker 3:          00:20:32       Uh, if you're lucky you don't got your head on the rocks, slippery rocks with lots of LG. The other way in which he doesn't want to do it, but it also works is that a, the seal school in the water and then you, uh, he's got a thin nylon net out set out and the seals go into the nab, their startle and, and he tries to get the, uh, one or two sales and make sure that no others are in there and you get about five minutes before the steels that are struggling and maybe withdrawn. So, but he has been very, very good scientist and it pains me greatly. He'll do fine. Whether that network can continue its work properly is beyond me. I don't see how it can, health is also about people in communities. Um, if you live on the west coast or on the east coast, this is a prime thing that people feel the loss, they feel the loss of livelihood, the loss of integrity, of work, that they felt important over the years as fishermen or various other ocean related, uh, uh, activities.

Speaker 3:          00:21:33       And whether it's in Prince Rupert, in northern British Columbia or whether it's, uh, in communities in the south shore of a newfoundland or Nova Scotia. Um, this is this very serious issue and it's one that we don't seem to do as good a job in Canada as places like Norway, uh, and maybe Australia and handling. Um, and we can come back to that point, a new line, new livelihoods and merge Lunenburg a school of sailing school. That beautiful schooner, um, sea kayaking, a summer thing we'll watching. Um, and interestingly if you were into music folk festivals and the the folk festival and part of it is held right on the uh, on the seashore and boats come and go like this beautiful big one in the background in middle of the picture, but this also calamity in the oceans and calamity takes many forms. Um, the cyclone Nargis for example, uh, in, in Burma where over almost 140,000 people were killed by terrible Maldives.

Speaker 3:          00:22:35       The prime spokes country for climate change, melt ice basically disappear with sea level rise in that given amount of time. And, and then there's the insidious kinds of things like ocean acidification, and I won't go through this slide, but just to say that oceans and climate change are intimately related, but don't get nearly as much attention as the atmospheric side of things. I happen to think that on both the mitigation side and just the general scientific knowledge base, that the oceans are basically still largely ignored compared to their significance. Then we go on to things, and this is an area that I'm very familiar with and this brings me to tears sometimes. There's an area of the world called the Coral Triangle, Indonesia, Philippines, parts of Malaysia and parts of Papua New Guinea area. And, and this is the leading center for ocean biodiversity in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:23:38       It's the thing that drove me first to live in Indonesia was the fact that I was working in the Caribbean on something for my master's thesis. And I realized that for every species of this little crab that I was looking at, there was a six or seven species and the coral triangle area, if you go to that area, that reefs are being destroyed at an incredible rate. Partly it's stupidity, it's greed, it's market demand for certain things. I could go on Fisher poisoned so he can get maybe a 10th of them for aquarium, fish, salt water, aquarium, fish that's coming under control a bit. People go off and risk their lives to have in the last decades risk their lives to go into old munitions dump, uh, dumps in, uh, west Papuan in Papua New Guinea to, to uh, take the explosives to take them out of the shells and then go back and blow up reese with them.

Speaker 3:          00:24:37       And I've seen these raves in some cases, small islands for example, in South Sulawesi where, where the, the very lives of people depend on the integrity of the reef because they protect the small islands around where people live. And still people will come in from outside and blow off the reefs just to get the fish done, the fish, take the fish goodbye, go to another reef. And the damage that's rigged and that process is, is quite incredible. We'll come back to the coral triangle because the countries now recognize that, that it's urgent. That is a crisis situation and they're trying their best to do a number of things. One of the, one of the important points is that they talk about a blue carbon budget. In other words, the reefs, if they're properly managed and not will extract a great deal of a greenhouse gases as a consequence of the reef being there and more or less do it permanently.

Speaker 3:          00:25:29       So there's always good news and there's lots of bad news, West Africa, uh, the fishing the, the term, which I don't really like, but it's a illegal unreported and it's unsustainable as well. But, uh, fishing. Um, and this is one of the prime areas that is um, um, bringing people in from the surrounding countries and taking fish, cod, taking fishing illegally. And then these fish will be transported office as a Korean vessel on the bottom. So it will be transported to Korea I've possibly through Europe, uh, and, and some sold in theU as well on the bottom. Uh, it's a, a mothership with a illegal trawlers that are out there and there's now spotting mechanisms where the local populations, because as was already said, people now have access to equipment like this waterproof cameras and this, that and the other access to the internet to know exactly which chip it is.

Speaker 3:          00:26:29       It's a fishing and people that go out in their canoes and take pictures and then report that. So this was one of the interesting things that technology can be very helpful in this process. And then finally I'm going to talk quite a bit this evening about the Arctic changing environment and development pressures. These are some photos I wish I had been in a nice position to be able to fake. These are taken by department of fisheries and oceans staff, but in our whales and um, belugas coming up in the little areas that are open in the Arctic. Well, we know there's going to be lots more areas open in the future, but we don't know what the fate of these animals will be. Now, I did this diagram to try and understand the overall governance of ocean use. Um, and I know a lot about that mainly because I've worked with some very interesting layers and others, uh, people involved with fisheries management and [inaudible] management.

Speaker 3:          00:27:21       And don't worry about all the details I find I did this diagram, but the year 2000 hasn't really changed much except that now there's a, not just the 1992 Rio, but as was pointed out, we're up to 2012, Rio plus 20. Um, and the, the important point here is that whatever we do with the oceans now doesn't just involve Canada, doesn't just involve a province in Canada. It involves international management, the use of global consensus documents like the law of the sea. It involves trade in an investment, a activities of various sorts. And I'm going to talk about some of these national and local interests, which are often very vested interest and not in the best interest of the ocean, but sometimes they are and they're not listened to and the generation of knowledge, uh, which comes not just as knowledge from scientists, but it comes from people that have a flame in their belly like we heard in our last talk and, uh, people that are in native communities, first nations community groups, and many, many other interests.

Speaker 3:          00:28:30       So knowledge now is drawn from many places. How do we put that knowledge together? And so we have things like a very, very, very good thing called the global ocean forum. But don't have time to go into the AE, but I suggest you take a look at it. And this has become kind of a pressure group at the international level. And you can see, don't worry about all of them, but, uh, there's a lot of different areas and all of these areas relate back to the fundamentals of Aquatic Resource Management, fisheries. There's also a new, uh, yet another I hasten to add and I don't know what they're going to be able to do. A global ocean commission that's been established launched just a few weeks ago with a focus on the high seas. Those areas of the deep blue that, uh, Jordan correctly pointed out are not necessarily all the productive areas, but they do play a major role still in our use of the oceans.

Speaker 3:          00:29:24       And one of the big questions is what, who should, how should high seas, uh, marine protected areas be set up and how should they be managed? Because all those neat things like fin tuna, that goal in a big circle around from the Gulf of Mexico up to east coast of Canada, across the West Africa and then across it here. And if they face a gauntlet of fisheries boats, a tremendous number of each of those fishes worth $50,000. One or two of those fish means the difference for Canadian fishermen between a good year and a bad year. Uh, and so the incentive to keep fee to have sustainability of the harvest, but there's also Japanese in the high seas and those people in the Mediterranean side, et Cetera. And there's a lot of, some illegal fishing. So anyways, Paul Martin's a Canadian number of this and I wish him luck, but we frankly have had lots of very good advice from global ocean commissions and we haven't seen the uptake of that advice nearly as strongly as we should.

Speaker 3:          00:30:24       And that's a troubling, uh, matter. So I'm entitled the, uh, Talk, uh, not just for the taking. And I really mean that the oceans are not just there for us to take. We have to give, we have to give a lot. You have to give our best to make the uses of the ocean sustainable. We have to understand that other creatures on this planet have a strong rationale for being included in the list of voters of the ocean and the people, the creatures that have some take on that, a massive set of resources up there. So, but for us, we at least can talk back and forth as humans to each other. Uh, and, uh, we have to devise what I'd call a responsible care approach for candidates. And so I'm going to go through some of what I consider the elements of that to be including some of the things that directly relate to fisheries.

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       First question. And this comes from, uh, John Fraser, who I think a lot of former minister of fisheries and oceans candidate who lives in the west coast. And he talks, um, as a person who is totally and absolutely committed to the health and the wellbeing of the oceans and says, who speaks for the oceans and what are they doing about it? And I think that for your group, Finn, you should ask that question. You should be one of the groups that speaking for the oceans, but what are you going to do about it? What is it that you can do to make a difference? And that question should be first and foremost in your mind. Here's a couple of Canadian authors do add to the very good list. Uh, and that was a short list by the way, that, uh, Jordan, uh, mentioned there. There's lots of others, but the book's Seasick, uh, written by Ilana Mitchell, former global mail writer.

Speaker 3:          00:32:14       She put a couple of years of her life into writing this book and it's very, very good and it's been highly acclaimed. In fact, uh, and it's based on science, but she's not a scientist first and say that she's a journalist trying to explain things about the oceans and you can see from our title of what her conclusion is. Uh, Farley Mowat, who's often a controversial figure, but his book, Sea of slaughter. We'll go more detail about the things that Jordan was talking about, about this unending slaughter of creatures from the ocean over the last 500 years in Canada. Um, I once showed a film about sea of slaughter at Dalhousie University and the graduate students that, uh, asked me to stop it in the middle and they said, we can't take anymore if this is what the situation is. Why are you spending your time on this? Why don't you just give up and try and do something simpler?

Speaker 3:          00:33:06       That's enough the way I'm constructed, I guess. But the point is, it's not pleasant greeting, but it's a reality check about what we have done in the past. And I'd also like to pay tribute to some people who, uh, you know, Canada as a nation has produced some of the best fisheries and ocean scientists in the world at one point in time. We were probably with along with a few European countries, um, having the best scientific journals and so forth and paying the most attention in terms of free access to the information and, and good research codes of ethics and funding in, in the ocean sciences. And, and uh, I've only put three names up here of people who are involved as an ocean studies or ocean science, uh, people that have regrettably passed away. I, if they were still alive and there's many, many of my colleagues that I could put up here, I'd be hard pressed to choose which ones.

Speaker 3:          00:34:08       But let me just give you this very brief profile of these people ran, ran myers ransom, Myers worked for the government and left the government wanting to be more independent, became a leading. I'm a professor at Dalhousie University and got a great following from the world's press because he told it like it was using his accurate scientific approaches as best he could about the state of fisheries in various parts of the world and including those in the east coast of Canada. Elizabeth Matador, Gazer who many people worship around the world and she is the daughter of Thomas Mann, the great author and a wonderful person who gave herself over completely to the oceans, also at Dalhousie University, but head at the International Oceans Institute and trained and got the money to train by hounding people like Bureau Trudeau and others in Canada saying, please give me money. And then using that money to get more money.

Speaker 3:          00:35:09       And so thousands of people now have been trained in understanding the complexities of oceans because of her work. She was also a great author, uh, on the oceans as well. And the third person who died recently, who I had the good fortune to work with, who is a psychologist. So not all is lost for you in this field. He sorted out how to, um, reduce the damage from the interaction between fishermen and Wales and, and, uh, Newfoundland that was his first claim to fame. Many more things since then. But he learned how using basic behavioral things that involve both the behavior of the whales and the behavior of the fishermen, so that when whales got, which is very frequent, which when whales got caught in the fisherman's traps, we called traps. Um, the, um, and these are big whales, really big whales. And, and everybody got upset at the Wales, got upset enough from, died fishermen put themselves in danger but lost a great deal of money and who wants to kill a whale?

Speaker 3:          00:36:09       So anyways, he worked that out and had teams that could actually go out and do it. So, uh, but he did many more things. Um, and, and these are people who made a substantial contribution in their lifetimes and serve as an inspiration for me and for many others. Um, getting down, and again, I'm just suggesting maybe if you're serious about wanting to understand what we should be asking as research questions, here's what some of the nation scientists in Canada and are talking about, and they bring, they bring in these four areas. Yes, bray improve the fundamental scientific understanding, but we've got to have the information about monitoring and how you use that information and you have to look at really understanding the impacts of human activities. And then you've got to bring this information back into governance and management. So it isn't just about managing a specific fish stock.

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       We've gone beyond that now because when you try and do it, we find often it's almost impossible because there's big questions that, that are ignored in that approach. Um, this is a rather interesting, uh, new, uh, and document this just come out, but it gets to the, what I'm going to try and say in some of the things tonight. Then there's other people that, so there's this, the scientific community speaks. Then there's all these folks, um, uh, see pause. Canadian parks and wilderness society. The Vancouver aquarium is a great place. Uh, ecology action center, Nova Scotia, the living ocean society in the west coast, wwf, that major programs that relate back to this. And, and I would really, really strongly underlying first nations and all three coast of Canada for coast, if we include the maritimes, we include the Great Lakes. They have an incredibly important role because they have constitutional rights that relate back to the oceans.

Speaker 3:          00:38:07       So we have this opportunity, we've got the longest coastline in the world and our maritime estate people don't often recognize is about, uh, depending on how you count it, but it could be as high as 70% of the land area. So that's, that's an important figure to remember. And then we have this, uh, purple exclusive economic zone, which from 1977 onwards has been the opportunity side for Canada has been as if we only had our hands on the management of that. And now we haven't had it for since 1977. We could do much better, get much more value from our use of the ocean. Uh, we could make it much more sustainable. Reality is sometimes been a little different now. Uh, if you'll allow me a little bit of a West Coast Navitas, um, from coast to coast to coast to coast. So we started in Vancouver, but the one I like here is just near my home in Oak Bay, Victoria, um, boxing day.

Speaker 3:          00:39:07       And you think of boxing day sales while the people in and uh, and uh, Oak Bay, think of sailing in a different sort of way of boxing day and they are out and the water in their wetsuits and their boats with my baker in the background. But here's another amazing thing. The western Arctic, um, that ice highway goes 40 kilometers and it comes up from the new vick. You've traveled all along the Mackenzie River, and then you'd go to little hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk, which is important strategically for a number of reasons. And the last 40 kilometers you're actually traveling on the Arctic Ocean, the frozen ocean. So they've just announced this week that they are going to put in an all season road, which will be $300 million. And of course, one of the reasons for that is simply that they won't be able to use ice highways up there much longer. This becomes a seasoned becomes too short and tenuous.

Speaker 3:          00:40:02       Um, and this was one of a person that I did a lot of mentoring with Janell Kennedy, uh, on the eastern Arctic where of course this is a primary or for what's going to happen in the future with icebergs and so forth. Um, but also one of the most interesting areas, um, because we don't know very much about the continental shelf and that area. Some people say it's better known on the surface of the moon than it is on the, along the bottom of that area. Um, people are already looking at it though, for oil and gas exploitation for shipping purposes. And they're also looking for, I'm a fisheries surprising how many things are happening in the Arctic right now where people want to go up and test fish and the east coast. It's for things like cod and the west coast. There's already salmon moving around into all of this at Pacific salmon are now found in some Arctic rivers to the other coast.

Speaker 3:          00:41:02       Gander. I was in a narrow small airplane with John Lean, the person they will, men Gander and Fogo island, uh, all covered in ice at that point. And then to a place where, uh, I really enjoy being, which is Lunenberg Nova Scotia, one of the great shipping, a wooden ship building and so forth, uh, basis. And it happened to be there the day they were relaunching the bluenose to um, almost newly built. And it's kind of interesting if you look along that shoreline, there is the sea shepherd, you would know the sea shepherd, Paul Watson's both, which has been pounded by Canada, um, for, for reasons that I won't explain it right now. And then you can see these other large boats. Um, and you can see the dartmouth ferry and the small naval vessel and dry dock there as well. It really is an active little spot, but don't forget that the oceans influence extends to uh, Ontario, not only directly through the New Orleans region and particularly therefore for Quebec, but also the water comes out of Ontario, the quality of the water and so forth.

Speaker 3:          00:42:09       Uh, creatures from the ocean come up into the Great Lakes, uh, including those El wives and some other little things that are really nasty and cost us billions of dollars in management of these species. But, uh, uh, it's also officially considered in Canada that these are inland seas that deserve to fall under the purview of fisheries and oceans for some things. And then we think of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Now, uh, it's a very interesting body of water there, but what I'd like you to look at is those little circles and then I'm going to show you some more circles. Um, one of the most interesting things for me, I've tried to simplify my understanding, a very complex oceanography is to look at the things that go round and round and dryers and circles of one sort or another. The simple example is when you go see kayaking and you're out there straining against the current and so forth, maybe the tides against it and there's a strong current and maybe a wind blowing against you.

Speaker 3:          00:43:08       So you go in and shore and then you find a countercurrent and then you're just swept along because that countercurrent is going this way while the main currents going that way. So you get a free ride instead of being out at. So lots of other things get free rides. So if you look at what's called the Haida Eddie here and see these little swirls out in the going out into the ocean there, well they're driven by the fresh water, which is all that red stuff coming down from the rivers, like the Skeena river and some others. And, and um, those swirls are, are driven by the current patterns of the ocean and they go out and they transport all the larvae from the insurer and the nutrients out to the offshore. So you talked to Jordan about the, the Simone's and one of these. Now Boys, Sema is just out there, up near the top end of it.

Speaker 3:          00:43:59       Uh, uh, that second set of swirls off there. And, and uh, um, that's how it gets all the fish that, that are out there that make it very special and why it's a high productivity area. Another one is in the beaufort gyre up in the Arctic and that's a collection point for the whales in the Arctic and some of the, uh, fish species as well because of the high productivity, same when the Gulf stream. And here's a good example of how little we understand. For a long time the oceanographers didn't understand that there were these dryers and, and that area of the Gulf stream. So the Gulf stream is going off, coming up the coast of the United States and heading off to Europe. And then there's all these counter currents that are swirling around just like the ones I'd be looking for on a kayak.

Speaker 3:          00:44:46       And then they're warm water, they're drinking warm water in off the ocean. So if these, um, countercurrent is happened to be in place just at the time that the scallops which are down on the Georges Bank shelf are spawning, then the little creatures coming up, it gets swept away by the warm water cause they're cold water creatures and, and uh, you don't get a good spa in that year. So if you're going to try and understand the management of things, you have to understand phenomena like the, uh, the gyrus and the eddies and the oceans. And this is my first introduction here. If things, ecological, physical, ecological phenomena that that won't come out through an examination of studying fishing pressure cause their environmental and focus. And there's lots of those kinds of things in the oceans. So this is led to great tusks. You can't believe, it's just like among economists, they, you know, it, what's the saying that if you get a three economists in the room, you'll get four opinions, you know, or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:45:49       And it was the same is true with a fisheries biologist. I've actually sat in the office of an ecological, uh, ocean scientist in British Columbia. I just happened to be there when he was, uh, uh, this is after the cod disaster. And he had just published a, an article with some others in science magazine, very highly respected Journal saying that the fisheries management people basically didn't understand what they were doing. A, which I agreed with him by the way. And we were talking about that the phone rings just at that moment from a fishery scientist who I won't give the name of an eastern Canada, but who worked for government and who was threatening to sue him for defamation of character because they had, they were at odds, uh, they were analyzing the same problem from entirely different points of view. And particularly when I lived in Nova Scotia, I could give you endless stories of this.

Speaker 3:          00:46:41       And, and they, they were, uh, in one case, there was a whole very large ecosystem group and they were shut down. They were shut down by the higher ups because they were producing data that were at odds with what the population dynamics people were producing. I'm giving a simplified version of things, but, so the point is, um, and I used to say this, the students when I was teaching a fisheries things, and, uh, in a Nova Scotia, don't trust the experts, you know, form your own opinions. The experts are often very wrong and they wear blinders just like everybody else in society. And one of the biggest ones is about fisheries management. Same could be said at times in the past for forest management with fisheries management is inherently even more complex. At least trees stand in line and can be counted. Rarely is that the case with fish.

Speaker 3:          00:47:33       Um, because of water kearns money, other things. So here's, here's just a little, a collection of books, a Nikah triple that collection about these different points of view. And I won't go into details now, and this is a side story here. Um, this is in Lunenberg Nova Scotia. And how many have ever been to Lunanburg? How many have ever been to Nova Scotia? Great, great. Well, if you go down to the Lunanburg, you'll see that it's very moving, very, very moving. Uh, um, uh, set of, uh, what would you call these obelisks maybe, I guess, and they list as much as possible the names of people who were killed at sea. In some cases there might be, they don't have all the names because it would be 50 or 100 people were killed in 1927. Again, while we were living there, there was a terrible incident, but these are just people from Lunenburg area cause this was the grand banks fisheries and um, and it's very moving to see it.

Speaker 3:          00:48:31       But the point is, uh, we remember a lot about our ocean passed and we even tend to glorify it or feel sad about it or whatever. But what have we actually learned, you know, and there's a just a little window dressing. There is couple of postage stamps to remind us about the glorious past. And that's the, I'm a fellow on the right. Uh, Angus Walters was a very famous captain of the fastest of the, uh, of the ships, the bluenose Newfoundland. That's that abundant cod population. But the interesting thing is the man that told us early on stuff let is still being quoted, is Harold in this, uh, from the University of Toronto, who was an economist who dealt with this idea of heartland and hinterland in Canada. And the fact that we were hewers of wood drawers of water for traders, but also, uh, we dipped into the emotion and he wrote this, what happens when you get a really, truly abundant resource like the cod fishery?

Speaker 3:          00:49:34       So that's, uh, that's his book written in 1940, very prescient. And basically he's saying as a, uh, an abundant tradable resource can fuel and economy, but it also traps you in many ways. And, and that is what has happened in Canada in a sense. We've, we've relied on super abundant natural resources, not just fish, but, but it, it allows us, I thought a lot about this over the years, trying to understand why we behave towards the resources we do. Like for example, with a cod, when we lived in Nova Scotia, you know, he'd go in and buy this fish. There was awful, uh, in the stores. You couldn't get good cod in the stores. And the reason it wasn't good was because it was mishandled, right from the time it was, it wasn't nice, it wasn't bled. So you'd have a nice open flesh and uh, it, it was treated as if it was going off the care where else, uh, to be treated a salted cod, you know, low value commodity.

Speaker 3:          00:50:32       Uh, some other people, Icelanders, Norwegians and some others didn't do that. They treated the fish property, they got a very good value added and they started respecting the resource base even more. So that's the important thing for those with an economic bent to recognize is that you can, one of the, one of the ways in which we can actually get more out of our resource get is to add value to it, handle it carefully, respect each fish that we catch, which gets again into why is it that we can go in and use trawlers and take that small fraction of the fish. But anyways, a lot of this stuff goes back to harold in us. And now the other thing is, and I hear I differ a bit from what, uh, what was said about the, the empty oceans. Yes, the oceans are empty because we've, we've knocked out a lot of the food chain, but there still can be an abundance.

Speaker 3:          00:51:23       And as you correctly pointed out, uh, Jordan, if you like eating a jellyfish, which I actually, I do there and I keep asking my Chinese colleagues, uh, well why is it that you eat a chicken feed or certain other things with some of the certain other things? Well, it doesn't for the taste, particularly, it's for the crunch and crunch feller and jellyfishes one of those things. And the same with Indonesians and others. They liked the crunch and they're delicious. Now they're dried in Newfoundland. Newfoundland couldn't believe it's good luck when they discovered the, were actually people in the world that want to do eat jellyfish, but uh, they, so they started drying them and exporting them into at least a little flat patties, you know. But there's certain other things that I could mention as well. And Squid. Uh, of course it's one of them.

Speaker 3:          00:52:10       And so what you find is a notion that gets, um, very abundant in those creatures that can be low on the food chain often and what we call it, the tritus food chains. You know, the stuff that rains down into the water column. So lots of fishermen are now happy to see no cod and Nova and a, well now I don't know about Nova Scotia so much, but certainly, whoops, everything shut off of a, I guess if you've got it still, you know, you have, can I ask some technical help up here? Like I've got nothing on my screen and then really like seeing the screen.

Speaker 3:          00:52:45       Oh, it's okay. Okay. Talk to her. It's just okay. And then how do I get it to go back here? Okay. So, so we now have very, very valuable snow crowd in northern shrimp and basically the ecosystem has changed. Don't expect the car to come back unless something catastrophic happens to these guys because these are replaced, basically replaced the card. We'll see card for sure. We'll see some other groundfish, but we probably won't see them in the abundance because these guys are eating. And the food train now. So, but, uh, that's not necessarily a bad thing, you know, that there's fewer card if you're asked the fishermen. A lot of them have made it a lot of money off. These new species will say, hey, we're making more money, we've got better votes, et Cetera. The question is, and I've tried to look at this question, but some people, the auditor general's office, uh, some years ago and we concluded that there was no knowledge base to support the hypothesis that these actually were being sustainably harvest and the new ones.

Speaker 3:          00:53:46       In other words, we might end up with the same problem, but let's go back again to what a, another thing that was mentioned earlier and that is electronic gear and so forth. Well, it's not exactly new, but it's in this period from about 1970 on, um, and this man got a, an honorary doctorate from I think the University of New Brunswick. Um, and this oddly enough was one of his boats, which I have in the sea and the dry dock in Lunenburg. Um, and, and, uh, Captain Medford Matthews was a real innovator with gear. And he brought in and saw, this wasn't the first trawler that came by any means into the region. Uh, but it's, it's kind of like the early brand of the, of the, uh, trawlers that are of a modern type and well equipped with all the gear that can take a lot of fish soner things and other equipment.

Speaker 3:          00:54:36       Well, here's what they look like. No, here's another one with a couple of kayakers for scale. And these things are essentially the bulldozers of the sea. They, they, they do so much damage to the bottom. They rip things up and I think eventually probably will see these things phased out for other types of gear. That's my hypothesis. But in the interim, these are deadly machines for from the point of view of what they can hold for fish. It doesn't mean that they can't be made to be useful contributors towards sustainability if they're held in check. But, um, particularly when you get in these big vessels and then you'd get a facilities on them or factory boats that can accompany them, that can take an immense amount and stay at sea for long periods of time because they can devastate a whole region of the ocean very quickly.

Speaker 3:          00:55:36       Now, then we move to what happens to fish after it gets caught. Um, if you look at this plant at the top, national seafoods, uh, is the worlds one of the world's major, a fishing companies. Uh, and one of the largest ones in candidate this plant located in Lunanburg was the world's largest fish plant in the 1980s. Now, my daughter Laura, will quite well remember when we used to go down to the cottage some days we were down in window of this, uh, this, uh, this, uh, a plant and it was just a bad smell and they were taking all the remains of making, cooking it to make it into fish meal and selling it. But what does national seafood do now? Um, white fleshed fish such as cod, haddock, pollack, and a bunch of others are kind of what some people in the banking business would call fungible.

Speaker 3:          00:56:34       I either all you can exchange them interchangeably. Uh, they're white flash, we can make them a deficient chips. You can even take something like Tilapia, uh, which is a freshwater fish and call it cod. And that happens sometimes illegally, but it happens. So in today's market supply chain, because China has become the most efficient processor, they get all this fish go into China and it goes through big ports like Rotterdam where it gets all muddled up. It could come from west Africa, it could come from southern America, whatever gets turned into chunks of fish that are partially processed there. Then it comes back to companies like the one in Lunanburg where people squirt some nice things on top of it and maybe make it a little fancier and make it into a frozen dinner or something like that. Then it gets step made in Canada and then sent to the United States are consumed in Canada or maybe in Europe even.

Speaker 3:          00:57:26       Uh, so that's, that's a reality. So if you were listening to the radio and the last few weeks, there's been a release of a report that estimates that something like 30% of this fish is actually mislabeled because once it gets to Rotterdam or wherever, you don't know whether it's a card or whatever it happens to be. So market supply chains go through this complex thing and um, it makes it very difficult for us to know a, whether we're really eating what we think is caught or whatever else it might be. B, whether it was caught sustainably, uh, or even whether it went through some mission happen. It's a, and it's a process that lowered the quality of the fish. So this has become a major, major problem, uh, in, in, uh, ocean management and in management of the seafood chains, the sort of thing that you're talking about.

Speaker 3:          00:58:16       If you want to be a good citizen and only eats sustainably produced fish. Fortunately, there are solutions. Um, but just to give you another example of this, uh, and this is an area where Australia was furious with us. See these, this large fish, the Patagonian toothfish, which some of you may have eaten us. How many people, and I shouldn't ask the question, but if you want to raise your hand, have you ever eaten Chilean Sea Bass? Okay, well, Chilean sea bass is one of those fancy names that's given for something that's actually a fish coming from Antarctica. And for the most part unsustainably produced. And at one point in time, this has been cleaned up quite a bit now, but it was going from Antarctica, uh, an pretty much an unregulated fishery. Uh, even though the Australians were really making a pitch for it and, and then he would go to China, it would be handled there, then it would come to Canada and then it'd be try and shipped to the United States as Canadian fish.

Speaker 3:          00:59:16       Australians weren't very happy about that. I can tell you. Uh, but, but again, this just illustrates things. So one of the ways to get around us is through all these various choices that you can make and people that help you to make good choices. It started with the Monterey Bay aquarium and now the Vancouver aquarium is in their seafood watch. Uh, the most critical thing is something started by wwf and some others in the private sector, uh, on the, what's called the Marine Stewardship Council, which is now certifying some, some species of fish and interestingly many chefs now in the world will refuse even in countries and places like Hong Kong and some of the big hotels, they will refuse to handle fish that are not certified. And this is a real step forward and I could tell you some interesting stories, but I'd better move on. So just go to a fish choice.com and take a look at some of the things that are on there or any of these individual websites.

Speaker 3:          01:00:12       This is the future. This is a future that responsible seafood companies like national see, see us, what they would be faced with. All of us and countries like China are now starting to recognize that they will have to become involved. Then there are some of the really nasty things like a shark's fin. I took this picture in a Chinese restaurant. But the interesting thing there is, um, [inaudible] the guy who was so, so tall, and he reaches to this guy, a basketball player from China and respected, highly respected within China and a person who doesn't just play basketball, but he's very interested in public policy issues. And, and he came out and said, I will not have my wife to be and I will not have, um, shark fin soup served as it's traditionally done at Chinese weddings. And I'm going to encourage all my fellow basketball players in sports figures and so forth to do the same.

Speaker 3:          01:01:09       He's probably had more impact than any other single thing of the scientists and others who bring their hands because China is a primary place now for shark fin soup and where all those 70 million or more shark fins are going now. Little known facts, I think the facts, but it's always interested me in Nova Scotia that there's been a sort of fishery. And if you go back far enough, there was a, there was all sorts of books written by people, I think Zane gray type of books. Um, very rich people used to go to Nova Scotia and, and catch them off as a sport fishery. But in the 1940s, still even, uh, there was, uh, um, a harpoon sort fishery in glace bay up in Cape Breton Island, hundreds and hundreds of boats. This is just one picture from the, um, from the era. And they had these canoes that they went out in and men would go out there with Harpoon waiting to catch up 400 or more phone swordfish.

Speaker 3:          01:02:10       The interesting point about it is it still exists, and one of the points right now is that the marine stewardship council has been asked to certify harpooned fisheries in the United States and in Canada. Um, and then also the pelagic longline. Now you've got introduced to the long line and, and some people wrap their hands to put their hands to their heart and say, the long line is the way to go because it's not involving those trawlers. But with the long line does is catches turtles, sharks and all sorts of other things that are not the ones that species, um, at the same time as they're catching swordfish. Uh, but, uh, controversially, uh, the Marine Stewardship Council has awarded the Northwest Atlantic Canadians sort of fishery, which amongst about $10 million a year, um, um, certification that they were doing it properly. Uh, I'm not so sure. I don't know now this one.

Speaker 3:          01:03:03       But the interesting thing is that already awarded the spirit fishery for the, sorry, the yes, the spear of fishery for the swordfish re, uh, they're still using spirits out there. And if you go, if you're google something along those lines, you can actually see little things for sportsmen in the United States. For example, going out and votes and throwing this or harpoons at getting swordfish. But you can see what happens that uh, the government in the late nineties really put a clamp on things cause you could see the decline on the, on the sort of fish going down there and what below what is considered a maximum sustainable yield of biomass. And you can see as the consequences of stopping that fishery, how it's built up to the point now where they feel that they can re-institute illimited sort of fishery. So these are the sorts of things.

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       This is, this is an odd ball little example. It's not one of the great fisheries, but there's dozens, even hundreds of these other kinds of fisheries out there that don't get the same kind of presses. They cod fishery. Uh, the big ones. Uh, the biggest single thing we have going for us now is the lobster and then had a, uh, is a ground fish that is still retaining some place in the and the scale of things. A very nice fish to eat. But these are the things that sustain the small communities in the social work, Nova Scotia, Bay of fundy and so forth. But the point here is that the haddock went down and it went down maybe because of what we're fishing, but it wasn't on the scale of over fishing of the, uh, of the card and almost certainly water temperature has played a role in it.

Speaker 3:          01:04:42       So again, what's cause and effect between fishing pressure and uh, fish abundance? Sometimes not very clear. Here's another one. This just, uh, a friend of mine took this picture last weekend or the weekend before, one day a fishery and you get all these collections of boats going out and, and they kill immensely. They take huge schools of herring and then the goals and other birds are there, eagles, et cetera. And the point here though is that the abundance of herring is that the greatest level in the last 30 to 40 years, responsible fishery scientist would say, we have no idea of why they would make claim credit to and sales because our careful management, but it's been up and down and up and down. There's, I, you don't have time. It was an awful lot of interesting stories about this fishery and about the way the native people, the first nations along the coast perceive how it should be managed, where they wouldn't have any of these bullets up there. They would be, because it's mainly managed for herring row, you know, they eggs and, and uh, they go to Japan and places like that. But, um, um, they would manage by lifting the things out on of Kelp where they'd been spawned by the official themselves and get rid of the bullets period. So there's different points of view of what you can do and some of those things I think are going to be the things for the future. Salmon.

Speaker 3:          01:06:06       I have spent a lot of my life looking at reading about, trying to understand Simon. I'll be the first to say it's really difficult, not the only person to say that. Um, there's aboriginal interests which are strongly constitutionally supportive commercial interests, which often are on the decline sports fisheries interests, which claim to produce about five to 16 times the value per fish landed because fishermen spent a lot of money. Uh, and then there's agriculture and anybody, anybody here from BC? Great. Well, you know that this is not exactly an easy subject in British Columbia. I mean, everybody has an opinion on it and, and uh, it's really difficult. But look at this. This is a plot, uh, several years ago of watersheds and counter because you have to involve the freshwater watersheds in British Columbia. I should say we're sockeye salmon is in decline. So the yellow and red watersheds, huge watershed is under threat.

Speaker 3:          01:07:06       That's likely to, uh, increase, uh, because of global warming and the streams are warming up and other things happening in the watersheds. The Pine Bark Beetle killing all the trees, trees go and water runs off, isn't there for the spawning season. So the salmon's truly in trouble no matter what aquaculture. Uh, if you're looking at a, a net like this, this is a fairly well run, uh, agriculture, uh, setting in a, on each of those netted areas holds about 50,000 fish this size. And if you've ever seen anything like that close up, it's quite amazing. So this is just fish pack in place. The fish aren't discontented. Um, and, um, you know, there's varying points of view about it, but some of you may know that, uh, uh, our prime minister appointed, uh, uh, uh, justice from British Columbia who was called the Koan commission to look at the future of the Fraser River Salmon, the biggest bear run.

Speaker 3:          01:08:02       And, and, uh, don't read all of this, but the basic point is that a Cohen said, if, if people were expecting that, I'd find a smoking gun one causality to it. No, no way. And I think I certainly felt that would be what he would come up with at the end. But there's all sorts of factors, but read what he says. Fraser River sockeye face and uncertain future shrinking resources, um, which may result in delays in implementing reforms and research as shrinking, shrinking resources, being less money around dfo has been cut badly. Um, meaning that the stressors to with Sockeye are exposed will continue and the deterioration of sockeye habitat will get worse. The water's constituting Fraser River sockeye habitat or warming. And then pointing out that basically because the government had taken a bunch of amendments before receiving as a, to the fisheries act that uh, in fact the future of management of the Fraser River is unknown and that's putting it in the most positive terms.

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       And, and so, um, these are guarded comments, the whole report, the summary of that, if you want to get a sense of that particular very important resource and why it's difficult to manage, read that report. So my, my, uh, concern. So we have these various things that we can do in Canada for the oceans and two big things. What is the Fisheries Act, which was in, uh, is in a very old, one of the first pieces of legislation we had encountered. And I won't give you a ball boring and dull description of all the parts of it, but it sets the basis for conservation of fish for pollution control and a number of other things related to habitat, etc. And also sovereignty over our resource and sovereignty between the federal government and provincial governments and, and its management. Uh, it's a very important piece of legislation. It's been changed quite dramatically in the last year.

Speaker 3:          01:09:58       Placing less emphasis on the habitat aspect in particular. Uh, but we also have the oceans act in Canada and this was a new piece of legislation that came out in the 1990s and essentially set a new basis of management around ecosystems, sustainable development in another words, balancing between the various kinds of uses of the ocean and specified the need for attention to marine protected areas. And also, uh, what was called la eventually became called wool, most large ocean management areas to take big chunks of the ocean and try and develop, uh, plans for them. I'm just going to give you a very brief overview of a few of these and you can, uh, th this talk will be available to anybody that wants it and you can see in more detail but, but the Lomas, uh, represent, uh, uh, move towards the ecosystem based approach and one that's based on consultation among the various users, whether they're first nations, whether they're oil and gas, fisheries and so forth. It's building relationships and dialogue among the various users. And the idea is to plan for surprises, plan for management strategies that you could actually implement and get that information in advance of development.

Speaker 3:          01:11:15       So a one that I'm very familiar with is eastern east coast Scotian shelf and they produce good work, um, and so forth. I won't talk about it anymore. One that's citizen led, uh, scientists led and led by both Canada and the United States is the area of the Gulf of Maine, particularly Georges Bank. As part of that. And then happened to the Bay of Fundy and a here, the federal government has a limited, it has taken a limited rural, um, and it's been the states and the provinces working together. That's really done some very innovative work. Won't have time to go into it. But I wanted to say just one thing, if you take this is the boundary line between the two countries. Uh, painfully worked out. And I can tell you interesting stories about that cause I was at some level and some of that, it was very interesting.

Speaker 3:          01:12:03       But if you look up towards the Bay of fundy and into north towards New Brunswick, which is, uh, just to the right at the top of the line, top line, um, whales and ships collide up there because that's where it's a natural, one of these areas with lots of occurrence flowing and dryers and so forth. And it's incredibly productive. The whales come up there to feed in the summer. Some of the scarcest whales, humpbacks are there, but some of the other whales and they collide with the ships. So you get these ships going up into, um, particularly for an oil refinery located up there and they find a whale draped over this. They have a kind of a bulbous front on them and there was a whale of dead whale there. And, and so the right whales particularly, um, there's only about 300 of them left, I think, and they were being knocked off right, left, no pun intended, uh, in that area.

Speaker 3:          01:12:56       So there was a simple solution. It was a very simple solution. And one that's worked remarkably well. They just changed the shipping lanes slightly and they put in place a kind of a spotting mechanism cause you can see the whales and so people would know where the whales tended to be clustered on a given day. So there's some leeway in where the ships go and problem not completely solve, but let's say 80% salt. So there's, there's, there really are win win situations out there. And the charge for that was led by, you can see how Nova Scotia goes down to kind of a little point, not, not the big part of Nova Scotia, but there's a little kind of peninsula and beautiful place. Now the school teacher was living out there and she took it upon herself to be part of the solution and organize local groups to actually spot and be able to say where the whales would be and demonstrated to the scientists who didn't really believe in this.

Speaker 3:          01:13:50       I don't think very strongly that, that it could actually be a solution. So it started from a citizen and I have a lot of respect for what I see is citizen science in the oceans, uh, throughout this country. I could give you many other examples in the west coast, in the Arctic and so forth. Another one that I think involves a heavy degree of citizen input is the same, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, uh, action plan, which is being implemented primarily through a, um, a environment Canada. And here there's something called Zip. We don't need to go into the details of it, but zip committees exist throughout the golf, in and around particularly around go back. It's all just all of life. Um, and the, the neat thing about it is that a, it brings the stakeholders together and they come to real solutions about local problems that affect their part of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

Speaker 3:          01:14:41       And the government and others provide a broader input into overall what the St Lawrence Action Plan would look like. So there's some degree of coherence throughout the whole region. Now these are good things that are happening and they've, they, they've been developed by people working together, painstakingly working together. I might add for more than a decade of interaction, overcoming all sorts of obstacles or differing points of view, narrow points of view, et cetera. So these are some of the good things that are happening in Canada. Uh, one that I helped to get underway in terms of some of, I won't go into all sorts of stories about it for time reasons, but a terrible name, Penn Sema Pacific North Coast integrated management area. And this includes, um, when I, I hate the word also worldclass the phrase world class, but the oceans in this area are stunning in terms of the diversity of life, uh, and also the intactness of the ecosystems in this whole area in the northern part of Vancouver Island.

Speaker 3:          01:15:43       Um, up to Prince Rupert, there's only 15 or 20,000 people living in that whole area. And that's an area that's probably about as long as the cost of much of the coast of Norway. For example, I'm absolutely fine, intact ecosystems. You can fly at a reasonably low levels and see gigantic sunfish floating on their side into the weigh a thousand pounds or more. You can see whales, you can see if you're in a boat where the seabirds go. And then there's important, uh, uh, uh, fisheries activities in that as well. There's a wonderful atlas of it. Uh, if you want to look at it online and you can download that, but, um, there's all sorts of other activities. This is drawn from that atlas just showing who's got, uh, uh, oil and gas exploratory wells and tenures in the area. Um, uh, you know, all sorts of people have staked that territory.

Speaker 3:          01:16:33       There's another one that shows, uh, all sorts of different fisheries interests. Well, interspersed with those, I don't know if I've got the, no, I don't. Um, I took it out for time reasons. Uh, if I, if I could show you where the corals are and where there's the thing called a glass sponges, which we thought were creatures that had gone extinct. They were studying as fossils in Germany and that was where they found the veranda. The areas I think that are fossilized now in Germany and suddenly about 15 years ago, somebody discovered that there was huge beds of these things around this area. They're primarily in the area that's kind of a pale orange. Um, so what are you going to do about it? These were areas that were just beginning to be used heavily by trawlers. The trawlers were starting to plow right through these ancient beds because these are, some of these are thousands of years old.

Speaker 3:          01:17:27       Um, and, and uh, uh, stock was put to it. Um, and now they're all applauded. We know where they are. There's an exclusion zones for the corals for the, a, a fisheries in the same, uh, Iran up till about 2000, there was an official almost denial that there was a, the soft corals that were found on the east coast and the fishermen had been complaining about a particularly long liners that the trawlers were going through and bringing up these things. And I went to a Fisher Fishery Association for museum and Southwest Nova Scotia and the handle these big corals and if you went on the west coast to do some of the commercial, but um, sports fishing shops and boats, uh, places they'd have them on the wall. The same thing on the west coast. Well, officially they didn't exist and finally they did exist. And now there's all sorts of exclusionary is for the red corals as well.

Speaker 3:          01:18:19       So progress but it's slow and it's painful. The northern gateway, I'm not going to even touch tonight if you want to ask me questions about it, but this is the prime example now of why we need something like Benzema to generate the kind of data that would be helpful to know how much, uh, what is their actual risk. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the government has decided to more or less, not totally, but more or less, um, got the cooperation that had been established hoop and Sema and, and that mechanism it seems to be lost. Now, another one in the north is the Beaufort Sea partnership, uh, in which is a complicated thing and you can see the vision of it is basically a ecosystem health and supporting sustainable communities and economies for future generations as well as the present. The problem with the Beaufort Sea partnership is there's a lot of things that relate to land claims and, and uh, uh, northern, um, local peoples up there that have made it very difficult.

Speaker 3:          01:19:23       And I'm not blaming them, but it's just there's a lot of obstacles in the way still to make this move as fast as it should. Another one where another mechanism is in place now and we're starting to get in places lancaster sound, lancaster sound, who is one of the first places where there were see use planning in Canada. And at that time that was in the 1980s. People were kind of looking at it as a bit of a curiosity. Now this is a very important part of the northwest passage that will become one of the areas used for shipping eventually. There's a large part of that has now proposed as a national conservation area and, and uh, this, it'll be very interesting to see what this will actually mean in reality. Now I want to point out the, the national marine conservation area because we actually have legislation saying that all the representative areas in Canada, there's 26 or 27 of them, something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:20:17       Each of those kinds of habitats should have representative areas where you could actually pinpoint and say, Aha, this is, this area is protected within that. And it will tell us about the area. I could be abused for fisheries management and so forth. Uh, helping to replenish their stocks, uh, were far from there. Just to highlight again what Jordan was saying. Ah, look at the small percentage of protected areas in the oceans in Canada compared to the line. And most people would say on the land areas, it's not enough. So I don't look at the detail of this, but these shows all these different types of areas. You know, you can look at Hudson Bay for example, or the north and south part of west coast, Pacific coast. There's a lot of areas, but particularly in the Arctic, um, we, we need a lot more effort. And one of the things that a c pause, which has been a prime, a contributor to this, they have a whole list of things that they feel are urgent priorities for marine protected areas.

Speaker 3:          01:21:23       And they're not all being acted on at this point in time. So we do have a document and talk, talk, talk, talk. It's very cheap called the national network of Mbas. Do we have a national network of Mbas in Canada? Uh, well here's one point of view from a person who I respect a lot through the Pew Foundation. Daniel Pauly from UBC fishery center is one of the people that really understands the oceans and fisheries very well in Canada and around the world. And, uh, he's been running something, a database called MPA global, looking at marine protected areas all around the world. And then if you go and look at the Canadian entries, there's 574 of them, including provincial coastal parks and ecological reserves and so forth. I can go out in my kayak and go right around the ecological reserves, two kilometers off shore from where I live, uh, for birds, for example, rain parks in British Columbia, there's dozens of them.

Speaker 3:          01:22:19       Uh, but they're mainly for, they've been chosen not for their ecological value, although sometimes there is ecological value, but it's nice safe shelters for boats that go up and down the coast, you know, small, pleasurable. It's a big pleasure bullets. So, um, this is kind of overstates the case, but it's not Daniel polly's fault. This is following certain criteria. Um, we're starting to see this now emerge as networks within the regions. So for example, um, there's whale sanctuaries, coral sanctuaries, and a place called the gully where a lot of the really interesting whales that are off shore from Nova Scotia collect now and then there's a lot of actually land based ones so that you're primarily for birds and protection of wetlands. The problem with this is can you really call it a network? What are the criteria? What, how will it relate? How will all of this relate, uh, that I've got on this diagram?

Speaker 3:          01:23:15       How will it relate to sustainable fisheries management? Because that's the kind of question that we should be asking. I don't think we're asking that question very well and Canada now, but I would urge fin to be thinking about that when you're thinking about sustainability of seafood and so forth, how does it relate back to the other things in the ocean ecosystem and how can we use those tools better? Uh, Penn Sema, this diagram shows the, all these different places that I mentioned, the corals and other areas that deserve some sort of, um, um, protection of one sort or another from here and now. Um, management issues, things like the trawlers and other activities, oil and gas in some cases. Now here is the makings of at least a west coast northwest coast network. Here's what I'd like to see. Uh, if you look at Penn seem, and I've taken it up to the 200 miles on it because I feel we should be going out to the 200 miles on this, but if you had a, I call it boy to brooks.

Speaker 3:          01:24:24       Brooks peninsula is a really, I should've put a picture of it. And it's so interesting to see it from the air. It's, it's, uh, a finger of land that goes out to the sea. Is that an interesting place? Because, um, during the Second World War when we were patrolling all along the coast for a ship's coming across automation, a lot of ship, a lot of airplanes were lost in the boy in the brooks peninsula because right at that point there's a change in the current and you get all, so there's a north and south current coming and they change seasonally and right at that point you can get a, I've talked to a pilot about this when I was flying over it with him and he was saying that he had actually seen what looked like Niagara Falls coming up because of the currents are clashing.

Speaker 3:          01:25:08       You get this water coming up rising out of the ocean. And, and uh, he said it was just like this wall of water coming up and then crashing down the other side in the atmosphere. So these are the things that only pilot see, I guess, but he said it exceedingly dangerous area, but it's, it's uh, again, a very important area separating the north and the south and the kinds of animal migrations, whales and so forth and see birds. And then if you look at the top end, there's the boys see mode and there's sea mounts. These mountains that rise up almost to the ocean, top of the ocean. Um, but in the case of Boise, mounted comes within 75 feet of the surface. Now I have talked to people that have gone out there and their cell phones, big sailboats and scuba dived on that seem odd.

Speaker 3:          01:25:55       It's filled with life. It's absolutely filled with life. And, and so we have a whole series of these. This is the only one that gets any protection whatsoever from fishing as far as I can tell. And there's other things in the scone olins and, um, rarity is very important. We'll look in the estuaries. Another one of these strange little fish, uh, things that I won't go into the sponge reefs and so forth. So this is not just a big blend, a body of light blue or anything like that. When you start looking at what's on the bottom, it needs protection. The Sea otters coming back, um, and, and they're part of the ecosystem. Now. Uh, some first nations hate them because they're taking moistures, they're taking all sorts of creatures that they want to harvest. Uh, the coral reefs. I've mentioned way Hannah's, uh, which is land co managed between Parks Canada and now a marine conservation under area under the Marine Conservation Act and the Haida people, one of the most innovative systems of co management anywhere in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:27:06       I mean this is fabulous and this is going to mean a whole different approach towards fisheries management in the area towards, uh, how the Haida people perceive their responsibilities and how the government of Canada and the province of Canada actually, uh, it's all done in a Cole management basis. This is one of the most exciting things that you can possibly imagine. And this is what the southern end can see down that yellow tip, the southern end, which happens to be where the highest recorded winds were ever recorded. And it was off a test oil rig there in the 1970s, I think it was 200 kilometers and hour or something like that. So this is the kind of habitat that's up there. And you can see the animals that are living there at the sea lions, the beautiful area. Um, oops. Cmon um, above that rock fish, those fish, many of them are 70 years old.

Speaker 3:          01:28:08       And as some of my colleagues, they want to protect them to say, would you eat your grandparents because they're delicious. They're served on many menus and a not very sustainably harvested. And in fact, before boys see mount, while it was still under consideration, that's just a, uh, uh, a plot of the, the depth contours and these currents that circulate around on the boys seem odd, but fishermen were being told to go out there and fish while they still could. So even in the, this is safe, seven or eight years ago when it was actively knowing that boise is going to be handled, there was boats going out there. So now that problem is solved, but there's all these other problems along the coast. Should you allow bullets to go out to other seamounts triangle island? Uh, most amazing place. Uh, the day I went out there and the pilot said, you were lucky, you get one to two days a year when it looks like this is not covered in rain fog.

Speaker 3:          01:29:13       You can see the little blip on the top of it. That was a, a light house. They put the light house up in the, uh, in the club level. So no, the light house keepers could never see it. The weather was so bad there that lighthouse keepers often would get no food for two or three months at a time. Um, sadly, some of the lighthouse keepers went crazy out there as well. And, and there's only the base of the light house, uh, left, uh, hurricane blew the Adelaide house itself away. Um, and so they also, one of the leading scientists that studied, it's a great place, one of the great nesting areas for certain, um, uh, important seabirds. And, uh, sadly one of the scientists fell off the cliff and she died. There's a wonderful book though that's been written about triangle island, uh, with a lot of watercolors and so forth, uh, by an artist that went out at a later time.

Speaker 3:          01:30:06       Um, it's, it's, it's a very interesting spot. Now, what do you think those things are? Uh, innovation with ocean technology and sovereignty issues such as signing onto the law of the sea. We never ratified the law of the seed, for example. I think it's time to revisit and strengthen our commitment to the ocean. I think we've made a start with the oceans action plan, but I think it's, um, we've got some good points and it's faltering in some key areas and not enough resources or even attention is being given to do it. Ask when the last time this was reviewed in parliament, for example, the fisheries, as far as I can see, the committee that deals with fisheries and oceans matters and the current parliament is, we pretty much dysfunctional, certainly not dealing with the kinds of questions that we're talking about here tonight. It will probably receive the report of the Commissioner on the environment, sustainable development.

Speaker 3:          01:31:05       An Mba's say, thank you. We probably won't be needing any serious discussion of this longterm discussion of this. Thank you very much for your hard work. And that's what things are degraded to at various times. Now we need much more than that. Uh, so in the work of Finn and with, I hope your other colleagues around the country that you will join the voices of those who do speak, I think responsibly and sensibly about the, and for the a boat and for the oceans, but that you will take these kinds of broader perspectives and keep those in mind even as you focus very strongly on underneath for going after the individual species and looking at the problems related to all of the fish that are out in the ocean. Because it's clear we're going to be eating more varieties of them and we're going to find some very scarce still in the future. So thank you very much for your attention this evening.

Speaker 1:          01:32:01       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:32:14       how'd your attention for a long time tonight? Uh, so, but you're welcome to ask questions if you'd like to do that. Right? If you ask a question, then I'll repeat it because then we can capture it on video, but he'd be more than pleased to take questions. So if anyone has one. Oh yeah. Just the general problem of sustainability. I don't know if anyone's heard of Donald Wright's idea of a progress draw. So like our ancestors killing two minutes, let's say over one is a good idea. That's progress. But once they could drive 200 off a cliff and kill an entire herd and then like he'll more herds until they, all our ancestors in those areas would starve to death because they'd kill all minutes essentially. Um, that would be progress drop. What a book from dawn [inaudible]. And I was wondering, um, if you guys have any thoughts about if that applies, if that's like an oversimplistic generalization or if it fits it.

Speaker 3:          01:33:14       Is there anything that you do about it? So the question is whether the idea of progress trap is relevant to this issue in a progress trapped is the expansion of technology to harvest beyond sustainable limits, I guess. Do you want to take that? Sure, sure. Um, well, it, it's part of a larger problem of traps and progress traps is certainly one. And we get caught in those traps because something works well for us for at the time hearing. And Sonia was true in the fisheries case. And then when it doesn't work well, we're still adhering to that approach. So one of the things, and this is one of the reasons why I bring up the ecosystem work and so forth, we have to open our mind to alternative possibilities. And also there's another little phrase that you is called the option for closure. Um, Eh, you know, for example, if you lay out all the different uses in the ocean, um, and everybody's scrambling for space in the ocean, you know, the fishermen don't want aquaculture because they can't park their boats or their nets are in the way, whatever it happens to be.

Speaker 3:          01:34:17       The oil people want one thing. The aquaculture is don't want to do old people, et cetera. So you've got to have some rational case for making choices, but option for closure if you do it well. And zoning is one of the ways to do that. Um, allows for more to go on, but at a lower risk. And what we're doing now I think is moving back towards a sectoral approach where it happens right now that the sector happens to be oil and gas. It could equally be some other sector, the could be deep ocean mining for example, or shallow ocean mining. Um, and, and so we have to have a more rational basis and just following whatever we think at the moment is the best know. And, uh, so that's, that's really dealing with the progress trap. Um, I think there's also a kind of, and maybe the company said, but it kind of a conceptual trap sometimes as well.

Speaker 3:          01:35:08       And our, we, we adhere to ideas and therefore wonder, open our minds up, but then something comes along. It could be some terrible accident, uh, the classic cases, the Exxon Valdez or something like that. And suddenly, Bang, you're in a whole new environment of thinking and you're not prepared for it. You don't have solutions. You don't have, haven't thought your way through the kind of knowledge basis you need. And so that's another kind of trap that we have to face because that's why I say think about accidents. Many of the changes in our society are the result of accidents and something so awful happens that we have to think of a new way of doing things. And so a lot of what I think of the scientific community is dealing with in the oceans right now is to say we've got to prepare ourselves for a future that's very uncertain and therefore we need to have a lot of knowledge and we have to ask a lot of what ifs so that we are prepared to make um, direction shifts as necessary in the future. Whether they're from climate change or some horrible accident or just changing priorities and society. One of those priorities for sure is that all those certification programs are going to become the way we do business. And those people who are not engaged in that, in the fisheries are going to learn the hard way. That's my prediction for five to 10 years.

Speaker 5:          01:36:29       What would be the negative consequences, especially economic consequences, the loss of jobs or those mysteries. We'll let some of those fee.

Speaker 3:          01:36:41       The question is the negative potential negative consequences of zoning? Um, yeah, it's a good question. Really good question. Um, well to start with it is if you impose zoning, it's almost certainly going to have a lot of negative consequences. One of which is people simply won't accept it and therefore the illegal activities will take a, so the first thing about zoning is it's gotta be done on a consultative and collegial and some conclusions, the wrong word, collaborative way and bringing stakeholders together. That's essential. Otherwise, there's all sorts of ways around zoning. Uh, the second thing about zoning is, um, if there are economic trade offs, one has to look at that carefully because there may be ways to avoid them. And if you don't look at the economics carefully, then you can do really dumb things with economic zone. The third thing is if you're going to make an assertion like we have both made tonight that we think Mbas, which is a type of zoning can be helpful in the overall issue of fisheries management.

Speaker 3:          01:37:48       Eventually maybe we can get away with saying that for a number of years, maybe even decades. Eventually we've got to show the results. So there to be a lot of monitoring and so forth as well. Otherwise, it's your word against my word, so to speak. And so, so those are some of the consequences on the positive side. If you do things right with zoning, you can actually get added value. You can have, uh, well give you an example. There was a full page ad in the paper, uh, in and uh, uh, British Columbia, I think it was probably a number of the papers by a group of people in engaged in marine tourism on the discovery, uh, Somme area, which is up the coast a little ways. And the point was in this case that they feared a bunch of clear cutting there was going to totally destroy or largely destroyed the potential for tourism.

Speaker 3:          01:38:42       So, um, you zone that you don't let that happen or do you just let it happen while they've got the rights to clear cutting and the people are saying, well, we're going to lose their livelihoods. People aren't going to want to come up and see clear cuts. Uh, so those are things that if you do get together, there's probably a good solution and everybody gives at the end of the day. But there's probably a solution. It's the same as that example between that I gave of the whales going and avoiding that ship. Legends for years there was resistance again, there's going to be shifts crashing into each other and all sorts of things or it won't work, work perfectly. So. So, and that was the zoning one. So, so look for the positive side of it and anticipate if there are negative things, can they be addressed?

Speaker 1:          01:39:32       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:39:32       just from the point of view of an organization like Finn, I think, uh, I read that the eye you use, um, also engage in a lot of odious behaviors that aren't necessarily related to what you talked about tonight. I, you know, human trafficking drugs now, that sort of thing. And I'm just wondering, in order to help,

Speaker 1:          01:39:51       uh,

Speaker 5:          01:39:53       give the issue more political prominence, is there, do you see linkages possible or possibly between this issue and others that people that other groups or other people make, you know, sort of considered to be sort of trigger ideas if you understand the question? So, so the question is, given that there are illegal fishing activities in that those illegal activities spill into other domains of the illegality light, perhaps drug trafficking and human trafficking, are there ways of making political capital out of those connections?

Speaker 3:          01:40:26       Um, and it's interesting that the, I, you you, and I think that's relatively new, that people have been trying to make those linkages even though we've known that there are linkages. Um, I th I think, uh, the answer in quick answer is yes, but it has to be done very carefully. Um, and it has to be done on the, it has to be evidence based and it has to be done not just at a kind of a global thinking level or won't lead and where it has to be God down a very serious things. To give you one example, um, in the 1980s, um, the fisheries industry and south of Thailand really went into decline and it was fish docks if been over fishing and all they could catch her jellyfish and squid. Um, so, and there's thousands of boats and so many of them turned into predatory action against the Vietnamese refugees coming out of Vietnam.

Speaker 3:          01:41:21       And, and it was a terrible situation, really awful. Um, well one of the things that happened was that, uh, Thailand, which was very concerned and the rest of the world was as well, but tyler and decided that they would take on the function of turning the, this past industry into a processing industry for the world's tuna and successfully managed to build a whole new industrial basis around taking frozen tuna from everywhere in the world. So if you look at all your canned to interview happened to eat tuna that you'll find most of, it's been that Camden and Thailand ever since. So it created a new industry as it at least picked up some of the jobs and got out of a lot of the illegal other activities. And including a lot of the illegal fisheries activities because of the ties were also going off into Indonesian waters and elsewhere and just savaging, uh, this fish docks there in terms of stocks and so forth. So there, there can be solutions to that. I think the, on this iau you thing it's a huge issue. FAO has been very useful on it. Um, and a lot of countries are now buying in very, uh, in a very good way including many developing nations. I think we're making progress on it, but as a long way to go still. And so anything that can link it to the other illegal activities, some of which are very audience to countries, um, that would be helpful.

Speaker 3:          01:42:50       Uh, aggressive activism like a sea shepherd can be positive or do you think that that's counter productive? The question is whether aggressive action like that of the sea shepherd can be productive for with her overall. That's counter row. Well, I have a personal view on this. My personal view, which is I think a agreed upon by at least some of my colleagues, not everybody is that we need a number of different, it is a war that's being fought and, and sea shepherd is, is fighting actively on some fronts where others fear to go, but we need people who are on the front, whether it's Greenpeace, whether it's a sea shepherd, whether it's people who are milder and their actions, but still, uh, for example, in the case of Sierra Club, no taking a harder stance decided which might include some actions that are not very nice but not on the level of going out and ramping ships or whatever that of sea shepherd has been accused of.

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       Um, I think that there's a wide spectrum of things are needed, some of which are on that far end. And I'm not, I don't want people to be injured in the process, but they're making a point in a dramatic way that, that others cannot make. Um, then there are the people that, um, um, that go out and there's lots of them go out and make movies. They go out and do active research with money that's raised for their cause and then the many of the NGO's fallenness and, and so they're not going that far, but there's still, there's still activist, highly activists and they're going out and they're looking at the problems locally and internationally and so forth. And they're valuable. There's people like myself that have chosen to work closer to government. But I mean, I, I'd like to believe that I understand some things about science and I want to see that translated into public policy.

Speaker 3:          01:44:56       If I ever went out and did something like Seasha, right, I certainly wouldn't be welcome in some of the circles that I traveled with, with government people or whatever. So you make choices. And then there are scientists that often, um, want to remain very close to their science, uh, whatever it happens to be and would prefer to bring that information freely and well out to the public and so forth, but not be the front liners themselves. And, and so, and then there's others as well. Um, I also believe in the power of one, you know, individuals like the school teacher. And the whales in Nova Scotia, um, that was just an ordinary school teacher in a small rural school district who did something that was really very, very valuable at the time. And we can find many other examples. I could tell you dozens of stories.

Speaker 3:          01:45:46       There's people, um, an organization that deals with fisheries management. Um, I'm a collective sort of basis and the west coast of Vancouver Island. And they stick their necks out. They, they work collectively between first nations, um, and with governments, federal, provincial to support, supported from a variety of different sources. And they manage a lot of species that are not the big flashy salmon or so forth, but other things. And they're making progress in setting the basis for a new form of fisheries management. And, and it's tough. Let me tell you how tough it is because I've looked at this organization quite closely. Uh, and, and, uh, so we need people that are activists in different ways. Uh, we need people that are educators. We need researchers, whole range. So I, I do think, uh, I must admit that I have a higher degree of respect for Paul Watson than many people might have. I think he's, he's shown us, he, Sean, a lot of light into some very, very dark corners.

Speaker 5:          01:46:51       Okay. So I kind of have this legal and the same question I'm interested in how we could introduce this. How can I extract something on a more daily interaction that we have, you know, like choosing the better flavor or a, you know, are there any maybe way of like, because with food on land, like you know, quality is an important aspect. So you can, I guess you could take an individual to a farm showing the process of what I think of choice is, but how do you show something has this, I mean we don't have the same connection with the fish because we could. Sure. So is there another way of educating and what genuinely the public

Speaker 3:          01:47:31       wasn't? He picked the first try, you know, you're, you're a person who deals with behavioral psychology sorts of things. I think, which of this is all about psychology and behavior has been, well the question is consumerism. What can you know what can be done to link these issues to behavior on a, at a local level, um, you don't have something.

Speaker 5:          01:47:53       Maybe if there's like a project that you have or there already is circulating that maybe we can take people. Oh yeah, he can be like, because this is an intellectual talk how let's say, and I can't really voice this information process adequately. So maybe if I can point individually.

Speaker 3:          01:48:10       Well, I, the only, the only real effective means of changing individual behavior that I think would actually work is for people to write their nps and the members of the cabinet. Because believe it or not, politicians actually pay attention to letters. And so a lot of what we've talked about tonight, especially the marine protected areas issue isn't going to be moved forward unless the politician sense that there's actual public demand, like the frameworks already there, right? They've signed the treaties and so on. But the way they're reading the population is, it's perfectly okay to ignore that. And the only way to change that as far as I can tell is to indicate that it's actually not okay to ignore it because right now it is okay. And, and that's not good. Our political system actually does work. It's much more permeable than people really think because in some ways it's left to its own devices.

Speaker 3:          01:49:05       You know, most people don't really participate in the political system, so it leaves it in the hands of the very small minority who do, but it's surprisingly permeable if you're interested in permeating it. And so while that's, that's my take, at least at the political level, that's one. Uh, let, let me give you four or five things that I think are really useful. Uh, one is, uh, if you have the trust in them, uh, these seafood guides are very helpful and so you can use those in your own personal life. And if you go into a restaurant, uh, ask them has this, and if you happen to enjoy fish, ask them, tell me about this fish. What is a species? Where was it captured from? Um, what is it certified fish that you're serving? Ask the chef to come out and talk to you. I've done that.

Speaker 3:          01:49:55       And, and, and go in if you use an ipad or an iphone and challenge them on some things when they say they don't know, they, there's no information. And then I did this once in a very respectable restaurant in Vancouver and I warned them, I said, look, I'm bringing a group of people who are leaders in this whole seafood process. They're going to have all sorts of questions. So I brought my ipad was brand new in those days and did this come out six months before and we sat down and half an hour by the time that the poor chefs were sweating and let me tie, but they answered all the questions correctly. We got all information and we got past all these fancy names and so forth. So that's what another way in dealing with the food industry do it at a supermarket. If you're not getting good answers right to the president of the company and say, you know, I was in whatever chain had happened to be local or national and, and I could not get any answer above whether the crowd that you're serving with sustainably produced.

Speaker 3:          01:50:52       Can you tell me? And if they can't go after them and say, please, I really want to, not an honest answer, but I'll bet you the answer and you'll make your decisions. And a third way is, as you say, go to the politicians and keep going to the politicians. Find out who the politicians locally are, the really have an interest in the subject because there are little clusters of people that don't get very much support in both the Senate and in the house. There really are interested in they cross party lines and some of these things as well. Um, and so that's another way of doing it. But go to this. I think that unsustainable development in general, we have to go to the cities and what's anything but Toronto and political system right now and how much this would come up to the top.

Speaker 3:          01:51:36       But I know certainly in the West Coast and uh, I think a lot of places in the east coast, it's very central. People will talk about it to you and they are the places where action is taking, taking on interesting approaches. Uh, the next one is to figure out, and you can only do this yourself by looking at different organizations, decide which organizations you're going to support and support them in ways, not just maybe giving them some money from time to time, but ask how you can help because, uh, it, just to give you a couple of examples, world wildlife fund, a Canadian parks and wilderness society both have excellent, excellent people that need support, you know, and not just money, but they need people behind them in various ways. And there's various things. Uh, and I guess finally if you have children will have children or whatever, work with kids. Kids genuinely want to do things better. They understand kids, you know, you're cute animal.

Speaker 4:          01:52:36       Well I was a bit insulted about that fish that your child. But I thought it was kind cute myself but,

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       but uh, uh, the important point is that kids love whales are our little granddaughter who's eight years old. And she proudly announces, oh I'm doing a research project on a Pacific Dolphin. And, and by the time she finished that thing, she knew a lot about Pacific dolphins help people that way, you know, get at young people, young people who really want to because they are upset by these things and they see it. There's a lot of stuff on television and so forth. The Internet and they are getting done that there's a problem and they happened to love these things. They love dolphins, they love seals and they decided the other certainly whales and uh, they can't understand why these things are in trouble or the fish that they might eat her in trouble. So those are some concrete ways that you can actually address this and keep that list in mind as you move ahead with Finn as well.

Speaker 3:          01:53:36       Cause I think it's a really important question when I'm talking and we all are talking that may maybe a bit abstract they hear, but in each case, you can bring these things down to, uh, to real life. Another one on the west coast, just to give you a nonstop on this. But if you go to any school around Victoria, Greater Victoria, you'll see salmon images, uh, that the kids have individually made and painted and they're on the school fences. It's in front of them, you know, about sustainable and, and, uh, some, uh, communities, uh, spray painting around, sorry, spray painting around gutters and saying, you know, this water needs to assignment stream. Yeah. Self awareness. All right. So I think we've had your attention long enough. Thank you very much for coming. [inaudible] much appreciated. And thanks to Dr. Hanson. Thank you.
