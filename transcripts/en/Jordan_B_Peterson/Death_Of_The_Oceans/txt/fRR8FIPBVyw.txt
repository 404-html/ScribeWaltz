Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15          An event of major international significance so occurred this week. Australia announced plans to protect almost half its oceanic territory up from an already stellar 20% the announcement was made it real plus 20 the world summit evaluating progress made on environmental and economic issues since 1992 why is this so important? It's simple. We're catching all the fish down the chain from large to small with high tech rapidity. It's a war on fish and we're winning. Marine protected areas give nature a fighting chance. When Europeans first came to the new world, they encountered see life and quantities that stagger modern imagination lobsters so common that only the poor would eat them. Reach 20 pounds. Massive oyster beds yielded dinner plate sized specimens in a single day. A fisherman could hook 600 giant sturgeon, which could weigh a ton on cream beach north of Boston. The shellfish would pile up three feet thick after a nor'easter.

Speaker 2:          01:18          I've been there recently after a storm on four miles of beach, I found a lobster trap, a horseshoe crab dad and one starfish. I found that painful. None of this exists anymore and more besides is gone. It's an environmental catastrophe, but it's also an economic and aesthetic catastrophe and it's caused by ignorance. Particularly in Canada. We had one of the world's great resources in the cod fishery for years. We blamed it's decline on foreigners. In 1982 we won the right to extend our coastal limit from seven to 200 miles. By 1992 we had managed the cod to virtual extinction and the Atlantic fishery was closed. 40,000 people lost their jobs. We learned nothing from this. Canada is willfully blind and it's ocean management strategy and we keep lying to the world about our intentions to do better. In 1992 we pledged to protect one fifth of our oceanic territory.

Speaker 2:          02:19          By 2012 we promised the same thing again in 2002 and 2003 and 2005 where are we after all these promises? We've reserved less than 1% and phishing is still allowed in almost all of that. Even the radically business like Americans have done better with 5% of their oceans protected. Does our word on the international stage means so little, and if so, why? Some of it is the consequence of the ideological divide between environmentalist's and those on the right. Harper's conservatives regard anyone concerned with ecological issues as an enemy. The in gratitude environmentalist's typically show for the benefits of the modern economy assures such a response we must get beyond such counterproductive enmity and quickly. Proper management of the oceans would be good for everyone. Fishermen, tourist, consumer, businessmen and politicians alike. If we continue along our present path in a few years, there will be nothing but jellyfish left and we've started to eat those. We should muster up the foresight of the Australians adopt the processes they have developed so successfully and manage what we are responsible for gratefully and intelligently for the agenda with Steve Pakan, I'm Jordan Peterson, support Ontario's public television. donate@tvo.org.
