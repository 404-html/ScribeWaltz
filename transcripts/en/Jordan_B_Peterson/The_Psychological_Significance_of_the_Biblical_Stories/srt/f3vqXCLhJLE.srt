1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,770
So it's

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,100
July 18th,
Tuesday,

3
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:07,040
July 18th,
2017,

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,240
and I've been working for the last few 
days on the eighth lecture in my series,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,280
the psychological significance of the 
biblical stories and I'm planning to 

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,121
talk about the abrahamic stories that 
immediately follow the stories of Noah 

7
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:26,491
and the Tower of Babel.
I'm not as familiar with abrahamic 

8
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:30,040
stories as I am with the stories,
the earlier stories in genesis say from 

9
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:33,950
the beginning of the Bible through the 
stories of Noah and the Tower of Babel.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,730
And I'm not as familiar with abrahamic 
stories as I am with the stories of 

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,710
Moses that begin with exodus and 
continuing to succeeding chapters.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,980
So I've had to do a lot of reading and a
lot of thinking and,

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,340
and some conversing as well.
And as part of that process,

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,710
I spoke once again with Jonathan Patio,
uh,

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,090
a carver of stone icons and an Orthodox 
Christian and student of religion.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,760
And also this time,
who I did a video with a while back,

17
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,800
you might remember called the 
metaphysics of pepe,

18
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:07,940
where we discussed the psychology of the
stranger and also some of the stories,

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,000
abrahamic stories involving lot in Sodom
and Gomorrah,

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,450
and I also had the opportunity to meet 
his brother Matthew Palio,

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,480
who's been working on a book on the 
Bible for the last three and a half 

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:19,480
years.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,020
And so we spent 90 minutes talking about
the abrahamic stories and the conceptual

24
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:25,700
background that's necessary to 
understand them.

25
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:30,701
And that's what I want to show you today
after this introduction.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,120
So I hope it's useful.
So I'm going to introduce both of you.

27
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:41,121
So Jonathan is a carver of icons and 
I've spoken with Jonathan a number of 

28
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:44,370
times already and he now has his own 
youtube channel as well,

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,400
where he discusses issues that are 
similar to the ones that we're going to 

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,611
discuss today.
In Matthew is his brother who I haven't 

31
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,540
met before in Matthew,
has been working on a book for the last.

32
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,050
How long?

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,650
Two and a half years.

34
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,770
Three and a half years.
And do you want to tell everyone very 

35
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:01,770
briefly about the book?

36
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,230
Well,
it's a book about symbolism,

37
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:09,231
but it's basically,
I'm trying to rediscover the world view 

38
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,530
that was present in the time of the 
Bible or at least actually not that long

39
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:20,250
ago because modern,
modern interpretations of reality,

40
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:22,890
materialists interpretations of reality 
aren't that old,

41
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,950
right?
The world view that was there when 

42
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,700
traditional societies were still there.
Um,

43
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,320
and so I'm trying to rediscover that 
worldview and a,

44
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,380
basically there are basic patterns,
heaven and earth time and space,

45
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,540
things like things like that.
Uh,

46
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:47,541
so it's like a,
a cosmology that's been completely lost 

47
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,780
as far as I'm concerned.
Some people have glimpses of it,

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I think a lot of people do,
but it's very general patterns that we 

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,060
have to re re understand.
So we can understand the Bible,

50
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:58,230
for example,
in other,

51
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,250
other storage.
They get interested

52
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,230
in this.
Like what is it that compelled you to do

53
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:02,590
this?

54
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,470
Oh,
I don't know where to start.

55
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:08,940
I mean,
my whole life has been about that.

56
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,290
So,
uh,

57
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,790
I mean,
you read the Bible,

58
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,970
you can take it literally,
you can take it figuratively or you can 

59
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,640
take it both ways.
And I'm trying to take it both ways.

60
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,360
I'm trying to get rid of it,
the economy,

61
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,080
the dichotomy of symbolism and factual 
description.

62
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,580
I think there is no such dichotomy.
If you understand what the words mean.

63
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:34,581
If you have the right perspective,
there's no more metaphors in the Bible.

64
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,680
There are no okay.
But it takes a while to get there 

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,200
because you have to adopt a completely 
different perspective than,

66
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,560
than the materialistic when obviously 
you got to be a materialist and,

67
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,470
and a Christian or we can be a religious
and a materialist.

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,160
That's what I think.

69
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Okay.
And one of the things we're hoping is 

70
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:55,640
that,
you know,

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:55,640
we've been getting.
I've been getting a lot of questions and

72
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,710
I know you probably Jordan,
me getting a lot of questions about this

73
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:03,210
question of metaphor and a lot of people
have been asking me how do we reconcile,

74
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,150
how do I reconcile metaphors with what's
in the Bible?

75
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:11,151
How do I reconcile these metaphors with 
how I'm supposed to live in the world 

76
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,721
and I think that would,
matthew has been with his writing and 

77
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:14,721
what I've been,
I've been reading it,

78
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,530
I'm reading it right now,
is that he,

79
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,670
he's really able to answer that question
in a way that I think will be one of the

80
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:23,860
most satisfying answers that we've seen 
in in awhile.

81
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,870
So we're pretty excited to see how are 
we going to get that out

82
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,720
to people.
So let me start by telling you what I've

83
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:35,721
been thinking about just briefly and 
then you guys can comment and I'd like 

84
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,260
you to do most of the talking if we can 
manage that.

85
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:39,900
Although I'm so damn talkative,
it's hard to imagine that'll happen,

86
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,530
but.
So I've been reading this book called 

87
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,120
the disappearance of God and I've been 
using it as a.

88
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,380
it's a body guy named Richard Friedman 
and it was published I think in 2005.

89
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:55,890
I think that's right.
It might have been earlier than that,

90
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,610
but he makes a couple of interesting 
points about the all the braiding in the

91
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:08,091
old testament and and they're parallel 
points and so the first is that the 

92
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:10,290
closer you are to the beginning of the 
Bible,

93
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:15,291
the more God is present and and as you 
progress towards the end of the Old 

94
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:22,641
Testament,
God sort of vanishes in stages until he 

95
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:25,710
only manifests himself if at all,
in prophetic visions.

96
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,180
And at the same time the parallel 
development is that the stories of 

97
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,190
individual human beings become more and 
more well developed.

98
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,790
So it's like as the idea of the 
individual personality emerges or the 

99
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,760
fact of the individual personality 
emerges.

100
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,790
The the presence of God as a,
as a detectable entity like an external 

101
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:52,350
entity even seems to decline 
proportionately.

102
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,090
And so I'm trying to puzzle that out in 
a variety of different ways.

103
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,110
Partly neurologically because there's 
some evidence that the domain of 

104
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:09,281
experience that you might associated 
with my associate with the divine is a 

105
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:15,041
consequence of suppressed lemons.
Left Hemisphere function and augmented 

106
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,701
right hemisphere function.
And then I'm trying to also consider 

107
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:22,310
that in relationship to the effect of 
chemicals like silicide been,

108
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,880
which obviously can produce powerful 
mystical experiences,

109
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,360
so experiences of consciousness that are
really have a different type than normal

110
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,420
waking ego consciousness,
and I've also been reading humans mostly

111
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:41,471
commentaries about humans read book and 
his attempts to use active imagination 

112
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:46,211
as a as a means to explore the contents 
of different forms of consciousness,

113
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:50,960
which is something that modern people 
just really never do.

114
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,670
Although he did it for years and and the
consequence of that was the red book,

115
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,820
also the black books,
which hasn't been published yet,

116
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,420
but the red book,
which was a,

117
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,350
which was I think published two or three
years ago.

118
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,050
That was a collection of visionary 
experiences in his.

119
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,650
His continuing discussions with figures 
of his imagination,

120
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,070
which he regarded as the most important 
work he did in his life.

121
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,700
So,
so what's,

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,710
what does that all boil down to?
It's.

123
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,310
It's definitely possible for people to 
have non can have to have experiences 

124
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:30,911
outside the domain of their normal 
consciousness that produced the 

125
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:35,531
intimation of the divine.
That seems to be factually indisputable.

126
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,220
Those were not exactly sure how those 
experiences manifested themselves in the

127
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:45,730
periods of time that are associated with
the early biblical stories.

128
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,790
Yeah,

129
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,260
the BIP,
the Bible talks about those sorts of 

130
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,161
experiences very forthrightly in the 
earliest abrahamic stories and also in 

131
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:57,090
the story of Noah and obviously an Adam 
and eve and all of that.

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,120
God is very present and then he 
disappears over time and one of the 

133
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,781
things that that I'm the guy who wrote 
the disappearance of God Friedman.

134
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,420
One of the things he pointed out was 
that the fact of the disappearance of 

135
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:14,850
God in the Old Testament,
the fact that that's a.

136
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,810
that's,
that's a continual,

137
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,870
like it has narrative continuity.
That fact,

138
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,530
he already remarked on both those things
because of course the books were written

139
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:27,420
by different people and then they were 
aggregated,

140
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,450
but out of that came to elements of 
narrative continuity and one was the 

141
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,501
gradual disappearance of God and the 
other was the gradual rise of the 

142
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,200
increasingly well-defined and powerful 
individual.

143
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,890
So anyways,
associated with that is the idea that as

144
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:51,421
God withdraws,
he also starts to manifest himself more 

145
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:54,871
through the idea of a covenant and that 
the Covenant is something that's 

146
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:58,801
established with an individual all 
obviously also with the nation in the 

147
00:08:58,801 --> 00:08:59,970
case of Israel,
but it's mediated through individuals.

148
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,310
And so,
well,

149
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,430
that's a brief wander through the sort 
of cloud of associations that make up my

150
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,440
thinking about the topic at the moment.
So,

151
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:18,090
well,
what you described sounds a lot like 

152
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,010
what would you see in the Bible?
I'm not so sure about the god is more 

153
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,460
distant part in,
further on and goes,

154
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,910
um,
from what I understand,

155
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,460
there are two kinds of consciousness in 
the Bible.

156
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,570
One of them is it's called inhabiting 
the land.

157
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,650
That's when reality fits the fact,
the theory.

158
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,190
Okay?
So the principal and the fact that 

159
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,400
grief,
so their loss and people follow the laws

160
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,940
or there's an idea and reality fits with
that idea.

161
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,860
So that's called inhabiting the land.
So it,

162
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,790
it,
it's familiar space.

163
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,580
Okay.
So when you live in that space,

164
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,530
things make sense because your ideas 
match what's happening,

165
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,440
right?
And then you can fall away from that.

166
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,870
That's the covenant.
A covenant is an agreement between 

167
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,030
theory and practice.
That's what a covenant is in the Bible.

168
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,540
I'm so God gives laws and the people 
have to agree to follow the law 

169
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,060
basically.
So the law is,

170
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,560
is,
is an identity.

171
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:26,780
It's not just like you do this,
you do that.

172
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,940
It's,
it's,

173
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,010
it expresses God's identity in practice.
So when the facts match that identity,

174
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,340
that's like a soul and a body that are,
uh,

175
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,210
that a great.
Okay?

176
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,600
So when you fall away from that,
you fall into exile.

177
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,980
That's the other mode and it looks like,
um,

178
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,060
that's what you were talking about 
before.

179
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm not so sure until you've talked 
about a coconut,

180
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,720
but,
um,

181
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,340
that's when the meaning and the fact 
that do not know.

182
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:01,760
Touch.

183
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,550
Okay.
So,

184
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:07,551
so let me,
let me ask you a couple of questions 

185
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:07,551
about that.
Yeah.

186
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:07,680
So,
you know,

187
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,710
I've been describing the cosmology in 
the Bible as mappable onto the domains 

188
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:18,621
of order and chaos.
And I actually think the best way to 

189
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:20,930
define the order,
his order is the place you are when what

190
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,090
you're doing matches what's happening.
It's very,

191
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:29,091
very,
very similar to the idea that you just 

192
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:29,091
expressed.
And then that's exactly it.

193
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:29,091
Okay.
Okay.

194
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:30,600
And yeah,
that's a state.

195
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:34,050
There's a state of harmony between 
preconception and actuality.

196
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,290
And that's also,
I think the circumstance under which 

197
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,261
people's emotions remain regulated.
And I thought about that neurologically 

198
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:46,101
to.
I think that what happens is that under 

199
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:47,100
those conditions,
your left hemisphere stays in charge and

200
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:48,900
there's some evidence for that kind of 
thing too.

201
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:51,610
Especially from the writings of this 
neurologist.

202
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,840
I think he's a neurologist.
His name is Ramachandra and he's quite a

203
00:11:55,841 --> 00:12:00,790
famous brain scientist and he's an 
another,

204
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,550
another neuropsychologist named El Conan
Goldberg,

205
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,040
who's also talked about hemispheric 
function in the same way.

206
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,040
And so when things are going according 
to plan,

207
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:14,041
let's say,
and then the individual ego 

208
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:18,331
consciousness that's,
that's focused and specific stays in 

209
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:24,211
charge,
but that also keeps negative emotions 

210
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,950
regulate it because there's no need for 
them because everything is working 

211
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,700
properly.
And so then you can fall out of that and

212
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,830
you called that,
you called that exile?

213
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,460
No.
Uh,

214
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,820
when,
when you fall away from it.

215
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,140
Yeah.
When you fall away from the.

216
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,350
So that would be equivalent.
It's also the flood.

217
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,710
It's like.
Yeah,

218
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,390
fine.
Okay.

219
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,930
So I was like the wandering in the 
desert.

220
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,240
Yeah,
it's the,

221
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,040
the idea of exile is,
it's exactly what we said.

222
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,100
It's about serving strange things so 
you're not in charge anymore.

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,220
Fax something else is what you're in.
You're in that you live in a world where

224
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,090
you are not in charge or your identity 
is not in charge of the facts and 

225
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,490
they're not.
They don't fit with reality.

226
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,770
So that means something else is in 
charge.

227
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,830
And so you're serving that.
So the idea of serving strangers in 

228
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,220
exile,
it simply means,

229
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,280
oh,
that's really your identity doesn't 

230
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,280
match reality.
Oh,

231
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,280
that's funny.
I never thought of it

232
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,700
both that,
that idea of serving strangers in exile.

233
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,010
So,
so.

234
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:30,110
Okay.
So I'm going to branch off that a couple

235
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:35,111
of different ways.
So one idea there is that there was an 

236
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:39,700
idea from young,
which is paraphrased something like if 

237
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,271
you don't,
if you don't act out your own myths and 

238
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:43,970
you serve a bit part in the myths of 
others,

239
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,160
okay,
so that would be in keeping with that 

240
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,851
idea of serving the stranger in exile 
and then the next part would be when 

241
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:55,790
you're in a chaotic state and your 
emotions are disregulated,

242
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,180
your personality fraction aids and the 
fractionated personality personalities,

243
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:06,331
some personalities fight for control 
over over over behavioral output so you,

244
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:08,530
you,
you dissolved from a unity might have.

245
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,550
Think about it as a pyramid,
a pyramid with with a unifying 

246
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,320
conception at the top that 
disintegrates.

247
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:20,321
That would be like the Tower of Babel to
some degree that disintegrates and then 

248
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,790
sub entities,
you could think about them as spirits or

249
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,320
think about them as psychological 
entities regulate your behavior.

250
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,740
That would be equivalent to a movement 
from the left hemisphere to the right.

251
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,510
Because I think the right is dominated 
by subcortical structures route.

252
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,570
I think that's how the animals exist,
is,

253
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,630
is it's sequential domination by 
subcortical structures rather than some 

254
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,230
overarching conceptualization from the 
top down.

255
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,990
I think that,
um,

256
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:52,170
what you call it,
the left and the right is exactly the 

257
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,170
opposite of the traditional left.
Right?

258
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,410
I'm not so sure yet,
but when you say left hemisphere,

259
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:55,770
what do you mean?
Well,

260
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,760
like what's the left hemisphere governs 
the right hand.

261
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,050
Okay.
So the left hemisphere is the one that's

262
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,110
when it's.
When it's in charge and when everything 

263
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,110
works.
Yes.

264
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,060
Okay.
It's exactly the opposite of the,

265
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,760
of the traditional imagery.
Usually the,

266
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,200
it's the right.
That's.

267
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,190
Well,
yeah,

268
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:17,370
because they're using the hands.

269
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,170
Yeah,
exactly.

270
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:24,171
So the right,
the right would be mapped onto the left 

271
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:24,171
hemisphere.
Okay.

272
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:25,410
So that's fine.
That's fine.

273
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:25,820
Now.
And,

274
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,850
and the traditional imagery I think is 
associated with the hemispheric 

275
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,071
specialization as well because the idea 
of right now I want to ask you a 

276
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:38,260
question about that.
You said that they,

277
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,510
the,
the,

278
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,700
the living,
what was it you contrasted exile with?

279
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:48,710
What was the other conceptualization 
inhabiting the homeland inhabit?

280
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,130
Inhabiting the homeland?
Sure,

281
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:55,131
absolutely.
Working on working on the homeland is 

282
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:55,200
another way to say,
okay,

283
00:15:55,201 --> 00:16:00,201
now tell me again how you conceptualize 
the relationship between God and and his

284
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:05,640
people.
Let's say in the homeland.

285
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,180
Uh,
well,

286
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,370
God,
like I said at the beginning,

287
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:16,371
there's the idea of heaven and earth is 
that the basis and everything in the 

288
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:19,590
Bible.
So heaven is meaning and earth is fact.

289
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:24,591
So in that relationship,
there's God,

290
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,210
it's always the name of God.
By the way,

291
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,580
if you look,
if you look in the way it's described in

292
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:30,880
the Bible,
it's,

293
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,480
it's,
they're talking about the name of God.

294
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,510
So that means the meaning of God.
So God is not just meaning,

295
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,980
but when they talk about it in the 
Bible,

296
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:45,330
it's always about the name of God.
So the name of God is an identity.

297
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,600
It's like a principal in axiom or 
something like that.

298
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,690
And um,
it has to embody itself in a physical 

299
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:58,230
reality,
flesh or in matter.

300
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,620
So the,
the role of the nation of Israel is to 

301
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:09,201
embody that identity.
And it's also to embody it in reality,

302
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,170
not just in themselves.
So basically there are a mediator 

303
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,160
between heaven and earth,
right?

304
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,100
They're trying to make God's identity,
um,

305
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,440
practical or concrete or that's why it's
all about laws because you take a nap,

306
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,590
it's like mathematics.
You've taken that an abstract principle 

307
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,950
that's really extremely simple.
Uh,

308
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:38,250
it doesn't seem like it.
It contains much information,

309
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,350
right?
If you take an axiom in mathematics,

310
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,260
but then you have to derive all the 
implications,

311
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,360
right?
So that's making it practical,

312
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:48,570
that's making it concrete,
that's bringing heaven into the earth.

313
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,280
So that's their job.
It's like a cosmic mediator.

314
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,120
Okay,

315
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,350
okay.
Follow you so far.

316
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:58,520
So,
all right,

317
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:01,460
so the,
the,

318
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:08,230
it looks like there's two ways maybe in 
the biblical narrative that that will,

319
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,020
is instantiated in,
in reality,

320
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:17,021
and one would be as a consequence of 
individuals aligning themselves with the

321
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:22,251
word of God and the other is the 
instantiation of the word of God into 

322
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:25,860
the state of Israel seem seem 
reasonable.

323
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:30,861
Okay?
And that seems to begin that that has 

324
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:31,080
its origin in the,
in the first abrahamic story.

325
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,650
So Abraham talks to God and God talks to
Abraham and tells him that he's going to

326
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,650
be the father of the nation essentially,
and then

327
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,240
you'd like to inherit the land to order.
It's the same thing actually.

328
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,050
Those two things have the same is going 
to inherit the land and he's going to 

329
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,610
become the principal of a great many 
people.

330
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,020
So that's like he's fleshing out an 
identity,

331
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,890
right?
It gives a nation instead of just 

332
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:04,890
individual.
Right?

333
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,890
And he's going to become the identity of
a nation.

334
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,410
Okay.
And so how do you understand the 

335
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,330
description of that in the,
in the biblical narrative?

336
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Because one of the very.
One of the things I find very strange 

337
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,961
about abrahamic stories is that 
immediate presence of God and God shows 

338
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,030
up to Abraham and tells them this.
And then Abraham makes an altar,

339
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,420
if I remember correctly,
once he gets to the land where he's 

340
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,600
supposed to be,
he makes an altar and then.

341
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,320
And then God appears to him again.

342
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,150
Yeah,
I'm not again,

343
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,040
not again,
appears to him the first time.

344
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:51,041
It doesn't appear.
I think I'm pretty sure the first time 

345
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:51,041
God speaks to him.
Okay.

346
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,200
See that's,
that's important.

347
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,570
Okay.
The second time

348
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,760
distinction important.

349
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,400
Well,
because he's just,

350
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,000
he's just,
he's not physical.

351
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:05,050
He's not a into practical reality yet.
It's invisible.

352
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,380
So God speaks is he's not manifest.
It's just an idea principal at word.

353
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,260
Okay.
And unmanifest word or it's like the 

354
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,690
minimum of manifestation.
It's just language,

355
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:18,520
just word.
And then.

356
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:23,521
So what he says is go to this place,
go to this land and you'll inherit the 

357
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:31,471
lead.
And then he goes there and then it says 

358
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:31,471
God appeared to him.
I see.

359
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:31,471
So,

360
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:32,150
okay.
So there's a,

361
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:37,151
there's a progression.
Progressive Progressive Appearance of 

362
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:39,950
God and it's partly a consequence of 
Abraham's original,

363
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,830
um,
obedience to the initial idea.

364
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,780
Yeah.
Which was very abstract.

365
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,860
Me Go here.
You can be more simple than that.

366
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,410
Go there.
So it's,

367
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,720
it's like,
it doesn't mean anything,

368
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,910
but it means everything.
It's a very.

369
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,320
Everything we do is I go there,
go there and do something.

370
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,770
So it's like the principle of all things
appeared to Abraham saying,

371
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,380
just go there and you'll inherit.
That doesn't really mean anything if it 

372
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:15,350
contains everything humans do.

373
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,390
Yup.
Okay.

374
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,670
That's an interesting observation 
because I think of human beings as other

375
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,680
very directional.
They're always going from point a to 

376
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,021
point b.
they're always aiming there like 

377
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:29,021
archers.
Right.

378
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,590
And it's definitely the case.
Like I had someone write to me.

379
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,160
No,
I was doing a Patriot interview with one

380
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:39,161
of the people who's been supporting me,
a young guy and uh,

381
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,880
we were talking about the idea of Christ
as redeemer and judge and he was,

382
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,380
this young man was unredeemed,
let's say for a long period of time 

383
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,131
because he didn't have any direction.
And to have direction you have to know 

384
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:59,690
what's good and what isn't.
Because to have direction you have to go

385
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,700
towards what's good.
And so the judge is what helps you 

386
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,381
figure out what's good and if you don't 
know what's good then you can't be 

387
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:10,340
redeemed.
Because to be redeemed as to be is to be

388
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:13,190
moving towards the good and away from 
let's say evil.

389
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,010
And so the judge and the redeemer have 
to be the same thing.

390
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,460
And that fits in with what you're saying
because the judge is the thing that 

391
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,250
makes qualitative distinctions,
let's say,

392
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,030
and you need to make a qualitative 
distinction before you can move ahead.

393
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,450
Okay.
And so your point is that the principal 

394
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,410
that Abraham encounters to begin with is
the principle of directionality itself,

395
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,940
qualitative directionality.
It's something like that.

396
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,680
That's correct.
Yeah.

397
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:40,250
It's.
Well,

398
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:44,360
it's,
it's the positive identity of anything.

399
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,880
Like it's,
it's like a seed.

400
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,120
It's the seed of a tree.
That's the traditional way to understand

401
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:51,330
it.
It's just a seed.

402
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:57,010
It contains everything in it,
but in itself it's just something like 

403
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,000
go there or something go there.
Okay.

404
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,840
That's it.
Okay.

405
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:00,580
So one of the things that's been 
interesting,

406
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,830
I think for me to learn personally as 
I've moved through my life was that if I

407
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:08,380
ever actually did anything,
it was worthwhile.

408
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,130
You know what I mean?
Is that something would come of it.

409
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:15,310
It wouldn't necessarily be what I expect
it to come of it,

410
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,960
but the act of going and doing did bear 
fruit.

411
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,730
Yeah.
And that's pretty much the story of 

412
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,190
Abraham in a nutshell.
Actually what you just said,

413
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,520
because God says,
go here,

414
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,910
you only inherited the land.
Abraham doesn't inherit the land.

415
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,750
He could have been right away.
It could have gone there and it's yours,

416
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,140
but no theirs.
That's why it says as soon as he gets 

417
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,140
there and says there's already people 
there,

418
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,970
there's the land is already owned by 
other.

419
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,900
There's a famine.
Yeah,

420
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:48,900
exactly.
And,

421
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:51,140
and that means,
it means,

422
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,400
like what I was saying before,
the facts support the theory.

423
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,620
Okay,
and here is going to the land.

424
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,110
That's the theory you will inherit.
That's the theory.

425
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,530
And the facts don't support it.
That's a fun.

426
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,240
Okay.
The earth doesn't support you.

427
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,410
The earth doesn't give you sustenance to
make it reality.

428
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,730
It doesn't give you matter.

429
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,780
Yeah.
It gives you at that in Egypt,

430
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:18,781
and I mean his wife is separate 
essentially because he lies about her.

431
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,800
But then it's so strange because.
So he tells the federal and the Pharaohs

432
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:26,740
man that his wife is actually a sister.
That's Sarah.

433
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,550
Sarah,
is that how you say that changes?

434
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:35,551
The name is actually his sister and 
that's to protect them and so the 

435
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:41,461
Pharaoh takes sariah and then it can 
isolate something.

436
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,020
You bet there is

437
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,600
meaning to all of those things.
There's a meaning to it.

438
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,360
Okay,
so the idea is that when facts,

439
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,120
facts,
support the theory,

440
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,850
okay?
When,

441
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,400
when the flesh supports the identity or 
the matters,

442
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,170
heaven.
Earth supports having things are square.

443
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Okay?
That's just the traditional way of 

444
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,601
understanding.
That basically means that what you see 

445
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:06,730
is what you get.
Okay?

446
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,980
It's,
it's truth.

447
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,330
Things are true.
That's the definition of meaning matches

448
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:16,260
fact.
It's true when pragmatic definition.

449
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,850
Yeah.
When,

450
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,500
when the other side happens,
then things are around there.

451
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,750
They're cyclical.
Okay.

452
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,040
And it's.
It's.

453
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,730
It's essentially,
it's time.

454
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,310
It's space and time.
That's what it is.

455
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,540
Okay?
One of them.

456
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,410
You're falling into time.
Things are not square.

457
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,760
That means things do not.
The meaning doesn't mask the fact.

458
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:40,530
That's why it's all lies.
Okay?

459
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,680
When they go into exile,
it's all about lies and it's all about 

460
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,140
dreaming,
okay?

461
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:52,270
Because they are in that domain.
They're in a domain where meaning in 

462
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,781
fact doesn't match.
So everything happens through lies and 

463
00:25:56,781 --> 00:26:00,530
deception and even the whole idea of 
saying,

464
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,750
my wife is my sister,
but that represents a cyclical paradox 

465
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,500
that's supposed to happen.
Well,

466
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:11,870
why cyclical?
Um,

467
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,790
you're a parent has a son and a daughter
and they get married.

468
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,610
It's like a regression.
Okay?

469
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,780
It's like you're,
you're producing different things and 

470
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,571
then you're joining them back together 
and that's supposed to join back 

471
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:34,200
together because when you joined them 
back together,

472
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,000
it's like you're going,
you're regressing.

473
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,430
When you,
when you build something,

474
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,470
you start from principal and you develop
it.

475
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,410
Okay?
You make specializations.

476
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,030
That principle,
when you start to mix them up again,

477
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,480
it's like a regression.
You're,

478
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,730
you're going back to something more 
primitive than before.

479
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,560
How do you see that in relationship to 
Abraham's insistence that surgery,

480
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,610
his,
his,

481
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,160
his,
his sister.

482
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,150
Sister.
Yeah.

483
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,190
Because you're not supposed to marry 
your sister.

484
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,960
And I'm not saying that as a moralistic 
thing even though it becomes one,

485
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,350
but the reason you shouldn't marry your 
sister is because you're undoing the 

486
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,260
work.
The specializations is that your,

487
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,410
your,
your father or your mother Ha have 

488
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:26,570
created.
It's like going back,

489
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,660
it's like regressing,
so like if you married your father or 

490
00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:35,240
your mother or depending,
you're going back,

491
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,460
it's a cycle.
You're not speaking to that because it's

492
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:41,990
like your annihilating something that 
was specified.

493
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,420
Hey look,
I'll give you an example of like an 

494
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,420
imagery of that that's pretty important 
in,

495
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,340
in,
in the story of the flood,

496
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,430
there are traditions that the giants 
created.

497
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:54,440
Hybrids.
Okay.

498
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,260
Yep.
One of the things that giants like to do

499
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,020
is create hybrids.
They are hybrids themselves,

500
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,440
but they created hybrids.
They took the species and they confuse 

501
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,870
them back into who knows what.
Okay,

502
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,110
and that's very significant because it 
actually means that you are regressing 

503
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,530
in it confused manner.
Okay.

504
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,130
That there's a connection between the 
flood and what I just said,

505
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:27,190
making hybrids and causing the flood.
It's actually considered one in the same

506
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:27,650
thing.

507
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,460
Does that make sense?
It makes some sense.

508
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,220
Yeah.
It's about returning to confusion.

509
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,900
Yep.
Look,

510
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,070
I'll say it this way.
Adam named the animals had an adam named

511
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,930
the animals.
God asked Adam to names and it.

512
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,940
It's his first job in the universe,
so he's asking him to specify different 

513
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,850
things that are all,
all have the same source,

514
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,260
the same as you differentiate.
That's the idea of incarnating a 

515
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,230
principle into practice yet 
differentiated.

516
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,320
Okay?
Now,

517
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:08,321
if you reverse that process,
you're going back to a more primitive 

518
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:13,451
level.
You're going back to the flood because 

519
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:13,451
the flood is the most primitive thing 
in,

520
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,100
in that cosmology,
right?

521
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,770
It starts with a flooded world.
That means everything's in confusion.

522
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,580
So what'd you have to do is specify 
things out,

523
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,400
but if you go back,
does that make sense?

524
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,070
So let,
let me,

525
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,970
let me reformulate that and tell you 
what popped into mind.

526
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Alright?
So God gives Abraham the word and then 

527
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,610
Abraham follows it and God manifests 
himself more completely to Abraham.

528
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,190
And then what happens?
Abraham is twofold.

529
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,880
He ends up in a barren land,
so nature rebels,

530
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,300
and he also ends up in a tyranny,
right?

531
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:52,960
Because he is not only,
not only does the land not produced,

532
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:55,630
so it's in a famine,
but Egypt eventually.

533
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,780
Egypt is generally speaking,
assemble for for tyranny throughout the 

534
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,940
initial parts of the Old Testament.
I mean you see that with the Pharaoh,

535
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:08,941
for example,
and the symbolism in the mosaic story 

536
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:09,040
of,
of the,

537
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,950
of Egypt always being associated with 
stone instead of water,

538
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,200
and so you could say that God gives 
Abraham the command to move forward,

539
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,770
but he has to contend with the 
intransigent sea of nature which rejects

540
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,770
him because there was a famine and then 
he becomes subjugate some.

541
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,040
It becomes subject to both tyranny and 
deceit,

542
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,170
and so,
okay,

543
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,260
c,
two,

544
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,740
c,
any are a look.

545
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,080
Okay,
I'll say it this way.

546
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,310
It's more about the tyranny,
okay?

547
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,690
But the thing is,
when you're not in charge,

548
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,000
I mean there's a tyranny.
That's it.

549
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,130
When you're you or whoever you identify 
with is not in charge,

550
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,150
you're a slave to some other principle,
right?

551
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,060
You're embodying some other wheel that's
not you.

552
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,940
I mean,
that's tyranny,

553
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,500
right?
So,

554
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,830
right.
In that sense,

555
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,930
it's really directly relate to the idea 
of tyranny.

556
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,550
You serving strangers,

557
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,620
right?

558
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,780
It says it all.

559
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,930
So motivates.
That also motivates Abraham's deception,

560
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:18,931
right?
Because he's terrified that the 

561
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:18,931
strangers that he's serving will kill 
him.

562
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:19,840
Yeah.
For his wife,

563
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,990
for his wife,
and that's why he likes it.

564
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,270
He's afraid that he's going to be 
treated very badly.

565
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,490
Yeah.
Because he doesn't want strangers to 

566
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,720
have his wife.
His wife is like the earth.

567
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:37,810
His wife is how he will incarnate,
can self or express itself in the world.

568
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,670
He's like the seed and the wife is like 
the,

569
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,120
the,
the earth,

570
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,030
something like that.
So she's the.

571
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:52,090
She is like his earth.
It's like a major version of heaven and 

572
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,720
earth.
The male is,

573
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,200
is,
is,

574
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,250
is the heaven and the female is the 
earth.

575
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,040
In that case,
that's the whole idea.

576
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,850
He's not in charge of facts anymore.
That includes his wife,

577
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,960
that ingredients.
So he doesn't want other men,

578
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:11,020
other principals to control his wife.
Right.

579
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,050
Does that make sense?

580
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:12,950
Yes.
Well,

581
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:16,520
it also,
it also seems to me that because he's,

582
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,880
the land isn't fruitful for him and 
because he's serving strangers in a 

583
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:26,981
strange land,
he's also correct to be afraid for the 

584
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:27,470
loss of his wife.

585
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,020
Yeah.
And how does he get out of it?

586
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:35,850
By being deceitful,
because he's in the cycle is in that.

587
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,400
I mean are you supposed to be truthful?
Your adversary usually know,

588
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,250
especially when your editor series 
hostile and if you're an enemy 

589
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,581
territory,
your morality changes because all of a 

590
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:54,500
sudden it's not about being truthful,
it's about surviving.

591
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:59,501
It's about.
It's like the most primitive existence 

592
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:03,761
there is.
The more primitive states of existence 

593
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:05,210
are more about the seat than about 
truth.

594
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,680
It's an advance.
It's an advanced state to talk about 

595
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,000
truth.
It's when we all agree,

596
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:16,330
we all agree on at least something,
but before that it's every man or woman 

597
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,530
for him or herself.
It's all about the seat.

598
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,490
It's all about survival.

599
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,060
Okay?
Okay,

600
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:26,061
so now.
Now the next thing that happens 

601
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:28,430
essentially is that the pharaoh gets 
played and he's wondering why.

602
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,460
So because.
So the story indicates that the Pharaoh 

603
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,840
has broken some natural law,
let's say,

604
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:40,260
or some divine law and things go very 
badly for him.

605
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:45,261
And then he discovers,
I don't remember how he discovers that 

606
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,850
he's taken.

607
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,820
I think it,
it doesn't say how it's right.

608
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,890
And,
and he discovers that he's taken Sarah,

609
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,900
but Sarah is Abraham's wife.
And so then the pharaoh gives Abraham 

610
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,990
all sorts of goods and sends him on his 
way.

611
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,730
Okay.
So that's also quite confusing.

612
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:07,420
So Abraham is rewarded for his decision.

613
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,590
Ill ill gotten goods.
Yeah.

614
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,260
Right.
It'll go.

615
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Good.
That's part of her story is interesting 

616
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,070
because you also see,
I think in not account,

617
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,250
some of the complexity that's embedded 
in the old testament accounts is that 

618
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,170
it's not a simple morality tale.
It by any stretch of the imagination.

619
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,520
You especially see that in the Abrahamic
accounts because it's Jacob who who so 

620
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,030
deceitful with Esol.
I mean,

621
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,460
Nissan comes off.
I mean he's,

622
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,530
he's gone.
He's gone out unconscious.

623
00:34:40,531 --> 00:34:41,790
Esau.
Yeah.

624
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,840
He gives things up too easily.
He's too easily deceived and he's a bit 

625
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,501
primitive.
I guess he's a bit too primitive in a 

626
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:51,501
bit too naive,
something like that.

627
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:56,000
But Jacob plays and Rachel place some 
really nasty tricks on him and yet they 

628
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,600
come out ahead.
Yeah.

629
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,040
And so that's also a very difficult 
thing to contend with.

630
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,260
Well,
there's,

631
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,150
there's this idea,
at least in,

632
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:07,040
in,
in traditional interpretation,

633
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,100
there's this idea that in Esol is 
actually supposed to be that the key it 

634
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,830
should be the only reason he isn't is 
because there's something wrong.

635
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:23,120
That's pretty much describe the whole 
Bible in its entirety.

636
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,990
The there's,
there's the theory and the fact the fact

637
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,970
is supposed to be king.
Okay.

638
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:33,080
Do you know what I mean by that?
Like at matter is king it,

639
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,600
that's what it's supposed to be,
but it's not.

640
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,940
And the whole,
all the stories are about redeeming.

641
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,740
Redeeming that problem,
taking care of that problem.

642
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,290
It's like the facts don't match the 
theory.

643
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,530
We have to redeem the facts.
That's,

644
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,570
that's pretty much all the stories in 
the Bible are about that and that's 

645
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,920
pretty much what lock represents in the 
story of Abraham as well.

646
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,430
Okay.
You represents a material reality.

647
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:08,940
He represents facts,
but there's something wrong with it.

648
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,180
Let's go into the large story now.
So.

649
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:16,181
Okay,
so Abraham leaves and I believe he 

650
00:36:16,181 --> 00:36:19,601
leaves with lot and,
and lot also becomes quite wealthy and 

651
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:25,220
they go back to where Abraham had built 
the altar initially,

652
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,910
but lot large men and Abraham's men 
start to fight so they decide they're 

653
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:36,640
going to separate and they basically do 
that somewhat arbitrarily could,

654
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:40,180
could have gone either way,
but a lot ends up going to sort them.

655
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,690
Well actually there is something you 
should be aware of.

656
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:51,150
Well that's the thing.
A lot of the stories in the Bible are 

657
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,220
based on a really ancient way of 
thinking that we don't really following 

658
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:00,710
you more.
But I mean in the Bible there is a 

659
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,710
reason why,
um,

660
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,470
the directions of the travels that 
they're not just random,

661
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:09,471
like Egypt represents the earth.
And um,

662
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:13,890
what's the name of the city?
What's the name of the place of both her

663
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:16,770
and I think the place where he goes to 
meet.

664
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,530
I'm leaving.
Uh,

665
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,610
it's in the north.
Okay.

666
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:21,270
I,
I'm not,

667
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,420
I'm not sure I remember the name of 
this.

668
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:27,421
See,
I think it's Iran that represents 

669
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:27,421
heaven.
Okay.

670
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:27,660
And there's a reason.
It's not just arbitrary,

671
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:32,661
it's because Egypt is south and south is
going down.

672
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,140
Right.
We still say that when,

673
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:36,870
when,
when you say that someone's gone south,

674
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,630
we say that means that they've gone to 
seed or they've gone down.

675
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,140
Yeah.
So,

676
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:44,350
so in the Bible,
and especially in Genesis,

677
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:46,240
especially in finances,
um,

678
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,990
the south represents the earth and the 
north represents that happens.

679
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,130
Okay.
And like I said,

680
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:56,131
it's not arbitrary it,
it corresponds to the geography of the 

681
00:37:56,131 --> 00:37:59,671
region.
One of them goes uphill and the other 

682
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:00,130
one goes downhill.
And the north there's mountains,

683
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:05,340
snowy mountains.
In the south there's a Egypt which is 

684
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,380
like the low,
a low place and yeah.

685
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,180
Right.
So north literally is up.

686
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,010
Yeah.
It's not a metaphor.

687
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,340
Yeah.
Literally is close going,

688
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:14,170
getting closer to heaven and the other 
one going into the earth.

689
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,740
So when they go and excited to Egypt 
there,

690
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,870
it's actually means they're going into 
the earth.

691
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,670
It's like a descent into the earth.
So it's like death.

692
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:29,730
It's death and they say it a few times 
in the book of Genesis it talk about 

693
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,810
your,
it's like dying.

694
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,300
Going it,
going to Egypt is like a death.

695
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,480
Okay,
so then now.

696
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:42,510
So then we moved to the story of the 
strangers.

697
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:47,210
Right.
Weight,

698
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:52,220
not who you were going to say,
why the separation of the land with lot 

699
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:52,720
and uh,
and Abraham.

700
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,430
Yes.
Right.

701
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,320
The idea is that lot takes the,
the,

702
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,240
the south,
right.

703
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,180
And then Abraham.

704
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,910
Yeah.
That was the whole point of that.

705
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:05,911
Yeah,
a lot as a reason why he takes the 

706
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,510
south.
It's the lowest place on Earth Sodom and

707
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,100
Gomorrah that,
that place.

708
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,940
It's the lowest place.
Okay.

709
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,120
So literally the lowest place on earth,
right?

710
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,180
I'm not sure about.
I know.

711
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,230
I don't know.
I think that region actually is the 

712
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,560
lowest place on earth,
but in the story that that's how,

713
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,350
that's what it means.
It means it's the lowest plates.

714
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,780
So it's a place that's farthest away 
from heaven.

715
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,040
Yeah,
it's the,

716
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,160
it's the idea that Milton develops with 
regards to Satan when he's thrown from 

717
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,751
heaven because the hell that Satan 
inhabits is the furthest possible away 

718
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:42,490
from heaven.
That's how it's defined essentially.

719
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,450
Yeah.

720
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,880
Yeah.
It's like a journey into the earth.

721
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,570
It's,
it's the same as,

722
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:51,590
um,
it needs the same thing as,

723
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:56,591
as falling asleep,
exiled and sleep are the same in the 

724
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:56,980
Bible.
Sleep is,

725
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,400
is a form of exile.
Exactly.

726
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,730
So,
so the next thing that happens is that 

727
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,580
we get the first warning about Sodom and
Gomorrah.

728
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,400
Yep.

729
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,240
That's just a very brief sentence.
It's like a foreshadowing.

730
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,820
And then the next thing that happens is 
that there's an episode where there is a

731
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:23,821
war among kings and the kings,
if I remember correctly,

732
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:29,281
it's the King of Sodom takes a lot and 
Abraham has to go rescue him.

733
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,460
Actually,
I think it's the other way around.

734
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,200
I think it's things from the north.
They come down and uh,

735
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,460
take Sodom and Gomorrah and lot is part 
of that.

736
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,400
And so is the king.
The King of Sodom and Gomorrah.

737
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,270
They have to flee.

738
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,690
That's what I remember.
Do they flee with,

739
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,220
do they flee with lot?

740
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,740
No.
Law is taken by these chains from the 

741
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,221
north and I'm the King of Sodom.
I think hides or something like that.

742
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,340
Fleece

743
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,320
the king,
the King of Sodom at the end gives gifts

744
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:11,920
to Abraham to thank him that he rescued.
Yes,

745
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,660
that's right.
So what happens is that,

746
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,980
yeah,
it says in and it came to pass in the 

747
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:18,980
days of Amarillo,
Elle,

748
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:18,980
king of Shinar,
et Cetera,

749
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,581
that these made war with Barbara,
King of Sodom and with Burger King of 

750
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:23,860
Gomorrah,
et Cetera,

751
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,250
and these were all joined together in 
the veil of cinnamon,

752
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,710
which is in the old seat,
which is the salt seat,

753
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,880
so I presume that would be the Dead Sea 
and that would be the low point that 

754
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,050
you're describing is the dead seat.
That's pretty interesting.

755
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,100
And the veil of cinema was full of slime
pits and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah

756
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:50,171
fled and fell there,
and they took away all the goods of 

757
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:53,351
Sodom and Gomorrah and older victuals,
and they took lot Abram's brother's son 

758
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:57,401
who dealt in,
dwelt in Sodom and his goods and 

759
00:41:57,401 --> 00:41:57,401
departed.
So

760
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,280
you can really see this whole geography 
that matthew is talking about.

761
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,390
When they say that Sodom and Gomorrah,
they had to flee and fall into pits.

762
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:10,420
It's almost like they're laying it out 
for us that they had to almost kind of 

763
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,630
go even further down into the earth,
the hide from these,

764
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,470
these,
uh,

765
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,650
these invaders of the north that are 
coming to take their land.

766
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:17,590
So.
Okay.

767
00:42:17,591 --> 00:42:22,510
So Abraham goes and rescues lot and he 
does not successfully.

768
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,490
And the Ndaa also,
there's,

769
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,670
there's kings,
but he.

770
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,390
Did he freeze as far as I can tell?
Yeah,

771
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:38,210
probably.
Then the kings wanted to reward him and 

772
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:41,630
Abraham says to the King of Sodom and he
doesn't want any reward.

773
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,140
And the reason he doesn't want any 
reward except for what is men have 

774
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,291
equal.
He doesn't want any reward because I 

775
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:53,690
will not take anything that is thein 
lest thou should say I have made Abraham

776
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:58,691
rich save only that which the young men 
have eaten and the portion of men which 

777
00:42:58,691 --> 00:43:02,801
went with me and it looks.
See God has already promised Abraham 

778
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:11,111
everything in some sense.
And it looks like he doesn't want to 

779
00:43:11,111 --> 00:43:14,531
take anything at Abraham.
Doesn't want to take anything from 

780
00:43:14,531 --> 00:43:17,381
anyone else because what would it do?
Would it interfere with the purity of 

781
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:20,220
his accomplishments?
Something like that.

782
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,350
Yeah.
Well,

783
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,780
I,
I don't know for certain because,

784
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:26,150
um,
that's just a line I guess,

785
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:27,440
but in the,
in the story,

786
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:32,441
I mean,
it's not that much of a big part of the 

787
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:33,710
story,
but the way I see it is I think he says,

788
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:37,970
I don't want to take even this shoe lash
to latch for me.

789
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:42,971
Okay.
So there's a reason why he says that 

790
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:45,400
because the shoe is the lowest part is 
the lowest clothing,

791
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,930
right?
It's on the feet.

792
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:53,470
So it's all related to the idea that the
earth needs to be redeemed.

793
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,160
Need,
needs to be rectified.

794
00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:00,430
And it in that situation,
it's not like he's not allowed to accept

795
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,650
it.
It's the same thing is not eating the 

796
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,391
forbidden fruit.
There are things in the world that are 

797
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:10,061
poisonous to humans.
We can't eat them because they don't 

798
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:12,410
agree with,
are our patterns,

799
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,250
our,
our,

800
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,300
our,
our mind.

801
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:19,750
So if you eat poison,
you go into that place where things 

802
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:23,420
don't agree,
your mind and your body don't agree.

803
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:24,140
I mean,
if you,

804
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:25,790
if you,
if you take,

805
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,030
if you drink alcohol,
um,

806
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,480
that takes you into the where your mind 
and your body don't agree.

807
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:40,190
The theory doesn't match the fact and 
then you go into that whole confusion.

808
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:42,180
Yes.
Those,

809
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,570
could it be that when,
when,

810
00:44:43,571 --> 00:44:44,470
um,
he doesn't,

811
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,220
he doesn't want to take from Sodom 
because Sodom is already what we know 

812
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,220
saw them to be.
I mean,

813
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,931
it already represents kind of the,
the land that can't hold and will be 

814
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:54,931
burned off.

815
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:56,270
Yeah.
It's something he can,

816
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,680
he can integrate something.
It's like,

817
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,640
that's why I said the forbidden fruit.
You don't want to eat.

818
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,210
You don't want to accept mattered that 
you can't handle,

819
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:10,330
that you can integrate.
So there's something in that place that 

820
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:16,030
he doesn't know how to deal with,
what to do with it and he doesn't want 

821
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,510
his riches to come from that place.

822
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:22,590
He doesn't write,
he doesn't want his riches to come from 

823
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:22,590
that place because it would compromise 
them

824
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,970
because he doesn't know how to deal with
it yet.

825
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,450
Maybe someday he will.
That's right.

826
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,870
That's the whole idea.
And actually,

827
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:35,050
here's an interpretation,
lot represents that place that will one 

828
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:39,340
day be redeemed.
Okay?

829
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,480
The reason why they talk about lots so 
much in the story of Abraham is because 

830
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,540
he represents King David.
He is the ancestor of the nation that 

831
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,610
will give rise to King David.
Okay?

832
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,100
It's like a secondary story within the 
story,

833
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,930
but it's like a.
it's meant to be interpreted in terms of

834
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:04,931
a future redemption of that place that 
he can handle,

835
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,280
that Abraham couldn't handle at that 
time.

836
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:12,320
And that place will be redeemed.
I'm giving you a lot of tradition here,

837
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:14,660
but this is what I would.
I would,

838
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,820
I've learned.
It's King David.

839
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,010
Okay.
It's the future king.

840
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:23,040
Okay.
So the whole story of luck is about King

841
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:23,780
David.
Well,

842
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:28,890
and of course Lord is Abraham's 
descendants as well because he's his 

843
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:28,890
nephew.
Yeah.

844
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,700
So Abraham's nephew descends into the 
lowest place essentially.

845
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:34,880
Yeah.
Well,

846
00:46:34,881 --> 00:46:37,730
look it,
the story that starts out pretty clear,

847
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:41,810
it starts out there's three sons to a 
tear up.

848
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,190
One of them is harass.
The other one's not horror.

849
00:46:46,191 --> 00:46:48,020
And the other one's Abraham.
Okay?

850
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,890
Heroin dies.
That's how the story starts.

851
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:57,690
That's like the beginning of this story 
is Aaron dies and he has a son called 

852
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:00,050
lot.
See,

853
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,420
that's what I was it.
The idea is it's the same idea.

854
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:09,440
The son of this heroin,
he represents death.

855
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:14,470
He represents the thing we can't handle.
You represents the material facts that 

856
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:20,710
we can explain with the,
with our theories or with our identity 

857
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,130
is the thing we is the matter.
We can't handle it.

858
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,600
And that's why in the story starts with 
he dies the father of lot dice.

859
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,760
It a

860
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:35,420
lot represents some fact that we cannot 
correctly,

861
00:47:35,421 --> 00:47:35,490
okay

862
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:40,550
integrate into our universe.
This could be interpreted in so many 

863
00:47:42,181 --> 00:47:44,080
different levels.
But um,

864
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,430
that's basically what it is.
I don't know if that makes sense,

865
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,870
but the idea the.
I mean,

866
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:52,650
the idea is that I think we need to see 
it.

867
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:57,710
The idea is that an orphan or a widow,
that's what they always represent.

868
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,210
They represent something that have lost 
their,

869
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:03,010
their principle that unifies them.
They're here.

870
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,150
They're kind of disconnected from the 
hierarchy of the family.

871
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,300
So,
so,

872
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:10,890
so a lot losing is the fact that losing 
his father died me,

873
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:14,310
that he loses the thing that gives him 
identity and so he's like this,

874
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,450
he's like a,
a,

875
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,220
a piece of birth that is lost attachment
or last meeting or.

876
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:19,650
Well,
that,

877
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:24,080
that reminds me of what happens to know 
his son

878
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,200
who

879
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,260
sees him naked.
Yeah.

880
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,160
Right.
Yeah.

881
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,870
And,
and because,

882
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,560
because to see,
it seems to me,

883
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:37,330
I'm going to talk about this a little 
bit tonight,

884
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,950
that to see noah gets drunk and then 
which,

885
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,630
which son is that have pam ham.
Yeah.

886
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:51,130
I'm really first sees him but doesn't 
respond properly.

887
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,920
The other sons,
when they see no one naked,

888
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:58,950
they cover him up and they don't look.
And so it's like they're not exposing 

889
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,690
their fathers weakness.
His mortality is his,

890
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,880
his insufficiency,
right?

891
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:06,910
They didn't retain respect,
but ham doesn't do that.

892
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:12,410
But there's also more what matthew was 
talking about before they're in that 

893
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:16,381
story.
There's two things that are implied of 

894
00:49:16,381 --> 00:49:18,541
what matthew was talking about before,
this idea of wine that brings you into 

895
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:21,010
this cycle where causality ceases to be 
a direct.

896
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,910
And then what happened to the faction?
Yeah.

897
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:28,970
Yeah.
And the fact that he sees his father 

898
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,231
naked,
he discovers his nakedness is also a 

899
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:33,940
kind of suggestion of incest as well.
The same type,

900
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,620
the same type of,
of,

901
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,420
of inappropriate causality that you see 
in the story of the two,

902
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:40,930
of,
uh,

903
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:44,010
of uh,
Abraham's sister marrying his sister,

904
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,500
luck with his two daughters,
two daughters.

905
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:47,680
Right?

906
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,630
So it's transgression.
It gets some funding.

907
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,420
Transgression against some fundamental 
boundary.

908
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,110
Yeah.
Against the,

909
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,480
the hierarchical relationship.
And have a family,

910
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,900
right?
Yeah.

911
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,390
You're not supposed to make loops.
It's a tree.

912
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,190
You're not supposed to make loops in a 
tree.

913
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,280
So you can say like that.
It's really simple and that's supposed 

914
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,940
to regress and I supposed to.
You produce things,

915
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,340
you're not supposed to turn back on 
yourself.

916
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,020
You're not supposed to go back.

917
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:23,340
So,
so maybe that's why lot's wife has 

918
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:23,340
turned into a pillar of salt

919
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,920
because she lives back,
right?

920
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,240
Yeah,
exactly.

921
00:50:26,241 --> 00:50:27,040
Yeah.
It has to do it.

922
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,310
Looking back to the mental

923
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:29,360
and,
and,

924
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:31,010
uh,
and,

925
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:35,240
and pines for something that it was 
terrible.

926
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,520
It shouldn't have been.
And so,

927
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,380
and she's commanded not to look back 
once you,

928
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:43,460
once you escape from that catastrophe,
you don't get to be nostalgic for it.

929
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:48,590
And the same thing happens in the story 
of Moses because what happens to the 

930
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,630
Israelites when they were out in the 
desert is they start to become nostalgic

931
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,460
for Egypt,
for the tyranny.

932
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,530
Right.
And that's also,

933
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:57,320
I think when God starts to send 
poisonous snakes among them,

934
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,270
because right though,
don't they,

935
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:04,271
they,
they start to pine for Egypt and 

936
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:04,760
complain about Moses and then they start
to worship other idols.

937
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,920
So that's part of that confusion that 
you were talking about.

938
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,160
And then God gets irritated and throws a
bunch of poisonous snakes in there to 

939
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,160
give them a good chomping.

940
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:17,050
Yep.
So that's the snakes come as a result of

941
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,490
them wanting to go back.

942
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

943
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:21,700
Well,
right.

944
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,490
That makes perfect sense.
So,

945
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,120
and you see that nostalgia for tyranny.
You know,

946
00:51:27,121 --> 00:51:30,550
you see that the Soviet Union in Russia 
right now with regards to stolen.

947
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,400
And so the question,
the question is,

948
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:40,401
I think this is one of the things that 
I'm the guy who wrote the disappearance 

949
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:44,121
of God mentioned this.
Do you want to be well fed as a slave or

950
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:48,150
hungry and freedom,
something like that.

951
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:49,530
And the choice.
Well,

952
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:52,450
fed as a slave is not a good choice.
Yeah.

953
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,110
So,
okay,

954
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,530
now.
So when Jonathan,

955
00:51:55,531 --> 00:52:00,531
you and I talked a fair bit about the 
story of Abraham and the strangers 

956
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,390
before.
So I'm.

957
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,760
So God decides to reward Abraham and he 
tells him that just like he told him 

958
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,230
before,
but he repeats it,

959
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:17,260
that he's going to be the founder of a 
nation and he,

960
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,660
and he tells them that Sarah is going to
bear a child.

961
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,140
And Sarah of course is not.
Doesn't believe that.

962
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,800
Let's see.
Let me,

963
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,140
let me just find this here.
Yeah.

964
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:40,400
Yes.
Okay.

965
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:43,580
So that's what happens is,
is that God's God,

966
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,330
God's word comes into Abraham in a 
vision.

967
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,380
So what's the word again?
Saying that his reward will be great and

968
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:54,920
that he's going to be the father of 
nations,

969
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,310
but he doesn't have any children.
And so isn't that when he takes

970
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,140
you take Sarah's servant,
Hagar?

971
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,520
Yeah.
And,

972
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,820
and that gives rise to Ishmael.
And it wasn't until later that Sarah is 

973
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:15,991
informed that she's sorry that he went 
fancy your question.

974
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:19,460
She wants one.

975
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:24,510
Answer your question.
I'd be curious to know what she has 

976
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,120
found you.

977
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,260
She closed her down.
Yeah,

978
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:29,900
I know.
It was pretty strange.

979
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:31,010
Intermission there.
So.

980
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:31,970
Okay.
So,

981
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:37,270
so Abraham has to take kind of a detour 
in order to have a child and he lays 

982
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:40,270
with Hagar and Hagar,
uh,

983
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:45,260
we don't know much about her,
but she gets he right away and starts to

984
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,680
despise Sarah.
And Sarah actually beats her as far as I

985
00:53:52,911 --> 00:53:57,911
can tell.
It says Sarah delk hardly with her and 

986
00:53:57,911 --> 00:53:59,800
then Hagar fleets.
And she ends up by A.

987
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:00,860
Well,
we're an angel.

988
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,820
Appears to her.
And uh,

989
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:10,180
the angel tells her that her son,
her child is going to be the father of 

990
00:54:12,431 --> 00:54:15,920
the nation as well.
So,

991
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:23,230
so the first question might be,
why is it that Abraham,

992
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:29,890
at this point in the story,
why is it necessary for the story that 

993
00:54:29,901 --> 00:54:32,390
Abraham takes a detour and has a child 
with Hagar?

994
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,230
What do you think that signifies?

995
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,300
It's,
it's,

996
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,120
it's always the same problem in the 
Bible.

997
00:54:40,121 --> 00:54:45,121
It's always,
it starts with confusion and it has to 

998
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:51,351
develop towards something that is clear.
So you're saying that yourself,

999
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:53,400
when you say detour?
Yeah,

1000
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:54,960
it's a detour.
Exactly.

1001
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,290
That's exactly what it is.
It's a detour.

1002
00:54:59,650 --> 00:54:59,980
Great.

1003
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:02,990
That's not necessary,
but it happens.

1004
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,820
Does that make sense?
Well,

1005
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:11,060
D two is teach.
Detours are the doors are things that 

1006
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:11,060
are not necessary,
but at the end

1007
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:14,820
there's something also in that detour,
the fact that he gives birth to Ishmael,

1008
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:20,010
which has to do with this,
this turning because God kind of 

1009
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:23,731
promises that Ishmael is going to come 
back and he's going to be a big problem 

1010
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:28,651
for you.
He's going to be a father of a great 

1011
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:30,661
nation,
but he's going to be a big problem for 

1012
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:30,661
you later.
Like it's going to be.

1013
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,380
There's going to be fighting between 
between your sons basically.

1014
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,920
Yeah.
There's that idea.

1015
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:35,730
Yeah,
of course.

1016
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,310
I don't know if it's in that story,
but

1017
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,100
yeah.
Well,

1018
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:44,130
it seems to be associated with an idea 
that you might take about as success of 

1019
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:47,510
approximation to an ideal.
No.

1020
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:52,550
So one of the things that that I've 
conceptualized sort of visually is,

1021
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,930
and this is associated with the idea of 
Jupiter wishing on a star.

1022
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:03,390
It was so what's your who does when he 
wants to facilitate the transformation 

1023
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,891
of Nokia was lifted his eyes up to the 
highest thing that he can conceive of 

1024
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,960
and Orient Yourself with that.
But the thing is is that as you move 

1025
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,950
through life,
let's say you're oriented by the highest

1026
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:16,140
thing you can conceive of,
but as you move towards it,

1027
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:21,380
you transform and then and your 
conceptualization of what's the highest 

1028
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:26,210
shifts as you transform.
So you're aiming at the highest thing 

1029
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:29,820
but,
but your perhaps your ability to 

1030
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,670
conceptualize what's the highest thing 
develops as you move towards it.

1031
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,530
And so what that means in practice is 
that you do take detours because you aim

1032
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:40,770
at something,
but you're aim is off and you move 

1033
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,710
towards it and then you get to a point 
where you can correct your aim.

1034
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,870
And so it's not like you've made a 
mistake.

1035
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:45,400
Exactly.
It's,

1036
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:48,880
you're farther ahead than you were and 
you've corrected your aim,

1037
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,300
but your aim wasn't.
You weren't aiming at exactly the right 

1038
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:54,300
thing to begin with.

1039
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:54,520
Yeah.
And so

1040
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:57,030
yeah,
go ahead.

1041
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,100
Well,
maybe that's what's happening to Abraham

1042
00:56:59,101 --> 00:57:00,150
is that,
you know,

1043
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:05,570
you could almost say,
I don't know if Ishmael is a practice 

1044
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:06,210
run,
something like that.

1045
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,070
So.
All right,

1046
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:13,140
so then you were going to,
you matthew,

1047
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,460
you were to say something about that.

1048
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,320
Oh yeah,
I was going to say that

1049
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,800
exiled in the Bible.
Um,

1050
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:27,910
there's always a reason for it,
but it's not necessarily a logical 

1051
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:28,860
reason.
It's,

1052
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,950
it's,
it's just like what you described.

1053
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,120
You think,
you know,

1054
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:37,121
something,
you think you'd know what you're aiming 

1055
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:37,121
at.
You think you know what you want,

1056
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,800
you think you know what you're doing.
Something happens that you didn't plan.

1057
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,620
That doesn't look like it's part of what
you were aiming.

1058
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,600
It makes you take a detour.
Well,

1059
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,490
this,
this site is all about detours.

1060
00:57:46,491 --> 00:57:49,040
It's all about turning around.
You don't know where you're going.

1061
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,720
You're lost.
So,

1062
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,730
but in the end it,
it brings about something that maybe you

1063
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:57,480
weren't even aiming at in the,
in the,

1064
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:02,490
in the first place.
What might be better than what you were 

1065
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:03,680
in yet in the first place.
So it's not all bad.

1066
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:08,681
So I think that's the idea.
The idea of the whole idea of exile is 

1067
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:14,171
that there it renews your plans,

1068
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,870
right?
If you don't die,

1069
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,630
yeah.
If you don't die,

1070
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,570
yeah.
Even if you do die,

1071
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:26,610
it renews your planning.
Okay,

1072
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,130
so now.

1073
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:32,450
Sure.
Now the next thing that happens is that 

1074
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:36,090
the strangers come to visit Abraham and 
he treats them hospitably and so now we 

1075
00:58:39,161 --> 00:58:44,050
might say that that's an indication of 
his increasing alignment with the good.

1076
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:49,770
Maybe that's one way of thinking about 
it because he does right by the stranger

1077
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,270
and one of the consequences of that is 
that the angels,

1078
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:56,860
I guess we find out that there are 
angels.

1079
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:02,130
Tell him that Sarah is going to give 
birth to someone and Abraham finds that 

1080
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:07,531
very difficult to believe.
It's Sarah finds it so difficult to 

1081
00:59:07,531 --> 00:59:07,531
believe that she actually laughs about 
it.

1082
00:59:07,531 --> 00:59:08,440
She overhears it,
she laughs about it,

1083
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,210
but,
but he,

1084
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,840
he has the strangers,
he feeds them.

1085
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,230
He has them wash their feet,
if I remember correctly.

1086
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:19,480
And um,
anyways,

1087
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:24,481
he treats them hospitably at well and 
there's a blessing as a consequence of 

1088
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:28,421
that.
And that's something we talked about a 

1089
00:59:28,421 --> 00:59:30,491
fair bit,
Jonathan when we were talking about the 

1090
00:59:30,491 --> 00:59:31,670
things that doesn't fit in categories.
Yeah.

1091
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:32,840
The Stranger.
Yeah.

1092
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:38,410
Which is that invitation to chaos as 
well that you were talking about 

1093
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:41,381
matthew,
because the stranger is while the thing 

1094
00:59:41,381 --> 00:59:44,711
that you can be subjugated to,
but also something that will bring 

1095
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:47,081
something new and potentially disruptive
but also potentially beneficial.

1096
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:52,450
And so then the idea there is whether or
not the stranger is disruptive or 

1097
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:56,420
beneficial depends to a large degree on 
how you treat the stranger.

1098
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,130
And that strikes me as very,
very possible.

1099
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:06,131
I mean,
that's the one thing that that's one of 

1100
01:00:06,131 --> 01:00:06,470
the things that has really entered my 
imagination as a clinician.

1101
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:12,160
Now,
if you're approached by someone who's 

1102
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,460
very in chaos,
the consequence of that is very 

1103
01:00:15,921 --> 01:00:20,921
dependent on how you interact with them 
because it can go any way and they're 

1104
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:25,331
not really in control because there are 
so chaotic and so if you're careful and 

1105
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:29,600
awake,
you can keep things moving in the proper

1106
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:34,601
direction and maybe even benefit from it
and that's Kinda like the idea of 

1107
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:41,170
walking with God because one of the 
reasons that no one gets through the 

1108
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:41,570
flood is because he is oriented 
properly.

1109
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:47,290
He's walking with God and so you could 
say that exile can.

1110
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,230
It's something like exile can expand 
you.

1111
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,680
If you stay properly oriented while 
you're in exile,

1112
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:58,510
it could fit.
It can fix your mistakes.

1113
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,790
That's part of it.
It cleans you.

1114
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:05,791
It renews you because you make mistakes 
and they become part of you and if 

1115
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,440
you're stuck with your mistakes,
you're rigid about your own estates.

1116
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,360
You need something outer to something 
that you don't know,

1117
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:16,480
something that you don't understand to 
clean your mistakes away.

1118
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,560
Yeah.
Well that's like

1119
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:20,480
the Golden Dragon Horse with the Virgin,
the Dragon Horts,

1120
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:20,980
right?
It's,

1121
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:26,380
it's,
it's the dragon represents that chaotic 

1122
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,760
would say Exxon state that drag the gold
and the and the virgin both represent 

1123
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:34,100
that which can be assimilated as a 
consequence of being in that situation.

1124
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,980
The funny thing is,
is in the hero myths going into exile on

1125
01:01:40,141 --> 01:01:43,410
purpose works way better than going into
exile accidentally.

1126
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:47,040
So that's an interesting thing.
So.

1127
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:47,640
Okay.
Okay,

1128
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:48,000
so

1129
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:54,070
can I say something about the part you 
were describing that the whole story of 

1130
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:54,890
Abraham,
if you look at the big picture,

1131
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:59,950
it's really about progressive,
a progressive Lee knowing something.

1132
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:05,350
So it started with just the voice of 
God.

1133
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,090
Go here.
It doesn't mean much goes there.

1134
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,730
Then it becomes a little more precise.
I will give you this land.

1135
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:15,380
So now it's more specific,
and then as the further he goes,

1136
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,980
the more it becomes explicit what's 
going to.

1137
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,740
So I'll give you a sudden when I don't 
know,

1138
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,610
someday it doesn't say later on it 
becomes more and more explicit,

1139
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:31,640
gay,
and he says like in the party we were 

1140
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:31,640
talking about,
he says,

1141
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,640
three men come.
These are angels as,

1142
01:02:34,641 --> 01:02:37,600
as it becomes clear later.
So this is God,

1143
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,880
right?
God sending his message in a clear 

1144
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,890
manner and it's more specific.
Then before he says,

1145
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,820
this time next year you will have it.
Sound good.

1146
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,060
So okay.
So a couple of things about that.

1147
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:57,061
So one of the things that see,
one of the ways that I've conceptualized

1148
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:02,290
the relationship between the Old 
Testament and the new testament and I,

1149
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,750
this is kind of a classic Christian 
conceptualization,

1150
01:03:04,751 --> 01:03:05,980
I think.
And it's also,

1151
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:12,150
it's also analogous to what happens to 
Moses because Moses doesn't get to the 

1152
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:12,970
promised land.
So there's this idea,

1153
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:18,370
Christian idea that the reason that 
Moses can't get to the promised land is 

1154
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,100
because he only represents the law now.
But then I thought about that.

1155
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:21,790
I thought,
well,

1156
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:27,450
one of the,
I've got to say about four stories at 

1157
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,770
the same time here at him to get the 
parallelism right.

1158
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:33,130
So the first is,
it's not so easy to speak the truth,

1159
01:03:33,131 --> 01:03:38,131
but it's fairly easy to stop light and 
so as you stop lying,

1160
01:03:38,411 --> 01:03:43,411
you get better.
You get to approximate speaking the 

1161
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:46,201
truth,
but the way you start isn't by speaking 

1162
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:46,201
the truth.

1163
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,690
The way you start is by stopping light 
and then a lot of the rules in the Old 

1164
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:53,101
Testament or prohibitions.
Here's a bunch of things you shouldn't 

1165
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:56,131
do that you might be inclined to do.
And so the idea there would be if you 

1166
01:03:56,131 --> 01:03:57,970
stopped doing all the things you know 
you shouldn't do,

1167
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,870
then you can.
Your head clears up,

1168
01:03:59,871 --> 01:04:02,590
but now so you can start to see the 
things that you should do.

1169
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:06,580
And so then in the Abrahamic story,
maybe it's something like this,

1170
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:11,740
you said you implied matthew,
that Abraham originally follow something

1171
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:16,741
like a vague and ill defined whim,
but he has enough faith to move forward 

1172
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,240
despite the fact that it's vague and ill
defined.

1173
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,940
And then as a consequence of moving 
forward,

1174
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:26,710
it becomes more and more concretized and
and differentiated and clear.

1175
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,510
Okay,
that's right man,

1176
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:29,440
because that's,
you know,

1177
01:04:29,441 --> 01:04:34,441
it's funny because the future authoring 
program we've developed sort of 

1178
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:37,441
predicated on that idea.
The first thing you do is wander around 

1179
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:41,370
in a kind of confused days,
trying to find a direction of 

1180
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:45,241
orientation and then you clarify that.
And partly you do that by continuing to 

1181
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:47,710
think about it,
but you also clarified by acting on it.

1182
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:49,600
Okay.

1183
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:54,750
Yep.
And the idea that these three men that 

1184
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,580
come visit him,
um,

1185
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,480
there's a reason why there's three.
Okay.

1186
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:00,820
It's because it,
it's,

1187
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,550
it's trying to express the idea that 
it's more expressed,

1188
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,530
it's more explicit.
It's not just the seed anymore,

1189
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,460
it's like,
it's like a branch.

1190
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,260
Okay,
you got it.

1191
01:05:11,261 --> 01:05:16,261
Okay.
You got something that looks like a 

1192
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:17,380
branch.
It's branching out into a more concrete 

1193
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:21,890
thing and at first it's just a voice.
Then it's a vision that it's actual 

1194
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:22,480
people.

1195
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,190
Okay.
Okay.

1196
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:29,310
So here's another idea.
So let's say if you're beginning to 

1197
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,860
develop morality,
you,

1198
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:40,660
you behave so that the people who share 
your morality can get along with you.

1199
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:45,400
That means you follow the rules,
but if you're dealing with strangers,

1200
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:50,401
it's a different issue because they 
aren't part of your morality and so the 

1201
01:05:50,401 --> 01:05:55,291
question then is how do you act properly
when you're not in the domain of your 

1202
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:59,191
morality,
and I always thought about that as a 

1203
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:01,890
matter moral domain and it seems to me 
that it's the domain that Christ 

1204
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:05,521
occupies because he's.
He's like the mediator between 

1205
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:09,030
morality's.
He's in no man's land and is the 

1206
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,480
mediator between moralities and if 
you're.

1207
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:13,900
If you're,
if you've oriented yourself properly,

1208
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:18,901
then you even know how to act with.
There aren't any rules and that's why 

1209
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:19,690
Abraham can act properly in relationship
to the strangers.

1210
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,590
He's awake enough so that when the 
strangers show up,

1211
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:27,630
shows up,
he can pay attention to the way they're 

1212
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:30,660
acting and could act spontaneously as a 
consequence of paying attention and 

1213
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:34,840
things go well and so the strangers 
aren't hostile.

1214
01:06:34,841 --> 01:06:36,340
They don't kill them,
they don't take his wife.

1215
01:06:36,341 --> 01:06:41,341
They don't do any of the terrible things
that strangers could do and he gets a 

1216
01:06:41,341 --> 01:06:42,520
blessing as a consequence of it.
Does that seem reasonable?

1217
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:51,290
It is,
but we have to understand that these 

1218
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:51,290
strangers

1219
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,240
are

1220
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:56,980
come from heaven in the sense that they 
are bringing a message.

1221
01:06:56,981 --> 01:06:59,950
They're not just random strangers right 
there sent,

1222
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:05,370
but maybe he would have acted the same 
way with a stranger that wasn't sent and

1223
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:07,330
that's the whole point.
He doesn't know.

1224
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:13,100
He acts in a way that allows for that.
For the one that sent it can be 

1225
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:13,450
received.

1226
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:18,580
Okay,
so that's very interesting too because 

1227
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,321
one of the things that I think you see 
happening as a consequence of the 

1228
01:07:20,321 --> 01:07:24,761
transition from the Old Testament,
the new testament is that part of 

1229
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:28,520
Christ's message is to act in exactly 
that way,

1230
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:34,180
is to act in a manner that allows for 
the possibility of the emergence of the 

1231
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,720
good.
That's something like that.

1232
01:07:35,721 --> 01:07:40,721
Something like what would you describe 
it as a description of the necessity of 

1233
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:44,291
faith and you know like let's say you 
stretch out your hand to someone in 

1234
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:44,480
trust.
You shouldn't be naive,

1235
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,820
but it's a precondition for good things 
happening.

1236
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:52,470
Like if you're distrustful and you have 
every reason to be because people are 

1237
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:52,470
full of snakes.
If you're distrustful,

1238
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:57,220
you've,
you foreclose the opportunity for 

1239
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,880
cooperative progress instantly,
you might protect yourself against being

1240
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:03,890
bitten now in that so,
so there is a dramatic relationship 

1241
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:07,430
between the manner in which you open 
yourself up to the world and the way the

1242
01:08:07,431 --> 01:08:12,431
world treats you,
and one of the things that seems to be 

1243
01:08:12,431 --> 01:08:14,450
really emphasized,
it's more implicit in the Old Testament,

1244
01:08:14,451 --> 01:08:19,451
more explicit.
The New Testament is that the more you 

1245
01:08:19,451 --> 01:08:23,591
open yourself up to the possibility that
good things will happen and that's 

1246
01:08:23,591 --> 01:08:24,830
partly by accepting your vulnerability.
As far as I can tell,

1247
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:28,040
the higher the probability is that good 
things will in fact happen.

1248
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:30,730
Alright.

1249
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:38,750
Yeah,
I mean I would definitely say that in 

1250
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,630
the story of Abraham,
the like we were kind of flirting around

1251
01:08:39,631 --> 01:08:44,631
that idea before,
is that the reason why he was able to 

1252
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:48,710
receive them as these angel,
that they were able to manifest 

1253
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:50,340
themselves as these angels was because 
he was willing to host them properly.

1254
01:08:50,341 --> 01:08:51,390
He,
he like,

1255
01:08:51,391 --> 01:08:54,090
it's as if he had his family just like 
Sarah,

1256
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:59,120
like Sarah is his,
is he was the right ground for that 

1257
01:08:59,120 --> 01:08:59,930
manifestation at that time.
Right,

1258
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:05,490
well you say that they wouldn't have 
been angels if he wouldn't have treated 

1259
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:05,490
them properly.

1260
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:05,660
Well,
it might've been.

1261
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:11,080
It might've done.
They might have done what they did in 

1262
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,080
Sodom and Gomorrah.
That's the whole point.

1263
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,700
That's the whole point.
Okay,

1264
01:09:11,701 --> 01:09:13,940
so now I want to switch.
I want to flip ahead.

1265
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:19,630
This is really what this is.
I think of all the things I wanted to 

1266
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:23,350
discuss with you guys,
I think this is the one that's most 

1267
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:23,480
crucial because.

1268
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,630
Okay,
so now we're in,

1269
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:30,810
let's say we're in of with the,
with the angels and we're,

1270
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:35,930
we're in the part of the story where the
townspeople of Sodom gather around the 

1271
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:40,311
house and they tell lot and unless he 
throws out the strangers so that they 

1272
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:41,770
can be raped.
Well,

1273
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,190
the,
this,

1274
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:47,280
the townspeople demand that and then um,
lot offers them his daughters,

1275
01:09:48,301 --> 01:09:50,910
which seems like a hell of a thing to 
do.

1276
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:54,510
It's like the sacrifice of Isaac to some
degree.

1277
01:09:55,530 --> 01:10:00,530
That's what it looks like to me because 
he's willing to sacrifice his daughters 

1278
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,500
to protect the strangers now.
Okay,

1279
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:06,501
so that's morally,
let's call that a morally ambiguous 

1280
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:09,201
element of the story,
but then the townspeople reject that and

1281
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,180
they,
they tell,

1282
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:16,220
they basically tell him that he has no 
right or power to bargain and that not 

1283
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:17,400
only are they going to take his 
daughters,

1284
01:10:17,401 --> 01:10:20,130
but they're also going to take the 
strangers so it doesn't work,

1285
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,160
but you know,
to a,

1286
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:27,280
to modern sensibility,
the offering of his daughters is a 

1287
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,081
reprehensible thing,
but it seems to be it in the context of 

1288
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:34,281
the story.
It's an indication of how hard lot is 

1289
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:37,521
trying to treat the strangers properly 
in a place where that's essentially 

1290
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:37,521
impossible.

1291
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:39,410
Yeah.
That's the whole point of that story.

1292
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,830
That place is impossible.
That's the whole point.

1293
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,280
I think what he just said,
okay.

1294
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,330
There's no way out of it.

1295
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,200
Right.
Leonard Cohen said something about that.

1296
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:56,230
He said there's.
You had a line that I remember quite 

1297
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,871
well.
You said there's no decent place to 

1298
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:00,380
stand in the massacre and what that 
seems to mean is that something.

1299
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:05,410
It's something like you can get into a 
place where it's made of such a compound

1300
01:11:06,411 --> 01:11:10,400
of errors and deceit and catastrophe 
that no matter which way you turn,

1301
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:11,970
there is no good.
No,

1302
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:15,120
I've seen people like that in my 
clinical practice.

1303
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:16,920
There's,
there's no good,

1304
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,890
there's no good alternative.
Everything is sin.

1305
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:20,970
That's.
That's a good way of,

1306
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:24,180
no matter which way you shoot your,
you're not going to hit the mark because

1307
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:25,830
you're not somewhere where the market 
can be hit.

1308
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:31,040
Okay.
Now I've been trying to think about the 

1309
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:35,550
story of Sodom and Gomorrah in 
relationship to modern sexual confusion,

1310
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,350
so this is what I see happening on the 
social justice front,

1311
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:45,270
let's say on the one hand since the 19 
sixties and probably as a consequence of

1312
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:47,970
the birth control pill,
but other factors as well.

1313
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:53,210
There's been tremendous stress placed on
sexual liberation and so there's this 

1314
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:58,161
idea that I think is associated in large
part right now with the radical left of 

1315
01:11:58,471 --> 01:12:03,471
total sexual freedom,
but at the same time there's increasing 

1316
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:08,871
emphasis from exactly the same sources 
on restricting sexual interactions.

1317
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,540
So you see this in the campuses,
for example,

1318
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:17,541
where increasingly particularly 
heterosexual contact is regulated by a 

1319
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:22,731
doctrine that says you have to get 
spoken permission for every move in the 

1320
01:12:22,731 --> 01:12:27,060
mating process and so you see,
and I know I'm not expressing myself 

1321
01:12:29,731 --> 01:12:34,731
very well,
but there seems to be in our current 

1322
01:12:34,731 --> 01:12:34,731
culture there seems to be massive sexual
confusion.

1323
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:39,830
It's,
it's some weird combination of extreme 

1324
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:42,471
libertarianism and extreme authoritarian
attitudes towards sexuality and and 

1325
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:48,380
obviously in the story of Sodom,
part of what's happening happening and 

1326
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:53,270
is that sex impulsive?
Sexual gratification trumps everything.

1327
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:59,961
It's something like that.
I mean I know there's more to what's 

1328
01:12:59,961 --> 01:13:00,600
going on inside them than that,
but there's certainly that and so.

1329
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:07,370
Well,
I'm trying to figure out what to say 

1330
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:08,340
about that tonight because there's a.
there's a lesson in there.

1331
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,660
The lesson is something like,

1332
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:16,570
don't let sexuality,
don't let impulsive sexuality get the 

1333
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:20,081
upper hand.
It's something like that or all hell 

1334
01:13:20,081 --> 01:13:22,331
will break loose.
Which I actually happen to agree with 

1335
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:26,020
because one of the things that we 
haven't been able to talk about in our 

1336
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,451
culture I think is.
Let's take the idea of the phenomena of 

1337
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:32,550
aids aids mutated to take advantage of 
promiscuous sexuality and that's just 

1338
01:13:34,311 --> 01:13:37,700
nothing you never hear that publicized.
You know,

1339
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:41,300
people had associated aids with 
homosexuality and there was a reason for

1340
01:13:41,301 --> 01:13:46,301
that because it's much more easily 
transmitted as a consequence of 

1341
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:48,941
homosexual sex than heterosexual sex 
because the anus is a much more delicate

1342
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:54,880
physiological structure.
It's not as robust and it can be much 

1343
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,361
more easily damaged and and and with 
with disease resulting as a consequence,

1344
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:02,000
but it isn't only the manner of sexual 
action,

1345
01:14:02,001 --> 01:14:07,001
that's the issue.
It's also the fact that promiscuity 

1346
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:10,070
provided the evolutionary platform for 
the AIDS virus to mutate into a very,

1347
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:13,430
into the form that it took and it was 
only through the school,

1348
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,050
by the skin of our teeth that we escaped
a totalizing plague.

1349
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:23,370
No had that emerged a hundred years ago,
God only knows how many people would 

1350
01:14:24,651 --> 01:14:27,210
have died.
It AIDS was unbelievably fatal.

1351
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:33,770
So I know that's a mishmash of ideas and
I'm not exactly sure how to see my way 

1352
01:14:34,351 --> 01:14:39,351
clear through it,
but there is a clear warning in that 

1353
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:41,420
story about about something about 
something to do with,

1354
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,680
with,
with sexual inequity,

1355
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:49,870
but in the Bible that sexuality has to 
two Poles that define it and it's pretty

1356
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:54,060
clear.
One,

1357
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:59,150
one side is reproduction and the other 
side is with let's say recreation.

1358
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,960
Okay.
So those are the two bowls of sexuality 

1359
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,740
in a normal work.
So it's not just for reproduction and 

1360
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,120
it's not just for recreation.
It's both.

1361
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,560
Right.
That was the idea.

1362
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:16,320
I mean it's a natural idea.
Now if you.

1363
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:19,800
If there's a balance there that should 
be had.

1364
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:24,810
If you lose this balance and it becomes 
just about reproduction,

1365
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,750
that's a problem.
And if it becomes just about recreation,

1366
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,650
that's another problem.
Yup.

1367
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,970
Okay.
It's not that complicated really,

1368
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:36,980
but it's so politically incorrect to 
talk about these things even though 

1369
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,490
they're obvious,
nobody dares to talk about it.

1370
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,710
The thing is is that the most difficult 
things to talk about are the things that

1371
01:15:42,711 --> 01:15:46,880
are obvious because when they're obvious
you don't have to talk about them and so

1372
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:49,070
then when people start to question the 
obvious,

1373
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,290
you don't know what to say.
Yeah.

1374
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,970
It's like,
so for example,

1375
01:15:52,971 --> 01:15:56,360
we would.
I'm thinking about the slut walks,

1376
01:15:56,361 --> 01:16:01,361
you know,
and so women go out and they dress very 

1377
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:04,451
provocatively and they go out and 
manifest their right to be as 

1378
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:07,370
provocative as they possibly can be 
without being interfered with.

1379
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:13,060
And I have some sympathy for that 
perspective because it seems to me 

1380
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:16,430
appropriate for women to be.
The final arbiter is in sexual contact,

1381
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,140
but on the other hand,
it also,

1382
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,000
it's that whole exercise is blind to the
fact that clothing,

1383
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:25,100
for example,
has communicative intent

1384
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:26,800
and that

1385
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:32,890
people broadcast their invitation to 
sexual congress in a million ways.

1386
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:36,370
Subtle and not so subtle.
And you can't just say,

1387
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:41,730
I have the right to broadcast myself in 
any manner possible and be completely,

1388
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:45,140
um,
can,

1389
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,560
can,
can be worked completely immune from the

1390
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,690
consequences.
There's something wrong with that.

1391
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,690
And with regards to basic sexual 
morality,

1392
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,320
no,
I've read things about like slut shaming

1393
01:16:56,321 --> 01:17:00,010
is that the more radical feminist types,
for example,

1394
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:04,360
claim that women shouldn't be held 
responsible for their sexual behavior in

1395
01:17:04,361 --> 01:17:05,980
some sense it shouldn't be held against 
them,

1396
01:17:05,981 --> 01:17:07,720
how many men they've slept with,
etc.

1397
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,890
But then I think,
well,

1398
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,670
you'd never recommend to someone that 
they laid down naked on the,

1399
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:17,480
on the side of the street with their 
legs spread and invite anybody who walks

1400
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:22,481
by to partake of the opportunity.
Everyone would regard that as 

1401
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:25,730
inappropriate,
I think without question.

1402
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:31,300
And so what that indicates is that some 
degree of sexual propriety is Both 

1403
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:37,420
normative and ethical.
And then of course you can start asking 

1404
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,961
yourself about what that degree of 
social sexual impropriety should be.

1405
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:44,300
And It does have something to do with 
getting the balance between reproduction

1406
01:17:44,301 --> 01:17:45,980
and recreation.
Right?

1407
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,100
Okay.
Well,

1408
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:50,910
the,
the thing,

1409
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,380
even in the bible,
there's the two aspects.

1410
01:17:55,381 --> 01:17:58,550
Some stories are about just this aspect 
in,

1411
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,660
there are the most strange stories in 
the bible.

1412
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,960
For example,
the story of I'm tamar is one of those.

1413
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:08,350
So,
uh,

1414
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:10,110
I don't know if you're familiar with 
that story,

1415
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,090
but it's tough.
It's in the,

1416
01:18:12,091 --> 01:18:17,091
it's,
it's intercut with the story of joseph 

1417
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:21,190
in Egypt and it's essentially a,
it says that judah had children with 

1418
01:18:24,211 --> 01:18:28,170
some woman and I think it's a stranger.
It doesn't necessarily say so,

1419
01:18:28,171 --> 01:18:33,171
but it seems like that's what it is.
And then the sons die off.

1420
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:39,050
And then there's this woman called tamar
and she disguises herself as a 

1421
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:39,670
prostitute.
Great.

1422
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:45,500
And she has a kid with judah himself.
So all of the symbols are in that story.

1423
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:50,090
Elements of his clothing.

1424
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,980
Yeah.
Demonstrate as a,

1425
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:53,170
as a bride.
Yeah.

1426
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:53,890
Essentially

1427
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,370
wants to indicate later that he's the 
one who slept with.

1428
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:58,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

1429
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,680
So that story is about the necessity,
the need for the recreative part of 

1430
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:08,280
sexuality.
It's all about that symbolism.

1431
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:11,340
It's all about the seat.
It's all about incest.

1432
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,760
It's all about death.
And it's.

1433
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:18,600
The idea is it's to raise the dead.
Okay.

1434
01:19:18,601 --> 01:19:20,660
It's not clear in the story,
but if you understand,

1435
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:22,530
if you understand the imagery,
that's what it's about.

1436
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,800
It's about regressing back to an error 
that was made.

1437
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:31,020
Okay.
And raising the dead so,

1438
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,080
and I don't want to get into it,
but it's just the idea that in the bible

1439
01:19:34,081 --> 01:19:39,081
there's both to the hearse reproduction 
and there's recreation and the 

1440
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:44,440
recreation is renewal.
There's the renewal sexuality's about 

1441
01:19:44,581 --> 01:19:47,970
renewal too.
But that aspect of the symbolism is,

1442
01:19:47,971 --> 01:19:51,660
is pretty.
I don't want to say obscure because it's

1443
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:55,770
actually right there if you can see it,
but it's strange.

1444
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:57,600
I'll say it like that.
It's a strange.

1445
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:57,950
Okay.

1446
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:03,130
Okay.
So now another element of this might be 

1447
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:03,750
the fact that in modern identity 
politics,

1448
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:09,050
sexual choice is a canonical identifier.
And that also seems to me to be 

1449
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:14,151
something wrong about that.
Like one of the things I've seen 

1450
01:20:14,151 --> 01:20:15,330
happening in toronto,
I'm sure it's the same in montreal,

1451
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:19,350
is that,
and I'm going to do this awkwardly.

1452
01:20:19,351 --> 01:20:24,351
I'm going to put this awkwardly because 
I haven't been able to sort through it 

1453
01:20:24,351 --> 01:20:24,560
properly.
Um,

1454
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:29,070
pride week.
Pride day has turned into pride week and

1455
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:34,071
that's turned into pride month.
And I think that seems to me to be 

1456
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:37,941
pushing against some kind of limit.
Because the first question that I have 

1457
01:20:37,941 --> 01:20:42,741
is like I was reading this book the 
other day by a friend of mine from 

1458
01:20:42,741 --> 01:20:46,500
ottawa who's a gay conservative and he 
said he had a lot harder time coming out

1459
01:20:46,501 --> 01:20:51,501
as a conservative than he had as coming 
out as gay and he talked about the 

1460
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:57,711
degree to which homosexuals were 
persecuted in Canada before say the 19 

1461
01:20:58,351 --> 01:21:03,330
eighties and it's quite.
It makes quite a harsh reading,

1462
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:08,450
let's say,
and so and so fair enough to the,

1463
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:14,690
to the civil rights movement,
let's say it,

1464
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:19,430
that that has brought homosexuality into
the norm or that into the mainstream.

1465
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:20,930
Maybe that's one way of thinking about 
it,

1466
01:21:20,931 --> 01:21:25,250
but that conversation still has a 
tremendous amount of development.

1467
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,900
It's necessary because I don't 
understand exactly.

1468
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:37,680
It isn't obvious to me what integration 
into the mainstream precisely means 

1469
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,730
because a lot.
There's been a lot of talk so far about

1470
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:46,320
respecting the rights of gay people,
but very little talk about what the 

1471
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,701
accompanying responsibilities might be.
That actually it seems to me to be a 

1472
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:52,810
problem and I mean I.
I just had a letter from,

1473
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:58,260
from guy gay guy who has been wrestling 
with this because he's not sure how to 

1474
01:21:59,141 --> 01:22:01,900
be gay and to be ethical at the same 
time,

1475
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:07,020
you know,
because he sees part of normative 

1476
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,181
behavior is taking wife and having 
children and not and can see the value 

1477
01:22:09,181 --> 01:22:12,841
in that,
but that's certainly not the direction 

1478
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:12,841
of his proclivity.
And so we wrote,

1479
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:16,750
wrote to me asking me what he should do 
and you know,

1480
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,780
I don't have an answer for that.
I don't know what the answer to that is,

1481
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:26,220
but I know that it might be something 
that would be worth talking about and 

1482
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:29,840
it's part of this current confusion 
about sexual identity and sexual 

1483
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,650
pleasure and,
and we'll even gender identity for that 

1484
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:35,650
matter.
So.

1485
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:38,410
All right,
so your idea was,

1486
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:42,640
well the balance between recreation and 
reproduction had gone,

1487
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,990
was completely absent inside them.
It was all recreation.

1488
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:49,270
It was all instant gratification and 
impulse.

1489
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:54,670
Yeah.
And that's why it's put in the contrast 

1490
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,410
with the abraham bit because it's the 
same angels.

1491
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:00,020
But in that case he says,
you'll have a son this time next year.

1492
01:23:00,021 --> 01:23:05,021
So it's the reproduction part is there,
but when he gets to the

1493
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,560
bottom,
it's not there anymore.

1494
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:11,050
It's only the recreation part.
Okay.

1495
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,030
So they're,
they're,

1496
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:18,031
they're meant to be contested.
Those two stores actually in the story 

1497
01:23:18,031 --> 01:23:20,260
of abraham,
it's pretty clear.

1498
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,930
He goes,
um,

1499
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:27,120
I don't know if this will make sense 
because when the angels come it says,

1500
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,600
um,
he washes their feet and then he feeds 

1501
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,160
them.
Okay.

1502
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:38,340
That's actually the recreation and 
reproduction part that not in terms of 

1503
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:43,771
sexuality,
but it's in terms of meaning the 

1504
01:23:43,771 --> 01:23:48,180
renewal,
the washing of the feet is the 

1505
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:48,180
recreation part,
their renewal,

1506
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:52,240
they're restarting and the feeding is 
the reproduction part,

1507
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:57,300
not in a sexual way,
but when you feed something food and he 

1508
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:57,300
eats it,
it integrates,

1509
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:01,711
it integrates it correctly.
That's like our reproduction of your 

1510
01:24:01,711 --> 01:24:01,711
identity,
your,

1511
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,240
you're staying yourself,
you're reproducing yourself.

1512
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:05,890
So when you eat food,
that's what you're doing.

1513
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:06,910
Not,
like I said,

1514
01:24:06,911 --> 01:24:09,700
not in a sexual way,
but it has exactly the same.

1515
01:24:09,701 --> 01:24:12,970
Meaning if you eat something that you 
can integrate correctly,

1516
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:17,440
you're like reproducing your pattern is 
the correct version of yourself.

1517
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:23,250
The other side,
the washing is that like is that little 

1518
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:23,250
flood

1519
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,360
the fuck so many flood,

1520
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:27,760
right?
It's an acceptable.

1521
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:31,020
It's a controlled one.
You're washing the dust off your.

1522
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:33,570
The roads dust off your feet.
It means that you're.

1523
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:38,890
You're passing from one mode of being 
into another because you're.

1524
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:41,470
You're cleaning off the debris of the 
past.

1525
01:24:41,471 --> 01:24:44,940
It's something like that and that it's 
about renewal next year,

1526
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:46,840
so you have to see that when,
when,

1527
01:24:46,841 --> 01:24:48,090
when matthew was talking about,
yeah,

1528
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:53,130
you have recreation,
you have to understand that recreation 

1529
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,861
and rest are basically the same thing.
ThEn you basically have the same 

1530
01:24:55,861 --> 01:24:55,861
meaning.
It's sleeping,

1531
01:24:55,861 --> 01:25:00,660
resting,
recreation are all that bring you into 

1532
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:01,240
renewal.
okay,

1533
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:02,020
bye.

1534
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,510
And dying.
Dying.

1535
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:08,910
Dying is.
It's passing into another state,

1536
01:25:08,911 --> 01:25:12,290
letting something else have a chance 
that's quit tying his.

1537
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:12,490
I.
