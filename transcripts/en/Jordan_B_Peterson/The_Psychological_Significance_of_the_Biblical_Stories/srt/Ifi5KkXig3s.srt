1
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,310
So hopefully we're going to get past 
genesis one today.

2
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:25,311
That's the theory.
So I finished my new book yesterday.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,270
Yes,
that's,

5
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,440
that's taken about three years of 
writing.

6
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,510
It's quite a long time to write 
something.

7
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,740
So yeah,
I'm done except for the mopping up,

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,720
you know,
copy editing and that sort of thing.

9
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:49,000
So hopefully it's as good as I can make 
it.

10
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:54,001
I don't know if that's any good,
but it's as good as I can make it 

11
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:54,001
anyways.
All right,

12
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,691
so this is the stories that I'm going to
tell you tonight.

13
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,110
I've been thinking about,
well like the ones last week for that 

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,920
matter for very long period of time,
but I think these even longer and one of

15
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,080
the things that I just do not 
understand,

16
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:13,081
I cannot fathom this.
I cannot understand how there can be so 

17
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:16,510
much information in such tiny little 
stories,

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,790
especially the story of Cain and Abel.
That story.

19
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:22,840
Just every time I read it it just 
flattens me because it,

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,110
it's only like a paragraph long.

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,430
There's just nothing to it,
you know,

22
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,610
and I think about it,
I think about it and I think about it 

23
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:35,610
and I think about it.
Every time I think about it,

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,250
another layer comes out from underneath 
it and then another layer comes out from

25
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:41,320
underneath it and I can't figure that 
out.

26
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:46,321
Like you know,
the rational approach that I've been 

27
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:49,770
describing to you is predicated on the 
idea that these stories have somehow 

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,541
encapsulated wisdom that we generated 
interpersonally on behaviorally and then

29
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:59,950
an image over very vast stretches of 
time and then condensed it into very,

30
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:04,870
very dense articulated words that are 
then further refined by the act of being

31
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,800
remembered and transmitted and 
remembered and transmitted,

32
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:11,140
remembered and transmitted over vast 
stretches of time.

33
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,390
And that's a pretty good argument.
I'm willing to.

34
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,810
I'm willing to go with it,
but it's still never ceases to amaze me 

35
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,210
how much information such tiny little 
passages can can contain.

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,730
So we'll,
we'll take that apart today.

37
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,010
I think it's especially true with the 
story of Cain and Abel because it works 

38
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,400
on the individual level and it works on 
the familial level in.

39
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:44,401
It works.
On the political level and it works at 

40
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,730
the level of warfare and it works at the
level of economics and it's.

41
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,120
That's a lot for a little tiny one 
paragraph story to cover,

42
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:54,121
man.
Now you know you could object well with 

43
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:57,480
these stories.
You never know what you're reading into 

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,480
it and once in the story,
right?

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,290
That's part of,
let's call it the postmodern dilemma and

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,980
fair enough

47
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,490
and there's really no answer to that 
anymore than there is an answer to how 

48
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,060
do you know your interpretation of the 
world is well,

49
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,950
let's not say correct,
but sufficient.

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,420
There's some answer to that.
It's sufficient in if you can act it out

51
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:18,421
in the world and other people don't 
object too much and you don't die and 

52
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,530
nature doesn't take a bite out of you 
any more often than necessary.

53
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:25,531
You know,
those are the constraints within which 

54
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:27,091
we live.
So you have some way of determining 

55
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,710
whether your interpretation is at least 
functionally successful and that's.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,090
And that's not trivial

57
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,210
and I guess you could say the same thing
to the interpretations that might be 

58
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,050
laid out on these stories and at the 
moment that's probably good enough.

59
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,860
Hopefully you find the interpretations 
functionally significant at multiple 

60
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,990
levels and I also think the chance of 
managing that by chance is very,

61
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:49,890
very small,
you know,

62
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:54,891
to to be able to pull off an 
interpretation of a story that works at 

63
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:58,760
multiple levels simultaneously.
You think with each level that it 

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,961
applies,
the chances that you've stumbled across 

65
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:05,691
something by chance have to be 
decreasing right now that there's a 

66
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,290
technical term for that.
In psychology it's called something like

67
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:12,291
multi-method multi trait.
A method of determining whether or not 

68
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:16,581
something is accurate and the idea is 
the more ways that you can measure it 

69
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,760
and get the same result,
the more confident you can be.

70
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,510
That you're not just deluding yourself 
with your a priori hypothesis.

71
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,510
You know,
that there's actually something out 

72
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,341
there.
So I guess that's another part of this 

73
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:31,620
method is that.
And it's also a method that I use in my,

74
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,860
in my speaking,
I think I don't try to tell people 

75
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,410
anything that isn't personally relevant 
because you should know why you are 

76
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,040
being taught something,
right,

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,390
you should know what the fact is good 
for,

78
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,280
and then it should be good for you 
personally,

79
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,650
at least in some sense.
And then if you act it out in the world,

80
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:51,651
it should be good for your family and 
maybe should have some significance for 

81
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:51,651
the broader community.
I mean,

82
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:56,491
I think that's what meaning means.
And I don't really see the utility in 

83
00:04:56,491 --> 00:05:00,170
being taught things that aren't 
meaningful facts that aren't meaningful 

84
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,440
because there's an infinite number of 
facts and there's no way you're going to

85
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,880
remember all of them.
They have to be.

86
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,540
They have to have the aspect of tools 
essentially.

87
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Something like that.
Because we are a tool using creatures 

88
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,140
while these these stories have that 
aspect is as far as I can tell,

89
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:18,141
there's nothing.
There's no doubt about that.

90
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,400
So here's the stories in genesis two 
very famous stories.

91
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:28,401
Obviously,
virtually everybody who's even vaguely 

92
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,040
versed in western,
roughly speaking,

93
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:34,041
western Western culture knows these 
stories and that's something that's 

94
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:37,680
interesting too,
that stories can be so foundational that

95
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:42,681
everybody shares them.
I mean you can say the same thing about 

96
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:42,681
a fairly large handful of fairytales as 
well,

97
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:44,340
or you could at least until recently,

98
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,230
but the fact that stories are 
foundational,

99
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:51,500
I think also means that they have to be 
given a kind of,

100
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,800
well,
even if you don't give them any respect,

101
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,610
you have to at least treat them as 
curiosities.

102
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,150
Why those stories and why did they stick
around and why does everybody know them 

103
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,651
and it's not self evident by any stretch
of the imagination and you can use 

104
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,030
explanations,
can use the Freudian explanation.

105
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Freud sort of thought that the Judaeo 
Christian was predicated on the idea 

106
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,370
that the figure of the father,
the familial father,

107
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,660
was expanded up into cosmic dimension so
that mankind existed in the same 

108
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,741
relationship to the cosmic father.
Let's say that an infant or a small 

109
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:33,941
child existed in relationship to his or 
her own father and that's a reasonable 

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,110
critique.
I would say to some degree,

111
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:41,480
but it does,
and and,

112
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,530
and this was purposeful.

113
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,530
It does imply more than imply in Freud's
case that people who adopt a religious 

114
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:56,051
belief that has a persona figure as at 
its apex are essentially acting out the 

115
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:01,211
role of dependent children and you know,
I thought about that critique for a long

116
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:03,860
time and believe me,
that's been a powerful critique.

117
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:08,861
One of the best books I ever read called
the denial of death by Ernest Becker I 

118
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:12,170
think took that line of argumentation.
It developed it as well as any,

119
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,620
any book I've ever seen argue it back or
tried to bring closure to Freudian 

120
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:22,880
psychoanalysis on religion and he did a 
pretty wicked job of it.

121
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:26,810
Like I think the book is seriously 
flawed and wrong,

122
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,770
but it's really a great book.
Like some books are well,

123
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,520
some books are wrong and really good 
ways,

124
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:32,840
right?
They make a powerful,

125
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,940
powerful argument.
They really take it to its extreme.

126
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,210
I think Becker missed the point and he 
missed it in the same way that Freud,

127
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:46,730
Mrs [inaudible] point and Becker who 
wrote this book on the psychology,

128
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,840
the psychoanalysis of religion,
never referred to except very briefly in

129
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:54,440
the introduction and I think that was a 
major mistake,

130
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,500
but becker took the argument that the 
hypothesis of God is nothing but an 

131
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:06,401
attempt by human beings to recreate a 
infant infantile state of dependency and

132
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,420
to be able to rely on an all knowing 
father and to thereby recovered the 

133
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,961
comfort perhaps that we experienced when
we were young and had a hypothetically 

134
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:23,021
all knowing father for those of us who 
were lucky to have someone who rigged 

135
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,270
vaguely resembled death,
but the more I thought about that,

136
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:30,650
the more that that struck me as quite 
implausible across time.

137
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:35,651
Charles Taylor,
I think it was Charles Taylor wrote an 

138
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:37,430
interesting book called the,
I think it was called the origins of the

139
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:38,180
modern self.

140
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,680
He's a philosopher.
I wouldn't necessarily call him a friend

141
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:44,510
of classic religion,
but it doesn't matter.

142
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,660
He made a very interesting point about 
Christianity in particular.

143
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,860
He said,
well,

144
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,110
if you're going to invent a religion 
that offered you nothing but infant tile

145
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,120
comfort,
why in the world would you bother 

146
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,230
conceptualizing hell?
That just seems like an unnecessary 

147
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,630
detail to add to the whole story,
right?

148
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:02,190
If it's.
If it's all about comfort,

149
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,760
why would you hypothesize that the 
consequence of of serious error was 

150
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:11,730
eternal torment?
That doesn't really sound very.

151
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,730
It isn't the sort of thing that that is 
likely to make you feel comfortable.

152
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,520
James Joyce,
when he wrote about that city,

153
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,530
had terrible nightmares when he was a 
child because of the Hellfire to 

154
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,970
sermons.
The jesuits used to spout,

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
spew forth let's say,
and he wrote down what he remembered of 

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,310
them and they were pretty hair raising.

157
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,520
I think in James Joyce's book,
I think it was portrait of the artist as

158
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,360
a young man,
man.

159
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:41,361
He talked about the jesuits telling them
and telling them that hell was a like a 

160
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:45,621
prison with walls that were seven miles 
thick that was always in darkness and 

161
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:50,360
consumed by fire and that the people who
are trapped there were continually burnt

162
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,881
by this dark fire that gave New Light.
Which also simultaneously rejuvenated 

163
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:59,400
their flesh so that it could be burned 
off eternally in case you were wondering

164
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,230
how it was going to be burned off 
eternally.

165
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,520
That's apparently the process.
It's not easy for me to see that as an 

166
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,920
infant tile wish fulfillment.
I'm afraid now you could.

167
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Well you could be a cynic about it.
And Elaine pagels who who wrote a book 

168
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,660
on the devil was cynical about it in 
this manner.

169
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,910
She thought that the Christians so to 
speak,

170
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,900
invented hell as a place to put their 
enemies and you know.

171
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,970
Yeah,
fair enough.

172
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,210
But no,
that's not accurate really.

173
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,820
Although it's convenient to have a place
to put your enemies.

174
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,250
Charles Taylor did point out,
for example,

175
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:37,251
that the modern terror of loss of self,
let's say the existential loss of self 

176
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:43,401
and loss of meaning was perhaps roughly 
paralleled by the medieval terror of 

177
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,250
hell.
You know,

178
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:47,010
in terms of existential intensity.
And so it wasn't.

179
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,900
Hell wasn't merely a place where those 
people that you didn't care for,

180
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,840
it would end up.
It was the place where you were going to

181
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:56,841
go if you didn't walk the line properly.
And so I don't think Freud's Freud's 

182
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:02,070
critique really holds water in the final
analysis and then marks his critique,

183
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:07,071
of course,
was that religion was the opiate of the 

184
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:07,290
masses and he made an argument that was 
similar to Freud's,

185
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:12,291
although somewhat earlier and made the 
based upon the presupposition that 

186
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:17,780
religious police were stories told to 
the gullible masses in order to keep 

187
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,630
them pacified and happy.

188
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,630
Well they're corporate overlords for 
lack of a better purpose,

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,520
continue to exploit them and,
and,

190
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,520
and weaken them.
And you know,

191
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,070
I find that I find the critique of human
institutions as driven entirely by power

192
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,790
very,
let's say questionable to say the least.

193
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,630
And of course every human institution is
corrupted by,

194
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,830
corrupted his corrupt by,
for one reason or another.

195
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,220
And it's also corrupt specifically by 
such things as deception and arrogance 

196
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,990
and the demand for unearned power.
And the same thing of course can be 

197
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,801
applied to religious systems,
but that doesn't mean that they are in 

198
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,930
some special way characteristic of those
faults.

199
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,910
And maybe you think they are and you 
know,

200
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:12,700
maybe you could make a case for it,
but it's not primary.

201
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,860
I think that's how you say that,
evident that that is.

202
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,670
That also is a particularly useful 
criticism.

203
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,960
I don't buy it.

204
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,890
I think there's.
I think that's far too cynical.

205
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,920
I think that the people who wrote these 
stories,

206
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,300
first of all,
what are you going to do?

207
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:36,301
You're going to read it.
You're going to run a bloody conspiracy 

208
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:36,301
for 3000 years successfully.
It's like,

209
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,820
good luck with that.
Can't run a conspiracy for 15 minutes 

210
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,340
without somebody ratting you out.
You know it's,

211
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,900
it's impossible.
So whatever's at the basis of the 

212
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,330
construction,
not only of these stories,

213
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:51,760
but of the dogmatic structures that 
emerged from them,

214
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,180
I think that it's a terrible mistake to 
reduce them to unit dimensional 

215
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,180
explanations.
In fact,

216
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,590
I generally think that reducing any 
complex human behavior to unidimensional

217
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,450
explanation is often a sign of a 
seriously limited thinker.

218
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,180
And you know,
I,

219
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:08,830
I say that with some caution because 
Freud did do that with religion at least

220
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,770
to some degree in Freud was a serious 
thinker and marks,

221
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:13,810
I suppose was a serious thinker too,
even though.

222
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,810
Well yeah,
if he's someone you just,

223
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,620
if you have any sense marks,
just leaves you speechless.

224
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,720
So,
so anyway,

225
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:35,721
so that's all to say that I don't think 
there's any simple explanation for how 

226
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:36,490
these stories have the power that they 
have.

227
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,550
I really don't.
I don't think you can reduce it to 

228
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,550
political conspiracy,
that's for sure.

229
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,690
I don't think you can reduce it to 
psychological infantile ism.

230
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,940
I think you can make a case like I have 
that they are repositories of the 

231
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,291
collective wisdom of the human race.
I had an interesting letter this week 

232
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,490
from someone.
I get a lot of interesting letters.

233
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,510
I think I'm going to make an archive out
of them and put them on the web at some 

234
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,940
point with people's permission 
obviously.

235
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,510
Um,
and he said that he'd been following my 

236
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,661
lectures and noted that I'd been making 
what you might describe as a quasi 

237
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:16,530
biological or evolutionary case for,
for the emergence of the information 

238
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:18,130
that the stories contained.

239
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,630
And he said,
well,

240
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,890
how do you know that someone from a 
different religious tradition or 

241
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,471
speaking of a different religious 
tradition couldn't do exactly the same 

242
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:28,471
thing?
And I thought,

243
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,580
well,
first of all,

244
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:32,770
to some degree they could because there 
is overlap.

245
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,050
Like I've talked to you a little bit 
about Dallas,

246
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,930
for example,
in the,

247
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,320
in the Dallas view of,
of being as,

248
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,890
you know,
the eternal balance between chaos and 

249
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:43,890
order.
One thing I didn't tell you,

250
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,540
I don't think about that,
and I,

251
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:49,541
I don't know if you know this,
but there's a neuropsychologist named 

252
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,830
Elkanah and Goldberg who is a student of
Alexander Luria.

253
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,870
Luria was,
I think the greatest neuro psychologist 

254
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,881
of the 20th century.
He was a Russian and he was one of the 

255
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:01,541
first people to really determine,
in large part the function of the 

256
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:06,070
frontal Cortex,
which was quite a mystery for a very 

257
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,070
long period of time.

258
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,260
And Goldberg,
you know,

259
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,850
you know how we have two hemispheres,
right?

260
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:09,530
We have a left hemisphere and right 
hemisphere.

261
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:12,350
And people often think of the left for 
right handed people,

262
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,500
right handed males more particularly 
because women are more neurologically 

263
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,180
diffuse a.
it's one of the things that makes it 

264
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,470
more robust to head injury,
for example.

265
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,900
Um,
and,

266
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,330
and maybe men are less diffused and 
somewhat more specialized,

267
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:29,390
which makes them a bit more specialized,
but a little more subject to damage.

268
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,780
Anyways,
we have two hemispheres left and the 

269
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,601
right and no one exactly knows why and 
we know that they housed quasi 

270
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:39,800
independent consciousnesses because if 
you divide the Corpus callosum that,

271
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,110
that unites them,
which was done to in cases of 

272
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,070
intractable epilepsy,
for example,

273
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:50,060
that each hemisphere is capable of 
developing its own consciousness to some

274
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:55,061
degree.
The right generally nonverbal and the 

275
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:55,061
left verbal.

276
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:58,600
And so there has been this idea that the
left is a verbal hemisphere and the 

277
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,661
right is a nonverbal hemisphere,
but that can't be right because of 

278
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,230
course animals don't talk and they have 
a bifurcated hemisphere.

279
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:06,680
So if it's right,
it's not causally right.

280
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,180
Right now,
Goldberg hypothesized instead that the 

281
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,160
hemispheres we're,
we're a specialized for route and 

282
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,901
ization and non routinized or for 
novelty and familiarity or for chaos and

283
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,500
order.
And so that's pretty damn cool.

284
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,050
When I ran across that,
I also thought about that as a,

285
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,930
as a signal of,
of what would you call it,

286
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,650
multi-method multi trait,
construct validation because I'd never 

287
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:38,741
thought of the hemispheres is operating 
that way and Goldberg came up with this 

288
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:42,350
in a in a historical pathway that was 
entirely independent from any 

289
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,200
mythologically inspired thinking,
completely independent fact.

290
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,730
It was motivated more by materialist 
Russian neuro-psychology,

291
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,410
which was materialist for political 
reasons and also for scientific reasons,

292
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,950
but the idea is that we have one 
hemisphere that reacts very rapidly to 

293
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,610
things we don't know and it's more 
imaginative and diffuse and it,

294
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,480
and it's associated more with negative 
emotion because negative emotion is what

295
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:08,420
you should feel immediately when you 
encounter something you don't understand

296
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,400
because it's a form of thinking,
right?

297
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:15,550
Negative emotion.
It's like I'm somewhere where things 

298
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:15,980
aren't what they should be,
right hemisphere does.

299
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:19,730
That generates images very rapidly to 
help you figure out what might be there,

300
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and then the left hemisphere takes that 
and develops it into something that's 

301
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,160
more articulated and an algorithmic and 
fully understood.

302
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:33,161
And so then there's this dynamic balance
between the right and the left 

303
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:36,041
hemisphere where the left tries to 
impose order on the world that's 

304
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,450
Ramachandran who is a neurologist and in
California,

305
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:43,451
very famous neuro neuro neuro 
neurologist who also developed a theory 

306
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:48,611
light Goldberg's who said that the left 
hemisphere imposes routinized order on 

307
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:51,600
the world and the right hemisphere 
generates novelty and,

308
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,400
and uh,
and reacts to novelty and generates 

309
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,400
novel hypotheses.
And he thought,

310
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,260
and there is some good evidence for 
this.

311
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,530
That's what happened.
What's happening during the dream is 

312
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,601
that information has moved from the 
right hemisphere to the left hemisphere 

313
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:09,530
in small doses basically.
So that the novel revelations of the 

314
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Right Hemisphere don't demolish the 
algorithmic structures that the left 

315
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,370
hemisphere has so carefully put 
together.

316
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,420
So,

317
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,570
and I like that theory too because it 
also does help justify the hypothesis 

318
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,530
that I been laying out for you,
which is that,

319
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,540
you know,
there's part of us that extends 

320
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,201
ourselves out into the world and try to 
understand what we don't know and that 

321
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,830
that part extends itself out with 
behavior and also with emotion and also 

322
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,790
image.
And then maybe with poetry and then 

323
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,010
maybe with storytelling,
and then as that develops,

324
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:52,011
then we develop more and more 
articulated representations of that 

325
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:55,940
emergent knowledge and so you can map 
that quite nicely onto the neurologists 

326
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,660
and the neuropsychologist's presumption 
about what constitutes the reason for 

327
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,330
the hemispheric differentiation.
But the other thing that's so cool about

328
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:05,790
the hemispheric differentiation argument
as far as I'm concerned,

329
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,010
and this is really this is worth 
thinking about man,

330
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:10,290
because it's a real.
It's a real.

331
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,120
There's a word that ned ned flanders 
uses for that Norgen scratcher.

332
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:19,760
I think it's something like that.
Anyways.

333
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,070
You know,
we do make the assumption that what it 

334
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,520
is that we are biologically adapted to 
his reality,

335
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,730
right?
It's actually an axiomatic definition if

336
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:31,140
you're a Darwinian,
because nature is what?

337
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:33,830
Select by definition.
That's what nature is.

338
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:38,831
It's what select and if the nature that 
selects is forced upon you a dual 

339
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:41,990
hemispheric structure,
because half of you has to deal with the

340
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:44,510
chaos in half,
half of you has to deal with order.

341
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Then you can make a pretty damn strong 
influential case that the world is made 

342
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:49,840
out of chaos.
And order,

343
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,850
and that's really something to,
that's really something to think about 

344
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:54,850
mountain,
you know,

345
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,700
so you can think about that for a while 
if you want.

346
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,270
So anyways,
for whatever reason,

347
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:01,280
there is a lot packed into these 
stories.

348
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,190
And so let's investigate a couple more 
of them.

349
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,860
We'll start with this story of Adam and 
eve.

350
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,100
Now you may remember that the Bible is a
series of books.

351
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,410
Bible actually means something akin to 
library.

352
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:19,400
And these books are written by all sorts
of different people and groups of people

353
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:24,401
and groups of editors and groups of 
people who edited over and over across 

354
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:26,120
the very,
very large periods of time.

355
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:29,600
So they are authored by no one and many 
at the same time.

356
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,850
Um,
the,

357
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,520
there was a tradition for a long time 
that the earliest books were written by 

358
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Moses,
but that,

359
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,040
that's probably not technically correct 
even though it might be dramatically 

360
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,770
correct,
let's say,

361
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:45,530
or correct in the way that a fairytale 
is correct.

362
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:50,531
And I'm,
I'm not trying to put down fairy tales 

363
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:52,960
by saying that there's a number of 
authors in the way the authors have been

364
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:57,961
identified tentatively is by certain 
stylistic commonalities across the 

365
00:20:57,961 --> 00:21:02,641
different stories,
different uses of words like the words 

366
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:02,680
for God,
different poetic styles,

367
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,830
different topics and so forth,
and people have been working for 

368
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,950
probably 200 years roughly that to try 
to sort out who wrote what and how that 

369
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:16,831
was all cobbled together,
but it doesn't really matter for our 

370
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:16,831
purposes.

371
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:20,250
What matters is that it's an aggregation
of collected narrative traditions and 

372
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,150
maybe you could say it's an aggregation 
of collective narrative wisdom.

373
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,210
We don't have to go that far,
but we can at least say it's aggregated 

374
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,971
narrative traditions and that there was 
some reason that those traditions and 

375
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:36,541
all the others were kept in that.
There were some reasons complex though 

376
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,481
they may have been why they were 
sequenced in the order that they were 

377
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:42,511
sequenced.
Because one of the things that's really 

378
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,840
remarkable about the Bible as an as a 
document is that it actually has a plot.

379
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,700
And that's really something.
I mean,

380
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,820
it's,
it's sprawling and it goes many places,

381
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:53,821
but the fact that something's been 
cobbled together over several thousand 

382
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:53,821
years,
maybe 4,000

383
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:54,850
years,
maybe longer than that,

384
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:59,851
if you include the oral traditions that 
preceded it and god only knows how old 

385
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,370
those are,
that that collective imagination part of

386
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:08,371
the human collective imagination has 
cobbled together a library with a plot 

387
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:09,850
and like I see the Bible as an attempt.

388
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:15,150
A collective attempt by humanity is 
solve the deepest problems that we have 

389
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,370
and I think those problems are the 
problems of pro primary.

390
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,860
That the problem of self consciousness.
The fact that not only do we are,

391
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:23,950
we are mortal and that we die,
but we know it.

392
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:29,310
And that's the unique.
That's the unique predicament of human 

393
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:35,131
beings and it makes all the difference.
And I think that's laid out in Adam and 

394
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:37,921
eve in the story of Adam and eve.
I think the reason that that makes us 

395
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:41,740
unique and is laid out in that story,
and interestingly,

396
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,610
I really realized this only after I was 
doing the last three lectures.

397
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,660
So the Bible presents a cataclysmic.
A cataclysm at the beginning of the of 

398
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,680
time,
which is the emergence of self 

399
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,821
consciousness and human beings,
which puts a rift into the structure of 

400
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:03,121
being.
That's the right way to think about it 

401
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:03,121
and that's really given cosmic 
significance.

402
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:04,870
Now you can dispense with that and say,
well,

403
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,970
nothing that happens to human beings as 
of cosmic significance because we're 

404
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:09,970
these short lived,
you know,

405
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,640
mold like entities that are like cancers
on this tiny little planet that's 

406
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:19,770
rotating out in the middle of nowhere on
the edge of some unknown galaxy in the 

407
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,910
middle of infinite space and nothing 
that happens to us matters and it's fine

408
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:24,700
and you like,
you can walk down that road if you want.

409
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,960
I wouldn't recommend it.
I mean,

410
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:32,961
and that's part of the reason I think 
that for all intents and purposes it's 

411
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:32,961
untrue.
You know,

412
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,100
it isn't,
it isn't a road you can walk down and 

413
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,100
live well.
In fact,

414
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,120
I think if you really walk down that 
road and you really take it seriously,

415
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,930
you end up not living at all.
So it's certainly very reminiscent.

416
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:48,931
I mean,
I've talked to lots of people are 

417
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:48,931
suicidal and seriously suicidal and you 
know,

418
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:53,260
the kind of conclusions that they draw 
about the utility of life prior to 

419
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,041
wishing for its cessation are very much 
like the kind of conclusions that you 

420
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:57,041
draw.

421
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,480
If you walk down that particular line of
reasoning long enough,

422
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,290
if you're interested in that,
you could read Tolstoy's confession,

423
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,090
Leo Tolstoy's confession.
It's a very short book.

424
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:06,530
It's so,
it's a killer man.

425
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:07,790
It's,
it's a powerful book.

426
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,660
Very,
very short.

427
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,960
And tolstoy describes his obsession with
suicide when he was at the height of his

428
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:17,060
fame,
most well known author in the world,

429
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,190
you know,
huge family,

430
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,940
international fame,
wealth beyond anyone's imagining at that

431
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:23,770
time,
um,

432
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,130
influential,
admired,

433
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:30,131
he had everything that you could 
possibly imagine that everyone could 

434
00:24:30,131 --> 00:24:32,861
have.
And for years he was afraid to go out 

435
00:24:32,861 --> 00:24:35,261
into his barn with a rope or a gun 
because he thought he'd either hang 

436
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:36,590
himself or shoot himself.
And he did get out of that.

437
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,010
He and he describes why that happened 
and where he went,

438
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:43,000
when that happened.
And so if you're interested in that,

439
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:44,410
that that's a very good book,
but

440
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,090
so the biblical stories and starting 
with Adam and eve,

441
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:56,100
they present a different story.
They present the emergence of self 

442
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,880
consciousness in human beings as 
cosmically cataclysmic event,

443
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,260
and you could say,
well,

444
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:06,261
what do we have to do with the cosmos?
And the answer to that is it depends on 

445
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:09,201
what you think consciousness has to do 
with the cosmos and perhaps that's 

446
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:12,381
nothing and perhaps it's everything.
I'm going to go with everything because 

447
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:13,230
that's how it looks to me.
Now,

448
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,500
of course,
anyone who wishes to as welcome to 

449
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:18,540
disagree,
but if you believe that consciousness is

450
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,450
a force of cosmic significance,
which which,

451
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,690
which,
which being itself is dependent on in 

452
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:26,690
any real sense,
at least in any experiential sense,

453
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,611
that it's not unreasonable to assume 
that radical restructurings of 

454
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:36,591
consciousness can worthy be granted some
kind of cosmic or metaphysical 

455
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:42,171
significance and even if it's not true 
from outside the human perspective,

456
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:47,661
whatever that might be,
it's bloody well true from within the 

457
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:47,661
human perspective.

458
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:47,790
That's for sure.
And so that's the.

459
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,060
That's the initial event in some sense,
after the creation is the cataclysmic 

460
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,171
fall and then the entire rest of the 
Bible is an attempt to figure out what 

461
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:58,350
the hell to do about that and everything
in it is is,

462
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,630
and so you could say for example,
in the earliest in in,

463
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,650
in the old testament stories,
what seems to happen is that the state 

464
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,960
of Israel is is founded and it rises and
falls and rises and falls,

465
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:13,800
and so there's this experimentation for 
centuries,

466
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,040
millennia,
even with the idea that the way that you

467
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:20,490
protect yourself against the tragic 
consequences of self consciousness is by

468
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:25,491
organizing yourself into a state,
but then what happens is the state 

469
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:28,790
itself begins to reveal its pathologies 
and as those pathologies mount,

470
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:31,770
the state becomes unstable and collapses
and then it

471
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,490
rises back up and becomes unstable and 
collapses and then it rises back up 

472
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,750
after it does this a number of times.
This is primarily from northrop prize 

473
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,051
interpretations.
People start wondering if there's not 

474
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:46,560
something wrong with the idea that the 
state itself is.

475
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:51,561
This is the,
is the pathway is the place of 

476
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:55,161
redemption.
That there's something wrong with that 

477
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:56,040
idea,
and so then I think on the heels of that

478
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,880
comes the Christian revolution with its 
hypothesis that it's not the state 

479
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,410
that's,
that's the place of salvation.

480
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:08,670
It's the individual psyche and then 
there's,

481
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,140
there's a,
there's a,

482
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,170
an ethic that goes along with that too,
which is quite interesting.

483
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:18,171
So the ethic of redemption after the 
state experiment fails,

484
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,700
let's say is that it's,
it's the,

485
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,720
it's within the individual that 
redemption can be manifested,

486
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,780
let's say,
and even in so far as the state is 

487
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,121
concerned because the state's proper 
functioning is dependent on the proper 

488
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,300
functioning of the individual rather 
than the reverse.

489
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,790
Most fundamentally and that the proper 
motive,

490
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:43,791
individual being that's redemptive is 
truth and truth is the antidote to this 

491
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:47,940
suffering.
That's that emerges with the fall of man

492
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,630
in the story of Adam and eve.
And then that relates back to the 

493
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,691
chapters that we've already talked about
because there's this insistence in 

494
00:27:56,691 --> 00:28:01,190
genesis one that it's the word in the 
form of the of truth that generates 

495
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,440
order out of chaos.
But even more importantly,

496
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,050
and this is something I like I said,
I most clearly realized just doing these

497
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:11,610
lectures for the last three weeks,
is God continues to say as he speaks,

498
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,640
order into being with truth,
that the being he speaks into being is 

499
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,870
good and so there's this insistence that
the being that spoke into being through 

500
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:23,970
truth is good and so there's a hint 
there.

501
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:25,530
It's so interesting.
There's a hint there,

502
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,830
right at the beginning of the story that
that the state of being that Adam and 

503
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:36,441
eve inhabited before they fail,
before they became self consciousness 

504
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,500
conscious in so far as they were made in
the image of God and acting out the 

505
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,671
truth,
that the being itself was properly 

506
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:49,100
balanced and it takes the entire Bible 
to rediscover that which is a,

507
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,970
which is a journey back to the 
beginning.

508
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,160
Right?
And that that's a classic theme.

509
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,280
It's a classic mythological theme that 
the wise person is the person who finds 

510
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,030
what they lost in childhood and regains 
it.

511
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,970
Right?
So that's A.

512
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,210
I think that's a Jewish idea that Zadie,
if I remember correctly,

513
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,330
it was a messiah figure,
is the person who finds what he lost in 

514
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,320
childhood and regains it to this idea of
this return to the beginning,

515
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:18,321
except that the return is you don't fall
backwards into childhood and 

516
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:21,240
unconsciousness.
You returned voluntarily to the state of

517
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,840
childhood,
well awake and then determined to 

518
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,460
participate through truth in the 
manifestation of proper being.

519
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Now you know,
I'm a psychologist and I've taught 

520
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,790
personality theory for a very long time 
and I know a personality theories that 

521
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,721
profound personality theories pretty 
well and I'm reasonably well versed in 

522
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:45,021
philosophy,
although not as well versed as I should 

523
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:47,401
be,
but I can tell you in all the things 

524
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:47,401
I've ever read or encountered or thought
about,

525
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:51,931
I have never once found an idea that 
matches that in terms of profundity but 

526
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:53,920
not only profundity also in 
believability.

527
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,020
Because the other thing I see as a 
clinician,

528
00:29:56,021 --> 00:30:01,021
and I think this is very characteristic 
of clinical experience and also very 

529
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:04,240
much described explicitly by the great 
clinicians,

530
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,300
is that what cures in therapy is truth.
That's the curative.

531
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,460
Now there's exposure to the things 
you're afraid of and avoiding as well,

532
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:17,461
but I would say that's a form of enacted
truth because if you know there's 

533
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:19,990
something you should do by your own set 
of rules and you're avoiding it,

534
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:22,540
then you're enacting a lot.
You know you're not telling one,

535
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,400
but you're acting out.
It's the same damn thing.

536
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,610
So if I can get you to face what it is 
that you're confronting that you know 

537
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,650
you shouldn't be avoiding,
then what's happening is that we're both

538
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:37,651
partaking in the process of attempting 
to act out your deepest truth and what 

539
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:41,050
happens is that that improves people's 
lives and it improves them radically and

540
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,630
the evidence for the clinical evidence 
for that is overwhelming.

541
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,020
We know that if you expose people to the
things they're afraid of but that 

542
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,261
they're avoiding,
they get better and you have to do it 

543
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:53,290
carefully and cautiously and with their 
own participation and all of that,

544
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:57,790
but of all the things that clinicians 
have established that's credible,

545
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,850
that's number one,
and that's nested inside this deeper 

546
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,510
realization that the clinical experience
is redemptive,

547
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:09,690
let's say,
because it is designed to address 

548
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,821
suffering in so far as the people who 
are engaged in the process are both 

549
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:12,490
telling each other the truth and then 
you think,

550
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:17,491
well obviously,
because if you have some problems and 

551
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:19,330
you come to talk to me about them,
well first of all just by coming to talk

552
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:21,310
to me about them.
You've admitted that they exist.

553
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,750
Man.
That's a pretty good start.

554
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,360
And second,
well if you tell me about them,

555
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:28,270
then we know what they are and then if 
we know what they are,

556
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:33,271
we can maybe start to lay out some 
solutions and then you can go act out 

557
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:33,430
the solution to see if they work.

558
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,820
But if you don't admit they're there and
you won't tell me what they are.

559
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,540
And I don't,
and I'm like posturing and,

560
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:44,541
and,
and acting egotistically and taking the 

561
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:44,541
upper hand in all of that in our 
discussions.

562
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:45,550
Well,
how the hell is that going to work?

563
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,250
You know,
it might be comfortable moment to moment

564
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:50,500
while we stay encapsulated in our 
delusion,

565
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:55,501
but it's not going to work.
So a lot of that seems to think it 

566
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:55,810
through.
It seems pretty self evident.

567
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:59,260
And you know,
Freud thought that repression was at the

568
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,800
heart of much mental suffering.
The difference between repression and 

569
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,000
deception is a matter of degree and 
that's all.

570
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,520
It's technical.
It's a technical differentiation.

571
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,840
And Alfred Adler who was one of Freud's 
greatest associates,

572
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,640
let's say,
and much under appreciated,

573
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:20,641
I would say he thought that people got 
into problems because they started to 

574
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:20,641
act out a life lie.

575
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:25,440
That's what he called it,
a life lie that's worth looking up 

576
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:25,480
because Adler,
although not as charismatic as Freud,

577
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,080
was very practical and,
and,

578
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,580
and really foreshadowed a lot of later 
developments in cybernetic theory.

579
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:36,581
And of course young believed that you 
could bypass psychotherapy entirely by 

580
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:39,800
merely making a proper moral effort in 
your own life.

581
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:44,801
And Carl Rogers believed that it was 
honest communication mediated through 

582
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:49,601
dialogue that had redemptive 
consequences and the behaviors believe 

583
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:53,501
that you do a careful micro analysis of 
the problems that are laid before you 

584
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:54,860
would help introduce people to what 
they're avoiding.

585
00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:00,070
It's like all of those things to me are 
just secular variations of the notion 

586
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,880
that truth will set you free 
essentially.

587
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,030
So,
so you know,

588
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:10,031
it's a pretty powerful story and a,
a,

589
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,440
it's not that easy to dispense with.
And B,

590
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,020
the other thing is you dispense with it 
at your peril.

591
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,820
Because what I have seen as well as 
that,

592
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,150
the people that I've seen have been 
really hurt,

593
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,390
have been hurt mostly by deceit.
And that's also worth thinking about 

594
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,750
that you know,
you get walloped by life.

595
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,450
There's no doubt about that.
Absolutely no doubt about that.

596
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,810
But I thought for a long time that maybe
maybe,

597
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,900
maybe people can hang handle earthquakes
and cancer and even death meaning,

598
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,860
but they can't handle betrayal and they 
can't handle deception.

599
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,340
It can't handle having the rug pulled 
out from underneath and by people that 

600
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,250
they love and trust.
Not just does them in,

601
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,080
you know,
it,

602
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,570
it,
it,

603
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,310
it,
it makes them ill,

604
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:55,780
but it does where it hurts the 
psychophysiological,

605
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,320
it damages them,
but more than that,

606
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:00,530
it makes them cynical and bitter and 
vicious and resentful,

607
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,800
and then they also start to act all that
out in the world and that makes it 

608
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:05,800
worse.
So,

609
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,140
so you know,
the story starts.

610
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:14,170
God uses the spoken truth to create 
being that is good and then the 

611
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:20,561
cataclysm occurs and then human beings 
spend untold millennia trying to sort 

612
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:26,681
out exactly what to do about the fact 
that they've become self conscious and 

613
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:30,150
you know by the way we have right,
we are in fact self conscious.

614
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,760
No other animal has that distinction.
Now you'll read that chimpanzees can,

615
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:38,000
for example,
if you put lipstick on a chimpanzee,

616
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,730
just kind of a strange thing to do.

617
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Well I won't pursue that any further,
but the chimpanzee chimpanzee will wipe 

618
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:52,760
off the lipstick if you show it a 
mirror.

619
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,200
And Dolphin seemed to be able to 
recognize themselves in mirrors.

620
00:34:57,201 --> 00:35:02,201
And there is.
So there is the glimmerings of self 

621
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:05,351
conscious recognition in other animals.
But to put that in the same conceptual 

622
00:35:05,351 --> 00:35:09,230
category as human self consciousness is 
into my way of thinking.

623
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,160
It's,
it's,

624
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,350
well,
it's uninformed to say the least,

625
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:20,351
but I also think that it's motivated.
It's motivated by a kind of anti 

626
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,640
humanistic underlying an underlying 
motivation.

627
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,380
Because our self consciousness is so 
incredibly developed compared to that,

628
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:29,350
that they're hardly in the St conceptual
universe.

629
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:30,890
It's.
It's like comparing the.

630
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,880
The alarm cries of vervet monkeys when 
they see a Predator to the language of 

631
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,560
human,
it's like,

632
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:38,310
yeah,
yeah,

633
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:39,450
yeah.
There's some similarities,

634
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,100
man.
Their utterances,

635
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:46,340
they're utterances with meaning,
but they're not language and the self 

636
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,131
consciousness of animals is protos self 
consciousness and it's only there and a 

637
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:49,290
very small number of animals.

638
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:54,290
And if it's nothing like ours,
they're not aware of the future like we 

639
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,110
are.
They're not aware of their boundaries in

640
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,750
space and time.
And that's the critical thing.

641
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:02,751
And most particularly time human beings 
discovered time and when we discovered 

642
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:08,781
time,
we discovered the end of each of our 

643
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:11,481
being and that made all the difference.
And that's what the story of Adam and 

644
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:15,471
Eve is about.
So genesis one is derived from the 

645
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:20,130
priestly source where God is known as a 
low him or El Shaddai,

646
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,990
and there's God in the singular and the 
gods in the plural,

647
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:29,991
and I suppose that's because it seems 
that if you analyze the history of the 

648
00:36:29,991 --> 00:36:34,911
development of monotheistic ideas,
that monotheism emerges out of a 

649
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:38,961
plurality of gods and as I mentioned,
I think it's because the gods represent 

650
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:44,150
fundamental forces at minimum and those 
fundamental forces have to be 

651
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,571
hierarchically organized for some with 
something absolutely at the top because 

652
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,040
otherwise they do nothing but war.

653
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Right?
You have to organize your values 

654
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,100
hierarchically or you stay confused and 
that's true.

655
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,880
If you're an individual in it.
It's true.

656
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:01,881
If your estate,
if you don't know what the next thing 

657
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:03,600
you should do is then there's 50 things 
you should do and then how are you going

658
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:04,770
to do any of them?
You can't.

659
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:07,260
You have to prioritize.
Something has to be above.

660
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:10,920
Something else has to be arranged in a 
hierarchy for it not to be chaotic,

661
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,160
and so there's some principal at the top
of the hierarchy and maybe the 

662
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,101
organization of the gods over time,
that's the battle of gods that Murcia 

663
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:20,100
Eliana talked about.
And if you're interested in that,

664
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,710
you could read a history of religious 
ideas,

665
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:25,050
which I would really recommend it to.
Three volume book.

666
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,350
Um,
it's actually quite as straightforward 

667
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,630
read as far as these things go.
And Eliana does a very nice job of 

668
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,680
describing how and even why polytheism,
Ken's towards monotheism,

669
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,750
even in polytheistic cultures,
there's a strong tendency for the gods 

670
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,490
to organize themselves in a hierarchy 
with one God at the top in a,

671
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,180
in a monotheistic culture,
in some,

672
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,480
in some sense,
all the other gods just disappear across

673
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:50,340
time and there's nothing left,
but the top God.

674
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:55,790
But even in a polytheistic society,
there's a hierarchy of power among the 

675
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,650
gods.
The first story is newer than the second

676
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,240
one.
So the story I'm going to tell you today

677
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:02,160
is actually older than the one I already
told you,

678
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:06,120
even though their order was flipped by 
the redactor,

679
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,200
who's the hypothetical person or persons
who edited these stories together and we

680
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:12,590
don't know exactly why he or the 
committee or what,

681
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,820
I suspect it was a single person,
but who knows?

682
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,240
We don't know why the stories were 
edited together in the order that they 

683
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,130
were edit together,
but we could infer,

684
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,280
I mean they were added together in that 
order because the editor thought they 

685
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,490
made sense that way because that's what 
an editor does,

686
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:34,491
right?
An editor tends to take diverse ideas 

687
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:34,980
and then to organize them in some manner
that makes.

688
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,440
And part of the manner that makes sense 
is that you can tell them to people and 

689
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,281
the people stay interested and you can 
tell them to people and people remember 

690
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:44,281
them.

691
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,720
That's one of the ways you can tell if 
you've got an argument,

692
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:51,721
right,
because it's communicable and 

693
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:51,721
understandable and memorable.
And so he,

694
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
this person was let's say,
motivated by intuition to organize the 

695
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,381
stories in this particular manner.
So the second the yard was strand 

696
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,700
contains the stories,
the classic stories in the pentitude 

697
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:08,700
that's five books,
genesis,

698
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:08,920
exodus,
leviticus,

699
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:10,060
numbers,
and Deuteronomy,

700
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,050
which we'll try to get through perhaps 
in these 12 lectures was,

701
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,810
we'll see how that goes.
It's strongly on through poor morphic.

702
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,170
So the God in the West account is,
for all intents and purposes,

703
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:22,250
a sort of metta person.
Um,

704
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,230
and I dealt with that a little bit last 
week because people tend to,

705
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,600
you know,
think of that as unsophisticated,

706
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:33,601
but when you think that the mind that 
the ground of consciousness is the most 

707
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:39,931
complex thing that we know of,
then it's not so unsophisticated to 

708
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:42,250
assume that the most complex thing that 
there might be is like that,

709
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:44,580
or it's at least it's as good as we can 
do with our imaginations.

710
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,580
And so I don't think it's so,
it's so a,

711
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,420
it's so unsophisticated.
It's also the case,

712
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,320
and this is practically speaking,
is that it is not at all unreasonable to

713
00:39:56,321 --> 00:40:01,321
think of God the father as the spirit 
that arises from the crowd that exists 

714
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,730
into the future.
Right?

715
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:08,731
And that's,
we talked about that in relationship to 

716
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:08,731
the idea of sacrifice at least a little 
bit more,

717
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:12,790
or we're going to make sacrifices in the
present so that the future is happy with

718
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:14,320
you.
And the question is,

719
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:16,960
what is that future that would be happy 
with you?

720
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,770
And answer to that is it's the spirit of
humanity.

721
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,860
That's who you're negotiating with 
because you make the assumption that if 

722
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,910
you forgo impulsive pleasure and get 
your medical degree,

723
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,240
that when you're done in 10 years and 
you're a physician,

724
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,680
humanity as such will honor your 
sacrifice and commitment and open the 

725
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:37,840
doors to you.

726
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,360
Right?
So you're treating the future as if it's

727
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:45,361
a single being and you're also treating 
it as if it's some something like a 

728
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:49,231
compassionate judge.
You're acting that out and maybe we had 

729
00:40:49,231 --> 00:40:52,420
to imagine God in that form before we 
could understand.

730
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,210
Once we started to understand that there
was a future,

731
00:40:55,211 --> 00:41:00,211
perhaps we had to imagine God in that 
form in order to concretize something 

732
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:02,710
that we could bargain with so that we 
could figure out how to use sacrifice to

733
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:07,711
figure out how to guide ourselves into 
the future because as sacrifice is a 

734
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:11,131
contract with the future,
but it's not a contract with any 

735
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:11,131
particular person,
it's.

736
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:13,270
It's a contract with the spirit of 
humanity as such.

737
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:16,300
It's something like that,
and so when you think about it that way,

738
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,690
that should make you faint with 
amazement because that is such a bloody 

739
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,010
amazing idea to come up with that idea 
that you can bargain with the future.

740
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,720
That is some idea,
man.

741
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,480
That's,
that's like the major idea of human,

742
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,670
of humankind.
We suffer.

743
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,700
What do we do about it?
We figured out how to bargain with the 

744
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,020
future and we minimize suffering in that
manner.

745
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,030
It's like no other animal does that 
either.

746
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:38,930
You know,
like the lions,

747
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:42,170
they just eat everything.
I think a wolf can eat 40 pounds of meat

748
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:43,850
in a single city.
Right?

749
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:45,110
It's like there's some meat,
eat it.

750
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,810
It's like not like save some mammoth for
tomorrow.

751
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,290
That's a.
that's not a wolf thing,

752
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,420
man.
That's a human thing and that might mean

753
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:55,940
you have to be hungry today or maybe 
you're a farmer,

754
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:57,770
you know,
several thousand years ago,

755
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:59,030
6,000
years ago or so,

756
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:02,720
what agriculture first got going and 
you're starving to death waiting for the

757
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:06,140
spring planting and you think we bill it
bloody well better not eat those seeds.

758
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,800
Right,
and that's really something to be able 

759
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:11,800
to control yourself,
to make the future real,

760
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,500
to put off what you could use today and 
not just in some impulsive manner,

761
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:17,360
man,
maybe your kids are starving to death.

762
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:22,361
You think we are not touching the seeds 
that we need for the future and for 

763
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:27,221
human beings to have discovered that and
then to also have figured out that we 

764
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:27,221
could bargain with the future.
It's like,

765
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:29,150
man,
that's something and I think that that.

766
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:34,390
I think that the stories that are laid 
out in this book actually describe at 

767
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,580
least in part the process by which that 
occurred.

768
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,660
They always stories begin with genesis 
two,

769
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:43,661
four.
This is the account of the heavens and 

770
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,911
the earth when,
so there's two real creation stories at 

771
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:45,911
the beginning,
the newer one,

772
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:46,760
which is the first one,
and the older one,

773
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:51,761
which is the second one,
and the older one begins in chapter two 

774
00:42:51,761 --> 00:42:51,761
and that's the story that we're going 
to,

775
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,270
that we're getting into now.

776
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,440
Adam and eve are in that Cain and Abel.
Noah,

777
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,340
the Tower of Babel in the [inaudible] 
strand exodus numbers along,

778
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,320
and there's some of the priestly version
in there too,

779
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:05,980
as well as the 10 commandments.
Well,

780
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,520
there's some lovely representations of 
of Paradise.

781
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:16,160
This is a garden of earthly delights.
What's his name?

782
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,370
Say That Bosch?
Yes.

783
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,080
Hieronymus Bosch.
He has that crazy.

784
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,140
I mean if you.
How he didn't get burnt at the stake is 

785
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,050
absolutely beyond me.
I mean,

786
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,600
you know,
some of you know about Salvador Dali,

787
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:34,601
I suppose most of you do.
I mean delis a piker compared to 

788
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:34,601
Hieronymus Bosch.
Man,

789
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:38,800
you could spend,
because there's three pieces of this 

790
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,921
particular painting,
you could spend a very bizarre and 

791
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:47,000
surreal month looking at that painting.
I don't know what it was with Bosch,

792
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:51,650
but he was some sort of creature that 
only popped up once and probably for the

793
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:52,160
best.

794
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:57,740
And so there's been very many 
representations of paradise.

795
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,360
I mean,
God only knows what that is.

796
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,890
It's like I could probably guess,
but I won't.

797
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,530
And then look,
I mean that's,

798
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,560
that's,
that's the lion lying down with the 

799
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:11,560
lamb.
Right?

800
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,291
So that's this idea that's maybe 
projected back in time that there was a 

801
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:15,480
time or maybe will be a time when,
when the,

802
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,180
when the horrors of life are no longer 
necessary for life itself to exist.

803
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,780
Right?
And the horrors of life or of course 

804
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,871
that everything eats everything else and
that everything dies and that 

805
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:29,900
everything's born and the whole bloody 
places a charnel house and it's,

806
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:35,040
it's a catastrophe beginning to end.
And this is the vision of it being.

807
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,130
Other than that.
And you know,

808
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:42,170
there was a strong idea.
This was also in implicit in the 

809
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,711
alchemical ideas.
And I think it's also implicit in the 

810
00:44:45,711 --> 00:44:48,111
scientific revolution that human beings 
can interact with reality in such a way 

811
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:54,591
so that the tragic and evil elements of 
it can be mitigated and so that we can 

812
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,570
move somewhat closer to a state that 
might be characterized well,

813
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:02,571
that's obviously images stick,
but it might be characterized by 

814
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:03,870
something like that where we have the 
benefits of actual existence without all

815
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,120
of the catastrophe that seems to go 
along with it.

816
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,120
And Carl Young,
when he wrote about the emergence of 

817
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,220
Alchemy or the emergence of science from
Alchemy,

818
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:15,900
he thought of science as being motivated
by a dream because for you dream was the

819
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,420
dream was the manifestation of the 
instincts.

820
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:20,670
That was the boundary between the 
instincts and thinking.

821
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,510
He said,
well,

822
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,560
sciences nested inside a dream,
and the dream is that if we investigated

823
00:45:25,561 --> 00:45:29,370
the structures of material reality with 
sufficient attention and truth,

824
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,450
that we could then learn enough about 
material reality to alleviate suffering,

825
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,610
right?
To produce the philosopher's stone,

826
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,130
to make everybody wealthy,
to make everybody healthy,

827
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:41,820
to make everyone live as long as they 
wanted to live for perhaps forever.

828
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:46,821
That that's the goal,
to alleviate the catastrophe of 

829
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:48,590
existence and that that idea,
the idea that mysteries,

830
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:53,870
the solution to the mysteries of life 
that might enable us to develop such a 

831
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:57,870
substance or let's say a multitude of 
substances provided the motive force for

832
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:00,390
the development of science and young 
trace,

833
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:05,391
that the development of that mode of 
force really over a thousand years and 

834
00:46:05,391 --> 00:46:06,060
if you're interested in reading his 
books on Alchemy,

835
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:11,061
which are extraordinarily difficult and 
that's really saying something about 

836
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:12,180
young because all of his books are 
difficult and then the books on Alchemy,

837
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,040
they kind of take a quantum leap.

838
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,020
That's actually a very small leap 
choice.

839
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:20,250
Wouldn't say that they take a massive 
leap into a whole different dimension of

840
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:22,050
complexity,
but that's what he was trying to get at.

841
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:26,100
He went back into the ELC chemical texts
and interpreted them as if they were the

842
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:29,880
dream on which science was founded and 
Newton was an outcome is by the way,

843
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:34,881
I mean have hypotheses are certainly 
well supported by the historical facts.

844
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:39,200
Science did emerge out of alchemy.
The question is what were the alchemists

845
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:44,210
up to?
And they were trying to produce the 

846
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,681
philosopher's stone,
and that was the universal medica meant 

847
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:48,111
for mankind's pathology.
Young felt at what had happened was 

848
00:46:48,111 --> 00:46:48,111
that,
you know,

849
00:46:48,111 --> 00:46:51,780
Christianity had promised that the 
cessation of suffering promised it for a

850
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,670
thousand years and yet suffering went on
unabated.

851
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:59,090
And at the same times Christianity,
he had attempted to really put emphasis 

852
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:03,141
on spiritual development,
let's say at the expensive material 

853
00:47:03,141 --> 00:47:03,141
development,
right?

854
00:47:03,141 --> 00:47:05,340
Thinking of material development as 
something akin to a sin,

855
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,990
trying to get a control of impulsivity 
and,

856
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,640
and all the things that went along with 
a two embodied existence.

857
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,820
There was a reason for it,
but that by about a thousand add the 

858
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,860
European mind,
somewhat educated by that point,

859
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,040
somewhat able to concentrate on a single
point perhaps because of a very long 

860
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,631
history of intense religious training 
turned its dream to the unexplored 

861
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:31,510
material world.
And thought,

862
00:47:31,511 --> 00:47:32,320
well,
you know,

863
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:37,530
the spiritual redemption that we've been
seeking didn't appear to produce the 

864
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,951
result that was promised or intended.
And so maybe there's another place that 

865
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:45,001
we should look.
And that was in the damned material 

866
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:45,001
world,
right?

867
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:45,001
Which,
which,

868
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:49,860
which was supposed to be at least 
according to some elements of classic 

869
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,410
thinking,
nothing about the creation of the devil.

870
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,140
So,
but the three point I'm making is that,

871
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:56,470
you know,
it's very difficult to underestimate the

872
00:47:56,471 --> 00:48:01,471
amount of human motivation that's 
embedded in the attempt to alleviate 

873
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:03,820
suffering,
to eradicate disease,

874
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:08,190
to help people live a healthy,
healthy life and will,

875
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,200
that's the disease obviously,
but to live a long life as well and to 

876
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:13,200
make things as peaceful as possible.

877
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,560
I mean you can be cynical about people 
in,

878
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:18,220
you can talk about them as motivated by 
power and being corrupt and all of those

879
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:23,221
things and all of those things are true,
but you shouldn't throw away the baby 

880
00:48:23,221 --> 00:48:26,191
with the bathwater because we have been 
striving for a very long time to set 

881
00:48:26,191 --> 00:48:29,881
things right.
And we've done to actually not too bad 

882
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:31,861
at job of it for half starving crazy 
insect written chimpanzees with 

883
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:35,710
lifespans of 50 to 70 years.
So,

884
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:40,770
you know,
we could deserve a bit of sympathy for 

885
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:40,770
our position as far as I'm concerned.
So

886
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,360
some other representations.
This one I liked the one on the left.

887
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:57,690
That's paradise.
Paradise is a walled garden and that's 

888
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:57,690
what paradise means.
It's paradise that was,

889
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,110
which is,
I don't remember the language.

890
00:48:59,111 --> 00:48:59,600
It's,
it's,

891
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:00,460
it's,
it's a,

892
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,470
it's a,
it's associated with Persian parodies.

893
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,460
That means walled garden.
And why a walled garden?

894
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,590
Well,
it goes back to the chaos order idea.

895
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:13,591
So this is where God puts man in woman 
after the creation in a walled garden 

896
00:49:13,591 --> 00:49:17,940
wall.
The Wall is culture in order and the 

897
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,191
garden is nature.
And the idea is the proper huet and 

898
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:20,191
habitat is nature and culture in 
balance.

899
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:21,910
And while we like gardens,
well why?

900
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:26,911
Because well,
they're not completely covered with 

901
00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:26,911
weeds and mosquitoes and black flies,
right?

902
00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:28,270
So they're,
they're civilized a little bit,

903
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:31,090
but still within that civilization 
nature,

904
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:36,490
it's more benevolent.
Guys is encouraged to flourish and 

905
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:36,490
people find that rejuvenating.

906
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:40,980
And so the idea that paradise,
the proper habitat of a human being is 

907
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,251
a,
is a walled garden is a good one and 

908
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:45,251
it's walled because while you want to 
keep things out,

909
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:46,240
right?
I mean raccoons for example,

910
00:49:46,241 --> 00:49:47,620
you want,
you want to keep those things out,

911
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:48,910
man,
even though it's impossible.

912
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,830
And you know,
you don't,

913
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:52,090
you don't want,
well,

914
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:53,830
there's all sorts of things you don't 
want in your garden,

915
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:56,620
like snakes,
walls don't seem to be much used against

916
00:49:56,621 --> 00:50:01,621
them.
But the idea that paradise is a walled 

917
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:02,880
garden is,
is a,

918
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,910
uh,
an echo back to the chaos order idea,

919
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,290
walls,
culture,

920
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,500
right garden nature.
So the proper human habitat is a 

921
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,160
properly tended garden.
Now,

922
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,580
the radical left leaning anti theist 
environmentalist's tend to make the case

923
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:28,291
that the predations of the Western 
capitalist system are a consequence of 

924
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:34,721
the injunction that was delivered in 
Genesis by God to man to go out and 

925
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:37,340
dominate the earth.

926
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,490
David Suzuki has talked a lot about this
by the way.

927
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:46,870
They believe that that statement has 
given rise to our inappropriate 

928
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:53,350
assumption that we have the right to 
exert control over the world and that 

929
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,941
that's what's turned us into these 
terrible predatory monsters sometimes 

930
00:50:57,941 --> 00:51:02,360
described as cancers on the face of the 
earth or viruses that have inhabited the

931
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:07,361
entire ecosystem who are doing nothing 
but one wandering everywhere and 

932
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:08,570
wreaking havoc as rapidly as we possibly
can.

933
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,930
Which is another perspective on the 
essential element of human kind that I 

934
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:18,320
find absolutely deplorable.
I mean,

935
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,510
if you look at the historical record,
for example,

936
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,150
even casually,
you'll find out that as early as,

937
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,370
as late as the late 18 hundreds,
18,

938
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:26,330
95,
thereabouts,

939
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,090
Thomas Huxley,
who was Elvis Huxley's grandfather and a

940
00:51:29,091 --> 00:51:34,091
great defender of Darwin,
prepared a report for the British 

941
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,751
government on ocean sustainability.
And his conclusion was fish away.

942
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:39,560
Guys,
man,

943
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,860
there's so many fish out there.
The oceans are so inexhaustible that no 

944
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,970
matter how hard humanity tried for,
for any number of years,

945
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:52,150
the probability that we could do more 
than put a dent in what was out there 

946
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,050
was zero.
Now Huxley turned out to be wrong.

947
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,110
He didn't realize that our population 
was going to spike so dramatically,

948
00:51:57,111 --> 00:52:02,111
partly because we got a little bit rich 
and our children's stopped dying at the 

949
00:52:02,111 --> 00:52:03,830
rate of like 60 percent before they were
one years old.

950
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:08,831
And you know,
we actually managed to populate the 

951
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:12,040
earth with a few people,
but it wasn't really until 1960 or so 

952
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,371
that we woke up to the fact that there 
were so many of us that we actually had 

953
00:52:15,371 --> 00:52:15,890
to start paying attention to what we 
were doing to the planet.

954
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:18,110
And that's like what 50 years ago?
Well,

955
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,350
we've just started to develop the 
technology,

956
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:25,880
have the wherewithal to understand that 
the whole world might be well considered

957
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:30,881
a garden,
and we need to live inside the proper 

958
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:31,520
balance between culture and order or 
culture and,

959
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,230
and,
and chaos.

960
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:39,070
Before that,
we were spending all of our time just 

961
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,430
trying not to die and usually very 
unsuccessfully.

962
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:41,540
So.

963
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:48,530
So I don't agree with that 
interpretation of the opening section of

964
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:53,531
Genesis.
I don't believe that it's given human 

965
00:52:53,531 --> 00:52:54,440
being is the right to act as super 
predators on the planet.

966
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:59,441
I think that instead the proper 
environment for human beings is 

967
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:01,970
presented quite properly as a garden and
that the role of people,

968
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:05,030
and that's explicitly stated in,
in the second story of Adam and eve,

969
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:10,031
was to tend the garden.
And that means to make the proper 

970
00:53:10,031 --> 00:53:12,860
decisions and to make sure that 
everything thrives and flourishes and so

971
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:15,860
that it's good for the things that are 
living there that aren't just people,

972
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:18,260
but also good for the people too.
So fine.

973
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:23,261
I think we can.
We could at least note that that's a 

974
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:26,770
slightly different take on the story 
than the ultimately cynical 

975
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,770
interpretation that's so commonly put 
forward today.

976
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,220
Now inside that walled garden is a 
couple of trees and Adam and eve and 

977
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,760
some animals and all of that,
and unfortunately the tree happens to 

978
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,760
have a snake wrapped around it.

979
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,530
Now that's an interesting thing.
We're going to talk about that a lot and

980
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:47,490
the snake in both of these 
representations is no ordinary snake say

981
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,830
it's got a human head and it's got a 
human head there too.

982
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,650
So whatever that snake is.
Well,

983
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:56,730
let forget about looking at this from a 
religious perspective,

984
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,760
like if you can just imagine that you're
an anthropologist and you've never seen 

985
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:01,760
this image before.
It's like,

986
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,160
what do you see?
Well,

987
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:06,090
you see walls and you see something,
a fairly pleasant enclosure,

988
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,730
and then you see a tree and people are 
eating from the tree,

989
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:10,950
but the tree has the snake in it that 
has a human head,

990
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,570
and so then you might think,
well,

991
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,570
what's a snake with a human head?
And then you think,

992
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:17,250
well,
it's half snake and half human.

993
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:20,990
That's hardly revelatory.
It's just self evidence.

994
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,160
So whatever that snake is isn't just a 
snake.

995
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,850
It snake and human or it's,
it's,

996
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:29,040
it's a snake and partakes in whatever 
human beings are.

997
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,720
And that's very important.
So we'll continue.

998
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:35,750
We'll consider that later.
And you see the same thing here and you 

999
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,650
see in this particular version,
there's the head is one also has wings 

1000
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,660
and so this is a wing snake,
sort of like a dragon.

1001
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,920
And so it crawls on the ground like a 
reptile and it's got an aerial aspect or

1002
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:49,050
a spiritual aspect.
So here it's a snake,

1003
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:51,540
which is like the lowest form of,
of Reptilian life.

1004
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:56,541
Say something that crawls on the ground.
It's something that's human and 

1005
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:56,541
something that's spiritual at the same 
time.

1006
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:59,970
And it inhabits the tree,
which look a lot like magic mushrooms by

1007
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:01,100
the way.
And uh,

1008
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:07,610
you can look that up if you want.
That's quite an interesting little 

1009
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:07,610
rabbit hole to wander down if you're 
curious about it.

1010
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,400
Um,
but,

1011
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:13,570
but there's an idea here too,
is that there was something in the 

1012
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:14,880
garden at the beginning of time that was
like a snake that was like a person that

1013
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:17,910
was like something that was winged,
something spiritual.

1014
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:22,911
So it's spiritual,
human and Reptilian all at the same 

1015
00:55:22,911 --> 00:55:25,401
time.
And it's the animating spirit of the 

1016
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:25,401
tree.
Okay?

1017
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:26,040
So keep that in mind.

1018
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,880
Thus the heavens and the earth were 
finished.

1019
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:32,580
This is in relationship to genesis one 
and all the host of them.

1020
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:35,340
And on the seventh day,
God ended his work which he had made.

1021
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:37,530
And he rested on the seventh day from 
all his work,

1022
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:42,531
which he had made.
And God blessed the seventh day and 

1023
00:55:42,531 --> 00:55:43,050
sanctified it because that in it,
he had rested from all his work,

1024
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:46,050
which God created the maid.
That's wisdom in that one too.

1025
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,680
I think the idea of the sabbath,
you know,

1026
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:52,730
because one of the things I've worked 
with a lot of people who were hyper 

1027
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,971
conscientious and thing about hyper 
conscientious people is that they'll 

1028
00:55:55,971 --> 00:55:59,661
just work till they die and that's 
actually not very productive because 

1029
00:55:59,661 --> 00:56:02,841
then they're dead and they can't work.
And so what you have to do with hyper 

1030
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:02,880
conscientious people is you have to say,
well,

1031
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:07,881
I know you'd rather do nothing but work 
and maybe you're just as guilty as you 

1032
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:07,881
can possibly be when you're not working.

1033
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:10,110
But let's figure out what you're up to 
and what you're up to.

1034
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,880
In all probability is the attempt to be 
productive in the least problematic,

1035
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:20,090
longest sustaining possible manner.
And that might mean you have to take a 

1036
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:24,321
rest.
And so one of the things I used to work 

1037
00:56:24,321 --> 00:56:27,291
with lawyers with people who had risen 
to the top of large law firms and they 

1038
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:31,531
were hyper productive types and they're 
often trying to hit their impossible 

1039
00:56:31,531 --> 00:56:35,110
quota for yearly hours and,
and burning themselves to a frazzle.

1040
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:37,240
As a consequence.
And one of the things that we used to do

1041
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:40,600
was he couldn't work fewer hours a day 
that just didn't work.

1042
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,090
But what we did was we'd have them take 
more time off,

1043
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,460
you know,
like a four day weekend every two months

1044
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:47,800
or something that was plotted out into 
the future.

1045
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,250
And then we track their billable hours,
which is their degree of productivity.

1046
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:56,250
It would actually increase.
So that was so cool because you could 

1047
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:56,250
take hardworking people and you could 
say,

1048
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:56,350
look,
you know,

1049
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,690
take break.
Why?

1050
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,450
Well,
because you'll be more productive if you

1051
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:02,530
take a break.
No,

1052
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:07,531
that couldn't possibly be like,
I should just work flat out all the 

1053
00:57:07,531 --> 00:57:07,531
time.
It's like,

1054
00:57:07,531 --> 00:57:07,531
let's test that out.
You take a break now.

1055
00:57:07,531 --> 00:57:08,590
And that it's like,
well,

1056
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,410
what happened was their productivity 
would increase often by 10 percent.

1057
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,450
So there's a,
there's wisdom here too,

1058
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:18,451
which is okay.
And this is alludes to the Adam and Eve 

1059
00:57:18,451 --> 00:57:19,960
story near the end.
You,

1060
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,580
you,
you're self conscious,

1061
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,220
you discover the future,
you have to work well.

1062
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:25,840
Then the question is how much should you
work?

1063
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:30,930
And one answer is you better bloody well
work all the time because no matter how 

1064
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:31,540
much work you do,
you're not solving your problems.

1065
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,130
They're coming along,
man,

1066
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,990
and you can stack up all the money you 
want,

1067
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:36,370
you can stack up all the wealth you 
want,

1068
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,770
it is not going to protect you in the 
final analysis.

1069
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,040
So you better be hitting the ground 
running and you better run flat out all 

1070
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,040
the time.
Or what happens if you do that?

1071
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,170
Well then you die.
That's not a good solution.

1072
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,380
So maybe you should rest.
And so how does that risk get 

1073
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:52,380
instantiated?
Well,

1074
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,630
it's not an easy to tell,
but one way to do it,

1075
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,490
let's say conceptually is to say,
look,

1076
00:57:57,491 --> 00:58:02,491
even God had to rest one day a week.
And so you don't have to be so 

1077
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:06,121
presumptuous to assume that if God had 
to rest one day a week that maybe you 

1078
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:10,711
know,
you are allowed to work nonstop without 

1079
00:58:11,651 --> 00:58:13,840
a break at all.
You know?

1080
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:15,820
And,
and I think our culture has slipped into

1081
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:19,120
that in quite a dangerous way because 
everything is open all the time.

1082
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:19,630
And I mean,
I'm,

1083
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,150
I'm find that just as convenient as the 
rest of you,

1084
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:25,660
but you know,
it's so strange to talk to modern people

1085
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:27,310
because one of the things they always 
tell you,

1086
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:27,700
we say,
well,

1087
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:29,260
how are you and what do they always say?

1088
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,970
They don't say good.
They don't say bad.

1089
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:32,710
They say busy.
It's like,

1090
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:33,400
yeah,
well,

1091
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:39,690
okay.
This is where genesis two starts and we 

1092
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:44,791
finally got there.
These are the generations of the 

1093
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:47,101
heavens,
end of the earth when they were created 

1094
00:58:47,101 --> 00:58:48,490
in the day that the Lord God made the 
Earth and the heavens and every plant of

1095
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:53,491
the field before it was in the earth,
and every herb of the field before it 

1096
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:56,281
grew for the Lord.
God had not caused it to rain upon the 

1097
00:58:56,281 --> 00:58:56,860
earth and there was not a man to till 
the ground,

1098
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,770
but they're wind type of mist from the 
earth and water,

1099
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:05,771
the whole face of the ground.
And the Lord God formed man of the dust 

1100
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:07,450
of the ground and breathed into his 
nostrils the breath of life.

1101
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,450
And man became a living soul.
Well,

1102
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:12,100
you know,
there's some archaic thinking in there.

1103
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,420
The breath is life,
right?

1104
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:14,800
That psyche,
that spirit,

1105
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,660
that's inspiration,
that's respiration,

1106
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:18,940
that's all associates.
It's Numa,

1107
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:24,210
pneumatic tire,
it's breath and the reason that people 

1108
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:24,610
associated life with breath,
well,

1109
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:25,870
that's not so foolish.
You know,

1110
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:30,890
I mean you're breathing man and 
something you do all the time and when 

1111
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:34,421
you die you start breathing.
And so the idea that there's something 

1112
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:36,020
integral to life about breathing is a 
perfectly reasonable supposition.

1113
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:41,021
It actually happens to be very true and 
they'll tend to associate the act of 

1114
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:45,360
creation with the active first of all,
inspiration and respiration and,

1115
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,030
and the breathing of,
of,

1116
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,040
of life into something that was inanna.
But is,

1117
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:54,090
is well,
what do you expect for a one sentence 

1118
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:54,090
description?
It's not a bad one sentence description,

1119
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,630
you know,
so and the Lord God planted a garden 

1120
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,870
eastward and eaten and eaten means 
well-watered place.

1121
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,870
And that's particularly relevant I 
suppose if you're a desert dweller,

1122
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:07,871
right?
Because the issue there is can you get 

1123
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:09,410
enough water to make things grow?
And so the walled garden,

1124
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:11,000
which is paradise,
is also Eden,

1125
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:14,600
which is a well watered place and water 
has the element of chaos.

1126
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,300
We already saw that in relationship to 
genesis one,

1127
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:21,380
where the underlying chaos was often 
assimilated symbolically to water.

1128
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:26,710
And so the idea too is that a certain 
amount of chaos has to be brought into 

1129
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:27,770
the order in order for it to be 
fruitful.

1130
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:32,771
And you can see that in the form of of 
allowing in the water and out of the 

1131
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:36,971
ground made the Lord God to grow every 
tree that is pleasant to the sight and 

1132
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:40,871
good for food.
The tree of life also in the midst of 

1133
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:41,510
the garden and the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.

1134
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,570
So two trees are marked out among the 
rest.

1135
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:48,200
One is the tree of life and one is the 
tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

1136
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:53,201
Now you know,
you know when you read something like 

1137
01:00:53,201 --> 01:00:53,201
that,
if you're thinking about it,

1138
01:00:53,201 --> 01:00:57,341
that you're in a metaphorical space.
Now we've got to be careful about 

1139
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:58,650
metaphors because you know,
I could say,

1140
01:00:58,651 --> 01:01:01,730
and he had that the chaos order idea is 
a metaphor,

1141
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:03,170
but then I also said,
well,

1142
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:04,940
wait a second.
It's a metaphor,

1143
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:07,730
but it's also what your brain is adapted
to and so you know,

1144
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:12,731
let's just not be pushing the idea that 
it's merely a metaphor to heart and the 

1145
01:01:12,731 --> 01:01:14,690
same thing is,
is here is happening here.

1146
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:19,691
These are metaphors,
the tree of life and the tree of the 

1147
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:23,351
knowledge of good and evil,
but that doesn't exactly mean that 

1148
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:24,380
they're mere metaphors because 
sometimes,

1149
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:30,100
as I mentioned before and abs,
if you have a set of things and you 

1150
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,821
abstract out from them a common element,
you can make a strong case that the 

1151
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:36,440
common element is more real than the set
of things from which you extracted it.

1152
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:38,390
That's the whole utility.
That abstraction.

1153
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,800
Why would you bother with it?
Otherwise,

1154
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:41,930
if you can't take a set of things and 
say,

1155
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:46,931
look,
there's something in common across this 

1156
01:01:46,931 --> 01:01:46,931
set of things that's more important than
the differences between them,

1157
01:01:46,931 --> 01:01:48,260
then you wouldn't bother abstracting at 
all.

1158
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:53,530
And so the tree of life and the tree of 
the knowledge of good and evil are 

1159
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:53,530
abstractions.
Now,

1160
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:55,700
one of the questions is,
this is a tough one,

1161
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:56,360
man.
I've been trying.

1162
01:01:56,361 --> 01:02:01,361
I tried to figure out for a long time 
why have fruit and something you eat 

1163
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:06,281
would be associated with the 
transformation of psychology because 

1164
01:02:06,281 --> 01:02:07,490
that's basically what happens in the 
Adam and Eve story.

1165
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:09,530
Why would it be something that you eat 
now?

1166
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:11,570
Eric Norman,
who was one of young students,

1167
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,210
had written a fair bit about this and 
God a fairways with it.

1168
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:15,230
And he said,
well,

1169
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,210
you know,
we do have noted,

1170
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,470
we've noticed forever that the act of 
eating,

1171
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:21,690
especially if you're hungry,
especially if you're starving,

1172
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:24,030
produces a rapid spiritual 
transformation.

1173
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:24,510
Right?
I mean,

1174
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,670
some of you,
this is worth knowing.

1175
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,450
You probably have a crabby partner or 
child because everyone does.

1176
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,960
And one thing you might try is that if 
they get erratic during the day and get 

1177
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,230
all volatile about nothing at all,
it's given them something to eat.

1178
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,640
Really.
I'll tell you,

1179
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,610
man,
the this solves for.

1180
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,520
I do this with my clinical clients all 
the time.

1181
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,110
It's like they say,
well,

1182
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:47,820
I fly off the handle at the littlest 
things.

1183
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:48,420
It's like,
okay,

1184
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,800
yeah,
just try this for a week.

1185
01:02:49,801 --> 01:02:54,801
When you're crabby and unreasonable,
eat a piece of cheese or eat a peanut 

1186
01:02:54,801 --> 01:02:56,040
butter sandwich,
eat something that's high protein,

1187
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:58,470
high fat,
and then just wait 10 minutes and see if

1188
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:03,471
you're saying and you'll find out that 
you're saying after you eat so often 

1189
01:03:03,471 --> 01:03:06,300
that you just can't believe how crazy 
you are when you're hungry.

1190
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:07,920
Look,
here's.

1191
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:10,830
It's really absolutely bloody 
remarkable.

1192
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:12,240
So I'm telling you,
try this.

1193
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:12,790
It'll,
it'll,

1194
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,150
it'll.
Especially if you don't eat breakfast,

1195
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:18,660
this will change your life.
And so here,

1196
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,180
here's the practical bit of information 
for you to,

1197
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:24,090
for all of you,
antisocial types who are going to end up

1198
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:29,091
in prison.
So if you're in prison and you want to 

1199
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:31,200
go on parole,
okay,

1200
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:33,690
so you have to go in front of the judge 
and tell them why you're not going to do

1201
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:35,250
it again.
So here's the deal.

1202
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,280
Here's the deal.
It doesn't really matter what you did 

1203
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:40,530
and it doesn't really matter what you 
promise.

1204
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:44,490
What matters is whether you see the 
judge before lunch or after lunch,

1205
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,920
because if you see the judge after 
lunch,

1206
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:50,190
the probability that you will get parole
is 60 percent higher.

1207
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,420
Yeah,
right.

1208
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:56,250
That is just like so.
Never have an argument with your partner

1209
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,750
when you're hungry or when they're 
hungry.

1210
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,640
Especially if you want something from 
them.

1211
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:01,260
It's like,
here's the sandwich.

1212
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,480
They'll eat it.
Then there'll be happy.

1213
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,540
Then you can manipulate them before,
before that,

1214
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:07,110
man.
No.

1215
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,590
So,
you know,

1216
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:17,680
it's not that unreasonable to think that
there's a spirit in food because food 

1217
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,310
rejuvenates and it just doesn't 
rejuvenate you physically.

1218
01:04:19,311 --> 01:04:24,311
It rejuvenates you spiritually.
And then of course there's the other 

1219
01:04:24,311 --> 01:04:27,071
things that we consume that aren't 
exactly like food that have a walloping 

1220
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,490
spiritual impact like alcohol,
let's say,

1221
01:04:28,491 --> 01:04:31,600
which is a spirit and is regarded as 
[inaudible],

1222
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,240
right?
I mean,

1223
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:37,420
it's the god of the vine and the god of 
the vine and possesses you in and makes 

1224
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:38,090
you act all the fun ways that alcohol 
makes you act.

1225
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:43,120
You know,
the fun ways that you regret the next 

1226
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:43,120
day.
And uh,

1227
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,360
so,
so there's the spiritual element of that

1228
01:04:44,361 --> 01:04:46,130
too,
and then,

1229
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:51,220
but there's something even deeper that I
think is so cool that's associated with 

1230
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,641
food and information because the story 
of Adam and Eve represents the fruit as 

1231
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:58,250
producing a psychological 
transformation.

1232
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:03,280
And so the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil is an abstraction across trees 

1233
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,800
and it's trying to say here's something 
that's common across trees.

1234
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:10,400
It's a fruit that's common across trees.
It's something like that.

1235
01:05:10,401 --> 01:05:15,020
And so the fruit across it's common 
across trees is something you might call

1236
01:05:15,021 --> 01:05:16,460
food.
Fair enough.

1237
01:05:16,461 --> 01:05:21,461
That's a.
But here's something that's even more 

1238
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:23,821
cool.
The food that's stable across the entire

1239
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,770
domain of food isn't food.
It's information,

1240
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:32,520
it's information.
And we use the same bloody circuits in 

1241
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,731
our brain to forage for information that
squirrels used to forage for food that 

1242
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:36,730
animals use to forage for food.
It's the same circuit.

1243
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:41,910
And why is that?
Because we figured out that knowing 

1244
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:42,400
where things is,
knowing where the food is more important

1245
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:44,080
than having the food.
And so,

1246
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,880
so knowing where the food is,
is a form of mat,

1247
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:51,100
of food information is a form of food 
and once you,

1248
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,050
well that's why we're information 
foragers.

1249
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:58,230
And so once you grasp that and that 
ideas is embedded into the story of Adam

1250
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:03,331
and Eve,
so whatever it is that they ingest is a 

1251
01:06:03,331 --> 01:06:03,331
form of Metta food,
it's,

1252
01:06:03,331 --> 01:06:03,340
it's,
it's information.

1253
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,490
And,
and you know,

1254
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:06,370
we'll trade food for information,
right?

1255
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:10,030
So if you're stuck on the edge of the 
highway and you know your,

1256
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:15,510
your hoods up and you're going places,
thing has turned into a pile of junk 

1257
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:18,210
that you don't understand and somebody 
pulls beside,

1258
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:23,310
pulls up beside you and they're a 
mechanic and they point to something to 

1259
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:23,310
say,
well,

1260
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:26,341
just put that wire back on there.
You will immediately give them a 

1261
01:06:26,341 --> 01:06:26,341
sandwich,
right?

1262
01:06:26,341 --> 01:06:27,730
Or you offer them something in return.
You know what I mean?

1263
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:32,731
Because they've provided you with 
information that has value and it has 

1264
01:06:32,731 --> 01:06:34,210
value because it actually provides you 
with energy because information provides

1265
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:39,211
you with energy.
Because otherwise why would we bother 

1266
01:06:39,211 --> 01:06:41,191
with it?
And so food provides energy but so does 

1267
01:06:41,191 --> 01:06:41,350
information.
And so there's the,

1268
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,560
there's the idea of food that you 
abstract from everything you can eat,

1269
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:49,561
but then there's the idea of what you 
could abstract from all sources of food 

1270
01:06:49,561 --> 01:06:51,730
and the answer to that would be 
information and the trees that are being

1271
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:54,280
referred to an Adam and eve are these 
method trees.

1272
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:57,460
They're not ordinary trees,
just like paradise is.

1273
01:06:57,461 --> 01:07:02,461
No ordinary place,
just like Adam and eve are no ordinary 

1274
01:07:02,461 --> 01:07:05,281
people and just like the logos that God 
is using at the beginning of time is no 

1275
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:09,361
ordinary conception and these aren't.
They're not metaphors there more than 

1276
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:13,741
metaphors there.
I think of them as hyper realities is 

1277
01:07:13,741 --> 01:07:16,740
something like that.
Is there more real than what you see 

1278
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,411
there are more real than the reality 
that presents itself to you and lots of 

1279
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:19,411
things that are like that,
right?

1280
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:23,580
Numbers are like that.
We wouldn't think or abstract if there 

1281
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,000
weren't things that were more real than 
what we can see.

1282
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:31,510
So what's most real well,
that's partly what we're trying to 

1283
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,961
figure out and out of the ground made 
the Lord God to grow every tree that is 

1284
01:07:33,961 --> 01:07:34,780
pleasant to this sight.
And good for food,

1285
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:40,350
the tree of life also in the midst of 
the garden and the tree of knowledge of 

1286
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:44,281
good and evil,
and a river went out of Eden to water 

1287
01:07:44,281 --> 01:07:44,281
the garden.

1288
01:07:44,281 --> 01:07:46,770
And from then,
so it was part of and became into 

1289
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,541
foreheads.
That's produced a tremendous amount of 

1290
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:48,541
speculation.
Now,

1291
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:52,890
you know,
the garden of Eden is also the holy 

1292
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:52,890
city.
That's another way of thinking about,

1293
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:53,470
or it's Jerusalem,
right?

1294
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,080
Or it's the ideal state,
which could be the ideal city,

1295
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:59,620
or it could be an ideal state of being,
or could be the ideal psyche or it's all

1296
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:01,480
of those things stacked up at the same 
time.

1297
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,040
Right?
And this is a Mandela,

1298
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,350
and this is the Mandela form that 
people,

1299
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:10,540
um,
what would you call hypothesized that 

1300
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,910
constituted the structure of paradise?
He knows it's got this cross form that's

1301
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,440
eating itself.
And there's the center eden,

1302
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:17,720
and there's the rivers are rivers,
not snakes.

1303
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:22,721
Those are the rivers that go out of it.
And they're turned into these Mandela 

1304
01:08:22,721 --> 01:08:23,900
images that are representative of what 
you described as the self,

1305
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:28,901
which would be the center element of 
being that he associates of conscious 

1306
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:29,870
being that he associated with divinity,
I would say,

1307
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,270
but also with the idea of the holy city.

1308
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:37,330
And so I'm just showing you that to show
you what were the imagination has taken 

1309
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:42,191
ideas of paradise.
So the name of the river is pies and 

1310
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,040
that is which compensates the whole land
of Avila,

1311
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:48,170
whether is gold and the gold of that 
land is good.

1312
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:53,410
There's Bedelia.
I'm in the onyx stone and the name of 

1313
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:55,841
the second reverse jihad the same isn't 
that compass at the whole land of 

1314
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:59,051
Ethiopia.
And the name of the third river is 

1315
01:08:59,051 --> 01:08:59,051
headache cal or had echo,
I don't know.

1316
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:01,230
That is it.
Which goes towards the east of Assyria.

1317
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:06,310
And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
So there's this strange intermingling 

1318
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,270
there of geography with mythical 
geography.

1319
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:13,300
Right?
Which you see happen fairly frequently 

1320
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,251
in the books and the Lord God took the 
man and put them in the garden of Eden 

1321
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:16,760
to dress it and keep it.
Okay.

1322
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,830
So that's good,
that's a good command.

1323
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,380
That's what you're supposed to do is 
take care of the damn thing.

1324
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,060
It was a lot of work to make,
right?

1325
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:28,061
Took a whole week,
and the Lord God commanded the man 

1326
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:32,600
saying of every tree of the garden,
thou mayest freely eat,

1327
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,210
but of the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil,

1328
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,840
thou shalt not eat of it for the day 
that thou eat thereof,

1329
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:43,870
thou shalt surely die.
While there's this bunch of questions 

1330
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:47,780
there that people have been puzzling,
puzzling over for a long time.

1331
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:51,440
Goddy he's a tricky character in the 
story of Adam and eve.

1332
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:52,040
It's like,
well,

1333
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,990
okay,
if we can't eat the damn thing while why

1334
01:09:53,991 --> 01:09:56,330
put it in the garden to begin with,
that would be one question.

1335
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,760
And uh,
you made us.

1336
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:03,761
And then you told us not to eat this 
knowing perfectly well that the first 

1337
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:05,240
thing we were going to do is eat it 
because people are of exactly that type,

1338
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:09,200
which is that if you say to them with 
their insatiable satiable curiosity,

1339
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:14,590
this is all fine and nice,
but over here is something you should 

1340
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:14,590
never look at.

1341
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,770
And then you leave the room.
It's like everybody is over there trying

1342
01:10:15,771 --> 01:10:18,050
to figure out what the hell that thing 
is instantly,

1343
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:19,760
right?
Because we're curious,

1344
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:20,840
curious,
curious,

1345
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:25,841
curious creatures.
And so you have to wonder exactly what 

1346
01:10:25,841 --> 01:10:27,410
God was up to here.
And there's gnostic speculation that the

1347
01:10:27,411 --> 01:10:30,110
original God,
this one was not really a very good God.

1348
01:10:30,111 --> 01:10:35,111
He was kind of an unconscious evil God 
and that he wanted his creation to be 

1349
01:10:35,111 --> 01:10:37,520
unconscious and so for bade them from 
developing consciousness and that it was

1350
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:42,521
a higher God who and maybe in the form 
of the serpent who tempted human beings 

1351
01:10:42,521 --> 01:10:45,200
towards consciousness.
And you know that that idea got scrubbed

1352
01:10:45,201 --> 01:10:46,970
out of classic Christianity Pretty 
early.

1353
01:10:46,971 --> 01:10:51,971
Although there's something that's 
interesting about it and there are 

1354
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:53,210
remnants of it in different forums that 
stayed inside this story.

1355
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:58,560
I'm like the idea that the fall was a 
terrible tragedy,

1356
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:02,540
but on the other hand,
it was the precondition for the greatest

1357
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:07,541
event in history,
which was the birth of Christ and the 

1358
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:07,541
redemption of mankind.

1359
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:09,590
And so it's complicated.
Let's put it that way.

1360
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,520
God only knows what God was up to you,
but uh,

1361
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:17,130
you know,
this is a good example of that 

1362
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:17,130
ambivalence.
And to me again,

1363
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:21,101
that it's an indication of the 
sophistication of the people who put 

1364
01:11:21,101 --> 01:11:23,931
these stories together.
I also considered this somewhat 

1365
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:23,931
miraculous because,
you know,

1366
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:25,230
if you're just a simple propagandist of 
sorts,

1367
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,660
you wouldn't leave this sort of 
complexity in the text.

1368
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:30,360
You just get rid of that because if 
you're a propagandist,

1369
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:33,320
everything is supposed to make sense 
along the ideological plane.

1370
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,250
Here God is supposed to be good.
It's like,

1371
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:37,620
well,
we better get there to that line because

1372
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,080
something's up with it and it isn't 
obvious what it is,

1373
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:45,081
but that isn't what people did.
And to me that indicates that that they 

1374
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:48,351
were doing two things as they were 
trying not to be too careless with the 

1375
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:52,470
traditions that they were handed they 
they were,

1376
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:54,570
they were touching them at their peril.

1377
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:59,570
They were very careful with them and 
also that they were actually trying to 

1378
01:11:59,570 --> 01:11:59,760
understand what was going on because why
otherwise keep this?

1379
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:04,761
Why not just simplify it or maybe just 
attribute this to the devil that would 

1380
01:12:04,761 --> 01:12:09,090
be easier and having God do it,
but then the Lord God said,

1381
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,720
it is not good that man should be alone.
I will make a help meet for him.

1382
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:18,230
None of the ground,
the Lord God formed every beast of the 

1383
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:20,361
field and every fall of the air and 
brought them unto Adam to see what he 

1384
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:23,631
would call them and whatsoever Adam 
called every living creature that was 

1385
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:25,140
the name thereof.
And Adam gave names to all the cattle in

1386
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:27,990
the fall of the catecholamines.
Animals basically and to the fall of the

1387
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:31,080
error and to every beast of the field.
But for Adam,

1388
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:32,610
there was not found to help meet for 
him.

1389
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:33,720
Okay.
Well,

1390
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:36,240
a couple of things.
Their speculations,

1391
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:41,510
number one,
it's like why does God care what Adam 

1392
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:44,181
calls the animals and the answer to that
seems to be that it's associated again 

1393
01:12:44,181 --> 01:12:45,570
with the magic of speech,
right,

1394
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:50,630
so that we know according to the story 
that human beings were already made in 

1395
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:54,591
the image of God and that God used 
language in order to call order from 

1396
01:12:54,591 --> 01:12:56,190
chaos and that human beings were made in
that image,

1397
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:01,340
and so there's an echo of that here,
even though it's from an independent 

1398
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:04,101
tradition and the echo is the thing 
isn't quite real until you name it and 

1399
01:13:04,101 --> 01:13:04,240
that's quite.
And that's,

1400
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,460
that's an interesting thing and we don't
exactly know how far that extends.

1401
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:13,550
It's certainly the case that like seem 
things often exist in a strange 

1402
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,820
potential form interconnected forum 
where everything's confusing,

1403
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:20,850
like a massive confusion before you put 
your finger on it,

1404
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:23,430
name it,
what's going on here?

1405
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,570
You name it,
it's like it.

1406
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:30,250
It carves it out from all that 
underlying chaos and makes it into a 

1407
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:32,550
grippable entity that you can then 
contend with.

1408
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,480
And you might say,
well,

1409
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:35,490
it was real before you named it.
It's like,

1410
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,440
well,
yes,

1411
01:13:37,441 --> 01:13:42,210
it was real before you named it the same
way things are there when there's no one

1412
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:47,211
there to perceive them and it isn't 
obvious how things are there when you're

1413
01:13:47,311 --> 01:13:52,311
not there to perceive the.
I'll tell you something bloody weird 

1414
01:13:52,311 --> 01:13:52,311
about perception.
You can look this up and John Wheeler,

1415
01:13:52,311 --> 01:13:53,290
John,
leaders of physicists,

1416
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,360
so here's a really cool thing.
Let's say you go outside at night and 

1417
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:02,001
you look up and you see a star and so a 
photon from that star enters your eye 

1418
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:05,980
and maybe that Fulton has been cruising 
along for like $30,

1419
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:10,990
million years.
Do you know that that photon would not 

1420
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:12,370
have been emitted from star at that 
time?

1421
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:17,370
If you're.
I wasn't there at that time to receive 

1422
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:17,370
it.
You think,

1423
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:21,390
well,
how in the hell can that because it 

1424
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:21,390
happened 20 million years ago.
It's like,

1425
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,360
well,
I don't know how it can be to tell you 

1426
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,101
the truth,
but I know that John Wheeler has done a 

1427
01:14:26,101 --> 01:14:28,711
very good job of detailing out why 
that's true and necessarily true and so 

1428
01:14:28,711 --> 01:14:33,321
in wheeler is also the physicist who 
developed the notion of it from bit and 

1429
01:14:33,321 --> 01:14:37,621
he believes that the world is best 
construed as the potential of the world 

1430
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:40,480
is best construed as a place of 
information.

1431
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:45,481
It's something like latent information 
and that what consciousness does is 

1432
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,950
transform the latent interest in 
information into something like concrete

1433
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:51,700
reality and he doesn't mean that 
metaphorically and one of the cases that

1434
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:56,701
he makes in that regard is this story 
that I just told you is that the photon 

1435
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,810
couldn't have left from where it was 
unless it had a place to go.

1436
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:04,470
Now it's.
It's complicated and confusing because 

1437
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,110
from the perspective of a beam of light 
from a full time,

1438
01:15:05,111 --> 01:15:08,250
there is no time and there's no distance
from one point to another one.

1439
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:13,470
Of course,
that's completely impossible to 

1440
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:13,470
understand too,
but from the perspective of a Photon,

1441
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:17,760
the universe is completely flat,
perpendicular to the direction that the 

1442
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,360
photon is traveling,
so it's there and here at the same time.

1443
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,000
For us it's not,
it's like 20 million years ago,

1444
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:24,310
but for the photon it's all here and 
now.

1445
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:29,490
So anyways,
the reason I'm telling you all that is 

1446
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:31,450
because the relationship between 
consciousness and reality is by no means

1447
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,810
straightforward.
It is seriously not straightforward.

1448
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:40,140
And physicists,
physicists debate what the relationship 

1449
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:44,371
is between consciousness and reality and
they debate about what the sort of 

1450
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:48,361
phenomena that I just described mean,
and I'm not really qualified to enter 

1451
01:15:48,361 --> 01:15:48,400
into that debate because I'm not a 
physicist,

1452
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,640
but I do know and I've read a fair bit 
of wheeler is about as much of it as I 

1453
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,150
can understand and I do at least know 
that that's what he claimed.

1454
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:00,070
And I also know that that claim is not.
That's a claim that it's taken seriously

1455
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:03,640
among physicists of the caliber of the 
physicist who can understand wheeler.

1456
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:06,520
So that's pretty interesting.
So anyways,

1457
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:11,820
there is emphasis again on this 
importance of naming in order to make 

1458
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:11,820
things real.
You know,

1459
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:15,520
when sometimes people won't name things 
just so they don't become real.

1460
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,620
So you know if,
if you're,

1461
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:22,680
if you have a relationship,
which undoubtedly you do and it has 

1462
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:22,680
problems,
which undoubtedly it does,

1463
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:27,030
you bloody well know that lots of times 
there's something under the carpet that 

1464
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:27,030
no one wants to name and everybody's 
thinking,

1465
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,150
well,
as long as we don't name it,

1466
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:33,151
it's not really there.
And in some sense it really isn't there 

1467
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:36,121
because you can act as if it's not there
and get away with it at least for short 

1468
01:16:36,121 --> 01:16:36,880
periods of time.
But as soon as you name that thing,

1469
01:16:36,881 --> 01:16:41,881
it's like you give it form and it's 
there and no one can ignore it and 

1470
01:16:41,881 --> 01:16:45,241
that's annoying because then you have to
deal with it or an or or face the 

1471
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:45,241
consequences.

1472
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:46,960
But the reason I'm telling you that is 
because we have a,

1473
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:52,480
an intuition even that we can have 
things not exist by not naming them.

1474
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:57,630
You name it.
And it comes forward with staggering 

1475
01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:58,330
clarity.
And it's not as if naming it is the only

1476
01:16:58,331 --> 01:17:03,331
thing that gives it reality,
but it is something like it sharpens it 

1477
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:06,160
and brings it into focus and it gives it
borders and barriers and borders and 

1478
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,300
boundaries.
And so anyways,

1479
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:09,770
God's interested enough in what Adam has
to say,

1480
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:13,400
that he has a name all the animals and 
that sort of makes them into animals.

1481
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:16,430
Now there's more to the linguistic story
than that.

1482
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:19,490
So social psychologists,
Roger Brown was one of them,

1483
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,760
studied this really interesting 
phenomena which is associated with a 

1484
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,000
relationship between perception and 
action.

1485
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:29,000
You know how a kid will call a 
particular animal,

1486
01:17:29,001 --> 01:17:30,440
a cat?
Well,

1487
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,110
the word cat is very short,
like the word dog.

1488
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,930
And it turns out that,
you know,

1489
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:40,390
you could think that we could perceive 
cats as multicellular organisms.

1490
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:43,130
Like we could see the self,
we could see the molecules,

1491
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:48,131
we could see the atoms,
we could see where we could see the 

1492
01:17:48,131 --> 01:17:48,350
ecosystem that the cat is part of,
but we don't.

1493
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,520
Or,
or maybe the broader mammalian 

1494
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,081
classification that it's part of.
We could perceive that as the unit of 

1495
01:17:56,081 --> 01:17:56,240
perception.
But we don't.

1496
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:01,480
We perceive things at the level of cat 
and you can tell the perceptual level 

1497
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:06,970
that people naturally perceive that 
which doesn't seem to be socio 

1498
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:07,760
culturally determined to any great 
degree by the way,

1499
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:11,840
because the words are often short and 
easily remembered and early learned,

1500
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:17,350
and so there's this level of analysis 
out of all the possible levels of 

1501
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:21,911
analysis that the world does exist as we
perceive it at a certain level of 

1502
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:26,381
analysis and that level of analysis 
seems to have something to do with the 

1503
01:18:26,381 --> 01:18:26,381
world's functional utility.

1504
01:18:26,381 --> 01:18:31,210
For us at that level and the perception 
at that level and the naming at that 

1505
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:33,440
level gives things a reality at that 
level.

1506
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:38,830
You know,
because the thing about things is that 

1507
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:38,830
they're not easily separable from other 
things.

1508
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:43,631
They tangled together and all sorts of 
strange ways and yet when we cast our 

1509
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:47,180
eye and and,
and use our language to orient ourselves

1510
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:52,181
in the world,
we cut things up into discrete 

1511
01:18:52,181 --> 01:18:52,910
discriminate objects that we can then 
utilize.

1512
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:57,911
And there's something about that that 
makes them real in a way that they're 

1513
01:18:57,911 --> 01:19:01,060
interconnected potential.
The interconnected potential that they 

1514
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:01,520
were before that.
That it's not,

1515
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:04,880
it's not real in the same way.
At least I think it's even less real.

1516
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:07,580
I think that's a right way of thinking 
about it even though it's not completely

1517
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:10,280
unreal,
but it's an eco.

1518
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,070
Adam's a little God at that point,
a little God,

1519
01:19:13,071 --> 01:19:15,370
the father and God's already done the 
groundwork,

1520
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,150
but Adam has to come along and says say,
well,

1521
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:17,870
that's a cat.

1522
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,410
It's like poof.
Whatever that is is now a cat and a dog,

1523
01:19:21,411 --> 01:19:24,080
and that's a sheep and you know it.
It gives them.

1524
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,600
It gives them something like pragmatic 
form,

1525
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:33,550
but for Adam,
there was not found a help meet for him 

1526
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:37,660
and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to 
fall upon Adam and he slept and he and 

1527
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,230
God took one of his ribs and closed up 
the flesh instead thereof,

1528
01:19:39,231 --> 01:19:42,860
and the rib which the Lord God had taken
from man made he a woman and brought her

1529
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,540
unto the man,
and Adam said,

1530
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:46,970
this is now bone of my bones and flesh 
of my flesh.

1531
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,730
She shall be called woman because she 
was taken out of man.

1532
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,870
Therefore shall a man leave his father.
And his mother and shall cleave unto his

1533
01:19:53,871 --> 01:19:58,871
wife and they shall be one flesh.
I thought walloping statement to put in 

1534
01:19:58,871 --> 01:20:02,561
there at the end of those three 
sentences mean that therefore it comes 

1535
01:20:02,561 --> 01:20:02,561
as somewhat of a surprise.

1536
01:20:02,561 --> 01:20:03,710
But there's an injunction there.
Well,

1537
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:05,030
it's a good injunction,
man.

1538
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:07,040
I'll tell you,
people who don't,

1539
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,540
that they have a hell of a time in their
marriage.

1540
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:12,750
And so this is a good thing to know if 
you are married or if you're planning to

1541
01:20:12,751 --> 01:20:16,990
get married is like,
you know,

1542
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,280
we have very strong orientation towards 
our parents and for good reason.

1543
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,800
It's like the injunction here is that 
secondary,

1544
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:29,820
soon as you're married and,
and failure to do that makes your 

1545
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:33,801
marriage collapse and then you deserve 
it to collapse too as far as I'm 

1546
01:20:33,801 --> 01:20:37,791
concerned because it's a reflection of 
your pathological immaturity and your 

1547
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:41,070
unwillingness to extract yourself from 
the grip of parents who are a little bit

1548
01:20:41,071 --> 01:20:43,800
too much on the interfering side.
But the injunction,

1549
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,390
there's,
there's a deep injunction here.

1550
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:50,160
It's very complicated.
So one of the ideas is that the original

1551
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:54,330
Adam wasn't a man like,
like a separate band.

1552
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:59,620
It was more like a hermaphroditic being 
and in that Hymn Afra Didik being there 

1553
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:03,351
was a kind of undifferentiated 
perfection and then that was split into 

1554
01:21:03,351 --> 01:21:07,580
male and female and then that part of 
the goal of human beings is to reunite 

1555
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:11,901
that as the singular unity that 
reestablishes the initial perfection and

1556
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:14,430
that's actually the goal of marriage 
from a spiritual perspective.

1557
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:19,431
And you could read about that if you 
read young because he wrote quite a bit 

1558
01:21:19,431 --> 01:21:19,431
about that.
So lovely.

1559
01:21:19,431 --> 01:21:23,271
It's such a good idea.
So I had these friends that went to 

1560
01:21:23,271 --> 01:21:24,090
Sweden to get married.
They were more.

1561
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,490
They were from northern Alberta,
but his heritage,

1562
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,900
they're both.
Their heritage is were Swedish,

1563
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:32,930
Swedish,
and in this ceremony they did this cool 

1564
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:37,071
thing as they were being married and 
they had to hold a candle up between 

1565
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:37,890
them,
right while they were being married.

1566
01:21:37,891 --> 01:21:38,610
And you think,
well,

1567
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:39,840
okay,
what's The candle?

1568
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:43,440
That's a source of light,
source of illumination,

1569
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,270
right?
Source of enlightenment.

1570
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:48,510
It's the candle that you put on 
Christmas trees and in Europe.

1571
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,630
So it's the light that emerges in the 
darkness and the depth of winter.

1572
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,290
It's a symbol of life in,
in,

1573
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:56,310
in darkness.
It's the reemergence of the sun that the

1574
01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:58,920
at the darkest,
coldest time of the year,

1575
01:21:58,921 --> 01:22:01,370
which is also associated symbolically 
with the,

1576
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:04,470
with the birth of Christ,
for all sorts of complicated reasons.

1577
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:06,030
And so the candles,
all that.

1578
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,550
And then the next question is why do you
hold it above you?

1579
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,100
And the answer is because what's above 
you is what?

1580
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:16,101
You're below two.
So it singles to simplify something 

1581
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:16,290
transcendent.
And so why do you both hold onto it?

1582
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:21,510
Well,
because you're both supposed to hold 

1583
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:21,510
onto the light,
right?

1584
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,380
And you're supposed to be subordinate to
the light.

1585
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,760
And so you ask,
well,

1586
01:22:23,761 --> 01:22:25,170
who's in charge of the marriage?

1587
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,250
Well,
the light,

1588
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:29,460
that's the idea.
So you come together as one thing.

1589
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:34,461
You're no longer two things.
It isn't what's good for you and it's 

1590
01:22:34,461 --> 01:22:35,430
not what's good for your wife.
It's what's good for the marriage.

1591
01:22:35,431 --> 01:22:37,830
And the marriage is about the combined 
being,

1592
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:40,280
which is the reassembly of the original 
Hermes,

1593
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:41,400
Hermes,
Herma,

1594
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:44,580
phronetic,
hermaphroditic being at the beginning of

1595
01:22:44,581 --> 01:22:46,410
time.
That's the idea.

1596
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:49,320
And that's all packed into like these 
four sentences.

1597
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:50,220
And,
you know,

1598
01:22:50,221 --> 01:22:51,610
there's been,
well,

1599
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:56,720
all of these sentences have tremendous 
history of interpretation associated 

1600
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:56,720
with them,
right?

1601
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,870
It's just endless and endless and 
endless.

1602
01:22:57,871 --> 01:23:01,890
And that's one of the lines.
And so it's also an antidote to the idea

1603
01:23:01,891 --> 01:23:05,100
that women taken out of man,
which is obviously the reverse.

1604
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:09,400
The biological process by the way,
makes women in some sense subordinate to

1605
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:12,790
men that is not built into this text.
I don't see that at all,

1606
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:16,290
is built into the text and there's 
something else that's associated with it

1607
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:16,510
too.

1608
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:19,330
And there's the idea that,
um,

1609
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:21,880
you know,
in,

1610
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:23,530
in,
in sleeping beauty,

1611
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,840
you know,
sleeping beauty goes to sleep.

1612
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:31,320
And the reason she goes to sleep is 
because you have to remember what 

1613
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,411
happens is she has parents who are quite
old and so they're pretty desperate to 

1614
01:23:34,411 --> 01:23:38,581
have a child,
like so many people are now and they 

1615
01:23:38,581 --> 01:23:39,010
only have one child like so many people 
do now.

1616
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:42,520
And they don't want to think it happened
to this child because like,

1617
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:47,521
hey,
it's a miracle and there's only one of 

1618
01:23:47,521 --> 01:23:47,521
them.
And so,

1619
01:23:47,521 --> 01:23:51,330
and she's the princess.
And so it's like we're not letting 

1620
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:51,430
anything around her.
So they have a big christening party,

1621
01:23:51,431 --> 01:23:53,020
right.
And the invite everybody,

1622
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:58,330
but they don't invite maleficent and 
maleficent is the terrible mother.

1623
01:23:58,331 --> 01:24:03,331
She's nature.
She's like the thing that goes bump in 

1624
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:03,490
the night.
She's the devil herself,

1625
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:04,360
so to speak.

1626
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,000
She's everything that you don't want 
your child to encounter.

1627
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,560
So the king and queen saying,
well,

1628
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:10,090
we just want to invite her to the 
Christening.

1629
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:10,690
It's like,
well,

1630
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:13,210
good luck with that.
That's an eatable story,

1631
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:18,211
right?
The eatable mother is the mother who 

1632
01:24:18,211 --> 01:24:20,371
devours her child by refusing,
by overprotecting him or her so that 

1633
01:24:20,371 --> 01:24:23,620
instead of being strengthened by an 
encounter with the terrible world,

1634
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:29,100
they're weakened by too much protection.
And then when they're let out into the 

1635
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:29,100
world,
they cannot live.

1636
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,680
And that's the story of sleeping beauty.
And that's what the king and Queen do.

1637
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:37,890
And they apologize to the,
to Melissa sent when she first shows up 

1638
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:37,890
and say,
well,

1639
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:42,631
you know,
they have a bunch of halfway to the 

1640
01:24:42,631 --> 01:24:42,631
excuses why they don't invite her.
We forgot.

1641
01:24:42,631 --> 01:24:42,631
It's like,
I don't think so.

1642
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:46,000
You know,
you don't forget something like that and

1643
01:24:46,001 --> 01:24:47,380
she kind of makes that point.

1644
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,480
It's right.
The whole horror of life.

1645
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,150
You don't forget about that when you 
have a child that's for sure.

1646
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:53,710
You might wish that it would stay at 
bay,

1647
01:24:53,711 --> 01:24:55,750
but you do not forget about it.
The question is,

1648
01:24:55,751 --> 01:25:00,751
do you invite it to the party and the 
answer is it bloody well depends how 

1649
01:25:00,751 --> 01:25:04,651
unconscious you want your child to be 
and if you want your child to be 

1650
01:25:04,651 --> 01:25:08,131
unconscious,
well then you have the added advantage 

1651
01:25:08,131 --> 01:25:10,051
that maybe they won't leave home and so 
you can take advantage of them for the 

1652
01:25:10,051 --> 01:25:12,010
rest of your sad life instead of going 
off to find something to do for yourself

1653
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:17,400
as well.
And then of course you can take revenge 

1654
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,681
on them if they do have any,
any what would you call impetus towards 

1655
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:22,921
courage that you sacrificed yourself 30 
years ago and want to stamp out as soon 

1656
01:25:22,921 --> 01:25:23,110
as you see it developing your child.

1657
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:25,120
That's another thing that would be quite
pleasant,

1658
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,610
and so that's what happens in sleeping 
beauty.

1659
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:28,570
Yeah.
Well,

1660
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,840
none of this is pleasant and nothing 
that happens in that story as pleasant,

1661
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,880
so sleeping beauty,
she's naive as hell.

1662
01:25:33,881 --> 01:25:38,881
They put her out in the forest and have 
raised by these three like goody two 

1663
01:25:38,881 --> 01:25:42,121
shoes,
ferries that are also completely devoid 

1664
01:25:42,121 --> 01:25:42,121
of any real potency and power,
right?

1665
01:25:42,121 --> 01:25:43,930
There's no nothing maleficent about 
them.

1666
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:46,480
And then the first idiot prince that 
wanders by,

1667
01:25:46,481 --> 01:25:51,481
she falls in love with so badly that she
has post traumatic stress disorder 

1668
01:25:51,481 --> 01:25:52,240
really rides off on his horse,
right?

1669
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,700
That's what happens.
And then she,

1670
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:58,150
then she goes into the castle and she's 
all freaked out because she met the love

1671
01:25:58,151 --> 01:26:00,670
of her life for like five minutes for 
God's sake.

1672
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:02,800
And you know,
that's when the spinning wheel,

1673
01:26:02,801 --> 01:26:06,260
that's the wheel of fate pops up and she
picks her finger right.

1674
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,000
They tried to get rid of all the 
spinning wheels.

1675
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:10,670
They tried to get rid of all the wheels 
of fate with their pointed end,

1676
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:15,940
but she finds it poked her fingers and 
finger falls down unconscious while she 

1677
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,870
wants to be unconscious and no bloody 
wonder.

1678
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:23,020
She was protected her whole life.
She so damn naive that her first love 

1679
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:26,501
affair just about kills her.
She wants to go to sleep and never wake 

1680
01:26:26,501 --> 01:26:26,501
up.
And so that's exactly what happened.

1681
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,240
And then she has to wait for the prince 
to come and rescue her.

1682
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,850
What you think,
how sexist can you get that story?

1683
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:33,050
Well,
seriously,

1684
01:26:33,051 --> 01:26:35,400
because that's,
that's the way that that would be red.

1685
01:26:35,401 --> 01:26:39,110
And in the modern world it's like she 
doesn't need a prince to rescue her.

1686
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,860
That's why Disney made frozen that 
absolutely appalling piece of rubbish.

1687
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,040
So you know,
you can say,

1688
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:57,041
you can say,
well the princess doesn't need a prince 

1689
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:57,041
to rescue her,
but you know,

1690
01:26:57,041 --> 01:27:01,021
that's a bone headed way of looking at 
the story because the prince isn't just 

1691
01:27:01,021 --> 01:27:02,360
a man who's coming to rescue the woman 
and believe me,

1692
01:27:02,361 --> 01:27:03,500
he's got his own problems,
right?

1693
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:05,750
He's got a hold God damn dragon he has 
to contend with.

1694
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:11,040
But.
But the prince also represents the 

1695
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,500
woman's own consciousness.
That consciousness is presented very 

1696
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,740
frequently in stories as symbolically 
masculine as it is with the logo idea.

1697
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:21,770
And the idea is that without,
without that forward going courageous 

1698
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:26,021
consciousness,
a woman herself will drift into 

1699
01:27:26,021 --> 01:27:27,080
unconsciousness and terror and so you 
can read it as well.

1700
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:32,260
The woman who's sleeping needs a man to 
wake her up and of course just like a 

1701
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:36,221
man needs a woman to wake him up.
It's the same damn thing that's the 

1702
01:27:36,221 --> 01:27:36,221
dragon fight in sleeping beauty.

1703
01:27:36,221 --> 01:27:39,110
But it's also the case that if she's 
only unconscious,

1704
01:27:39,111 --> 01:27:44,111
all she can do is lay there and sleep 
the sleep of the naive and damned she 

1705
01:27:44,111 --> 01:27:49,091
has to wake up,
wake herself up and bring her own 

1706
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:52,721
consciousness,
your own masculine consciousness into 

1707
01:27:52,721 --> 01:27:52,730
the forefront so that she can survive in
the world.

1708
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:54,920
And of course women are trying to do 
that like mad.

1709
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,620
But that's partly what's represented in 
the story like that.

1710
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:02,890
And that's partly what's implicit in 
this idea is that unless the woman is 

1711
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:04,490
taken out of man,
so to speak,

1712
01:28:04,491 --> 01:28:07,340
then she isn't a human being.
She's just a creature.

1713
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,820
And that's partly what's embedded in 
this story.

1714
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:13,340
So you don't want to read it as a 
patriarchal,

1715
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:19,070
don't want to read anything that way.
So really it's really,

1716
01:28:19,071 --> 01:28:19,530
it's,
yeah,

1717
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,170
I won't,
I won't bother with that,

1718
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:23,150
but really we can do better than that 
man.

1719
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:26,540
Therefore shall a man leave his father 
and his mother and shall cleave unto his

1720
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:28,700
wife and they shall be one flesh.
It's like,

1721
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:29,960
yeah,
finger.

1722
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:32,420
The other thing about marriage,
this is really worth knowing too,

1723
01:28:32,421 --> 01:28:35,240
is that I learned this in part from 
reading youngest,

1724
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:36,650
like what do you do when you get 
married?

1725
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:41,950
That's easy.
You take someone who's just as useless 

1726
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:45,311
and horrible as you are,
and then you shackle yourself to them 

1727
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:50,350
and then you say,
we're not running away no matter what 

1728
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:51,440
happens.
Yeah.

1729
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:54,110
Well that's perfect because then you 
don't get to run away.

1730
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:57,110
And the thing is,
is like if you can run away,

1731
01:28:57,111 --> 01:29:02,111
you can't tell each other the truth 
because if you tell someone the truth 

1732
01:29:02,111 --> 01:29:02,111
about you,
they don't run away.

1733
01:29:02,111 --> 01:29:05,400
They weren't listening.
And so if you don't have someone around,

1734
01:29:05,401 --> 01:29:07,470
they can't run away,
then you can't tell them the truth.

1735
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:09,660
And so that's part of the purpose of the
marriage.

1736
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:10,290
It's like,
okay,

1737
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,060
okay,
I'll bet on you.

1738
01:29:12,061 --> 01:29:13,530
You bet on me.
It's a losing battle.

1739
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:16,680
We both know that,
but given our current circumstances were

1740
01:29:16,681 --> 01:29:19,050
unlikely to find anyone better,
that's for sure.

1741
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,850
No

1742
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:26,720
two things that come off of that.
One is,

1743
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,760
you know,
people are waiting around to find Mr and

1744
01:29:28,761 --> 01:29:29,450
Mrs.
Right?

1745
01:29:29,451 --> 01:29:31,070
It's like,
here's something to think about,

1746
01:29:31,071 --> 01:29:32,420
man,
to put yourself on your feet.

1747
01:29:32,421 --> 01:29:37,421
Right?
If you went to a party and you found Mr 

1748
01:29:37,421 --> 01:29:37,421
Wright and he looked at you and didn't 
run away screaming,

1749
01:29:37,421 --> 01:29:39,920
that would indicate that he wasn't Mr 
Wright at all.

1750
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:42,770
Right?
It's like the old Nietzschean joke.

1751
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:48,970
If someone loves you,
that should immediately disenchant you 

1752
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:49,090
with them.
Right?

1753
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:50,540
Right.
Or it's the woody Allen joke.

1754
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:53,150
I never belonged to a club that would 
take me as a member.

1755
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:55,180
So.
So that's,

1756
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:57,740
that's an interesting.
That's a very interesting thing to think

1757
01:29:57,741 --> 01:30:02,741
about and so you're going to shackle 
yourself to someone who's just as far as

1758
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:07,470
imperfect as you are.
And then the issue is you,

1759
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:12,660
you,
you might be in a situation where you 

1760
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:12,660
can actually negotiate because you might
think,

1761
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:17,980
well,
there's some things about you that 

1762
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:17,980
aren't going so.

1763
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:19,810
Right.
And there's some things about me that 

1764
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:19,850
aren't going so right and we're bloody 
well stuck with the consequences for the

1765
01:30:19,851 --> 01:30:21,620
next 50 years.
So we can.

1766
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:26,680
We can either straighten this out or we 
can suffer through it for the next five 

1767
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:31,211
decades and you know people are of the 
sort that without that degree of 

1768
01:30:31,211 --> 01:30:32,600
seriousness,
those problems will not be solved.

1769
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:37,810
You'll leave things unnamed because 
there's always an out and this the same 

1770
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:37,820
thing when you're living together with 
someone.

1771
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:43,060
You know that people who live together 
before they're married are more likely 

1772
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:43,060
to get divorced,
not less likely.

1773
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:47,410
And the reason for that is,
what exactly are you saying to one 

1774
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:47,510
another when you live with each other?
Just think about it.

1775
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:53,200
Well,
for now you're better than anything 

1776
01:30:54,531 --> 01:30:55,670
else.
I can trick,

1777
01:30:57,410 --> 01:31:02,410
but I'd love to reserve the right to 
trade you in conveniently.

1778
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:08,990
If someone beat her,
happens to stumble into me,

1779
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,000
well,
how can.

1780
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:20,450
How could someone not be insulted to 
their core by an offer like that?

1781
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:25,660
Now they're willing to play along with 
it because they're going to do the same 

1782
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:25,660
thing with you that.
Well,

1783
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:25,660
that's exactly it.
It's like,

1784
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:26,090
yeah,
yeah,

1785
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:31,150
I know you're not going to commit to me,
so that means you don't value me or our 

1786
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,660
relationship above everything else,
but as long as I get to escape,

1787
01:31:32,661 --> 01:31:34,610
if I need to,
then I'm willing to put up with that.

1788
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,410
It's like,
that's a hell of a thing.

1789
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,160
I mean,
you might think,

1790
01:31:37,161 --> 01:31:39,710
how stupid is it to shackle yourself to 
someone?

1791
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:40,640
It's like,
it's stupid,

1792
01:31:40,641 --> 01:31:41,840
man.
There's no doubt about that.

1793
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:47,080
But compared to the alternatives,
it's pretty damn good because without 

1794
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:51,371
that shackling,
there are things you will never ever 

1795
01:31:51,371 --> 01:31:54,551
learned because you'll avoid them.
You can always leave and if you can 

1796
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:55,130
leave then you don't have to tell each 
other the truth.

1797
01:31:55,460 --> 01:32:00,460
It's as simple as that because you can 
just leave and then you don't have 

1798
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:00,460
anyone.
You can tell the truth too.

1799
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:09,710
So there's some representations of the 
idea of the original.

1800
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:11,030
It's not.
This isn't all Adam,

1801
01:32:11,031 --> 01:32:13,460
this is,
this is an old Chinese symbol.

1802
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:15,560
I think it's fuck and new.
Uh,

1803
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:18,650
I think I have the pronunciation wrong,
but it's really cool.

1804
01:32:18,651 --> 01:32:19,100
See,
it's.

1805
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:23,150
See the snakes down here.
They're kind of like a DNA symbol,

1806
01:32:23,151 --> 01:32:28,151
which I find very interesting,
and so that's the original cosmic 

1807
01:32:28,151 --> 01:32:32,530
serpent that's sort of the potential out
of which that emerges and then that's 

1808
01:32:32,530 --> 01:32:35,831
the differentiation of that into male 
and female and so that's like the 

1809
01:32:35,831 --> 01:32:37,550
predatory unknown.
That's one way of thinking about it.

1810
01:32:37,551 --> 01:32:41,030
That's the most fundamental conception 
of mankind is something like that is the

1811
01:32:41,031 --> 01:32:46,031
predatory unknown and then the 
bifurcation of that into the two 

1812
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:46,910
fundamental cognitive elements of human 
perception,

1813
01:32:46,911 --> 01:32:49,520
masculine and female,
and you see the same thing here.

1814
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:51,150
This is Chinese.
This is Egypt,

1815
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,640
also extraordinarily old.

1816
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,880
It's the.
It's the great serpent that underlies 

1817
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:59,810
everything.
Ma indicating itself into Isis,

1818
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:04,930
queen of the underworld,
and Cyrus King of the King of King of 

1819
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:05,360
King Pharaoh,
King of order.

1820
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,580
You see the same thing in the middle of 
Dow chemical symbol.

1821
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:12,700
I love this one.
Does it looks quite a lot like the 

1822
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:12,700
little thing that Harry Potter chases 
around A.

1823
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,060
Yeah,
and that's not accidental by the way,

1824
01:33:14,061 --> 01:33:19,061
because the seeker is the same.
The thing that chases this and the 

1825
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:22,721
seeker that chases this and catches that
wind and that's a really old idea and 

1826
01:33:22,721 --> 01:33:26,591
how the Hell j Dot k rowling knew that I
cannot figure out because that is a 

1827
01:33:26,591 --> 01:33:26,591
very,
very archaic symbol,

1828
01:33:26,591 --> 01:33:30,830
arcane symbol on Google.
It's called the round chaos and the only

1829
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:36,220
reference to the round chaos that I can 
find on Google is on my webpage and so I

1830
01:33:36,531 --> 01:33:39,050
have no idea how Rollin came up with 
that.

1831
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:40,880
I mean,
I know she looked at a lot of old texts,

1832
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:44,330
but the idea that if you play the 
metagame and you catch this,

1833
01:33:44,331 --> 01:33:46,730
you win all the Games is exactly right 
in that.

1834
01:33:46,731 --> 01:33:49,640
And that's the for.
What's the name of that quidditch?

1835
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,460
Yeah,
so there's the potential that's like the

1836
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:57,461
potential out of which God made the 
world at the beginning of time and what 

1837
01:33:57,461 --> 01:33:58,190
emerges out of that is some kind of.
That's a dragon.

1838
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:03,600
The dragon fight.
That's partly the serpent that's in the 

1839
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,240
garden of Eden and then that's the 
manifestation of masculine and feminine.

1840
01:34:05,241 --> 01:34:08,840
Out of that potential predatory,
unknown,

1841
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:11,540
masculine and feminine.
It's like a single.

1842
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:16,840
It's like a single representation of the
evolutionary history of human cognitive 

1843
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:17,780
consciousness,
so cool,

1844
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,180
and then it's also an image of the 
ideal.

1845
01:34:20,181 --> 01:34:25,181
It's the Union of sun and moon and it's 
this hyper creature hermaphroditic 

1846
01:34:25,181 --> 01:34:29,920
that's also the Adam and eve that 
existed at the beginning of time before 

1847
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:30,860
the fall,
and it's the purpose of marriage.

1848
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,190
All of that as a sacrament.
All of that in these images.

1849
01:34:34,191 --> 01:34:39,191
It's just absolutely unbelievable what 
images can pack into them and there's 

1850
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:44,030
some more classical representations of 
eve being extracted from Adam

1851
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:50,340
and this is a cool line and they were 
both naked.

1852
01:34:50,341 --> 01:34:52,200
The man and his wife and were not 
ashamed.

1853
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:58,400
Well that.
See someone who wrote that would only 

1854
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,251
write that like that if they were 
surprised that they weren't ashamed 

1855
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:01,251
because why would you point it out 
otherwise?

1856
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:03,710
And so there's this intimation that have
two things.

1857
01:35:03,711 --> 01:35:08,300
Number one is there was a point at time 
in time when human beings were naked and

1858
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:13,301
they weren't ashamed of it,
and there is a point of time which is 

1859
01:35:13,301 --> 01:35:13,610
now where they're naked and they are 
ashamed of it.

1860
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:15,130
And then the question is,
well,

1861
01:35:15,131 --> 01:35:17,570
what's the association with nakedness 
and shame?

1862
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,500
And that's often given a sexual 
connotation in,

1863
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:26,360
in classic interpretations of the Adam 
and Eve story because of its association

1864
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,650
with nudity,
I presume.

1865
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:29,930
But I think it's a lot more complicated 
than that.

1866
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:34,940
So I think,
I know I noticed my daughter,

1867
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:38,390
she probably won't be very happy that 
I'm revealing this in this lecture,

1868
01:35:38,391 --> 01:35:43,391
but my daughter was never really 
concerned about nudity when she was a 

1869
01:35:43,391 --> 01:35:44,600
little kid and it was all the same to 
her one way or another.

1870
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:48,890
But my son by the time he was three man,
that kid was private.

1871
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:49,810
He,
his,

1872
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:52,250
his bedroom door was shut,
the bathroom door was shut.

1873
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:57,251
It was like get the hell out of here.
And that seemed to just happen of its 

1874
01:35:57,251 --> 01:35:57,251
own accord.
And you know,

1875
01:35:57,251 --> 01:35:58,940
we had two children and one was like 
that and the other one wasn't.

1876
01:35:58,941 --> 01:36:00,530
I didn't think we had much to do with it
at all.

1877
01:36:00,531 --> 01:36:03,200
But it was really fascinating to watch 
that emerge in him.

1878
01:36:03,650 --> 01:36:08,650
And you know that that sense of,
of self consciousness does seem to 

1879
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:09,530
emerge in children somewhere around the 
age of three.

1880
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:14,710
And you know,
that's generally also when we start 

1881
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:16,571
thinking that maybe having your baby 
wander around naked on a beach isn't 

1882
01:36:16,571 --> 01:36:16,571
exactly the best idea.
There's,

1883
01:36:16,571 --> 01:36:17,630
there's,
there's something like that.

1884
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:22,631
It's the nudity in children is generally
okay under some circumstances in public 

1885
01:36:22,631 --> 01:36:22,631
display.

1886
01:36:22,631 --> 01:36:27,190
We seem to think of that as merely I 
succeptible why might,

1887
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:32,340
I dunno why it stops being acceptable.
Well that has something to do with 

1888
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:34,250
sexuality obviously,
but it's a very complicated phenomena.

1889
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:36,830
But you know,
that whole nudity thing is the,

1890
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:38,840
is a very complicated thing.
I mean,

1891
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:40,810
first of all,
people are kind of strange because we're

1892
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:43,580
hairless roughly,
you know,

1893
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:47,180
compared to most animals.
And we don't know why that is.

1894
01:36:47,181 --> 01:36:52,181
Some people think it's because we lost 
our hair when we were wandering around 

1895
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:55,001
in the desert,
in the desert running around in Africa 

1896
01:36:55,001 --> 01:36:55,001
because we're really,
really good runners.

1897
01:36:55,001 --> 01:36:57,530
We can run down animals,
say like a human being in good shape can

1898
01:36:57,531 --> 01:37:02,531
run a horse to death in a week.
We can really run man and had a lot of 

1899
01:37:02,531 --> 01:37:03,980
our ancestors,
the Kalahari Bushman still do this.

1900
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:09,250
They just run an animal for it till it 
dies and that Bushman doesn't die.

1901
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:12,380
I mean they also sometimes shoot them 
with poison arrows but they can just run

1902
01:37:12,381 --> 01:37:17,381
them until they die.
So we have tremendous endurance and you 

1903
01:37:17,381 --> 01:37:20,500
and you have to be able to get rid of a 
lot of heat if you're going to run 

1904
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:20,500
around in the desert.
So we don't have much hair.

1905
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:25,091
That's one explanation.
And Buckminster Fuller had an 

1906
01:37:25,091 --> 01:37:27,521
interesting explanation which was he 
thinks that at some point during our 

1907
01:37:27,521 --> 01:37:29,270
evolution we spend a lot of time near 
the water and so we're like fish apes,

1908
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:30,800
something like that.
Well,

1909
01:37:30,801 --> 01:37:35,801
you know,
we like to be on the beach and there's 

1910
01:37:35,801 --> 01:37:37,301
lots of food there and we like to swim 
and we're really good at swimming for 

1911
01:37:37,301 --> 01:37:38,300
terrestrial creatures and we,
we cry salt.

1912
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:43,360
Here's like some seagoing creatures too.
And women have a layer of subcutaneous 

1913
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:47,291
fat,
like some going creature stew and we 

1914
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:47,291
have kind of our feet are,
which are very odd.

1915
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:49,880
Things are kind of good for flapping in 
the water,

1916
01:37:49,881 --> 01:37:54,881
although we can also walk with them.
And so he thought that maybe that 

1917
01:37:54,881 --> 01:37:55,300
adaptation was to,
to,

1918
01:37:55,410 --> 01:38:00,410
uh,
a water existence like seals and so 

1919
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:02,991
forth,
like we kind of went back to the ocean 

1920
01:38:02,991 --> 01:38:02,991
but not quite and so,
but anyways,

1921
01:38:02,991 --> 01:38:05,010
the evolution of that hairlessness is an
interesting thing,

1922
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:10,310
but it certainly does make us exposed to
the world in a way that animals that 

1923
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:12,060
have a covering a for art and then we're
upright,

1924
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:15,750
which is very strange because most 
animals aren't there on all fours.

1925
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:20,751
And so they're very vulnerable.
Parts are protected and not exposed to 

1926
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:21,900
view.
And then of course,

1927
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,640
when you're standing up nude,
your,

1928
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:25,880
your,
your fears,

1929
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:30,240
let's call it your psychophysiological 
quality is on painful display,

1930
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:35,780
right?
And people complain about that all the 

1931
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:35,780
time.
You know,

1932
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:35,970
if you look at the feminist tack for 
example,

1933
01:38:35,971 --> 01:38:40,971
on,
but the idea that women have eating 

1934
01:38:40,971 --> 01:38:42,861
disorders is,
is directly attributed to the presence 

1935
01:38:42,861 --> 01:38:44,760
of too many beautiful women on the cover
of magazines.

1936
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:48,360
Something like that.
Even though women by those magazines and

1937
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:53,361
they're attracted to the band,
their mood goes up when they purchase 

1938
01:38:53,361 --> 01:38:54,600
them and the if the,
if the stimulus was a negative,

1939
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:56,520
that women would avoid the magazines and
not by them.

1940
01:38:56,521 --> 01:38:58,770
So as a theory it's a very,
very bad one,

1941
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,560
but it's still the case that,
you know,

1942
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:03,750
it's still the case,
that standards of beauty,

1943
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:05,810
shame people and that's for sure and 
everyone,

1944
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,830
because if you're not ugly now,
man,

1945
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,570
you're going to be at some point in your
life.

1946
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:14,130
So that's kind of a rough thing to 
contend with.

1947
01:39:14,131 --> 01:39:14,540
Right?
It's,

1948
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:16,770
it's a rough thing to,
to know that,

1949
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:19,660
that there's an ideal that you could be 
and maybe even once we're,

1950
01:39:19,661 --> 01:39:21,560
that you're not going to be for long or,
or,

1951
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,840
or never were.
And it's really an appalling issue 

1952
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,430
because I think it's harder on women 
because women are judged by men more for

1953
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:32,850
their,
for their youth and fertility.

1954
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,580
That's how it turns out from an 
evolutionary point of view.

1955
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,790
Men are judged more on their 
socioeconomic status by women.

1956
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:41,370
It's harsh both ways,
but so anyways,

1957
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:41,840
it's,
you know,

1958
01:39:41,841 --> 01:39:46,841
it's a terrible thing to,
to carry the knowledge with you that 

1959
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:52,610
you're exposed to the most serious 
possible evaluation of the quality of 

1960
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:56,511
your being that you can possibly be 
exposed to all the time and that that's 

1961
01:39:56,511 --> 01:39:58,230
further amplified if you're without 
clothing.

1962
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:03,440
And so part of clothing is protection,
but a tremendous amount of it is merely 

1963
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,270
stopping other people from evaluating 
you too harshly all the time.

1964
01:40:06,271 --> 01:40:10,800
It just gets in the way.
So anyways,

1965
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:11,950
this store,
this,

1966
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:17,290
this story makes the case that at some 
point we weren't like that.

1967
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:18,520
Well,
animals aren't like that.

1968
01:40:18,521 --> 01:40:21,850
So it seems perfectly plausible in at 
some point we weren't like that,

1969
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:23,410
but at some point that changed.
And,

1970
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:29,160
and they were both naked,
the man and his wife and were not 

1971
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:29,160
ashamed.

1972
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,760
Now the serpent was more subtle than any
beast of the field,

1973
01:40:31,761 --> 01:40:34,820
which the Lord God had made.
And he said unto the woman,

1974
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:37,370
yea,
have God said you shall not eat of every

1975
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:39,200
tree of the garden.
I like this.

1976
01:40:39,201 --> 01:40:40,220
This is,
um.

1977
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:43,020
Oh,
I can't remember who did the etching.

1978
01:40:43,021 --> 01:40:43,760
Now,
who is it?

1979
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:45,230
Dra.
Yeah,

1980
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:46,160
Delray.
Exactly.

1981
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:51,170
Hee.
He duray did etchings for paradise lost 

1982
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:52,560
that are absolutely remarkable and this 
is Satan and this is the snake here.

1983
01:40:52,561 --> 01:40:57,561
And of course in the genesis story,
Satan is weirdly associated with the 

1984
01:40:57,561 --> 01:40:58,240
snake.
And I'll tell you that's a.

1985
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:03,650
that's a,
that's a tough one to sort out because 

1986
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:06,750
in the story of Adam and eve,
there no indication whatsoever that the 

1987
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:10,291
serpent who cam see there's also Satan,
the author of all evil and how in the 

1988
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:13,210
world those two stories got tangled 
together.

1989
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:16,300
Well,
I think I figured that out and I'm going

1990
01:41:16,301 --> 01:41:21,301
to tell you that tonight,
but it took a very long time to figure 

1991
01:41:21,301 --> 01:41:21,301
it out.

1992
01:41:21,301 --> 01:41:21,400
And it's absolutely.
It's so bloody brilliant.

1993
01:41:21,401 --> 01:41:23,350
I just can't believe that people figured
it out.

1994
01:41:23,351 --> 01:41:28,351
It's so.
It's so unbelievably spectacularly 

1995
01:41:28,351 --> 01:41:28,351
brilliant.
And that's a,

1996
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,280
that's a,
an intimation of that idea,

1997
01:41:30,281 --> 01:41:32,050
right?
That there's a kinship between these two

1998
01:41:32,051 --> 01:41:33,970
things.
So anyways,

1999
01:41:33,971 --> 01:41:36,310
the serpent was more subtle than any 
beast of the field.

2000
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:37,750
Subtle.
It's an interesting word.

2001
01:41:37,751 --> 01:41:39,790
This is from the Oxford English 
dictionary.

2002
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:44,170
So [inaudible] will amplify the word 
about this is what you do in union dream

2003
01:41:44,171 --> 01:41:45,430
interpretation,
for example,

2004
01:41:45,431 --> 01:41:49,150
is to kind of look at the connotations 
of the concepts that are associated with

2005
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:53,020
the dream subtle of a person or animal 
and action behavior.

2006
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:54,220
Crafty,
cunning,

2007
01:41:54,221 --> 01:41:55,330
sly,
treacherous.

2008
01:41:55,331 --> 01:41:56,950
So it's something that's sort of sneaks 
along,

2009
01:41:56,951 --> 01:41:57,190
right?
It,

2010
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:01,870
it's not something that you really pick 
up on that easily have a look or glance.

2011
01:42:01,871 --> 01:42:04,480
Sly Furtive,
surreptitious of a person,

2012
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,020
skillful expert,
clever of a work of art,

2013
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:11,830
mechanical device cleverly made or 
designed ingenious well that that's.

2014
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:15,540
I think that's all fairly.
All those terms so far,

2015
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:19,670
fairly well attributed to snakes.
I mean they are very cool things and and

2016
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:24,680
they are very well designed and they're 
quite remarkable and they're also very 

2017
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,811
subtle on the nature of or involving 
careful discrimination of fine points or

2018
01:42:29,111 --> 01:42:34,111
five points.
Difficult to understand and abstruse of 

2019
01:42:34,361 --> 01:42:39,361
a person,
the mind or intellectual activity,

2020
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:43,930
intellectual activity characterized by 
wisdom or perceptiveness.

2021
01:42:43,931 --> 01:42:45,400
Discriminating,
discerning and true.

2022
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:50,550
That's interesting because Milton,
Satan is also the intellect and you 

2023
01:42:51,401 --> 01:42:52,780
know,
you see that very often.

2024
01:42:52,781 --> 01:42:54,220
You know,
it's so often the bad guys,

2025
01:42:54,221 --> 01:42:55,510
an evil scientist,
right,

2026
01:42:55,780 --> 01:43:00,780
and there's something about it.
You see the same thing in the lion king 

2027
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:01,570
with scar,
I mean scars and intellect and arrogant,

2028
01:43:01,571 --> 01:43:04,630
deceitful intellect piece.
There's nothing stupid about scar.

2029
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:06,490
He's not wise,
but he's the.

2030
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:11,550
He's the evil voice that's always 
whispering in the king's ear and that's 

2031
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:14,140
associated with the pride of the 
intellect and the Catholics had warned,

2032
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:17,620
warned humanity about the pride of the 
intellect for centuries.

2033
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:22,970
Now,
it's partly what produced somewhat of 

2034
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:22,970
the schism between Catholicism and 
science,

2035
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:24,550
although that's much overstated.
If you look at the historical record,

2036
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:28,540
the idea was that the intellect has its 
own particular.

2037
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:33,600
It's a remarkable faculty.
Let's say it's the highest angel in 

2038
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,330
God's heavenly kingdom.
That's the way that Milton portrayed it,

2039
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:39,130
but it's also the thing that can go most
terribly wrong because intellect,

2040
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:44,970
the intellect can become arrogant about 
its own existence and accomplishments 

2041
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:49,320
and it can fall in love with its own 
products and that's what happens when 

2042
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,890
you're ideologically possessed because 
you end up with a dogma like say a human

2043
01:43:51,891 --> 01:43:54,830
constructed dog,
Mine Solzhenitsyn's words that possesses

2044
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:58,940
you completely have which you believe is
100 percent right.

2045
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:04,150
Right?
So it eradicates the necessity for 

2046
01:44:04,150 --> 01:44:05,981
anything transcendent and so that's the 
element of the intellect that's 

2047
01:44:05,981 --> 01:44:09,020
associated symbolically with the snake 
in the garden of paradise,

2048
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:12,170
of a feeling sense,
sensation,

2049
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:15,890
acute and keen involving distinctions 
that are find her delicate especially to

2050
01:44:15,891 --> 01:44:18,530
such an extent as to be difficult to 
discern or analyze.

2051
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,300
Also almost imperceptible and elusive.
Having little thickness or breadth,

2052
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:26,450
thin fine sub teal matter.
Now,

2053
01:44:26,451 --> 01:44:29,780
historical rarefied matter,
barely there at all,

2054
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,680
and the woman said unto the serpent,
we may eat of the fruit,

2055
01:44:33,681 --> 01:44:34,700
of the trees,
of the garden,

2056
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:37,280
but of the fruit of the tree which is in
the midst of the garden,

2057
01:44:37,281 --> 01:44:38,480
Goth is God,
has said,

2058
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:41,240
you shall not eat of it.
Neither shall you touch it,

2059
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:43,940
lest you die.
The serpent said to the woman,

2060
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:49,510
Ye shall not surely die.
For God doth know in the day that you 

2061
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:53,201
eat thereof.
Then your eyes shall be opened and you 

2062
01:44:53,201 --> 01:44:54,200
shall be as gods knowing good and evil.
Sneaky,

2063
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:56,140
subtle.
It's a nice story.

2064
01:44:56,530 --> 01:45:00,410
The first thing is the for instance.
The instant implication is,

2065
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,510
well,
you can't trust God,

2066
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:05,630
so that's pretty sneaky.
In the next is what he's trying to.

2067
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:08,840
He's trying to pull a fast one on you 
and the next one is what?

2068
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:13,840
He's trying to do that because he's 
jealous and he doesn't want you to know 

2069
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,991
things that he knows because that 
wouldn't be so good and he's lying to 

2070
01:45:16,991 --> 01:45:17,270
you anyways because you're not going to 
die,

2071
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:21,380
and if you eat it contrary to what 
you've been informed,

2072
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:26,381
then all that's going to happen is your 
eyes will be open and you'll be like 

2073
01:45:26,381 --> 01:45:27,230
gods knowing good and evil.
That sounds pretty damn good.

2074
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:29,780
So you know a night,
I mean eve,

2075
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:31,310
but does she know?
You know?

2076
01:45:31,311 --> 01:45:35,990
It's no wonder she's susceptible to such
blandishments and it's quite interesting

2077
01:45:35,991 --> 01:45:40,991
too because Adam and Eve,
God tells Adam and eve not eat the damn 

2078
01:45:40,991 --> 01:45:42,050
fruit,
but they never promise not to write,

2079
01:45:42,051 --> 01:45:45,210
so they haven't promised.
They've just been told to and well,

2080
01:45:45,211 --> 01:45:46,340
we should.
They be obedient.

2081
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:51,540
Well,
how obedient do you want your children 

2082
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:53,171
to be?
You want them to be obedient enough so 

2083
01:45:53,171 --> 01:45:55,361
they don't get hurt,
but disobedient enough so that they go 

2084
01:45:55,361 --> 01:45:57,821
out in the world and do something 
courageous and they break some rules 

2085
01:45:57,821 --> 01:45:57,910
that they learned some things and so you
know it's,

2086
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:00,170
it's,
it's a very paradoxical story.

2087
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:01,690
Anyways,
the serpent,

2088
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:06,290
when wins this round man,
and so eve pays attention to the snake.

2089
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,030
So again,
we have the same set of images,

2090
01:46:13,031 --> 01:46:14,570
right?
We have an adamant,

2091
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,840
we have eve,
we have this tree,

2092
01:46:16,841 --> 01:46:20,040
and we have this strange serpent that's 
a dragon like form there,

2093
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:25,050
a sphinx like form that's associated 
with the tree snakes eternally 

2094
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:25,750
associated with a tree.
Well,

2095
01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:28,150
the snake was eternally associated with 
the tree.

2096
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:32,320
We spent,
God only knows how many tens of millions

2097
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:37,320
of years as tree dwelling primates and 
the primary or one of our primary 

2098
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,530
predators.
We had three primary predators,

2099
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:41,500
snakes,
birds,

2100
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:47,220
cats,
and so the snake has been associated 

2101
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:47,220
with the tree for a very,
very long time.

2102
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:52,620
And the lesson,
the snake tells people you bloody well 

2103
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:52,620
better wake up or something you don't 
like,

2104
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:54,840
we'll get you and who's going to be more
susceptible,

2105
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:57,270
susceptible to paying attention to the 
snake,

2106
01:46:57,570 --> 01:47:02,570
and that's going to be eve.
And the reason for that is eve has 

2107
01:47:02,570 --> 01:47:05,970
offspring and there's nothing tastier to
a snake than a child.

2108
01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:11,690
And so eve had every reason to be self 
conscious and neurotic and women are 

2109
01:47:11,690 --> 01:47:13,680
more self conscious and neurotic than 
men by quite a substantial amount.

2110
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:17,010
And that's true cross culturally and in 
emerges out of puberty.

2111
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,590
And part of the reason is,
as far as we can tell,

2112
01:47:19,591 --> 01:47:21,720
is that women are more sexually 
vulnerable.

2113
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:25,520
There are also smaller.
So that's a problem if you're engaged in

2114
01:47:25,521 --> 01:47:28,050
any physical alteration.
But most importantly,

2115
01:47:28,051 --> 01:47:33,051
I think is that why would you ever 
assume that a human females nervous 

2116
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:36,720
system is adapted to her or her 
wellbeing?

2117
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:42,020
Why wouldn't you assume a stead that her
nervous system is adapted to the female 

2118
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:43,950
infant dyad?
Because if it isn't,

2119
01:47:43,951 --> 01:47:46,560
then the infants die.
And so you might take,

2120
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:50,040
while women are way more susceptible to 
depression and anxiety than men are.

2121
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:53,180
And that's a hell of a burden to bear.
And that's also true cross-culturally,

2122
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:53,790
by the way.

2123
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:58,880
And it also kicks into puberty and the 
biggest differences are in Scandinavia 

2124
01:47:58,880 --> 01:47:59,610
for those of you who think it's 
socio-cultural,

2125
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:02,130
which it isn't.
So,

2126
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,810
but there's reasons for it.
You know,

2127
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:08,811
I didn't also at puberty when men,
men and women start to become sexually 

2128
01:48:08,811 --> 01:48:11,370
dimorphic in terms of size and men are 
way more powerful in their upper bodies.

2129
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:16,490
It's in comparatively more powerful and 
so that makes them a lot more dangerous 

2130
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:20,031
and human.
The human primary human defense 

2131
01:48:20,031 --> 01:48:21,990
mechanism is punching like with 
Kangaroos for because there's some other

2132
01:48:21,991 --> 01:48:24,300
animals that punch chimps can punch too,
but human beings,

2133
01:48:24,301 --> 01:48:29,301
it's a punch and most of the forest and 
that his upper body and shoulder and so 

2134
01:48:29,301 --> 01:48:31,560
a woman's no match for a man in a fight,
so she has every reason to be nervous,

2135
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:36,680
especially when you add that to that her
additional sexual vulnerability and the 

2136
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:37,800
fact that she has to take care of 
extraordinarily dependent.

2137
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:42,800
Infants were extremely fragile for a 
very long period of time and so she had 

2138
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,790
every and women are more self conscious 
than man.

2139
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,740
The empirical literature on that is 
clear.

2140
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:51,890
It's associated with trait neuroticism 
because self consciousness is actually 

2141
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:53,010
an unpleasant emotion.
Who wants to be self conscious?

2142
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:55,500
If I'm self conscious on the stage 
talking to you,

2143
01:48:55,501 --> 01:48:57,150
then all of a sudden I can't even talk 
to you.

2144
01:48:57,330 --> 01:49:02,330
All I'm doing is thinking about me in 
all the things that are wrong with me 

2145
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:03,020
and I fall inside myself.
It's like selfconsciousness,

2146
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,850
although it's a great gift,
let's say is nothing pleasant.

2147
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,010
It's associated primarily with anxiety.

2148
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:13,500
So we've had every reason to pay 
attention to the snake,

2149
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:17,130
that's for sure.
I think I read this week that among,

2150
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,080
I can't remember which tribesmen at 
where it was,

2151
01:49:19,081 --> 01:49:24,081
unfortunately,
although I did put a footnote in my new 

2152
01:49:24,081 --> 01:49:24,081
book about this,
um,

2153
01:49:24,081 --> 01:49:29,020
these,
these were jungle dwelling tribal 

2154
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:32,451
people.
Five percent of the adults had been 

2155
01:49:32,451 --> 01:49:35,061
attacked by a python and a substantial 
number of children had been killed by 

2156
01:49:35,061 --> 01:49:36,840
them.
So snake predation was no joke.

2157
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:41,220
It's shaped our evolutionary past and 
still is no joke in many places.

2158
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:44,010
And so we're attuned to snakes.
And the thing is,

2159
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,680
as Lynn has bell pointed out now,
anthropologists,

2160
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:50,410
we got really good at detecting the 
camouflage patterns of snakes,

2161
01:49:50,411 --> 01:49:53,410
especially in the lower half of our 
visual field.

2162
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:57,400
And there's evidence that part of the 
reason that human beings have such acute

2163
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:59,980
vision,
which means that our eyes opened,

2164
01:49:59,981 --> 01:50:01,960
let's say,
is because we were,

2165
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:07,440
we call evolved with snakes and we 
learned how to see them and then the 

2166
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:11,161
price we paid for seeing was that our 
brain grew because you need a lot of 

2167
01:50:11,161 --> 01:50:12,040
brain to be able to see.
And the consequence of our brain growing

2168
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:17,041
is one day we woke up and discovered the
future and the future is where all the 

2169
01:50:17,041 --> 01:50:18,400
snakes might live instead of where they 
live right now.

2170
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:25,750
So there's that same thing in the same.
So interesting.

2171
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:28,180
Again,
these images you see in this one,

2172
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:33,810
you have the specter of death in the 
tree with the snake and the fruit and 

2173
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:37,290
fruit is interesting to already make the
case that there's a tight linkage 

2174
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:38,560
between what you eat and information,
right?

2175
01:50:38,561 --> 01:50:40,480
A conceptual link as well as the 
practical link.

2176
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:42,790
But it's also the case that we can see 
colors.

2177
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:48,540
And the question is why?
And the answer is because we evolved to 

2178
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:49,570
see ripe fruit.
So in the story of Adam and Eve,

2179
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:54,630
human beings are given vision by the 
snake and the fruit and that turns out 

2180
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:56,500
to be correct.
So isn't that something?

2181
01:50:56,620 --> 01:51:01,620
And then you think,
what role do women play in relationship 

2182
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:01,620
to men?
Well,

2183
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,460
first they make themselves conscious.
Let's not ever forget about that because

2184
01:51:03,461 --> 01:51:08,461
the.
I would say the primary role that women 

2185
01:51:08,461 --> 01:51:08,461
have in relationship to men is to make 
them self conscious.

2186
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:13,470
And men don't precisely like that.
There's nothing that will make a man 

2187
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,250
more self conscious than being rejected.
And why?

2188
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,060
Because why is he rejected?
Well,

2189
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:21,940
obviously mother nature in the guise of 
that particular woman has said,

2190
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:27,390
you're not so bad for a friend,
but there's no reason that your genetic 

2191
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:27,400
material should propagate itself into 
the future.

2192
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:33,770
Right?
Well,

2193
01:51:33,771 --> 01:51:36,060
and it's not like men are exactly happy 
about being made,

2194
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:38,300
made self conscious by women,
right?

2195
01:51:38,301 --> 01:51:43,301
It's a major source of continual tension
between men and women and it's no 

2196
01:51:43,301 --> 01:51:46,781
wonder,
but it's also the case and this is 

2197
01:51:46,781 --> 01:51:46,781
something really cool and interesting to
know.

2198
01:51:46,781 --> 01:51:47,850
You know,
you do,

2199
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:50,750
you've divulged dive,
divulged,

2200
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:52,160
die,
whatever.

2201
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:57,430
That's it diverged.
We diverged from the common ancestor 

2202
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:58,790
between us and chimpanzees about 6 
million years ago.

2203
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:00,470
Here's why,
at least in part,

2204
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:03,530
chimpanzee females are non discriminant 
maters.

2205
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:06,950
They'll mate with any mail when they go 
into heat,

2206
01:52:07,010 --> 01:52:12,010
which human females don't when they go 
into heat than any male is allowed 

2207
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:18,280
access.
Now the dominant males chased the 

2208
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:20,801
subordinate males away and so the 
dominant males are more likely to leave 

2209
01:52:20,801 --> 01:52:23,861
offspring,
but it's not because of the female 

2210
01:52:23,861 --> 01:52:23,861
choice.
It's not the case with human beings.

2211
01:52:23,861 --> 01:52:26,290
Human females engage in hyper and 
hypoglycemia is the,

2212
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:31,330
and this is also true cross culturally 
and it's also quite as extensive in 

2213
01:52:31,731 --> 01:52:32,930
Scandinavia,
not quite.

2214
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:34,640
There's a bit of attenuation,
but not much.

2215
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:37,370
Women mate across and up.
Dominance hierarchies,

2216
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:40,080
manmade across and down.
Okay,

2217
01:52:40,081 --> 01:52:45,081
well,
and that has to be the case because it 

2218
01:52:45,081 --> 01:52:45,081
obviously has to work that way.
If one goes up,

2219
01:52:45,081 --> 01:52:49,871
the has to go down.
The socioeconomic status of a woman is 

2220
01:52:49,871 --> 01:52:53,780
almost determined almost zero of her 
attractiveness towards a man.

2221
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:59,230
Whereas the socioeconomic status of a 
man is a major determinant of his 

2222
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:01,010
attractiveness towards a woman and it 
isn't as well either because that's been

2223
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:06,011
tested.
It's his capacity to generate and be 

2224
01:53:06,011 --> 01:53:07,910
productive and to share because that 
beats the hell out of wealth.

2225
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:09,170
Wealth can disappeared,
right,

2226
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:11,690
but the capacity to be productive and 
share,

2227
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:14,960
that's,
that's a much more important element and

2228
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:20,020
why not be chosen on the basis of that,
especially because women have to have 

2229
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:22,991
infants and infants make the women 
dependent and the woman is just looking 

2230
01:53:22,991 --> 01:53:27,281
logically,
rationally and from an evolutionary 

2231
01:53:27,281 --> 01:53:28,300
perspective for someone who is useful 
enough to give a hint to lend a hand.

2232
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,690
So women make intense demands on men and
it's no wonder,

2233
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:36,440
but the thing is is that because women 
engaged in hyperglycemia,

2234
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:41,470
at least in part,
we diverge quite rapidly from 

2235
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:43,901
chimpanzees because the selection 
pressure that women placed on men 

2236
01:53:43,901 --> 01:53:48,160
develop the entire species.
Now there's two things that happened as 

2237
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:48,980
far as I could tell.
The men competed for competence,

2238
01:53:48,981 --> 01:53:53,981
let's say.
So the male hierarchy is a mechanism 

2239
01:53:53,981 --> 01:53:55,670
that pushes the best man to the top 
virtually by definition,

2240
01:53:55,970 --> 01:54:00,970
and then that's,
that's the effect of that is multiplied 

2241
01:54:00,970 --> 01:54:04,361
by the fact that women who are Pergamon 
as peel from the top and so that the 

2242
01:54:04,361 --> 01:54:08,111
males who are the most competent are 
much more likely to leave offspring and 

2243
01:54:08,111 --> 01:54:09,860
that seemed to be what drove our 
cortical expansion,

2244
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:10,970
for example,
which happened very,

2245
01:54:10,971 --> 01:54:13,130
very rapidly over the course of 
evolutionary time.

2246
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:18,350
So,
and when the woman saw that the tree was

2247
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:23,351
good for food and that it was pleasant 
to the eyes and a tree to be desired to 

2248
01:54:23,351 --> 01:54:27,911
make one wise,
she took of the fruit thereof and did 

2249
01:54:27,911 --> 01:54:28,760
eat and gave also unto her husband with 
her.

2250
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:30,080
And he did eat.
Oh yes.

2251
01:54:30,081 --> 01:54:34,010
And women share food.
That's a very strange thing because most

2252
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:35,300
creatures don't do that,
right?

2253
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:37,220
Most animals don't share food.
Like if you,

2254
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:39,350
if you're a wolf and you bring down 
something in a hunt,

2255
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:42,830
you eat your fill.
The dominant creatures eat their fill.

2256
01:54:42,831 --> 01:54:45,040
And then if there's some leftover,
this subordinate t too,

2257
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:47,870
but that isn't how human beings work.
We share food.

2258
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:53,200
Now you can imagine how that evolved 
because lots of female creature share 

2259
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:54,200
food with their offspring.
Okay?

2260
01:54:54,201 --> 01:54:59,201
You don't need much of a twist in that 
from an evolutionary perspective until 

2261
01:54:59,201 --> 01:55:00,260
you start to share food,
not only with your offspring say,

2262
01:55:00,261 --> 01:55:03,050
but with your mate,
and that's another way that you entice a

2263
01:55:03,051 --> 01:55:08,051
mate.
It's like we're going to be better 

2264
01:55:08,051 --> 01:55:08,051
together than alone.
Well,

2265
01:55:08,051 --> 01:55:08,180
that's the offering of the fruit.
Well,

2266
01:55:08,181 --> 01:55:09,530
what's the self conscious part?

2267
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:11,510
Well,
here's part of the bargain.

2268
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:16,660
You know I'm going to wake you up and 
partly I'm going to wake you up because 

2269
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:20,231
you need to be woken up because I have 
this infant that needs some damn care 

2270
01:55:20,231 --> 01:55:23,090
and so you bloody well better be awake 
and part of the bargain is all offer you

2271
01:55:23,091 --> 01:55:25,580
something.
I'll offer you some food and in response

2272
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:28,040
we're going to make a team and that's 
the deal.

2273
01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:33,420
Well,
that's the human deal and that's why 

2274
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:35,021
we're more or less monogamous by why we 
more or less pair of bond and why 

2275
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:38,210
something approximating marriage is a 
human universal.

2276
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:40,970
It's cross cultural.
Now you can find exceptions,

2277
01:55:40,971 --> 01:55:42,950
but who the hell cares?
The vast,

2278
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,610
really man,
who cares?

2279
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:49,050
If you look at the vast pattern,
the vast pattern,

2280
01:55:49,051 --> 01:55:54,051
while in the price we pay for having 
large brains is that we are very 

2281
01:55:54,051 --> 01:55:54,870
dependent and it takes a long time for 
us to get programmed and because of that

2282
01:55:55,080 --> 01:56:00,080
we need relatively stable family bonding
and that's basically what we've evolved 

2283
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:04,910
and you know,
you don't get that without making men 

2284
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:05,880
self conscious because male creatures,
why not impregnate and run?

2285
01:56:06,290 --> 01:56:08,820
I mean why the hell not?
And that's something to really,

2286
01:56:08,821 --> 01:56:10,890
no kidding,
like that's the thing to think about.

2287
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:13,380
It is not why men abandoned their 
children.

2288
01:56:13,381 --> 01:56:17,400
That's the mystery.
It's why any men ever stick with them.

2289
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:22,970
That's the mystery because you just have
to look at the animal kingdom and the 

2290
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:24,660
like.
The simplest and easiest thing is always

2291
01:56:24,661 --> 01:56:28,770
the most likely thing to occur.
So it's the exception.

2292
01:56:28,771 --> 01:56:30,900
That longterm commitment that needs 
explanation.

2293
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:37,340
She took of the fruit thereof and did 
eat and gave also unto her husband with 

2294
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:38,850
her and he did eat the eyes of both of 
them were opened.

2295
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:43,440
Implying that before that they were 
closed and they knew they were naked and

2296
01:56:43,441 --> 01:56:45,720
they sewed fig leaves together and made 
themselves aprons.

2297
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,910
So that's so interesting.
So their eyes are open,

2298
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,890
which indicates that they weren't to 
begin with.

2299
01:56:49,891 --> 01:56:54,891
So whatever God created to begin with 
was kind of blind in but not blind in 

2300
01:56:54,891 --> 01:56:57,060
some strange way because they weren't 
obviously wanting to run into garden,

2301
01:56:57,061 --> 01:56:58,110
bumping into trees.

2302
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:03,350
It was some sort of metaphysical 
blindness that's been removed by 

2303
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:04,560
whatever has just happened and 
whatever's just happened.

2304
01:57:04,561 --> 01:57:06,300
Also made them realize that they were 
naked.

2305
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:08,760
Okay.
So what sort of eye opening is that?

2306
01:57:08,910 --> 01:57:13,910
What does it mean to realize that you're
naked means to realize that you're 

2307
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:16,110
vulnerable.
That's what people discovered.

2308
01:57:16,111 --> 01:57:17,520
It's like,
oh,

2309
01:57:17,790 --> 01:57:22,790
we can be hurt.
So you're a zebra in a herd of zebras 

2310
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:24,600
and there's a bunch of lions around.
They're laying on the grass.

2311
01:57:24,690 --> 01:57:28,380
You don't care.
Those are laying down lions,

2312
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:33,530
laying down lines or no problem.
It standing up hunting lions that are 

2313
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:37,071
the problem.
You're not smart enough to figure out 

2314
01:57:37,071 --> 01:57:37,260
that laying down lines turn into 
standing up hunting lions,

2315
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:40,620
so you're not building a fort to keep 
the lions out.

2316
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,160
You're just mindlessly eating grass.
You're not very awake,

2317
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:49,340
but that's not what happens to human 
beings is they wake up and they think 

2318
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:49,340
we're vulnerable permanently.

2319
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:51,810
It's never going away.
Right?

2320
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:57,020
It's the.
It's the recognition of that internal 

2321
01:57:57,020 --> 01:57:57,150
vulnerability.
What happens?

2322
01:57:57,151 --> 01:57:58,860
The first thing they do is clothe 
themselves.

2323
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,080
Well,
what happens when you're naked?

2324
01:58:01,081 --> 01:58:03,180
When you need protection from the world 
will obviously.

2325
01:58:03,390 --> 01:58:04,950
Look,
you're all wearing clothes.

2326
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:07,710
You know why?
Well,

2327
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:10,320
we've been doing that for a very,
very long period of time.

2328
01:58:10,321 --> 01:58:12,240
It's tens of thousands of years at 
minimum.

2329
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,510
In fact,
you can track more or less when clothing

2330
01:58:15,511 --> 01:58:19,140
developed because you can do DNA testing
of the kind of life that cleaned clothes

2331
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:24,300
rather than heroin.
So we have a pretty good idea of when 

2332
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:25,080
clothing emerged and have different 
types as well,

2333
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:30,110
so that's quite cool.
But the point is they're naked and they 

2334
01:58:30,110 --> 01:58:31,320
think that's not so good.
We're vulnerable so their eyes were open

2335
01:58:31,321 --> 01:58:36,321
enough so they become self conscious and
they recognize their own vulnerability 

2336
01:58:36,321 --> 01:58:38,400
and the first thing they do is the first
step of culture is to protect themselves

2337
01:58:38,401 --> 01:58:41,950
with something from the world and you 
protect yourself from the world and from

2338
01:58:41,951 --> 01:58:43,390
the prying eyes of other people.

2339
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:49,860
This is the book by Lynn Bell,
why we see so well from the temptation 

2340
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:51,130
of eve to the venomous murder of the 
mighty thor.

2341
01:58:51,131 --> 01:58:56,131
The serpent appears throughout time and 
culture as a figure of mischief and 

2342
01:58:56,131 --> 01:58:59,200
mystery misery.
The worldwide prominence of snakes in 

2343
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:02,251
religion,
myth and foreclosure underscores our 

2344
01:59:02,251 --> 01:59:02,251
deep connection to the serpent,
but why?

2345
01:59:02,251 --> 01:59:03,880
When so few of us have firsthand 
experience.

2346
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:10,030
The surprising answer,
this book suggests lies in the singular 

2347
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:12,550
effect of snakes on primate evolution.
Predation pressure from snakes,

2348
01:59:12,551 --> 01:59:17,551
Lynn is tells us,
is ultimately responsible for this 

2349
01:59:17,551 --> 01:59:20,261
superior vision and large brain of 
primates and for a critical aspect of 

2350
01:59:20,261 --> 01:59:22,060
human evolution that was tested 
recently.

2351
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:27,420
Psychologists have known for a long time
that people are can learn fear to 

2352
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:28,480
snakes,
but they discovered in primates recently

2353
01:59:28,481 --> 01:59:29,830
a set of neurons,
Paul Dinner,

2354
01:59:29,831 --> 01:59:34,090
neural neurons which are specialized,
that's an old,

2355
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:39,150
old perceptual systems revealed 
neurobiological evidence of past 

2356
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:42,430
selection for rapid detection of snakes,
so that's from 2013,

2357
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:45,340
so the snake definitely woke us up.

2358
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:50,440
Color Vision as an adaptation to fruit 
eating in primates.

2359
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:54,520
It's not by accident that women make 
themselves look like ripe fruit in order

2360
01:59:54,521 --> 01:59:57,010
to be attractive to men.
Right?

2361
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:00,280
And that's also not socio-cultural in 
origin.

2362
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:04,630
So,
and they heard the voice of the Lord God

2363
02:00:04,631 --> 02:00:06,460
walking in the garden in the cool of the
day,

2364
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:11,760
and Adam and his wife hid themselves 
from the presence of the Lord God 

2365
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:12,040
amongst the trees of the garden.
That's interesting.

2366
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:18,120
So what's the implication prior to being
woken up prior to recognizing nakedness 

2367
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:21,850
and vulnerability,
there was no reason for God,

2368
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:26,880
for man and woman to hide from God.
Now where they're hiding from God while 

2369
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,790
they're naked,
they're vulnerable.

2370
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:29,290
Okay,
so think about this.

2371
02:00:29,291 --> 02:00:34,291
Think about this.
It's like imagine that you have the 

2372
02:00:34,291 --> 02:00:37,170
capacity to live truthfully and 
courageously and forthrightly.

2373
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:41,970
Just imagine that and then imagine why 
you might not do that and then imagined,

2374
02:00:42,150 --> 02:00:43,510
well,
how about fear and shame?

2375
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:44,740
How?
How would that work?

2376
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Well,
let's say that the idea of living 

2377
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,131
forthright,
Lee and truthfully and courageously is 

2378
02:00:53,131 --> 02:00:56,251
analogous,
given what we already know about these 

2379
02:00:56,251 --> 02:00:56,251
stories,
to walking with God in the garden.

2380
02:00:56,251 --> 02:00:56,980
Well,
what stops people from doing that?

2381
02:00:56,981 --> 02:00:59,140
What stops people from hiding?
Well,

2382
02:00:59,141 --> 02:01:01,690
it's their own rates or recognition of 
their own inadequacy.

2383
02:01:01,691 --> 02:01:06,430
They look at themselves and they think,
how in the world is a creature cinches I

2384
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:11,700
supposed to live properly in this world 
with everything that's wrong with me,

2385
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:13,810
and so what do you hide from?
Well,

2386
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:16,360
you go home,
you sit on your bed for five minutes and

2387
02:01:16,361 --> 02:01:18,520
ask yourself,
what have you hidden from in your life?

2388
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:23,730
Man,
you'll have books of knowledge reveal 

2389
02:01:23,730 --> 02:01:23,730
themselves to you and your imagination,
right?

2390
02:01:23,830 --> 02:01:24,250
Say,
well,

2391
02:01:24,251 --> 02:01:25,840
why are you hiding?
Well,

2392
02:01:25,841 --> 02:01:29,380
it's no wonder you're hiding.
It's no wonder that people hide.

2393
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:31,780
That's the thing that's so terrifying 
about this story.

2394
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:33,910
We woke up and we thought,
oh my God,

2395
02:01:33,911 --> 02:01:35,890
look at this place like this is 
seriously.

2396
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:41,250
There's some serious trouble here and 
we're in some serious trouble and we're 

2397
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:42,920
not what we could be,
and so we hide and that's what the story

2398
02:01:42,921 --> 02:01:44,060
says.
People woke up,

2399
02:01:44,061 --> 02:01:49,061
they became self conscious.
They recognized their own vulnerability 

2400
02:01:49,061 --> 02:01:52,300
and that made the.
Made them hide from manifesting their 

2401
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:52,400
divine destiny.
It's like,

2402
02:01:52,401 --> 02:01:53,600
yeah,
that's exactly right,

2403
02:01:53,870 --> 02:01:58,870
and the Lord God there,
I love this part of the story and it's 

2404
02:01:58,870 --> 02:02:00,230
so funny and the Lord God called and we 
could use a little humor at this point,

2405
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:04,670
and the Lord God called Unto Adam and 
said unto him where Art Thou?

2406
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:10,360
And Adam said,
I heard that voice in the garden and I 

2407
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:12,770
have.
I was afraid because I was naked.

2408
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,630
So in case there was any doubt about 
that.

2409
02:02:14,631 --> 02:02:19,631
That's why.
And I hid myself and God said,

2410
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:30,310
who told you that you were naked?
Did you eat of the tree whereof I 

2411
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:35,231
commanded you that you should not eat.
And this is where Adam shows himself in 

2412
02:02:35,231 --> 02:02:38,090
all his post fall,
heroic glory.

2413
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:42,590
And the man said,
the woman

2414
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:56,110
whom now gave us to be with me,
she gave me of the tree and I did eat.

2415
02:02:56,750 --> 02:03:00,170
So that set,
that set that it's so,

2416
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:01,790
you know,
again,

2417
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:07,120
there's a modern feminist interpretation
of the story of Adam and eve that makes 

2418
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:11,891
the claim that eve was portrayed as the 
universal bad guy of humanity for 

2419
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:15,350
disobeying God and eating the Apple.
It's like,

2420
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:16,820
fair enough.
You know,

2421
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:22,290
it looks like she slipped up.
Then she tempted her husband and you 

2422
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:23,360
know,
that makes her even worse.

2423
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:26,930
Although he's was foolish enough to 
immediately eat.

2424
02:03:26,931 --> 02:03:31,931
So it just means she was a little more 
courageous than him then got there 

2425
02:03:31,931 --> 02:03:32,690
first.
But it's Adam who comes across as really

2426
02:03:32,691 --> 02:03:35,500
one sad creature in this story as far as
I'm concerned about.

2427
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:37,790
He manages in one sentence.
It's like,

2428
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:39,410
first of all,
it wasn't him.

2429
02:03:39,411 --> 02:03:42,410
It was the woman and said,
can even blames God.

2430
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:48,240
It wasn't just the woman who was,
it was that woman and you gave her to 

2431
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:48,240
me.

2432
02:03:49,890 --> 02:03:51,720
Then she gave me of the tree and I did 
eat.

2433
02:03:51,721 --> 02:03:52,860
It's like,
so hay Adams,

2434
02:03:52,861 --> 02:03:57,861
all innocent.
Except now he's not only is he naked and

2435
02:03:58,110 --> 02:04:03,110
disobedient and cowardly and ashamed,
he's also sniffily backbiting.

2436
02:04:06,270 --> 02:04:11,270
Think he writes her out like the second 
he gets the opportunity and then he 

2437
02:04:11,270 --> 02:04:12,390
blames God.
It's like,

2438
02:04:12,391 --> 02:04:14,460
and that's exactly right.
That's exactly right,

2439
02:04:14,461 --> 02:04:16,470
man.
You go online and you read,

2440
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:21,860
you read the commentary that men write 
about women when they're resentful and 

2441
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:21,990
bitter about women.
You read it.

2442
02:04:21,991 --> 02:04:23,250
It's so interesting.
It's like,

2443
02:04:23,430 --> 02:04:25,530
it's not me.
It's those bitches.

2444
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:27,320
Okay,
that's right.

2445
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:28,650
It's not me.
It's them.

2446
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:31,290
And not only that,
what are bloody world,

2447
02:04:31,291 --> 02:04:34,500
this is in which they exist.
It's exactly the same thing.

2448
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:38,910
It's exactly the same thing and it is 
absolutely pathetic.

2449
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,110
All right,

2450
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:51,700
and the Lord God said unto the woman,
what is this that thou has done?

2451
02:04:51,701 --> 02:04:56,701
And the woman said,
the serpent beguiled me and I did eat 

2452
02:04:56,701 --> 02:04:56,701
while he.
She has a bloody excuse.

2453
02:04:56,701 --> 02:04:57,910
First of all,
it's a snake.

2454
02:04:57,911 --> 02:04:58,760
I mean,
those things aren't.

2455
02:04:58,810 --> 02:05:03,810
We already found out there is subtle and
second it turns out that the damn snake 

2456
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:04,660
is Satan himself.
You know,

2457
02:05:04,661 --> 02:05:09,661
when he's rather treacherous.
So the fact that she got tangled up in 

2458
02:05:09,661 --> 02:05:10,510
his mess,
let's say,

2459
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:15,630
is well problematic,
but it's a lot better excuse that Adam 

2460
02:05:15,851 --> 02:05:19,240
has and the Lord God says unto the 
serpent,

2461
02:05:19,241 --> 02:05:24,241
because thou has done done this,
cursed above all cattle and above every 

2462
02:05:24,241 --> 02:05:28,201
beast of the field upon thy belly shalt 
they'll go and dust shalt thou eat all 

2463
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:32,110
the days of their life.
And snakes by the way,

2464
02:05:32,111 --> 02:05:35,830
are lizards that lost their legs,
just so you know.

2465
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:41,400
And I will put enmity between the and 
the woman and between thy seed and her 

2466
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:45,811
seed,
it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt 

2467
02:05:45,811 --> 02:05:46,780
bruise his heel.
I love these pictures.

2468
02:05:46,781 --> 02:05:48,160
They're so smart.
And again,

2469
02:05:49,030 --> 02:05:53,290
strip the religious context from them 
and just look at them for a second.

2470
02:05:53,530 --> 02:05:58,530
What do you see?
You see the eternal mother holding her 

2471
02:05:58,530 --> 02:06:02,740
infant away from the snake.
See it down there,

2472
02:06:04,210 --> 02:06:07,780
right?
Crocodile snake.

2473
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:11,940
Everything predatory.
That's been after us for like 60 million

2474
02:06:11,950 --> 02:06:16,950
years.
The reason we're here is because of 

2475
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:16,950
that.
That's why it's a sacred image.

2476
02:06:18,370 --> 02:06:22,030
Now this one I like even better.
See down there,

2477
02:06:22,031 --> 02:06:27,031
there's something like the moon and then
there's this a reptile down there that 

2478
02:06:27,031 --> 02:06:27,050
even standing on,
this is really old.

2479
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:29,350
I showed you this before,
but I think it's so cool.

2480
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:32,020
She's coming out of this thing that's 
like a hole in the sky,

2481
02:06:32,021 --> 02:06:32,800
you know,
because it it.

2482
02:06:32,860 --> 02:06:36,460
It indicates the eternal presence of 
this figure.

2483
02:06:36,461 --> 02:06:39,160
It's something like that.
The eternal recurrence of this figure.

2484
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:42,070
It's an archetype,
but then the the,

2485
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:44,140
the potential out of which she is 
emerging.

2486
02:06:44,141 --> 02:06:49,141
These are all musical instruments back 
here and so what the artist is 

2487
02:06:49,141 --> 02:06:52,441
representing is the great pattern 
complexity of being and the emergence of

2488
02:06:53,730 --> 02:06:56,110
of the protective mother.
From that background,

2489
02:06:56,380 --> 02:06:59,470
protecting the infant eternally against 
predation.

2490
02:07:00,010 --> 02:07:05,010
It's like,
how can that not be a holy image if it 

2491
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:05,010
isn't the holy image?
If you don't think it's a holy image,

2492
02:07:05,110 --> 02:07:06,700
then there isn't something wrong with 
the image.

2493
02:07:07,550 --> 02:07:12,350
There's something wrong with the 
perceiver unto the woman.

2494
02:07:12,351 --> 02:07:13,210
He said,
well,

2495
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:15,830
God's just outlining the consequences of
this right now.

2496
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:16,580
It's like,
okay,

2497
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:18,560
well now you've gone and done it.
You've woken up.

2498
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:22,300
This is what's going to happen.
I will greatly multiply that Isaura.

2499
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:27,050
When I conception in sorrow,
thou shalt bring forth children and they

2500
02:07:27,051 --> 02:07:30,120
desire shall be to that husband and he 
shall rule over thee.

2501
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:36,210
Say he should says he will,
and why

2502
02:07:36,210 --> 02:07:38,190
in sorrow shall they'll bring forth 
children.

2503
02:07:38,970 --> 02:07:43,970
Well,
when you develop a brain that big so 

2504
02:07:43,970 --> 02:07:48,051
that you can see it's not that easy to 
give birth anymore and then you produce 

2505
02:07:48,691 --> 02:07:53,691
something that's dependent beyond belief
and that's one of the things that you 

2506
02:07:53,691 --> 02:07:58,131
would say dooms you to precisely this,
so that's eaves punishment for waking up

2507
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:05,060
and Adam because thou has hearkened unto
the voice of thy wife and has eaten of 

2508
02:08:05,060 --> 02:08:05,700
the tree,
of which I commanded thee,

2509
02:08:05,701 --> 02:08:06,900
saying,
thou shalt not eat it.

2510
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:12,140
Cursed is the ground for thy Sake,
in sorrow shall thou eat of it in all 

2511
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:14,010
the days of their life.
What's that?

2512
02:08:14,190 --> 02:08:15,390
The invention of work.

2513
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:21,880
Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth
to thee and now shall eat the herb of 

2514
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:22,310
the field.
It's the invention of work.

2515
02:08:22,580 --> 02:08:25,340
What do people do that animals don't 
work?

2516
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:30,700
What does work mean?
It means you sacrifice the present for 

2517
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:33,731
the future and why do you do that?
Because you know you're vulnerable and 

2518
02:08:33,731 --> 02:08:37,541
because you're awake and so from here on
end and from this point there's no 

2519
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:41,321
return to unconscious paradise.
I don't care how many problems you've 

2520
02:08:41,321 --> 02:08:44,440
solved so that today's okay.
You've got a lot of problems coming up 

2521
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:48,160
and no bloody matter how much you work.
You never going to work enough to solve 

2522
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:51,371
them and so all you're going to do from 
here on in is be terrified of the 

2523
02:08:51,371 --> 02:08:54,761
future.
And that's the price of waking up and 

2524
02:08:54,761 --> 02:08:57,401
that's the end of paradise and that's 
the beginning of history and that's how 

2525
02:08:57,401 --> 02:09:00,500
that story goes.
In this sweat of thy face,

2526
02:09:00,501 --> 02:09:03,090
hell thou eat bread til thou return unto
the ground,

2527
02:09:03,091 --> 02:09:07,620
for out of it was taken for dust thou 
art and unto Dust Thou shall return.

2528
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:12,900
And Adam called his wife's name Eve 
because she was the mother of all living

2529
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:20,960
unto Adam also and unto his wife did the
Lord God make coats of skin and clothed 

2530
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,230
them.
Hunted William Blake by the way,

2531
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,180
and the Lord.
God said,

2532
02:09:24,690 --> 02:09:29,690
behold,
the man is become as one of us to know 

2533
02:09:29,690 --> 02:09:31,641
good and evil,
and now lest he put forth his hand and 

2534
02:09:31,641 --> 02:09:31,641
take also of the tree of life and eat 
and live forever.

2535
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:35,680
I'll go over this again next week.
Therefore,

2536
02:09:35,681 --> 02:09:38,200
the Lord God sent him from the fourth,
fourth,

2537
02:09:38,201 --> 02:09:40,600
from the garden of Eden to till the 
ground from whence he was taken.

2538
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:44,320
So he drove out the man and he placed at
the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims

2539
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:48,430
and a flaming sword which turned every 
way to keep the way of the tree of life.

2540
02:10:01,650 --> 02:10:06,340
One more thing and then we'll stop.
So I thought,

2541
02:10:06,730 --> 02:10:11,730
why in the world?
So Adam and eve are tempted by the 

2542
02:10:12,951 --> 02:10:13,970
snake.
They eat the fruit,

2543
02:10:13,971 --> 02:10:15,500
they wake up,
they realized they're naked.

2544
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,290
They realize that they're vulnerable.
They realized the future.

2545
02:10:19,291 --> 02:10:21,900
They realized they're gonna die.
They realized that they have to work.

2546
02:10:22,950 --> 02:10:27,950
It counts for difficulty in conception 
and the fall of humankind from 

2547
02:10:27,950 --> 02:10:29,040
unconscious paradise.
Okay,

2548
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:34,760
that makes sense.
What about the knowledge of good and 

2549
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:34,760
evil?
What in

2550
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:38,980
the world does that mean?
The mesopotamians believed that human 

2551
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:40,570
beings were made out of the blood of 
king,

2552
02:10:40,571 --> 02:10:42,770
knew who was the worst monster that 
time,

2553
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:44,360
Matt,
who was the goddess of chaos,

2554
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:49,690
could imagine and then produce.
So their idea was that whatever it was 

2555
02:10:49,690 --> 02:10:51,560
about humanity,
there was something deeply,

2556
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:54,500
deeply,
deeply demonically flawed.

2557
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:02,960
So that's their conception and the sound
of that same value that these stories 

2558
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:07,401
emerge.
So what is opening your eyes and 

2559
02:11:07,401 --> 02:11:09,150
realizing your vulnerability have to do 
with the knowledge of good and evil.

2560
02:11:09,370 --> 02:11:11,370
And really I thought about that.
I really thought about that.

2561
02:11:11,371 --> 02:11:16,371
I got to tell you,
I thought about that for like 20 years 

2562
02:11:16,371 --> 02:11:16,371
because I knew there was something there
that I could not put together.

2563
02:11:16,371 --> 02:11:19,170
And at the same time I was,
I was reading things.

2564
02:11:19,410 --> 02:11:21,780
I'm going to tell you something truly 
awful.

2565
02:11:22,110 --> 02:11:23,780
And so if you need a trigger warning,
you're,

2566
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:26,190
you're getting one.
And believe me,

2567
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:31,370
I do not give trigger warnings lately.
So I'm going to tell you something he 

2568
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:32,620
will never forget.
So this is what unit seven,

2569
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:35,460
31 used to do in China.
And China is a Japanese unit.

2570
02:11:35,461 --> 02:11:37,480
During the Second World War,
right,

2571
02:11:37,590 --> 02:11:42,590
and as far as I can tell,
they did the most horrific things that 

2572
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:43,650
were done to anyone during World War II 
and that's really something,

2573
02:11:44,220 --> 02:11:49,220
so this is what they did.
They took their prisoners and they would

2574
02:11:50,971 --> 02:11:55,971
put them in a position so that their 
arms would freeze solid and then they 

2575
02:11:57,091 --> 02:12:02,091
would take them outside and pour hot 
water over their arms and then he would 

2576
02:12:02,101 --> 02:12:07,101
repeat that until the flesh came off the
bones and they were doing that to 

2577
02:12:07,101 --> 02:12:10,560
investigate the treatment of frostbite 
for soldiers.

2578
02:12:11,490 --> 02:12:14,190
Or you can look up unit seven,
31 if you want to have nightmares.

2579
02:12:15,090 --> 02:12:18,390
So that's a unit seven slash 31.
That's human beings.

2580
02:12:18,660 --> 02:12:21,630
Someone thought that up and then people 
did it.

2581
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:26,590
That's knowledge of good and evil.
Here's the,

2582
02:12:26,650 --> 02:12:27,940
here's the key,
man.

2583
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:33,610
You know you're vulnerable.
No other animal knows that you know what

2584
02:12:33,611 --> 02:12:38,140
hurts you because you're vulnerable and 
now that you know what hurts you,

2585
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,650
you can figure out what hurts someone 
else.

2586
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:46,000
And as soon as you know what hurts 
someone else and you can use that,

2587
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:48,850
you have the knowledge of good and evil,
well,

2588
02:12:48,851 --> 02:12:53,851
it's a pretty good trick that the snake 
pose because it doesn't look like it's 

2589
02:12:53,851 --> 02:12:56,671
exactly the sort of thing that we might 
have wanted if we would've known what 

2590
02:12:56,671 --> 02:12:59,611
the consequence was.
But as soon as a human being as self 

2591
02:12:59,611 --> 02:13:00,100
conscious and aware of his own 
nakedness,

2592
02:13:00,250 --> 02:13:05,250
that he has the capacity for evil and 
that is introduced into the world right 

2593
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:06,760
at that point.
And here's the rest of the story.

2594
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:11,110
So there's the snake,
right in your some tree dwelling primate

2595
02:13:11,111 --> 02:13:11,980
in the snake eats you.

2596
02:13:11,980 --> 02:13:13,750
And that sucks.
So let's like,

2597
02:13:14,110 --> 02:13:16,420
let's watch out for the damn snakes.
And then you think,

2598
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:18,130
well wait a minute,
your brain grows and you think,

2599
02:13:18,131 --> 02:13:19,210
wait a minute.
Well,

2600
02:13:19,211 --> 02:13:21,910
there's not just snake.
There's were snakes live.

2601
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:24,850
Why don't we just get the hell out of 
the tree and go hunt down the snakes and

2602
02:13:24,851 --> 02:13:29,851
get rid of them.
So those are sort of like potential 

2603
02:13:29,851 --> 02:13:31,891
snakes.
And so the snake becomes potential 

2604
02:13:31,891 --> 02:13:34,771
snake.
And it's the same circuit that you're 

2605
02:13:34,771 --> 02:13:34,771
using to do this thinking and then you 
get rid of the damn snakes.

2606
02:13:34,771 --> 02:13:37,800
It's like St Patrick chases the mode of 
Ireland.

2607
02:13:37,801 --> 02:13:39,690
No more snakes.
Everything's paradise.

2608
02:13:39,691 --> 02:13:40,560
It's like,
no,

2609
02:13:40,561 --> 02:13:41,100
no,
no,

2610
02:13:41,101 --> 02:13:42,600
that's not.
That's not how it works.

2611
02:13:42,601 --> 02:13:43,020
No.
Well,

2612
02:13:43,021 --> 02:13:45,810
now you've got the human snakes.
You're a tribe.

2613
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:50,960
You've got tribal enemies.
You've got to defend yourself against 

2614
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:51,450
the human snakes,
right?

2615
02:13:51,451 --> 02:13:55,650
So maybe your empire experience and you 
get rid of all the human snakes.

2616
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:57,600
And then what happens?
Well,

2617
02:13:57,601 --> 02:13:59,400
they start to grow,
develop inside.

2618
02:13:59,401 --> 02:14:02,790
It's like you get rid of all the 
external enemies and you make a big city

2619
02:14:02,791 --> 02:14:07,791
and all of a sudden there's enemies that
pop up inside because the snake isn't 

2620
02:14:07,791 --> 02:14:12,261
just the snake in the garden.
And this snake isn't just the possible 

2621
02:14:12,261 --> 02:14:12,261
snake.
And the snake isn't just the snake.

2622
02:14:12,261 --> 02:14:14,370
That's your enemy.
The snake is your friend,

2623
02:14:16,130 --> 02:14:17,780
right?
Because your friend can be true.

2624
02:14:18,110 --> 02:14:21,590
And then it's even worse than that 
because you can be true to you.

2625
02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:24,350
And so even if you get rid of all the 
outside snakes,

2626
02:14:24,710 --> 02:14:28,220
you've got an inside snake and God only 
knows what it's up to.

2627
02:14:28,820 --> 02:14:33,820
And that's why the bloody Christians 
associated the snake in the garden of 

2628
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:37,751
Eden with Satan,
it's unbelievably brilliant because you 

2629
02:14:37,751 --> 02:14:40,140
got to think what's the enemy?
Well,

2630
02:14:40,250 --> 02:14:42,560
the snake fair enough,
but you know,

2631
02:14:42,561 --> 02:14:44,360
that's good if you're a tree dwelling 
primate.

2632
02:14:44,570 --> 02:14:46,640
But if you're a sophisticated human 
being,

2633
02:14:46,870 --> 02:14:51,870
you know,
with 6 million years of additional 

2634
02:14:51,870 --> 02:14:52,820
evolution and you're really trying to 
solve the problem of what it is,

2635
02:14:52,821 --> 02:14:55,900
that's the great enemy of mankind.
Well,

2636
02:14:55,901 --> 02:14:58,460
it's the human propensity for evil,
right?

2637
02:14:58,550 --> 02:15:00,310
As such,
well,

2638
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:03,170
that's the figure of Satan.
That's what that figure means.

2639
02:15:03,171 --> 02:15:05,390
Just like there's a logo,
that's the truth,

2640
02:15:05,391 --> 02:15:09,890
that speaks order out of chaos at the 
beginning of time.

2641
02:15:10,130 --> 02:15:15,080
There's an antithetical spirit,
the hostile brother that's cane to able,

2642
02:15:15,081 --> 02:15:16,970
which we'll talk to talk about next 
week,

2643
02:15:17,210 --> 02:15:22,210
that's doing exactly the opposite.
It's motivated by absolutely nothing but

2644
02:15:23,091 --> 02:15:28,091
malevolence and the willingness to 
destroy and it has every reason for 

2645
02:15:28,091 --> 02:15:28,091
doing so.

2646
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:31,590
And that's

2647
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:35,570
what's revealed in the next story.
And cain and Abel in one paragraph,

2648
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:41,290
the first glimmerings of that outside of
the strange insistence by the Christian 

2649
02:15:41,290 --> 02:15:42,320
mystics,
let's say,

2650
02:15:42,530 --> 02:15:47,530
on the identity between the snake in the
garden of Eden and the author of all 

2651
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:47,660
evil himself.

2652
02:15:52,530 --> 02:15:57,530
Thank you.

2653
02:15:58,610 --> 02:16:00,830
Okay,
so we only have 15 minutes today.

2654
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:06,520
I wanted to finish that.
So apologies for going over a little 

2655
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:08,630
longer and.
All right.

2656
02:16:09,820 --> 02:16:13,270
Hi Dr Peterson over the last couple of 
weeks and further back,

2657
02:16:13,271 --> 02:16:17,110
you talk a lot about consciousness and 
the importance of it and I was hoping to

2658
02:16:17,111 --> 02:16:22,111
get your opinion on an issue of 
consciousness that has often seen 

2659
02:16:22,111 --> 02:16:25,200
Christianity among other groups and 
politics kind of clashed.

2660
02:16:25,201 --> 02:16:30,201
So I'm hoping to get your views on the 
consciousness or lack thereof of human 

2661
02:16:30,201 --> 02:16:30,201
fetus

2662
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:35,340
and how that's impacted your views on 
abortion whenever they are and any 

2663
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:39,640
legislation.
Thank you.

2664
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:51,460
Thank you.
Okay,

2665
02:16:57,931 --> 02:17:00,480
so the first question is,
do I have an answer for that?

2666
02:17:00,481 --> 02:17:03,060
That's a good enough answer to actually 
reveal.

2667
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:06,810
No,
I don't,

2668
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:11,840
but I'll.
I can flail about a little bit around 

2669
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:13,140
it.
Abortion is clearly wrong.

2670
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:18,450
Don't think anybody debates that.
You wouldn't recommend that someone that

2671
02:17:18,451 --> 02:17:21,390
you love have one.
Okay.

2672
02:17:21,391 --> 02:17:26,391
Now,
having clarified that that mere 

2673
02:17:26,491 --> 02:17:29,580
statement doesn't eliminate the 
complexity of the situation.

2674
02:17:31,950 --> 02:17:35,280
The first question is,
is should everything wrong be illegal?

2675
02:17:36,390 --> 02:17:40,230
That's a tough question.
Everything that's wrong isn't illegal.

2676
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:45,630
Then there's the additional complication
of the difference,

2677
02:17:45,631 --> 02:17:50,631
let's say in gravity regarding the 
problem in relationship to men and women

2678
02:17:55,230 --> 02:18:00,230
and we don't know how to deal with that.
Having said that,

2679
02:18:00,341 --> 02:18:02,620
I would say that it's actually the wrong
question.

2680
02:18:04,330 --> 02:18:07,390
There's something Leonard Cohen said 
once he said that in a massacre,

2681
02:18:07,391 --> 02:18:12,391
there's no decent place to stand,
and what he meant by that was sometimes 

2682
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,130
you're aware there is no good decision 
left,

2683
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:17,620
no matter what you do.
It's wrong.

2684
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:21,770
So then the question is,
how did you get there?

2685
02:18:22,490 --> 02:18:24,050
Well,
let's say you're in a position where you

2686
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:28,100
are inclined to seek an abortion.
The question is,

2687
02:18:29,030 --> 02:18:34,030
how did you get there?
Now we have a lot to straighten out 

2688
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:36,590
about sexual relationships between men 
and women.

2689
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:40,610
In the modern world,
they're bent and warped and demented out

2690
02:18:40,611 --> 02:18:45,611
of shape.
One of the things I see with young 

2691
02:18:45,611 --> 02:18:45,611
people,
for example,

2692
02:18:45,611 --> 02:18:48,460
is that they will engage in sexual acts 
with one another that they would not 

2693
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:49,430
talk about with one another.
I mean,

2694
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:52,040
couples will do that for that matter,
like married couples will do that,

2695
02:18:52,041 --> 02:18:54,800
but they're married.
That's a different story.

2696
02:18:55,310 --> 02:19:00,310
It seems to me that if you are willing 
to engage in a sexual act with someone 

2697
02:19:00,310 --> 02:19:01,010
with whom you would not discuss that 
act,

2698
02:19:01,011 --> 02:19:03,140
you probably put the cart before the 
horse,

2699
02:19:04,130 --> 02:19:09,130
so the discussion regarding the legality
of abortion is nested inside a larger 

2700
02:19:11,931 --> 02:19:16,931
discussion about the morality of 
abortion and that's nested inside a 

2701
02:19:18,261 --> 02:19:23,261
larger discussion about the proper place
of sexuality and human behavior and to 

2702
02:19:23,811 --> 02:19:27,770
me that's the level at which the problem
needs to addressed.

2703
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:31,500
Now I don't have the answer to that,
you know,

2704
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:34,240
because they all answer was get married 
now.

2705
02:19:34,241 --> 02:19:37,580
It's a good answer and it's an answer 
that people should still listen to,

2706
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:40,760
but we'll put that aside momentarily.

2707
02:19:42,830 --> 02:19:45,310
I had a client at one point who was.
I don't know.

2708
02:19:45,330 --> 02:19:47,230
She was probably.
No,

2709
02:19:47,380 --> 02:19:49,940
I'm going to disguise her in a variety 
of different ways.

2710
02:19:50,450 --> 02:19:52,260
She was 27,
28,

2711
02:19:52,310 --> 02:19:57,310
thereabouts,
had come from a relatively conservative 

2712
02:19:57,310 --> 02:19:58,850
background,
quite a timid or fearful person and also

2713
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:04,720
not very well,
not sophisticated in relationship to 

2714
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:06,470
relationships and she'd never had sex.
Well,

2715
02:20:06,471 --> 02:20:07,910
there's a bunch of things she'd never 
done.

2716
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:09,290
Well,

2717
02:20:12,550 --> 02:20:17,550
the answer from me to her wasn't 
continued to be timid about everything 

2718
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:23,110
because that wasn't working out for her.
She needed to go have some adventures.

2719
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:29,160
Now,
sexual adventures like other adventures 

2720
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:32,941
are dangerous and so you have to be very
careful when you encourage people to go 

2721
02:20:32,941 --> 02:20:34,390
out and have adventures,
but,

2722
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:36,310
but,
but too much.

2723
02:20:36,311 --> 02:20:40,600
Timidity and caution also constitutes a 
pathway to perdition.

2724
02:20:40,601 --> 02:20:45,601
Let's say you can't just say to people 
in the morning world while you know,

2725
02:20:46,541 --> 02:20:51,541
sex till you're married,
unless you're going to get married when 

2726
02:20:51,541 --> 02:20:51,541
you're very young and perhaps you 
should.

2727
02:20:51,541 --> 02:20:56,401
I don't know about that,
but I don't think that we're mature 

2728
02:20:56,501 --> 02:21:00,880
enough as a culture to have a serious 
discussion about sexual impropriety,

2729
02:21:00,940 --> 02:21:03,010
especially in the aftermath of the birth
control pill.

2730
02:21:03,220 --> 02:21:05,680
And we seriously need to do that and we 
haven't.

2731
02:21:05,950 --> 02:21:09,340
And so I think the eternal debate about 
abortion,

2732
02:21:09,341 --> 02:21:11,920
horrible as it is,
is a,

2733
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:16,490
it's the surface manifestation of a much
deeper problem.

2734
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:22,570
Now,
I talked a little bit today about the 

2735
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:22,570
utility of marriage,
like the spiritual utility of marriage,

2736
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:27,640
and that's something that I think we're 
so immaturely cynical as a culture,

2737
02:21:28,641 --> 02:21:33,641
like we don't.
We're not wise enough to look at an 

2738
02:21:33,641 --> 02:21:35,831
institution like marriage and to really 
think about what it means and what it 

2739
02:21:35,831 --> 02:21:37,490
signifies.
It signifies a place that people can tie

2740
02:21:37,491 --> 02:21:39,650
the ropes of their lives together so 
that they're stronger.

2741
02:21:39,651 --> 02:21:42,110
It signifies a place where people can 
tell the truth to one another.

2742
02:21:42,350 --> 02:21:46,580
It signifies a place where sexuality can
properly be integrated into life.

2743
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:49,010
That's no easy.
That's no easy task.

2744
02:21:49,370 --> 02:21:51,560
It's a place where children,
at least in principle,

2745
02:21:51,561 --> 02:21:55,010
it can be put first and foremost as they
should be once they exist.

2746
02:21:55,490 --> 02:22:00,260
And so there's a much broader discussion
that has to happen.

2747
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:05,320
I think before any concentration on the 
legality of abortion is labeled to get 

2748
02:22:05,601 --> 02:22:08,150
anywhere at all.
That's what it looks like to me.

2749
02:22:08,620 --> 02:22:10,940
So that's the best I can do with that 
question.

2750
02:22:13,700 --> 02:22:18,700
Thank you.

2751
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:24,750
Hi,
Dr Peterson earlier you showed a picture

2752
02:22:24,780 --> 02:22:26,930
of and newer.
Yeah.

2753
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:28,320
And,
and uh,

2754
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:31,470
oh cyrus.
And in your maps of meaning lectures,

2755
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:36,950
you also explained that cultures around 
the world have these twin snakes that 

2756
02:22:36,950 --> 02:22:37,950
are were everywhere,
man.

2757
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:43,040
Yeah.
And so you mentioned that you believe 

2758
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:44,700
this is a representation of DNA.
You would bring that up to Jesus.

2759
02:22:44,701 --> 02:22:47,390
What is it with you guys tonight?
Yeah,

2760
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,060
well,
yeah.

2761
02:22:48,061 --> 02:22:49,500
No,
I wouldn't say I believe that.

2762
02:22:49,501 --> 02:22:51,870
I have my suspicions that,
that might be it.

2763
02:22:51,871 --> 02:22:54,000
Yeah,
because believe is too strong a word,

2764
02:22:54,001 --> 02:22:55,950
but those representations are 
everywhere.

2765
02:22:56,310 --> 02:22:59,730
And read this book.
This is a good one.

2766
02:23:00,990 --> 02:23:05,990
Oh Man.
Now I have to remember the book by an 

2767
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:08,601
anthropologist who went down to the 
Amazon jungle and experimented 

2768
02:23:08,601 --> 02:23:10,470
intensively with Iowasca.
I think it's called the cosmic serpent.

2769
02:23:10,890 --> 02:23:13,110
I think that's the name of the book.
You could read that.

2770
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:15,090
There's another one called breaking open
the head,

2771
02:23:15,091 --> 02:23:19,740
which is also pretty damn interesting.
And there's something to those books.

2772
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:23,940
I mean the cosmic serpent kind of goes 
off on a bit of a tangent I would say.

2773
02:23:23,941 --> 02:23:26,130
Although breaking open the head is,
it's better,

2774
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:32,240
better,
it seems to stay more constrained and 

2775
02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:32,550
tight,
but there's,

2776
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:36,570
we don't know the limits of our 
perception,

2777
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:41,760
especially under certain conditions and 
I think people have had intimations of 

2778
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:46,140
DNA as the cosmic serpent for ever,
so.

2779
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:49,230
Yeah.
But that's like,

2780
02:23:49,860 --> 02:23:53,070
that's way out on the frontiers of 
knowledge,

2781
02:23:53,071 --> 02:23:54,350
right?
Like I'm,

2782
02:23:54,390 --> 02:23:58,230
I'm guessing in a dreamlike way when I'm
making statements like that.

2783
02:23:58,231 --> 02:24:03,231
So because you didn't mention that you 
did believe it and that there were sort 

2784
02:24:03,231 --> 02:24:07,101
of maybe some,
some dreams and interpretations that 

2785
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:12,380
might have emerged,
but I don't see how we could have 

2786
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:12,990
perceived DNA as it is,
right?

2787
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:16,200
Well,
yes we did.

2788
02:24:16,290 --> 02:24:21,290
We didn't objectively,
but I'm not so sure we didn't 

2789
02:24:21,290 --> 02:24:22,170
subjectively and me,
it's very strange that these,

2790
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:27,230
that these double helix is exist in so 
many places in that they're are often 

2791
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:27,990
utilized as healing symbols with the 
snake.

2792
02:24:28,350 --> 02:24:30,900
So anyways,
like I said,

2793
02:24:30,930 --> 02:24:32,880
that's.
What do you call that?

2794
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:37,800
I'm a high.
It's not hypothesizing.

2795
02:24:37,801 --> 02:24:40,020
It's one thing worse than that.
Speculating.

2796
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:41,510
Those are speculations.
I'm,

2797
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:44,070
I'm operating at the edge of my 
understanding,

2798
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:49,470
but our perceptions are very mutable and
they can,

2799
02:24:50,010 --> 02:24:55,010
we can see things under some conditions 
that you wouldn't think that anybody 

2800
02:24:55,010 --> 02:24:55,010
could see.
So.

2801
02:24:55,710 --> 02:24:56,520
Okay.
Yep.

2802
02:24:58,470 --> 02:25:02,710
Thank you.

2803
02:25:03,050 --> 02:25:06,390
Um,
so I was just starting to have a thought

2804
02:25:06,391 --> 02:25:09,990
while you were talking about sort of 
getting to the end of the talk about the

2805
02:25:10,300 --> 02:25:15,300
snake and the and the apple and so on.
So what you're saying is the moment 

2806
02:25:15,751 --> 02:25:17,100
that,
that uh,

2807
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:21,420
that Adam and eve eat the apple,
they become nervous or whatever.

2808
02:25:21,421 --> 02:25:23,280
So that's awareness of their own 
vulnerability.

2809
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:28,290
So then like you said,
it's also awareness of their own 

2810
02:25:28,290 --> 02:25:30,721
capacity to do harm.
So it's like when they are eating the 

2811
02:25:30,721 --> 02:25:33,841
apple then that's them.
Their immediate sort of a nervous 

2812
02:25:33,851 --> 02:25:38,851
reaction is,
is because they ate the apple and they 

2813
02:25:38,851 --> 02:25:39,430
kind of became evil in that moment or 
something like that.

2814
02:25:39,670 --> 02:25:43,390
So when they woke up and because they,
they woke up and realized how they could

2815
02:25:43,391 --> 02:25:48,391
be hurt,
how they could and would be hurt over 

2816
02:25:48,391 --> 02:25:48,391
the,
over the,

2817
02:25:48,391 --> 02:25:49,050
over the upcoming.
Over time.

2818
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:54,540
It's the same as the discovery of you 
did the discovery of your own nakedness 

2819
02:25:54,540 --> 02:25:57,840
and the discovery of time are very,
very similar phenomena mean.

2820
02:26:01,210 --> 02:26:03,190
Sure.
As soon as you know how you can be hurt,

2821
02:26:03,580 --> 02:26:06,550
well you don't have to just consult your
evil fantasies.

2822
02:26:06,551 --> 02:26:08,440
It's like wild really hurt him.
Oh yeah.

2823
02:26:08,441 --> 02:26:09,430
That would work.
It's like,

2824
02:26:09,431 --> 02:26:10,790
how do you know that?
Well,

2825
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:13,840
you just think about it.
What would happen if that happened to me

2826
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:15,130
that would hurt.
Oh yeah,

2827
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:18,550
that'll work.
It'll hurt him or her and you know,

2828
02:26:18,850 --> 02:26:21,940
you probably think that way twice a week
or maybe twice a day.

2829
02:26:21,970 --> 02:26:26,970
Jesus,
every time you have an argument with 

2830
02:26:26,970 --> 02:26:26,970
someone,
Oh you have to do is look at the back of

2831
02:26:26,970 --> 02:26:27,580
your mind a little bit.
You don't want to,

2832
02:26:27,581 --> 02:26:29,290
that's for sure.
But if you do,

2833
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:33,970
you'll see these sorts of thought 
processes generating constantly.

2834
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,080
It's like,
you know,

2835
02:26:35,081 --> 02:26:38,380
in a back and forth discussion,
particularly with people you love,

2836
02:26:38,381 --> 02:26:41,500
it's like you're always looking for a 
place to put the knife in.

2837
02:26:42,910 --> 02:26:43,880
It seems really similar to.

2838
02:26:44,410 --> 02:26:49,410
Seems like they're kind of discovering 
the kind of union shadow within 

2839
02:26:49,410 --> 02:26:49,410
themselves.
So that,

2840
02:26:49,410 --> 02:26:51,860
that is the moment where it got 
introduced into the human spirit.

2841
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:57,150
Sure.
One of the things about the shadow is 

2842
02:26:57,150 --> 02:26:59,981
that it's also when you integrate that,
that's what makes you a substantial 

2843
02:26:59,981 --> 02:26:59,981
person.
Right?

2844
02:26:59,981 --> 02:27:03,020
So it's like,
it seems to me that on one hand,

2845
02:27:03,021 --> 02:27:08,021
well it's,
it seems like this tragedy that Satan 

2846
02:27:08,021 --> 02:27:08,021
the most evil,
the father of evil,

2847
02:27:08,021 --> 02:27:12,401
whatever has introduced into people,
but it also seems like without that 

2848
02:27:12,401 --> 02:27:15,200
shadow that people are kind of in 
substantial.

2849
02:27:15,890 --> 02:27:16,520
So

2850
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:17,420
yeah.
Well,

2851
02:27:17,670 --> 02:27:18,410
right,
right.

2852
02:27:18,411 --> 02:27:20,680
I mean,
like I said,

2853
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:25,870
that there's been a multitude of 
interpretations emerge as a consequence 

2854
02:27:25,870 --> 02:27:27,540
of that story.
What was got up to was,

2855
02:27:27,610 --> 02:27:29,900
was God in fact evil,
the initial God,

2856
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:32,540
like why?
Why would he create a snake?

2857
02:27:32,570 --> 02:27:35,300
Why would he put it in the garden?
Why would there be these trees?

2858
02:27:35,510 --> 02:27:38,180
What the hell is going on with the whole
Satan thing?

2859
02:27:38,510 --> 02:27:39,440
You know,
it's very,

2860
02:27:39,441 --> 02:27:40,940
very problematic.
Well,

2861
02:27:41,090 --> 02:27:45,170
we'll talk about it more.
And this again is,

2862
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:48,170
let's call it speculation.
Well,

2863
02:27:53,070 --> 02:27:55,200
if you want to make something strong,
you test it.

2864
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:58,740
And maybe if you want to make something 
ultimately strong,

2865
02:27:58,741 --> 02:28:03,741
you tested ultimately,
and I think that there's an aspect of 

2866
02:28:03,871 --> 02:28:08,871
being that has that element is that 
human beings are tested to ultimately

2867
02:28:11,030 --> 02:28:16,030
it's partly because we know good and 
good and evil now and so that's the 

2868
02:28:16,030 --> 02:28:19,430
landscape in which we exist.
So you could say the landscape is across

2869
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:24,520
it's chaos in order and as and evil and 
we're stuck in the middle between those 

2870
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:25,130
two things.
It's a very common theme by the way,

2871
02:28:25,131 --> 02:28:27,740
in video games.
Exactly that chaos order,

2872
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:29,000
good evil.
It's the.

2873
02:28:29,090 --> 02:28:34,090
It's the basic plot of endless video 
games and that's perhaps because it's 

2874
02:28:34,090 --> 02:28:37,211
the basic plot.
Those are the things we have to contend 

2875
02:28:37,211 --> 02:28:37,211
with.
Well,

2876
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:39,860
I had a vision once.
It shouldn't tell you this,

2877
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:41,090
but I will.
Anyways.

2878
02:28:41,780 --> 02:28:46,780
I had a vision once that I went to 
heaven and I was putting in a enrollment

2879
02:28:47,121 --> 02:28:52,121
amphitheater with Satan just like thor 
in countering the hulk,

2880
02:28:52,671 --> 02:28:57,671
right?
That's coming up in that new avengers 

2881
02:28:57,671 --> 02:28:57,671
movie.
And so that was rather a shock because I

2882
02:28:57,671 --> 02:28:58,910
thought that was a hell of a thing to 
happen in heaven.

2883
02:28:59,210 --> 02:29:04,210
And so I had this battle and I won in a 
day and I came up to God and said,

2884
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:10,280
what's with the whole Roman amphitheater
thing there,

2885
02:29:10,281 --> 02:29:12,860
it seemed like a bit over the top to me,
said,

2886
02:29:12,861 --> 02:29:16,070
why would you put me in a ring with 
someone thinking like that?

2887
02:29:16,430 --> 02:29:21,430
And he said,
because I knew you could win and you 

2888
02:29:21,430 --> 02:29:25,301
know,
I don't know what to make of that one 

2889
02:29:25,301 --> 02:29:26,870
thing I should make of it as,
I shouldn't tell you,

2890
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:29,330
but whatever.
But you know,

2891
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:35,200
there's something,
there's something to that in my 

2892
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:35,200
estimation.
It's like,

2893
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,490
do you protect the people you love or do
you try to make them strong?

2894
02:29:38,270 --> 02:29:43,270
So you think it's that it's not that 
heavily Satan to thank for making a 

2895
02:29:43,270 --> 02:29:47,441
substantial.
It's that God gave us Satan in order to 

2896
02:29:47,441 --> 02:29:51,881
make a substantial wall.
I'd hesitate to say that because you 

2897
02:29:51,881 --> 02:29:51,881
know,
it's,

2898
02:29:51,881 --> 02:29:51,881
it's so cut and dried.

2899
02:29:52,430 --> 02:29:57,290
But I would say that,
that that's a strong underlying theme in

2900
02:29:57,291 --> 02:29:59,120
the biblical narrative.
Yes.

2901
02:29:59,810 --> 02:30:04,810
Now it's certainly not the only theme 
and it's not the only interpretation by 

2902
02:30:04,810 --> 02:30:06,550
any stretch of the imagination,
but there is something there.

2903
02:30:06,570 --> 02:30:07,360
There's something there,
you know,

2904
02:30:07,380 --> 02:30:12,380
at the end we didn't talk about this.
God puts up his flaming sword and these 

2905
02:30:12,381 --> 02:30:14,930
chairmen to keep you away from the tree 
of life.

2906
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:19,960
It's like it seeing if if paradise and 
immortality or the promised land and 

2907
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:26,110
why,
what's with the whole flaming angel and 

2908
02:30:26,110 --> 02:30:28,871
sword thing?
We could have just had the damn fruit 

2909
02:30:28,871 --> 02:30:31,810
5,000
years ago and not bothered with the 

2910
02:30:31,810 --> 02:30:31,810
problem.
Well,

2911
02:30:31,810 --> 02:30:32,900
it seems to me that there's something 
like,

2912
02:30:33,950 --> 02:30:38,780
I don't know what it is,
consciousness through tragedy,

2913
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:43,870
clarity through suffering.
Maybe something like that or maybe the 

2914
02:30:43,870 --> 02:30:48,221
perfection that lurks as a potential in 
the future is something that has to be 

2915
02:30:48,221 --> 02:30:48,710
earned rather than given.

2916
02:30:48,950 --> 02:30:51,260
Maybe it has no value without free 
choice.

2917
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:53,810
Maybe we have to distinguish between 
good and evil.

2918
02:30:53,811 --> 02:30:56,540
Now that we have the capacity to 
actually apprehend them.

2919
02:30:57,080 --> 02:31:00,320
Maybe that's what life is about.
Maybe that's the separating of the wheat

2920
02:31:00,321 --> 02:31:01,100
from the chaff.
See,

2921
02:31:01,101 --> 02:31:02,630
that's the idea and revelation,
right?

2922
02:31:02,930 --> 02:31:05,270
Because when Christ comes back in the 
book of revelation,

2923
02:31:06,350 --> 02:31:11,350
he divides the amd from the saved and 
the saved are the people who lived in 

2924
02:31:11,691 --> 02:31:14,420
logos,
roughly speaking and the damned or those

2925
02:31:14,421 --> 02:31:19,421
who don't,
and so there's this idea that there's 

2926
02:31:19,421 --> 02:31:21,660
this dynamic that underlies experience 
that he is in fact that's sorting.

2927
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:26,760
Now I don't know what to make of that at
all,

2928
02:31:27,210 --> 02:31:32,210
but that's the story,
but what I can make of that is that I.

2929
02:31:33,180 --> 02:31:38,180
I can't put a lever underneath the 
argument that I just made tonight about 

2930
02:31:38,491 --> 02:31:41,370
the relationship between the development
of vision,

2931
02:31:41,790 --> 02:31:45,240
the snake fruit,
nakedness time,

2932
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:47,880
future work,
and most importantly,

2933
02:31:47,881 --> 02:31:50,700
the emergence of evil.
That seems to me to be.

2934
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:54,960
I cannot find a way to undermine that 
argument.

2935
02:31:55,080 --> 02:32:00,080
It seems I can't break it,
and that's what I'm always looking for 

2936
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:02,850
when I'm trying to formulate ideas.
I'm trying to look for something that no

2937
02:32:02,851 --> 02:32:07,851
matter how hard I try,
I cannot break and I can't break that 

2938
02:32:07,851 --> 02:32:10,500
set of ideas.
Now what the full implication is of that

2939
02:32:10,501 --> 02:32:12,630
set of ideas.
God only knows,

2940
02:32:12,810 --> 02:32:14,070
right?
But,

2941
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:21,710
but I could say also practically,
you know,

2942
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:26,750
one of the things that I've observed is 
that lies and deception destroy people's

2943
02:32:27,031 --> 02:32:32,031
lives.
And when they start telling the truth 

2944
02:32:32,031 --> 02:32:32,810
and acting it out,
things get a lot better.

2945
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:35,350
GotTa stop.

2946
02:32:35,400 --> 02:32:35,510
Yeah.
