1
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,210
Thank you.

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much for showing up 

3
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:41,251
again.
That's a really good to see everybody 

4
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:41,251
here.

5
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:41,251
So

6
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,260
one of the things that I've been 
realizing as a consequence of going 

7
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,570
through these stories is that

8
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,540
the degree to which there are about 
individuals is quite remarkable and I 

9
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,050
think that's really telling,
you know,

10
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,140
one of the reasons I prefer Dostoevsky 
tolstoy because tolstoy is more of a 

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,420
sociologist.
He's more interested in the relationship

12
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,450
between groups of people.
This is an oversimplification because 

13
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,571
obviously total story's a great author,
but I'd like to stfc better because he 

14
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,790
really delves into the souls of 
individuals and I think it's remarkable.

15
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,150
The degree to which all of the stories 
that we've covered so far in genesis are

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,320
about individuals and they're quite 
realistic,

17
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,380
which is quite remarkable to.
They're not really romanticized to any 

18
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,400
great degree because all of the people 
that are regardless,

19
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,460
regardless,
let's say as patriarchal or matriarchal 

20
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,741
figures in genesis have no shortage of 
ethical Gif.

21
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:50,991
No shortage of ethical flaws and also no
shortage of difficulties in their life 

22
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:51,770
and the difficulties are realistic 
there.

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,180
Their major league problems,
you know,

24
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:59,181
like familial catastrophes and famine 
and war and revenge and hatred and all 

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,570
those things.
It's not a.

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,100
it's not a pretty.
It's not a pretty book and that's one of

27
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:10,101
the things that makes it great.
I mean that's one of the things that 

28
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:10,101
characterize this great literature 
right,

29
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:12,750
is that it doesn't present you with a 
whitewash view of,

30
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,320
of,
of humanity or of existence.

31
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:20,040
And that's really a relief I think 
because as you all know,

32
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,280
because you're alive,
there's no such thing as a whitewash.

33
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,810
Existence like your to be alive is to be
in trouble.

34
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Ethically and existentially.
I've been reading this book recently.

35
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,980
I'll talk about it a little bit later.
It's called better never to have been 

36
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,660
and it was written by a philosopher in 
South Africa in Cape Town named Bennett.

37
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,480
That's his last name and he basically 
argues,

38
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,120
I think it's a specious argument and I 
think it's artificially constructed,

39
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,890
but he basically argues that because 
life is so of suffering,

40
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,730
even good lives are very much full of 
suffering.

41
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,480
That it's wrong to bring children into 
the world because the suffering 

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,120
outweighs the good even in good lives 
and it's actually wrong.

43
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,210
It would also be better not to exist for
exactly the same reason and my sense in 

44
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:24,331
reading the book is that he came to that
conclusion and then wrote the book to 

45
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,630
justify it,
which is actually the reverse of the way

46
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:30,631
that you should write a book,
but you should do when you're writing a 

47
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:30,631
book is you should have a question and 
you should.

48
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,200
It should be a real question,
right?

49
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:37,201
It should be one you don't know the 
answer to and then you should be 

50
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:40,321
studying and writing like mad and 
reading everything you can get your 

51
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:43,501
hands on to see if you can actually 
grapple with the problem and come to 

52
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:47,161
some solution and you should walk the 
reader as well through your process of 

53
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,270
thinking so that they can come to the,
well,

54
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,410
not necessarily to the same conclusion,
but at least track what you're doing and

55
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,490
I don't think that's what he did.

56
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,770
I think he wrote it backwards,
but then.

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,800
And so I was thinking about it a lot 
because that's actually a question that 

58
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:07,291
I've contended with in my writing.
There are Memphis to Ophelia and are 

59
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,190
satanic figures,
for example,

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,200
in girth is faust and also Ivan in the 
in the brothers Karamazov who basically 

61
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:16,590
make the same case,
you know,

62
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,630
that existence is so rife with trouble 
and suffering that it would be better if

63
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:26,200
it didn't exist at all.
And the problem I've had with that,

64
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,660
there's a variety of them.
But one of the problems I've had with 

65
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:31,660
that is what happens if you start to 
think that way?

66
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,680
Because what I've observed is that 
people who begin to think that way,

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,520
that isn't where they stop.
Like they get angry at existence,

68
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:42,250
which is what happened to cane as we saw
in the Cain and Abel Story.

69
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,240
And then the next step is to start 
taking revenge against existence.

70
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,060
And that cascades until it's revenge 
against.

71
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,210
While I think the best way of thinking 
about it as revenge against God for the 

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,601
crime of being,
which is I think the deepest sort of 

73
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:57,610
hatred that you can entertain.
And,

74
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,080
and,
and,

75
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,790
and when you're in the grip of a really 
deep emotion,

76
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,180
like a really profound emotion,
right at the bottom of emotions,

77
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,420
you're in something that's like a quasi 
religious state and that's more or less 

78
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,930
independent of your belief,
say in a transcendent deity.

79
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:14,950
I mean you can be in a profoundly 
emotional state that's as deep as it can

80
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:19,951
be and it can have religious 
significance without that necessarily 

81
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:20,260
signifying anything about a transcendent
being,

82
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,670
you know,
but,

83
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,920
but then I was thinking,
see,

84
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:27,460
the problem with that argument is you 
can gerrymander it endlessly,

85
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,960
you know,
because first of all,

86
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,360
how do you measure suffering and how do 
you measure happiness?

87
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,970
It's like how do you assign weights to 
them and God,

88
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,950
there's just no way of doing that.
You have to do it arbitrarily and so you

89
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,650
can make an argument that the suffering 
outweighs the happiness.

90
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:46,651
You just wait the suffering more heavily
than you wait the happiness and that's 

91
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:46,651
the end of that,
you know?

92
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:47,200
And so that's,
that's a problem.

93
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,070
But I think there's a deeper problem.
And I was reading this other book a 

94
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,490
while back as well,
which was written by the guy who ran the

95
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,540
human genome project,
and I don't remember exactly what it was

96
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:07,541
called,
but it was something like a scientist's 

97
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:07,541
case for God.
There's something like that.

98
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:11,650
And one of the things he referred to,
which didn't strike me as hard as it 

99
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,830
should have to begin with,
was the he,

100
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,960
he,
he thought that one of the phenomena say

101
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,961
that justified a belief in a 
transcendent being with something like 

102
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:26,090
the moral intuition of human beings that
know we have a sense of right and wrong.

103
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,710
And uh,
you know,

104
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,330
certainly what happens in genesis and 
the story of Adam and eve is that,

105
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,700
that,
that story announces the coming of the 

106
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:37,700
sense of right and wrong,
right?

107
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,501
The knowledge of good and evil.
And it isn't something we ascribe to 

108
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,931
animals.
It's something that's unique to human 

109
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:44,120
beings.
Animals can be predators and you know,

110
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:47,930
and they can be gentle and and you can 
have a relationship with them,

111
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:50,630
but you never think of an evil cat or 
you know,

112
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:53,190
or an evil wolf even though they're,
you know,

113
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,050
they're predatory,
but human beings,

114
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,130
we have this capacity to judge between 
good and evil,

115
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:06,131
right and wrong,
and it's really an integral part of our 

116
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:07,310
being and I think you can make an 
evolutionary case for that,

117
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:12,311
a biological case for that as you can 
make a biological case for most of what 

118
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,760
is relevant about human beings because 
we are biological creatures,

119
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:20,150
but we don't really understand the 
significance of that.

120
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,150
Like what happens in the story of Adam 
and eve is that that's that realization 

121
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,141
that coming to the knowledge of good and
evil is actually represented as a shift 

122
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:29,390
of cosmic significance,
right?

123
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:34,391
It puts a,
it puts a permanent fracture in the 

124
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:37,031
structure of being and you know,
if you think of human beings as 

125
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:40,841
insignificant and so on,
a tiny dust mote in the middle of an 

126
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:44,390
infinite cosmos,
a cosmos that cares less for us,

127
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,760
then who cares?
Fundamentally,

128
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:50,480
if human beings have the knowledge to 
distinguish between good and evil,

129
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:55,481
but if you give consciousness a central 
role in being and you can make a 

130
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:58,040
perfectly reasonable case for that 
because without consciousness there's no

131
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:03,041
being as far as anyone can determine,
so it may be much more central than we 

132
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,160
think.
And and I,

133
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,460
I really don't think there's a counter 
argument to that,

134
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,320
like not a solid one.

135
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,510
You can state that consciousness is 
empathy,

136
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:16,511
phenomenal and that the world is 
fundamentally materialistic and it 

137
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:16,520
doesn't matter that there's 
consciousness.

138
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:21,521
You can state that,
but you can make an equally credible 

139
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:22,830
case the other way.
And certainly our lived experiences,

140
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,850
that consciousness is crucial obviously,
and we treat each other as if most of 

141
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:33,311
the time we're valuable conscious beings
and we wouldn't give up our 

142
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,030
consciousness even though it's often 
consciousness of suffering.

143
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,360
And so then I think another problem with
the book is that it's,

144
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,810
it's sort of predicated on the idea that
life is for happiness and I don't think 

145
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,751
that's right,
and I don't think that's how people 

146
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:51,641
experience life and I might be wrong,
but it seems to me that people 

147
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:56,730
experience life as something like a,
a series of ethical decisions.

148
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,500
It's something like that.
I mean,

149
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,070
when I just can't imagine,
maybe I'm being naive about this,

150
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:09,801
but I can't imagine that I can't imagine
another being that's like me in most 

151
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:17,001
senses,
that isn't constantly wrestling in some 

152
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,740
sense with what the next proper thing to
do is.

153
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,740
It's not like it's obvious.
It's not bloody obvious and it doesn't 

154
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,540
mean you'll do the right thing because 
you don't lot lots of times and you know

155
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,760
that by your own judgment,
right?

156
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:31,230
Because you're making mistakes all the 
time.

157
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,900
Sometimes you don't know what you're 
doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe

158
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:38,901
it isn't.
And who's to say that isn't what I'm 

159
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:41,181
talking about.
I'm talking about when you know that 

160
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:41,181
what you're doing is wrong and you go 
ahead and do it anyways.

161
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,230
People do that all the time and that's 
also extremely peculiar.

162
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Bloody well think that if you knew it 
was wrong and you told yourself that it 

163
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,791
was wrong,
that that would be sufficient so that 

164
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:52,791
you would just wouldn't do it,
but that isn't what you're like at all.

165
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:57,681
You know,
and you can tell yourself something is 

166
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:58,500
wrong a 50 times and you'll do it the 
51st time and then you'll feel,

167
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,190
you know,
like,

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,200
like you deserve to feel probably and,
but it doesn't stop you.

169
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,200
And so,
so then I think the other problem with 

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,290
the viewpoint,
the idea that the suffering of life 

171
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,310
eradicates its utility is that it's 
predicated on the idea that happiness or

172
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:21,621
lack of suffering even is,
is the right criteria by which to judge 

173
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,330
life.
And I don't think that's how we actually

174
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:29,331
experience life.
I think what we do instead is put 

175
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:31,770
ourselves through a series of 
excruciating moral choices.

176
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,060
You know,
when.

177
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,380
One of the things that that's really 
significant about the biblical stories,

178
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:42,381
and I think about the the entire 
implicit philosophy you know that's 

179
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:48,060
embedded in the stories,
is that that's how life is presented in,

180
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,160
in the stories,
is all of these individuals first 

181
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,370
through individuals to not groups and 
second,

182
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,700
they're agonizing over their moral 
choices all the time,

183
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,910
all the time,
and they have a relationship with God 

184
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,100
and but it's not a.

185
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,220
it's not a directive relationship.
Exactly.

186
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:08,820
Even the people to whom God speaks 
directly,

187
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,120
which I suspect is not something you'd 
would exactly want to have happen,

188
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,540
is it's there's still even the fact that
they have a direct relationship with God

189
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:24,621
doesn't stop them from being tormented 
continually by their moral choices and 

190
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:28,380
so the world is presented as a a moral 
landscape,

191
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,800
not as a,
not as a place that justifies itself by 

192
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,041
happiness.
It's presented as a more landscape and 

193
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,801
people are presented as creatures who 
traverse through the moral landscape,

194
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,200
making ethical decisions that determine 
the course of the world and that seems 

195
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:51,021
to me to be right and that's not a.
that's not the same as happiness by any 

196
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,800
stretch of the imagination.
It's a whole different category of being

197
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,090
and

198
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,700
you know,
one that I've thought that through a lot

199
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:02,701
and I think,
well we do make choices and what we do 

200
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:06,001
is contend with the future.
The future seems to appear to us as a 

201
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:10,291
realm of possibility.
That's a more accurate way of thinking 

202
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:14,491
about it.
Then then that the future presents 

203
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,441
itself to it,
to us as a realm of determined thinks 

204
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:21,160
it's,
it's presents itself as a realm of 

205
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,191
possibility and there's good choices in 
that realm and there's poor choices or 

206
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:27,121
even evil choices in that realm and 
we're negotiating continually deciding 

207
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,950
which of those choices we're going to 
bring into being.

208
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,940
That seems to me to be 
phenomenologically,

209
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,010
indisputable,
and we certainly treat each other as if 

210
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,040
that's what we're doing because we hold 
each other responsible for our actions,

211
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:44,210
you know,
with some exceptions and that we're 

212
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,120
deciding each moment whether to make 
things better or worse.

213
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,110
And that seems to me to be correct.
And I think that that's what these 

214
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:57,290
stories illustrate.
They don't say that directly,

215
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:02,291
you know,
although I think it gets more and more 

216
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:02,480
explicit as the narrative unfolds,
but,

217
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,310
and then part of the realism of the 
stories is that,

218
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:05,370
okay,

219
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,370
the people aren't.
The people that are being presented are 

220
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,150
by no means good,
mean maybe with the exception of Noah.

221
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,770
Noah was seemed to be a pretty good guy.
All they did,

222
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,110
he did get drunk and you know,
and,

223
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,270
and,
and end up naked exposed to his sons and

224
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:22,040
so forth.
And.

225
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,200
But I mean he,
he isn't talked about a lot as a 

226
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
character.
It's a pretty compressed story.

227
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:33,241
But Abraham,
I mean Abraham had plenty of problems 

228
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:34,590
not least of which was his inability to 
leave home and then you know,

229
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,870
his lying about his wife and there 
there's all sorts of mistakes.

230
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:41,110
And then Jacob,
who we're going to talk about tonight is

231
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,490
an even more morally ambivalent 
character.

232
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,760
He's,
especially at the beginning of the 

233
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:50,760
story,
he's,

234
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:50,810
it's,
it's,

235
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,450
he isn't the sort of person that you 
would pick out.

236
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,220
Especially if you were a hack writer.
You wouldn't pick him out as the hero of

237
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:05,221
the story.
He does a lot of things that are really 

238
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:06,580
pretty reprehensible and takes them an 
awful long time to learn better,

239
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,820
and yet he's the person who's put 
forward as the father of the 12 tribes 

240
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,681
of Israel.
It's from this flawed person that the 

241
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:20,221
people that,
that maybe that whose story you might 

242
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:24,190
say is at the fundamental,
constitutes the fundamental underpinning

243
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:25,740
of our culture.
It's,

244
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:30,130
it's from this deeply flawed individual 
that that group emerges.

245
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,800
And so you might think about as a relief
too,

246
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:36,400
because you know,
you're no knight in shining armor,

247
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:36,970
you know,
with,

248
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,850
with a,
with a pure moral past.

249
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:44,851
I mean,
people make mistakes of catastrophic 

250
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:44,851
proportions nonstop,
you know,

251
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,520
and that also means that these stories 
put forward.

252
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,340
Something approximating hope because in 
their realism,

253
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:56,690
in their moral realism,
they present heroes.

254
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,560
I suppose,
the heroes of renown,

255
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,020
right?
The Patriarchs of old,

256
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:03,380
let's say,
who are realistic,

257
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:08,381
people who have fits of anger and rage 
and who are murderous at times and who 

258
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:13,571
are deeply,
deeply embroiled with family dispute 

259
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:14,330
and,
and who,

260
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,630
who have adulterous affairs and like 
they do all of the terrible things that 

261
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,870
people do.
And the weird thing is,

262
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:25,490
is that God is still with them and

263
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,070
you know,
it isn't obvious what that means or even

264
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,460
if it means anything,
but it's very,

265
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:38,490
it's not disputable as far as I can tell
that a we're conscious and that 

266
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,410
consciousness is a transcendent 
phenomena which,

267
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,150
which we do not understand.
And that the landscape that we traversed

268
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,160
through his moral,
like every store you ever watch,

269
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:51,160
anything that grips your imagination on 
the screen or in the theater,

270
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,910
like any story that grabs you is a story
of moral striving.

271
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,800
It's just not interesting otherwise.
Right?

272
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,820
The person has to be confronted with 
complex moral choices.

273
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:02,520
And then you see the outcome and you 
know,

274
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,220
the good guy does it right and the bad 
guy does it badly and things don't go so

275
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:09,730
well for the bad guy generally.
And if it's a bit more sophisticated,

276
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:12,310
the good and the bad are in the same 
individual.

277
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:12,970
And that's,
you know,

278
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:17,971
that's a more compelling story.
But so we could say,

279
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:22,670
well,
let's,

280
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,700
let's,
we could make the assumption that it 

281
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:27,700
might be worthwhile thinking of the 
world as a,

282
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,590
as it has been thought of classically as
a theater upon which the forces of good 

283
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,031
and evil continually strive for 
dominance and I,

284
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,940
for the life of me,
especially after I started reading 

285
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,270
deeply into 20th century history and all
the terrible things that happened in the

286
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:49,271
20th century and all the terrible,
unbelievably incomprehensible things 

287
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:54,101
that people did to one another.
I just couldn't see seeing things any 

288
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,680
other way is realistic now because

289
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,890
I don't think that you can immerse 
yourself in 20th century history without

290
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:04,050
coming to the conclusion that evil is a 
reality.

291
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,200
And if it's a reality,
it depends on what you mean by reality.

292
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:11,390
But it's fundamental enough reality for 
me.

293
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,840
And if it's a reality,
then I don't see how you can escape from

294
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:19,841
the conclusion that the cosmos as we 
experienced it at least is a place of 

295
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:24,380
moral striving.
And well,

296
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:27,230
that's one of the things that's really 
illustrated in the story of Jacob.

297
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,440
And I found that quite striking.
So,

298
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,670
so the last time,
last lecture,

299
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,940
I ended with the abrahamic stories with 
the death of Sarah Abraham's wife,

300
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,700
and so we're going to continue from from
there.

301
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,090
Remember Abraham had a son,
Isaac,

302
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:54,180
and he was asked by God to sacrifice his
son,

303
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:59,181
which we talked about in in some depth 
and I was attempting to make the case 

304
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:06,171
that you know,
the idea of sacrifice was one of human 

305
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:09,320
kinds,
great discoveries because it meant the 

306
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,430
discovery of the future essentially,
but it also meant the discovery that the

307
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:16,431
future was something that you could make
a bargain with and that you could give 

308
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,280
up something now,
something impulsive,

309
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,310
some pleasure,
even a deep pleasure in the moment,

310
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,730
and you could strive and hypothetically 
you could make a covenant to bargain 

311
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,141
with the future.
And if your sacrifices were acceptable 

312
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,230
and that seemed to mean an ethically 
acceptable,

313
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,120
you had to sacrifice the right thing.

314
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,390
That that vastly increased the 
probability that not only you would be 

315
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,730
successful,
let's say,

316
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,930
but that your descendants would be too.
And I don't think that that's an 

317
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,360
irrational proposition.
I mean,

318
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,570
you have to leave in it a bit with the 
realization that sometimes you know you 

319
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,870
get sliced off at the knees no matter 
what,

320
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,930
right?
Because life has an arbitrary element 

321
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,300
and and that can be tossed out,
but building in the arbitrary element 

322
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,620
will say,
you still want to think,

323
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:03,150
well,
what's your best bet?

324
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,180
Given a certain amount of randomness,
and it seems to me that conscious self 

325
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:12,720
aware sacrifice and proper ethical 
striving is your best bet.

326
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:17,721
And you know there another idea that 
I've always explained it when I've 

327
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:23,721
explained it to people.
I've always used the movie Pinocchio as 

328
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:26,691
an example.
You know that when Japan was trying to 

329
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:29,360
make his puppet into a self aware and 
autonomous moral agent,

330
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,720
which is what he wants above all else,
he aims at the highest good.

331
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,850
That he can conceive w which is the star
that he prays to essentially and hopes 

332
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,591
for the transformation.
And there's also something in that 

333
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,051
that's unalterably profound and maybe 
that is somewhat independent of the idea

334
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:53,721
that you have to believe in God.
I would also say that what it means to 

335
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,770
believe in God in the Old Testament is 
by no means clear,

336
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,440
and that's something I also really want 
to talk about tonight.

337
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:03,441
It's not obvious what it means and well 
Japan know what he does,

338
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:09,060
at least his aim at the highest good of 
which he can conceive,

339
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,150
you know,
and that that's actually been a 

340
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,030
philosophical definition of God upon 
occasion that God is the highest good of

341
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:20,031
which you conceive.
And that's different than the idea of a 

342
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,610
transcendent being.
Precisely,

343
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:28,611
but it's in line with.
It's in line with certain interesting 

344
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:28,611
psychoanalytic speculations.

345
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:30,390
This is one of the things I really liked
about Carl Young,

346
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:32,350
you know,
young was so radical,

347
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:33,870
a thinker.
It's just beyond belief.

348
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:36,480
Like I've read a lot of critics of young
and I've always,

349
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,570
I've always got a kick out of them 
because the things they accuse young of 

350
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,810
are so trivial compared to the things 
that young actually did that it's like 

351
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,831
accusing a murderer of jaywalking.
Like because young was unbelievably 

352
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:51,520
radical.
Like here's one of his ideas.

353
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,010
You know,
he thought that it was necessary.

354
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:59,020
He believed that psychotherapy could be 
replaced by a supreme moral effort and 

355
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:04,111
so the moral effort would be something 
like aiming after good and then trying 

356
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:07,501
to integrate yourself around that and 
that the good at which you aim would be 

357
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:14,251
something approximating what you would 
be like if you manifested your full 

358
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:18,250
potential and that you have a glimmering
of what that full potential was,

359
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:21,370
so that would be the potential future 
you and he thought of that.

360
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,980
He thought of people as four dimensional
entities,

361
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:28,981
especially essentially that we're 
stretched across time and that you as a 

362
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:33,481
totality across time,
including your potential manifested 

363
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:36,901
yourself also in the here and now and 
that part of what your potential 

364
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:41,610
manifested itself was something like the
voice of conscious conscience or 

365
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,000
intuition.
It's amazing idea.

366
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,290
It's an amazing idea,
right?

367
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,360
Because it's like what you could be in 
the future,

368
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:51,361
beckons to you in the present and helps 
you determine the difference between 

369
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,620
good and evil.
It's a mind boggling idea and you know,

370
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:58,621
I think that it's an idea you have to 
contend with and then he went further 

371
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,190
than that.
This is,

372
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,110
this is also remarkable idea,
you know,

373
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:09,150
he,
he was interested in this symbolic 

374
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,550
representation of Christ and I mean 
psychologically speaking,

375
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:14,551
and he thought of Christ as the 
representation of the ideal potential 

376
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:15,940
human.

377
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,330
It's something like that.
So it was a symbolic,

378
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,430
at minimum,
that's what Christ was,

379
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,860
is a symbolic representation of the 
ideal potential of a human being.

380
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,530
And so for young,
there was no difference between,

381
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,190
there was no psychological difference 
between who you could be in the future 

382
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,451
beckoning to you and the prey in the 
present and orienting yourself in 

383
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:39,760
relationship to Christ psychologically.
Those were the same thing.

384
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,510
And then so that's a pretty mindboggling
idea.

385
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,440
Like,
seriously,

386
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:46,320
that's a mind boggling idea,
you know,

387
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,050
especially when you add the 
psychological idea that the.

388
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,920
One of the things that characterize as 
your ideal future self is the ability to

389
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:55,240
make sacrifices,
right?

390
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,310
And the deeper the sacrifice,
the better.

391
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,070
And then also to recover from the 
sacrifice,

392
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:01,600
right?
So that's the death and rebirth.

393
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:06,100
So the part of you that's most essential
to your full flowering as a,

394
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,450
as a being is your ability to let things
go.

395
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,500
And then spring back from that,
so to die in some sense and to be reborn

396
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,050
in the service of a higher good.
And then,

397
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,350
well then the next part of that is that 
the direction of the world depends on 

398
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:27,841
you doing that.
So not only your own life but your 

399
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:30,631
family's life.
And because we're networked so intently 

400
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:30,631
together,
you know,

401
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:35,011
the,
the whole panoply of human kind and 

402
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:35,500
maybe the structure of the,
of the cosmos.

403
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,730
And you know,
you might think,

404
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:38,350
well no,
but you know,

405
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,960
it's not so simple.
It's not so simple.

406
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,890
First of all,
one person can wreak an awful lot of,

407
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,380
there's absolutely no doubt about that.
And as we get more technologically 

408
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,621
powerful,
that becomes even more relevant and 

409
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:53,621
important and crucial.
You know,

410
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:58,570
one of the things that you said was that
we had to wake up because we are too 

411
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,160
technologically powerful to be as 
morally asleep as we are.

412
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,860
And that seems to me just to be self 
evident.

413
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,430
That's.
Yeah,

414
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,420
for sure.
That's true.

415
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,740
We're,
we're,

416
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,370
we're half asleep with nuclear bombs.
It's not a good idea.

417
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,370
It's seriously not a good idea.
And so.

418
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,860
Well,
and then you might ask yourself too,

419
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:19,420
you don't.
We're like,

420
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,430
what is the ultimate potential of a 
fully developed human being?

421
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,790
And well,
we certainly know that you have 

422
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,340
admiration for people who are more 
developed rather than less developed.

423
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:36,341
That's,
that just happens automatic or 

424
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:36,341
resentment that.
But that's okay.

425
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,640
It's the same thing.
It doesn't matter,

426
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,920
but it's not like you can't identify 
them.

427
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,360
You can identify them,
you know,

428
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:43,130
and,
and they're put forward to you in,

429
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,210
in,
in drama and fiction and all of that 

430
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,231
constantly.
So that's another form of moral 

431
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:50,231
intuition,
you know,

432
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:53,861
you can read,
you can discern the wheat from the 

433
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:53,861
chaff,
let's say.

434
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:53,861
And,
and so

435
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,970
the other thing that I was thinking 
about it's worth consideration too,

436
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,470
is that,
you know,

437
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,230
and maybe this is,
maybe this is petty,

438
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,380
but I don't think it is.
Somebody asked me the other day if I 

439
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,990
believed in miracles and I hate being 
asked questions like that,

440
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:20,650
you know,
and you know,

441
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,920
it's also people ask me to do,
I believe in God and I'm like,

442
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,870
I don't know what they mean when they 
say that.

443
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,920
So I don't know what to answer because I
don't think we're taught necessarily 

444
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,731
going to talk about the same thing,
but in any case I said yes and I have a 

445
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:34,790
variety of reasons for that,
but one of them is that,

446
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,930
you know,

447
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,500
the consensus among physicists is that 
we can track the origin of the cosmos to

448
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:49,801
something like 100 million of a 
millionth of a second after the big 

449
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:53,971
bang.
It's like it's so close to the big bang 

450
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,780
that the difference is literally 
infinitesimal.

451
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,800
But the consensus is that before that,
whatever that is,

452
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,260
the laws of physics themselves 
breakdown,

453
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,170
well,
what?

454
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,080
What do you call an event that

455
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,480
exists outside the laws of physics?
That by definition that's a miracle.

456
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,370
Now that doesn't necessarily mean that 
there's a transcendent daddy that caused

457
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:19,080
the event.
That's a separate issue,

458
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,950
but it does imply a barrier of some sort
beyond which we can't go where some 

459
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:31,611
other set of rules apply.
And so I find that interesting as well.

460
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,630
So all right,

461
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:47,910
so dies and Abraham makes a bargain with
the hittites to purchase a burial place 

462
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:55,520
for her and they offer it as a gift and 
he insists upon paying for it.

463
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:00,540
It's a little story that basically 
indicates two things that Abraham was 

464
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,940
the kind of guy that you trust pretty 
much when you see them and that even if 

465
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:10,041
something is offered to him as a gift,
he's going to do everything to be 

466
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:13,881
reciprocal about it.
And so it's not a massively important 

467
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:14,870
part of the story,
but it's,

468
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,060
it's in keeping with the same narrative 
flow.

469
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,270
And so if Ron,
who's a hittite,

470
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:24,060
offers a burial place as a gift and 
Abraham says,

471
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:24,520
no,
you know,

472
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,200
you have to let me pay for it,
and everyone says he will.

473
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:33,201
And that works out very well.
And so he has a burial place for his 

474
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:37,161
wife.
And then Abraham decides that Isaac 

475
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:39,450
needs a wife.

476
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:45,170
And so he sends his eldest servant to 
Mesopotamia to find a wife for Isaac.

477
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:53,070
And there's this strange ritual that's 
performed.

478
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:58,071
So it says in the story that the servant
places his hand under Abraham's thigh 

479
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,840
to,
to swear,

480
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:04,530
but that isn't really what it means.
It means that he places his hand.

481
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,620
I don't know exactly how to say this 
properly.

482
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,330
Well,
use your imagination.

483
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:14,331
How about that?
And the idea is that as far as I can 

484
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:17,880
tell that he's swearing on the future,
he's swearing on future people.

485
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,160
It's something like that.
So that,

486
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:20,940
that's sort of what testified means,
right?

487
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,430
Think about the route while.
I'm not kidding,

488
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,870
I'm not kidding.
That is what that is the derivation,

489
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:29,370
right?
If it is the derivation.

490
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:30,690
So,
so,

491
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,220
uh,
so anyways,

492
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:37,221
this is a serious issue.
So that servant has to go and find 

493
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:40,641
Isaac,
a good wife and he wants him to find 

494
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:43,380
Isaac,
a wife who is willing to accept the same

495
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:48,410
fundamental belief system,
which is something like the belief in a 

496
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,380
God that's a unity rather than a 
plurality.

497
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,710
You know,
the other thing that young was very 

498
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,361
insistent upon was that there was a 
relationship between polytheism and 

499
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:04,140
psychological confusion and monotheism 
and psychological unification.

500
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,350
And I really liked that idea too,
that you know that that what you're 

501
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,320
trying to do,
because you are a plurality,

502
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:15,321
that that's one of the things the 
psychoanalysts were really good at 

503
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:16,650
figuring out that the cognitive 
scientists haven't touched yet as far as

504
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:21,651
I can tell they're way behind the 
psychoanalysts and that element of 

505
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:24,321
thinking is that you are composed of sub
personalities which all have their own 

506
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,660
desires and their own viewpoint in their
own thoughts and their own perceptions 

507
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,920
and they're in a war with each other 
constantly,

508
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,350
maybe even a Darwinian war.
It's been.

509
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:39,410
It's been portrayed that way by certain 
neuroscientists and that that one of the

510
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,160
goals of life is to

511
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,190
integrate all of that plurality into a 
hierarchical ethical structure that has 

512
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:51,710
some canonical ethic at the pinnacle.
Right?

513
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,820
We've talked a little bit about that and
it's not obvious what should be at the 

514
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,970
pinnacle,
but we can guess at it.

515
00:29:57,971 --> 00:30:00,070
It's,
it's that which we admire.

516
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,100
That's one way of thinking about it.
It's that that describes fair play 

517
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,301
across a sequence of games.
That's another good way of thinking 

518
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:09,301
about it.
It's,

519
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:11,800
it's the heroic ideal that's another way
of thinking about it,

520
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:14,350
but it's combined with generosity,
you know,

521
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,360
because the hero,
the mythological hero goes out into the 

522
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,360
unknown and slays the dragon and gets 
the gold,

523
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,110
but then comes back to the community and
distributes what's found.

524
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:26,440
And so it's courage plus generosity and 
um,

525
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:32,190
and so all of your,
all of that interior struggling that 

526
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,121
you're doing is an attempt to hang 
yourself against the world with 

527
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:39,490
challenge,
constantly to hit everything together,

528
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:41,260
like you're beating on a piece of iron 
to,

529
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,400
to,
to,

530
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,140
to cure it,
let's say,

531
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,040
so that you don't,
you're not an internal contradiction.

532
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:53,040
You're not massive competing God,
something like that because it's just 

533
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,941
too psychologically stressful and hard 
on everyone else and impossible for them

534
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,570
to get along with you if you're one 
thing,

535
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:00,460
one moment and another thing,
another moment.

536
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:04,090
And so.
So anyways,

537
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:09,091
Abraham insists that Isaac find a wife 
from among people who are likely to 

538
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:11,650
carry off forward the monotheistic 
tradition.

539
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,430
And I'm not sure that the monotheistic 
tradition is actually indistinguishable,

540
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,060
is actually distinguishable from the 
individualistic tradition.

541
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,230
I think they might be the same thing at 
different levels of analysis,

542
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,410
you know,
so because individual means and divided 

543
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:28,930
in some sense,
right?

544
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:33,931
To be an individual means to be one 
thing and the other thing that mitigates

545
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:39,541
against the idea of life is happiness is
it isn't obvious to me that it's 

546
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:41,210
happiness.
That is what molds you and shapes you.

547
00:31:41,211 --> 00:31:46,211
You know,
it's something more like optimal 

548
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:46,300
challenge voluntarily undertaken at 
something like that.

549
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,660
Right.
And I think that's echoed in the idea 

550
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,090
that everyone has a moral obligation to 
raise their cross,

551
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,120
something like that,
to accept the fact of their mortality 

552
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,450
voluntarily.
I believe that that's the case and I do 

553
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,231
actually think that that's a 
prerequisite to proper psychological 

554
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:07,411
development because if you're not 
willing to take your mortality on 

555
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:12,391
voluntarily,
like if you're kicking and fighting 

556
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:12,970
about it constantly and you have every 
reason to don't get me wrong,

557
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,360
then you can't act forthrightly in the 
world.

558
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,630
Right?
You're going to be afraid and when 

559
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,911
you're afraid,
then you can't voluntarily take on a 

560
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:27,061
challenge.
And then if you can't take voluntarily 

561
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:27,061
take on a challenge,
then you can't develop.

562
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:30,961
And so again,
the life seems to be something like if 

563
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:35,011
it's a proper life is a voluntarily 
voluntary taking on of great challenges 

564
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,420
and maybe that's better than happiness.

565
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,680
Like it's certainly more noble,
you know,

566
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,990
it's not a word we use very much 
anymore.

567
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,470
The idea of nobility because we're so 
obsessed with happiness.

568
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,260
But I think happiness is a,
like if it comes along,

569
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:48,920
man,
great,

570
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:50,000
you know,
wonderful.

571
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:55,030
Don't,
don't take it lightly or for granted 

572
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,860
because it's fleeting.
But the idea that that's what you should

573
00:32:57,861 --> 00:33:01,320
be for in some sense to seems to me,
if,

574
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,890
if that's what life is for,
then maybe it shouldn't be.

575
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,130
Maybe that's correct because that isn't 
what life is,

576
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,790
but it also doesn't.
It isn't obvious to me that that's what 

577
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:12,790
life should be,
you know?

578
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,931
I mean,
if you really loved someone like your 

579
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:16,931
son,
let's say,

580
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:17,120
would you say,
well,

581
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,490
I hope he has a happy life,
or would you say,

582
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,420
I hope he accomplishes great things.
It seems to me that that's better than 

583
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,420
that.

584
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,750
The accomplishing of great things 
because that's admirable.

585
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,780
You know?
It's like a happy person is a happy 

586
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,941
person.
But a noble person has an admirable 

587
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:38,120
person and and that's,
that's better at man,

588
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,240
and so maybe there are better things 
than happiness and so you can't judge 

589
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,300
being on the basis of the ratio of 
suffering to pleasure,

590
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,390
something like that.
It's,

591
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:52,810
and I don't think we do that.
I don't believe we do that be comedians 

592
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:52,810
are happy,
right?

593
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:57,251
But everyone doesn't aspire to be a 
comedian and you don't watch comedy all 

594
00:33:57,251 --> 00:33:58,160
the time,
even though you could laugh nonstop more

595
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:03,161
or less if the comedians funny.
You want to get your teeth into 

596
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:04,610
something.
And also seems to me that this is one of

597
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:07,010
the reasons I liked existential 
philosophy was that,

598
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:13,550
you know,
the existentialists believed it's sort 

599
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:13,550
of an original sin idea.
They believe that we came into the world

600
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,400
with an ethical burden already laid upon
us something,

601
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,190
something like that,
and that we had a felt sense that it was

602
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:22,910
necessary for us to justify our being.
And if we didn't do that,

603
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:26,930
then we weren't authentic to ourselves.
We weren't moving towards individuality.

604
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:32,110
We weren't sustaining the community.
We weren't living properly and that and 

605
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,011
that,
that idea was deeply embedded in people 

606
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:38,771
as part of their ordinary experience and
that also seems to me to be accurate and

607
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,750
you know,
I've dealt with lots of people say in my

608
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:42,900
clinical practice and

609
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,230
they don't really cut.
They are,

610
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,960
they will come and say,
I wish I wasn't so unhappy,

611
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:54,530
but they don't usually come and say I 
wish I was happier and those things 

612
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,620
aren't the same.
And then when,

613
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,640
when,
when you talk to people who are having 

614
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:00,640
trouble,
you know,

615
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,160
they want to straighten things out and 
figure out how to do them right.

616
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,160
It's something like that.
And,

617
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,230
and that that's the primary,
that's their primary goal.

618
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:07,410
And

619
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,800
so anyways,
Abraham sends his eldest servant off to 

620
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,930
his place that God has granted him to 
find a wife.

621
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:27,930
And interestingly,
it,

622
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,420
the borders of the promised land under 
quite similar to the current borders of 

623
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,490
Israel.
I mean,

624
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,500
these are estimates right?
Based on the biblical and didn't mean 

625
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,381
that's not a fluke obviously,
but it's interesting to see the 

626
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:46,260
concordance between these ancient 
stories in the present day world.

627
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,660
So I thought that was very interesting 
and it shows once again that the past,

628
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,090
you think the past is the past,
but it's not,

629
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:57,150
it's still here.
It's embedded in the present,

630
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:02,151
you know,
just like the future in somehow in some 

631
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:02,550
ways is folded up inside the president 
waiting to unfold.

632
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,370
The past is all folded up inside the 
present too.

633
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,870
So anyways,
the servant goes to

634
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,780
the land that he's been charged to go to
an end.

635
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:25,380
He,
he's,

636
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,920
he's trying to figure out how in the 
world am I going to find a good wife for

637
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:30,600
Isaac.
I mean I don't know any of these people.

638
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:34,470
And so he has this little dialogue 
that's presented in the form of a prayer

639
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:36,060
I suppose.
Um,

640
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,830
and he thinks,
well,

641
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:40,290
I'm going to go to the,
the place where you water,

642
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,210
where people get water and water,
the animals.

643
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:47,211
And um,
because that's a place where everyone 

644
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:47,211
gathers.
So that's a good place to find someone.

645
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:47,790
And,
and it,

646
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,960
it's,
it's not a place of fun and lightness 

647
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,130
and relaxation and impulsivity.
It's a place of,

648
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,770
of,
of life sustaining work.

649
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:57,990
And then he thinks something like,
well,

650
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,610
what would a decent girl do at a 
watering place?

651
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:03,660
And he thought,
well,

652
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,930
maybe she would offer a stranger some 
water and also offer to water the camels

653
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,970
because that would be brave to approach 
the stranger and then generous and then 

654
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,980
indicative of the willingness to make an
effort.

655
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,450
And when you know that a camel,
I think he took 10 camels.

656
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,180
It was quite a few camels anyways,
not just one.

657
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,050
And that accountable can drink 20 
gallons of water.

658
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,470
And Rebecca,
who was drawing water from the wet turns

659
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:36,570
out to be Rebecca is drawing water from 
the well,

660
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,190
which is hard,
right?

661
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,300
Because water's heavy and you have to 
lift it up and it's 10 camels.

662
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,520
And so that's like 200 gallons of water.
So,

663
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,770
you know,
she has to put herself out a fair bit in

664
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:51,180
order to make this stranger happy.
And so that's what happens.

665
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:56,181
And then the service has brought along 
gifts and that sort of thing.

666
00:37:57,731 --> 00:38:00,880
And any ways to make a long story short,
uh,

667
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:06,300
Rebecca agrees to come back,
to come back with the servant and marry 

668
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,550
Isaac.
And so

669
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,920
then she has,
she gets pregnant and she has twins and 

670
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,610
this is an interesting thing.
The twins fight inside her,

671
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,580
she can tell that they're not getting 
along.

672
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,200
And this is an echo,
right?

673
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:28,201
It's an echo of Cain and Abel and the 
mythological motif that the unions have 

674
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:30,850
called the hostile brothers,
the hostile brothers,

675
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:34,150
and you see them all the time,
Batman and the joker or hostile brothers

676
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:38,710
and thor and or hostile brothers and I,
it's an unbelievably common motif.

677
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,400
And you know,
the ultimate hostile brothers or Christ 

678
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,400
and Satan.
So that's the,

679
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,380
that's the archetipal representation of 
the hostile brothers,

680
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,690
right?
The ultimate good and the ultimate evil.

681
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,590
And so and so it's an echo of the Cain 
and Abel Story.

682
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,430
Although it's a little more complex,
I would say from a literary point of 

683
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,690
view because it isn't obvious which of 
these brothers,

684
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:06,040
his cane and which of them is able,
they have parts of both in each of them.

685
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:11,430
So Esau,
who's turns out to be one of the 

686
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:11,630
brothers and Jacob who turns out to be 
the other oath,

687
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,980
have they're admirable qualities and 
their fault.

688
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,940
Anyways.
I'm Esau comes is born first,

689
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:24,330
but Jacob hasn't by the heel and so 
there was a fight within the womb to see

690
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:30,601
who would emerge first.
Now that's relevant because the 

691
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,960
firstborn had a special status.
While it has a special status in many 

692
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,680
communities,
especially agricultural communities,

693
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:39,040
and there's a reason these people were 
more hurts people.

694
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:44,041
But if you divide your property equally 
among all your children that had like 

695
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:47,641
three generations,
everybody has one goat and everybody 

696
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:47,641
starves to death,
you know,

697
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:50,610
or the same thing happens with land.
So one of the ways that,

698
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,670
that traditional communities solve that 
is they just give almost everything to 

699
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,010
the first board and then the everyone 
else knows,

700
00:39:57,011 --> 00:40:00,310
well you go out and do whatever you can 
and it's kind of arbitrary and unfair,

701
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:05,311
but you know,
at least it's predictably arbitrary and 

702
00:40:05,311 --> 00:40:07,210
unfair instead of doom over four 
generations,

703
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:12,211
you know,
so it actually mattered to be the first 

704
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:12,920
born and,
and God generally favors the first born.

705
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,650
And then you might think,
well,

706
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:18,920
what is it about being born first that's
so relevant apart from the,

707
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,860
the cultural practice of,
of aboard.

708
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,590
Generous inheritance.
And I would say,

709
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:27,040
well the first born is something like 
the model for the leader of the family,

710
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,530
right?
Because the first born child should be,

711
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,710
if there's a number of siblings,
a should take care of the siblings at 

712
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,671
least to some degree,
but also should be a role model for 

713
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:41,341
them.
So it's like a natural position of 

714
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:41,341
leadership.
But there's a cycle,

715
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:45,260
there's a cycle psychology ization of 
the idea of the first board in these 

716
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,931
stories because God often passes over 
the firstborn in favor of a later born 

717
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,400
child.
Um,

718
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,250
he seems to do that on the basis of 
moral character essentially.

719
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,430
And so there's this idea that,
well,

720
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,440
there's a natural proclivity towards 
leadership that's just a biological fact

721
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:03,730
that would be associated with being a 
first born.

722
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:09,030
But there's an element of 
characterological development that 

723
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,250
transcends that.
And so that you,

724
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,750
it's more important to be spiritually a 
firstborn,

725
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,080
let's say,
than to be biologically a first born.

726
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:19,081
And God recognizes that continually in 
these stories and inverts the natural 

727
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:21,640
order and favors a later board.
And who's,

728
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,840
who's done more work with regards to 
characterological development.

729
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:27,670
And that's also interesting too,
you know,

730
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:33,210
I've talked to lots of business people 
about leadership and there's a 

731
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,160
literature on leadership,
but it's not a good literature.

732
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:36,060
It's pretty shallow,
um,

733
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:41,070
partly because it's not that easy to 
define leadership and partly because 

734
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,070
there are different,
you know,

735
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,770
people have different temperaments and 
different temperaments can be leaders.

736
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,800
They just do it in different ways.
Now there's something in common about 

737
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,910
being a leader though.
And I would say one is that if you're an

738
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:54,050
actual leader,
you actually know where you're going,

739
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,920
right?

740
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,320
Because what are you going to do lead 
people in circles.

741
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:59,300
It's like maybe they'll follow you but 
you're not a leader,

742
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:04,301
you're just a charlotte.
And so you have to know where you're 

743
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:05,750
going and then you have to be able to 
communicate that and then people have to

744
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:10,751
trust you.
So you actually have to be honest 

745
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:10,751
because people aren't that stupid,
at least not for a long period of time.

746
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,360
And then where are you going has to have
some value because otherwise why would 

747
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,170
anyone want to go along with you?
So,

748
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,580
and then you might say,
well,

749
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:24,581
what,
what are the attributes that make you a 

750
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:24,581
leader?
And I would say,

751
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:24,800
well,
they're characterological fundamentally,

752
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,730
and this is not naive optimism or,
or,

753
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,480
or casual moralizing.
It has nothing to do with that.

754
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:33,560
You know,
we know,

755
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:38,561
for example,
that conscientious notice that the 

756
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:40,390
personality trait is a good predictor of
longterm success in,

757
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:43,010
in most occupations,
not all but most,

758
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,130
and that one of the things that's 
associated with conscientiousness is the

759
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,990
people keep their word,
they're trustworthy.

760
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,390
And that's certainly one element of a 
leader,

761
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:52,430
especially across any reasonable amount 
of time.

762
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,580
You have to be able to trust the person.
They can even be harsh,

763
00:42:55,581 --> 00:43:00,581
right?
It doesn't matter because you can see 

764
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,081
harsh leaders and kind leaders,
but as long as they do what they say 

765
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:05,591
they will do,
then then you can follow them and you 

766
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:06,440
know that the future payoff is,
is,

767
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,570
is secure,
something like that.

768
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,890
So the idea that character,
logical development is more important to

769
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:16,190
leadership than primogenitor.
I think that's the right word,

770
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,760
a primal genesis anyways,
being a first born,

771
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,690
that's a very crucial psychological 
realization that it's characterological 

772
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,380
development that makes you favored of 
God.

773
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,800
You know,
and I do think we've forgotten this in 

774
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,651
many ways because there isn't a lot of 
emphasis in our education system on 

775
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:37,640
characterological development and that's
very,

776
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:40,970
very surprising to me.
I think maybe it's partly because in our

777
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:45,971
fractured society,
we can't agree on what constitutes a 

778
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:49,691
reasonable characterological goal.
So we just throw up our hands and don't 

779
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,760
educate our kids to any degree at all,
especially in schools about what an 

780
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,140
admirable person is like or even let 
them know that,

781
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,210
well,
maybe you should actually try to be one.

782
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:04,211
You know,
that that's actually the most important 

783
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:04,211
possible thing that you could learn.
Right?

784
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,790
So,
and I also think,

785
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:16,791
and I think this is laid out very 
thoroughly in the biblical stories as 

786
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:20,571
well,
that if there are enough people who are 

787
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:22,220
admirable,
then things work and if there aren't,

788
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,860
then things.
Things are terrible.

789
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:31,130
You get wiped out.
You remember when Abraham is bargaining 

790
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,880
with God with regards to Sodom and 
Gomorrah,

791
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,460
he asked God to save the city if there's
like 40 admirable people,

792
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:39,690
right?
Respectable,

793
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,130
but let's say admirable,
right?

794
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,470
I don't want it.
I don't want to say good because good is

795
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:46,140
being corrupted in some sense by casual 
usage.

796
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,200
I mean admirable noble people,
right?

797
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,860
I think Abraham bargains God down to 
like 10.

798
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:57,861
If there's 10 of them in the city,
the city won't be destroyed and that 

799
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,291
that's not very many in the city.
So there's an interesting idea there 

800
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:04,371
which is that there,
there doesn't have to be that many 

801
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:04,530
people in a group who have their act 
together,

802
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,740
but zero is the wrong number and if it's
zero then then we're seriously in 

803
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:11,640
trouble.

804
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,290
And I think that goes along with the 
idea of the Preto principle in economics

805
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:21,291
too,
which is that it's a small minority of 

806
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:21,291
people who do most of the productive 
work in any given domain,

807
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:26,240
but so,
so a small number of properly behaving 

808
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,530
people might have enough of an impact to
keep everything moving.

809
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:30,540
And that might also.
That might actually be true,

810
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:35,541
but it can't fall below some crucial 
level and I do think that we're in some 

811
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:39,771
danger of allowing it to fall below some
crucial level because our society seems 

812
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:44,061
to be at war in some ways against the 
idea of the individual and individual 

813
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:48,240
character per se.
And I think that's absolutely.

814
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:54,900
I think that's absolutely catastrophic 
and that's part of the reason that I'm 

815
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:54,960
doing these biblical lectures,
you know,

816
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,990
because I think that I've known for a 
long time that the moral presuppositions

817
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:04,500
of a culture are instantiated in its 
stories.

818
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,440
They're not instantiated and it's 
explicit philosophy.

819
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:11,100
There might be a layer of explicit 
philosophy and of course there is in the

820
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:16,101
west and a layer of explicit law,
but underneath that there are stories 

821
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:18,570
and there isn't anything under the 
stories except maybe behavior,

822
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,130
you know,
and that's so implicit.

823
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:23,760
It doesn't even actually count.
It's not a cognitive operation.

824
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:29,210
And so this is the story.
These are the stories that are 

825
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,590
underneath our culture and so there 
better be something to them.

826
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,590
That's what we hope.
And but more importantly,

827
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:39,950
maybe we shouldn't toss them away 
without knowing what they mean because 

828
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:44,030
if we toss them away,
then we are throwing everything that we 

829
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,050
depend on a way as far as I can tell and
we'll we will pay for it.

830
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,360
We'll pay for it individually because 
we'll be weak,

831
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,740
you know,
because if you're not firm in your 

832
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,000
convictions than someone else who's from
in their convictions,

833
00:46:54,001 --> 00:46:56,160
can your,
their puppet like instantly.

834
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,260
And then you're also the puppet of your 
own doubts,

835
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:00,780
right?
Because unless you have convictions,

836
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,020
you're going to generate doubts like mad
because everyone does.

837
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,680
And then the doubts when,
and you'll be paralyzed because there'll

838
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:08,100
be,
you know,

839
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,400
50 percent of you moving forward in 50 
percent of you frozen,

840
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:15,120
stiff and that'll be enough just to 
lodge you in place.

841
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,980
And so,
okay,

842
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:22,440
so there's a psychologist,
creation of the idea of leadership,

843
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:27,441
which is very important.
And then it's associated with the idea 

844
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:29,901
of character or logical development and 
it's associated with the idea of 

845
00:47:29,901 --> 00:47:29,901
struggle,
not happiness.

846
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,650
And it's also associated with this 
abrahamic idea,

847
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:37,651
which I really liked,
which was something that's been very 

848
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:39,640
useful to me as a consequence of doing 
these lectures because remember,

849
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:41,380
at the beginning of the abrahamic 
stories,

850
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,360
Abraham's like a stay at home guy,
right?

851
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,550
He's like the guy who's 40 years old 
living in his,

852
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,080
in his,
in his mother's basement,

853
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,470
and God says like,
get,

854
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,620
get the hell out of there,
you know,

855
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,430
get out in the world where you belong.

856
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:56,350
Go do something difficult because what 
you're doing isn't acceptable.

857
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,060
And you know,
the first thing he does is go somewhere,

858
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:00,010
there's a terrible famine and then he 
goes somewhere.

859
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,180
There's a tyranny.
So,

860
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,130
you know,
it's,

861
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,320
it's pretty funny.
He follows God's call and it's not like 

862
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,380
sweetness and light and paradise 
immediately.

863
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:09,500
It's nothing like that.
It's,

864
00:48:09,501 --> 00:48:12,280
it's instantaneous combat,
you know,

865
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,070
of the most difficult kind.
So,

866
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:20,071
but,
but Abraham does in fact follow that 

867
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:20,650
impulse.
You know?

868
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,720
It's interesting too.
I mean,

869
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,750
I don't know.
Here's another thing that made me a 

870
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,720
really an advocate of psychoanalytic 
thinking it.

871
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:33,721
It was the sort of thing that started to
terrify me about what the human psyche 

872
00:48:33,721 --> 00:48:37,561
was actually like.
I started to understand that not only 

873
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:39,991
were we like an amalgam of,
of relatively autonomous 

874
00:48:39,991 --> 00:48:44,221
subpersonalities,
each of which had the possibility of 

875
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,431
gaining control,
but that we're also victim,

876
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:52,890
you might say,
or beneficiary of impulses that were 

877
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:55,510
beyond our conscious formulation or,
or,

878
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:58,090
or understanding or capacity to resist.

879
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,520
So here's this,
here's a funny story.

880
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:05,521
So I was talking to one of my patron 
people online this week and he said he's

881
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:11,161
a,
he was a committed atheist and that's 

882
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:11,161
fine,
you know,

883
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:13,860
lots of atheists are very honest people 
and they're atheist because they don't 

884
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,071
know how to reconcile what they know 
with traditional claims,

885
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:22,471
let's say.
And they're not willing to just mangled 

886
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:22,471
them together,
you know,

887
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:23,800
and there might be cynicism,
all data associated with it as well.

888
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:28,801
But he said he was,
he said he was entranced by these 

889
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:28,801
biblical lectures,
you know,

890
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:30,190
which is pretty weird.
And he said,

891
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:35,191
if someone would have told him a year 
ago that he was going to like be 

892
00:49:35,191 --> 00:49:35,350
obsessed with a sequence of biblical 
lectures,

893
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:37,120
he would have told them that they were 
mad.

894
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,660
And so we had a bit of a discussion 
about that because this is an 

895
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:42,660
interesting thing,
you know,

896
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,720
and he,
he mentioned this,

897
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:47,170
he said it was something like,
you don't choose your interests.

898
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:52,170
They choose you.
And that's really worth thinking about 

899
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:52,170
too,
man,

900
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,861
because you know it's really hard to get
interested in something you're not 

901
00:49:55,861 --> 00:49:59,191
interested in.
Even if you know there's a good reason 

902
00:49:59,191 --> 00:49:59,191
for it,
you know you're studying for an exam,

903
00:49:59,191 --> 00:50:03,210
you find the material boring.
You know anything will be more 

904
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:03,970
interesting than,
than this studying.

905
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:06,100
Even though you know that that's what 
you need to do.

906
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,850
You can't voluntarily grab yourself by 
the scruff of the neck,

907
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:11,650
let's say,
and shake yourself and say,

908
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:14,740
sit down and concentrate.
Your mind will just go everywhere.

909
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,630
But then if you're interested in 
something,

910
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,330
and even if it's something you shouldn't
be interested in,

911
00:50:19,331 --> 00:50:24,331
because that happens all the time,
then it's like you're a laser focused 

912
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:24,430
man.
You can pay attention forever,

913
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:26,860
you can work until you're exhausted,
you won't even notice it.

914
00:50:26,861 --> 00:50:28,670
Then you remember everything.
It's like,

915
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:31,880
okay,
if you can't control your interest,

916
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,560
what does?

917
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,220
And now I tell you,
you can think about that for a very long

918
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:42,221
time.
So you talked about the spirit 

919
00:50:42,221 --> 00:50:42,221
Mercurius,
you know,

920
00:50:42,221 --> 00:50:43,220
Mercury's the wing messenger of the gods
and,

921
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,920
and here's how he conceptualized it.
Psychologically,

922
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:50,921
he thought this is what the ancient 
people who thought about mercury as the 

923
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:53,390
winged messenger of the gods were trying
to state psychologically,

924
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:53,810
you know,
your,

925
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:59,050
your interest flits around.
It's like there's something that 

926
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,170
captures it and that moves your interest
from place to place.

927
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,640
You know,
like if you walk into a bookstore,

928
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,350
you'll get interested in a particular 
book.

929
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,320
It's as if the book grips you because 
you don't know why you're interested in.

930
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,400
You might,
but often you don't know why you're 

931
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:12,400
interested in that book and you know 
your interest is flitting around.

932
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,230
And so that's mercury.
The thing that makes your interest flick

933
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:20,260
flick around his mercury,
the winged messenger of the gods and 

934
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,160
mercury is the messenger of the gods 
because it's the things behind the 

935
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,671
scenes psychologically that are 
manipulating your attention and for 

936
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,150
young those were equivalent in some 
sense to the last gods.

937
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:34,510
And so for young your,
your interest was being manipulated 

938
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:39,250
behind the scenes by unseen forces that 
were associated with your character or 

939
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,210
logical development across time.
That was the manifestation of the self.

940
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,890
So the self is this the,
the potential you let's say,

941
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,280
and the way it operates in the present 
is by gripping your interest in 

942
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,431
directing it somewhere.
And that's part of the instinct of self 

943
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:55,430
realization.
It's a mind boggling idea,

944
00:51:55,431 --> 00:51:56,000
man.
Really,

945
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:57,920
it's,
I think it's correct.

946
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:02,921
I can't see how it can't be correct.
It doesn't mean I understand it 

947
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:05,801
completely,
but it certainly seems 

948
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:07,751
phenomenologically correct and I mean 
the potential that you are has to 

949
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:11,360
manifest itself somehow in the here and 
now it has to.

950
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,390
And what better way than by directing 
your attention,

951
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,420
you know,
it's like it seems like this might be 

952
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,101
useful for you,
or maybe you get attracted to this 

953
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:21,101
person.

954
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:21,560
Maybe you admire this person.
That happens with kids a lot.

955
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:26,561
They'll admire someone and then copy 
them and you can see that that's 

956
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:27,200
obviously part of their developmental 
progression,

957
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,060
right?
It's a form of hero worship,

958
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:34,061
but kids are very imitative and they 
hear a worship at the drop of a hat and 

959
00:52:34,061 --> 00:52:37,961
so they're.
They're entranced by the next stage of 

960
00:52:37,961 --> 00:52:42,731
development.
And if they see someone who embodies 

961
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:44,861
that,
especially if it's in the zone of 

962
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:46,691
proximal development,
it's some something they could achieve 

963
00:52:46,691 --> 00:52:48,440
stretching a bit.
They find someone who embodies that next

964
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:53,441
stage of development and then they start
to imitate them and act like them while 

965
00:52:53,441 --> 00:52:55,010
we're adults are no different.
We're no different.

966
00:52:55,011 --> 00:53:00,011
We're just.
We do it at a perhaps more abstract and 

967
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:00,620
sophisticated level.
So okay,

968
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,680
so Jacob and Esau are are hostile 
brothers.

969
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:10,900
They're like Cain and Abel except the 
mixture of Cain and Abel and they're 

970
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:10,900
very different.

971
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,910
Esau was red and covered with hair.
He was a hunter and a man of the field.

972
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:15,770
So he's like your basic jock,
right?

973
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:17,210
He's extroverted,
he's outgoing,

974
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:20,570
he's really tough.
He's like extraordinarily masculine.

975
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,510
He haunts and he's a real favorite of 
his father.

976
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:24,760
And so,
and,

977
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:29,260
and Jacob isn't,
he's a dweller intense and um,

978
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,120
yeah,
right.

979
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:31,800
Exactly,
exactly.

980
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:35,070
Exactly right.
And it says Isaac loved Esau,

981
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:37,740
but Rebecca loved Jacob.
Now that's a problem,

982
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:39,150
right?
That's a big problem.

983
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:40,860
And that there's a freudian element to 
this.

984
00:53:40,861 --> 00:53:44,970
It's like this family is now divided 
because one child is the favorite of the

985
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:48,810
mother and that's Jacob and one child is
the favorite of the father.

986
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:53,811
And so Jacob is kind of a mother's boy,
I guess to use an arc rather archaic 

987
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:58,821
phrase and certainly not as admirable 
from his father's perspective as Esau 

988
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:02,210
who was a tough guy who goes out with a 
bow and Arrow and like,

989
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,610
you know,
wanders around in the plains and brings 

990
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:07,610
animals home.

991
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:07,980
And he's tough.
He's a tough guy.

992
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,110
So,
and,

993
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:15,170
but,
but there's this discord in the family 

994
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,560
because one parent prefers one child and
the other parent prefers the other.

995
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:21,740
And it's obvious from the story that the
parents do not communicate about this 

996
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,750
because they really take sides.
And so there's a split in the family and

997
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:29,780
that's,
I think very realistic because one of 

998
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:29,780
the things that you do learn if you have
a family,

999
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,340
and of course most of you do,
but if you also think about families,

1000
00:54:32,341 --> 00:54:37,341
is that there's,
there's deep divisions within families 

1001
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:41,121
very,
very frequently that no one will ever 

1002
00:54:41,121 --> 00:54:43,251
talk about and,
or even think about often because it's 

1003
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:43,790
too painful to think about,
you know,

1004
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:49,010
Freud himself said Freud was clearly his
mother's favorite and the family 

1005
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:53,181
sacrificed a lot,
including some of the potential 

1006
00:54:53,181 --> 00:54:56,241
ambitions of the other children in order
to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a 

1007
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:56,241
pedestal.

1008
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:57,210
And,
and advanced is education.

1009
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,230
And it worked.
I mean,

1010
00:54:58,231 --> 00:54:58,650
you know,
he,

1011
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,270
he,
he turned into a great man,

1012
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:05,271
but there was a cost to his siblings and
Freud himself said that there was 

1013
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:08,901
something about being the favorite of 
the mother that gave a person additional

1014
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,690
confidence throughout their life.
And you know,

1015
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:14,850
there's,
there's something to be said about that.

1016
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:16,660
Even someone like Eric Erickson,
you know,

1017
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,330
he noted that he was very interested in 
child development,

1018
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:22,080
that that first bonding with the mother 
was the,

1019
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,510
was the place where trust was 
established,

1020
00:55:24,511 --> 00:55:29,511
maybe trust,
even in the goodness of existence was 

1021
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:29,511
established.
And so anyways,

1022
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:33,711
Jacob is Rachel's favorite and a Isa was
Isaac's favorite.

1023
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,290
Now Esau being extroverted,
let's say,

1024
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:45,990
is also a bit impulsive and maybe he's 
not.

1025
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,780
He's a man of action.
He's not a forward thinker,

1026
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,450
but he's also doing hard work.
And so,

1027
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,480
you know,
he goes out and he's hunting and he's 

1028
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,311
worn out and he comes home and he's 
faint with hunger and Jacob is at home.

1029
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:03,370
Cooking is boiling up lentils,
red lentils and um,

1030
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,940
you know,
Esau comes in from the Honda at east,

1031
00:56:05,941 --> 00:56:10,470
like half starved to death and he's 
sitting there and the aroma of these red

1032
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:14,250
lentils reaches them and he's exhausted 
and,

1033
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:19,170
and,
and he tells Jacob that he wants some of

1034
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:24,171
this stew and Jacob who's being a pain 
in the neck,

1035
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:27,640
fundamentally have basically says no,
there's a,

1036
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,600
there's a teasing thing going on here 
and won't give them any.

1037
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:32,100
And,
and,

1038
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:37,310
and there's,
you have to imagine this because it's 

1039
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,051
not laid out explicitly in the story,
but there's some dispute about whether 

1040
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,510
Esau gets to have lunch and Jacob 
finally says,

1041
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:44,230
well,
I'll give you some,

1042
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:49,231
but you have to,
you have to give me your birthright and 

1043
00:56:49,231 --> 00:56:50,920
Esau,
you think he must say something like,

1044
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,280
well,
to hell with it,

1045
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,460
take it,
you know,

1046
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,440
you son of a bitch,
take it.

1047
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,470
Just give me some damn stew at something
like that.

1048
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,450
So that's what happens.
But you know,

1049
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:04,180
with these archaic people,
once he made a statement like that,

1050
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:05,050
that was,
you were done.

1051
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:07,950
That was it.
And so I'm.

1052
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:13,390
Esau sells his birthright and this turns
out to be incredibly significant.

1053
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,530
Benson who wrote Biblical commentary 
said,

1054
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,930
Oh,
there's a bit of a twist to it.

1055
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:23,650
So Esau eats the red lentils and then 
from then on,

1056
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:27,640
his name is red and you've got to use 
your imagination a bit.

1057
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:29,920
I mean,
people are making fun of him,

1058
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:31,480
right?
That's why they're calling them red.

1059
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,090
I mean he's already read because we 
established that,

1060
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:35,920
but no one was calling them read before 
this.

1061
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:38,700
And so for the rest of his life,
you know,

1062
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:41,230
every time he goes out amongst his 
friends and family,

1063
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:43,720
they call them red and sort of snicker 
because he's the,

1064
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:48,721
you know,
half famished idiot who sold his 

1065
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:48,721
birthright for a bowl of lentils.

1066
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:49,150
And so it's,
it's not,

1067
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:54,360
it's not that funny actually.
And so Esau is not happy about this and 

1068
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,770
it actually turns out that this.
So what does it mean?

1069
00:57:56,771 --> 00:58:01,771
It means don't sell the future for the 
desires of the present and don't be 

1070
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:05,551
casual about what you have.
And then there's an archetype will 

1071
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:05,551
element to this too.
And Benson says,

1072
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:08,170
various have been the opinions what this
birthright was,

1073
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:13,171
which Esau sold,
but the most probable is that together 

1074
00:58:13,171 --> 00:58:15,730
with the right of sacrificing.
So determining what should be sacrificed

1075
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:18,280
and when and being the priest of the 
family,

1076
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,420
it included the peculiar blessing 
promised to the seed of Abraham,

1077
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:27,660
that of being the progenitor of the 
Messiah and the error of the special 

1078
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,410
promises of God,
respecting Christ's kingdom.

1079
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,530
It was at least typical of spiritual 
privileges.

1080
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,410
Those of the firstborn that are written 
in heaven.

1081
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:42,090
Well,
that's a lot harsher than meets the eye 

1082
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:47,461
to begin with,
and so there's a very interesting deep 

1083
00:58:47,461 --> 00:58:49,390
moral story there,
which is,

1084
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,160
it's sort of Esau does the opposite of a
sacrifice.

1085
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:55,330
It's the reverse,
right?

1086
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,520
He sacrifices the future for the 
present.

1087
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:03,360
And so the story basically says,
the way it's laid out across stories is 

1088
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,831
that if you're the sort of person that 
sacrifices the future to the present,

1089
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:13,230
then that eradicates the possibility 
that you will bring the most noble being

1090
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,780
into existence.
That's what it means.

1091
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:18,160
And you can,
again,

1092
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,610
this is the psychological significance 
of the biblical stories.

1093
00:59:21,611 --> 00:59:21,770
So

1094
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,270
that's a bad thing to do if you want to 
realize your potential.

1095
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,060
Let's say you don't do reverse 
sacrifices,

1096
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:34,061
that's a very bad idea.
And so esl really did himself in by 

1097
00:59:34,061 --> 00:59:38,510
being too attached to the present 
without a vision of the future.

1098
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,190
So he's too in the moment,
you know,

1099
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,280
and,
and he pays a heavy price for it.

1100
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:44,120
I mean,
he's the,

1101
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:49,630
first of all,
he loses his birthright and his double 

1102
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:52,391
inheritance.
So there's a practical consequence and 

1103
00:59:52,391 --> 00:59:52,391
then there's a spiritual consequence.
And then he's,

1104
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,860
while he's been made a fool of by his 
brother,

1105
00:59:54,861 --> 00:59:59,660
Jacob means supplanter by the way,
that's what the name means.

1106
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:02,490
And Jacob is always trying to usurp esl 
as,

1107
01:00:02,491 --> 01:00:07,491
as we see.
And so Jacob gets one over on them and 

1108
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:07,491
you know,
that's not,

1109
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:09,710
doesn't make an older brother happy when
a younger brother gets something over on

1110
01:00:09,711 --> 01:00:10,460
them,
that's for sure.

1111
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,180
And then he loses the opportunity to be 
the progenitor of the Messiah,

1112
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:19,181
which is like,
he probably didn't realize that 

1113
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:19,181
precisely,
but it seems to be,

1114
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:19,181
you know,
it's kind of rough.

1115
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:19,460
That.
So.

1116
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,610
And then there's,
there's a statement in Matthew Sixteen,

1117
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:29,420
26 for what is a man profited if he 
shall gain the whole world and loses his

1118
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:32,810
own soul or what shall a man give in 
exchange for a soul?

1119
01:00:32,811 --> 01:00:34,790
It's an echo of the same idea.
You know,

1120
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:35,480
when you think,
well,

1121
01:00:35,481 --> 01:00:39,320
what is this idea of soul mean?
And it's not intellect.

1122
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,430
And it said something like,
it's something like consciousness allied

1123
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,840
with character.
I think.

1124
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:50,080
And I think the reason that it's valued 
so much is that because he got to ask 

1125
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:50,080
yourself,
well,

1126
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,110
what do you really have when it comes 
down to it?

1127
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:52,580
So life is suffering,
let's say,

1128
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:56,360
and you know you can,
you can pile up worldly goods,

1129
01:00:56,361 --> 01:01:01,361
and the God in the Old Testament doesn't
seem to have anything against that 

1130
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:01,361
radiate,
right?

1131
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:03,920
The people who he favors seem to prosper
quite nicely in the world,

1132
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:09,190
but they also have to make a choice 
between whether they're going to 

1133
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:12,641
fundamentally sustain their character or
whether they're going to prosper in the 

1134
01:01:12,641 --> 01:01:16,481
world when push comes to shove and the 
idea of constantly is that really what 

1135
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:20,471
you have in the world that allows you 
the best possible defense against the 

1136
01:01:21,231 --> 01:01:23,750
suffering that's intrinsic to being as 
your character.

1137
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,180
That's what you have,
period.

1138
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,480
And I don't think there is anything 
that's more psychologically true than 

1139
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:31,480
that,
you know,

1140
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,060
because everything else.
Well,

1141
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:34,780
first of all,
your relationships with others depending

1142
01:01:34,781 --> 01:01:39,781
on your character.
And certainly this is part of the story 

1143
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:39,781
of Noah's Ark,
you know,

1144
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:43,601
because his generations were perfect.
So we had a very tight familial 

1145
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,010
arrangement.
Everyone trusted each other.

1146
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,650
That's a big deal.
If you hit a rocky patch in your life,

1147
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:53,651
right,
and it's character that it's character 

1148
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:54,470
that determines that you know,
if you're generous and honest and all of

1149
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:56,570
those things and people know they can 
rely on you,

1150
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:59,540
assuming they're not resentful,
that's a whole different story.

1151
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:01,700
Then they're going to come to your aid 
when,

1152
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,760
when it's necessary,
they're going to pull it together with 

1153
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,101
you and you know when people are really 
after you for one reason or another and 

1154
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:13,181
they're accusing you of all sorts of 
things and you're guilty because you 

1155
01:02:13,181 --> 01:02:14,080
have a past.
It's laden with character,

1156
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:19,100
logical errors.
Then it's very easy for people to take 

1157
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,360
you down because they'll poke,
they hit a place where you're guilty and

1158
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:26,361
then you're done because you'll do 
yourself in with your own judgment and 

1159
01:02:26,361 --> 01:02:28,780
so well.
So He makes a very big mistake and

1160
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,920
there's a sacrificial idea here too,
which is,

1161
01:02:35,921 --> 01:02:37,780
you know now,
and then you're going to be faced with a

1162
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:41,290
situation where it's something you 
really want or your character.

1163
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:46,320
Maybe you'll have to lie about something
you know and you'll think are what 

1164
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,710
difference does it make you know a lie 
about it.

1165
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,470
Jacob does this,
but the problem,

1166
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,480
there's a bunch of problems with that.
One is that,

1167
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:57,990
well,
now you know that you're the sort of 

1168
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,311
person that will in fact deceive 
yourself about the nature of reality if 

1169
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:00,550
something shiny is dangled in front of 
you,

1170
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:05,850
and that's not good because it 
undermines your faith in yourself and 

1171
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:09,001
when you're really in trouble,
they call that the dark night of the 

1172
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:09,001
soul.
When you're really in trouble,

1173
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:13,920
that's what you've got.
You've got whether or not you can trust 

1174
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,030
yourself and that's it.
You know when things are really harsh,

1175
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,850
and so if you've betrayed yourself in 
that manner,

1176
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:22,390
then you weaken yourself under the worst
possible circumstances.

1177
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:24,760
And that's just,
that's really not a good thing.

1178
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:29,290
So this is very practical advice.
Um,

1179
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:33,430
it's not casual moralizing.
There's very little casual moralizing in

1180
01:03:33,431 --> 01:03:33,970
these stores.

1181
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
In the next part of the story,
there's some parallels with Abraham and 

1182
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,860
that's built into the narrative,
I think because Isaac is Abraham's 

1183
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:48,811
descendant.
And so we have to keep the narrative 

1184
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:52,740
echoing forward,
otherwise it loses its continuity and 

1185
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:57,910
there was a famine in the land that 
Isaacson and God tells him to stay the 

1186
01:03:58,121 --> 01:04:01,720
course anyways,
repeating the promise he gave Abraham,

1187
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:06,760
although Isaac goes to check also 
telling the king and people that Rebecca

1188
01:04:06,761 --> 01:04:11,761
was his sister,
which is exactly what Abraham did when 

1189
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:11,830
he went to Egypt.
And so there's another echo there of the

1190
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:13,480
same,
the same.

1191
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,980
It's as if the story is being told for a
second time essentially.

1192
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,930
And that's supposed to remind you of 
the,

1193
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:23,050
of the previous story,
but they're careless.

1194
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:27,310
The king sees that Rebecca and Isaac are
intimate together.

1195
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:32,311
And um,
luckily he doesn't have them put to 

1196
01:04:32,311 --> 01:04:32,311
death.

1197
01:04:32,311 --> 01:04:33,850
He just tells everybody in the kingdom 
that there to be left the hell alone.

1198
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:39,180
And then Isaac prospers in Atlanta,
just like Abraham did in Egypt until the

1199
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:43,270
Philistines ask him to leave.
He's just getting too rich and powerful.

1200
01:04:43,271 --> 01:04:45,010
Things are going too well for him.
So he's asked,

1201
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,130
he's asked to leave.
Now,

1202
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,530
in the meantime,
Esau gets married,

1203
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:55,560
and this is a funny little story.
He says he marries two women who give 

1204
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:59,260
grief to Isaac and Rebecca,
so whoever he saw Mary's,

1205
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:02,140
they're not popular with his,
with their in laws,

1206
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:07,170
not in the least.
That actually becomes relevant a little 

1207
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:07,450
later because they drive rebecca quite 
mad.

1208
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:10,240
So I get a kick out of that because 
that's very common,

1209
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:15,241
you know,
it's not easy to integrate new people 

1210
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:16,870
into your family and,
and hope that that will go smoothly.

1211
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,610
It's one of the real catastrophes

1212
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,270
in life,
right?

1213
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:24,271
You have a kid,
maybe you get along with them and maybe 

1214
01:05:24,271 --> 01:05:24,760
you don't,
but let's assume you do,

1215
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:29,761
but then they marry someone that you 
just don't like and or maybe you think 

1216
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:30,370
is wrong for them.
I mean,

1217
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:35,371
that's really rough.
That's what are you going to do about 

1218
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:35,371
that?
You know,

1219
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:36,850
because you're basically screwed both 
ways.

1220
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:41,851
If you have the person you love around,
then you have to put up with this 

1221
01:05:41,851 --> 01:05:41,920
horrendous creature that they allied 
themselves with.

1222
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:44,530
And if you,
if you get rid of them completely,

1223
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:46,660
well then you know you don't have your 
child anymore.

1224
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:49,000
So it's very,
very difficult position.

1225
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:51,820
And so that's another example of the 
realism,

1226
01:05:51,821 --> 01:05:52,870
I think,
of the stories.

1227
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,190
Now,
Isaac,

1228
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:58,720
who's hypothetically on his deathbed 
asks Esau to hunt for Venison because he

1229
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:03,721
likes fitness and he's happy that his 
son is a hunter and Rebecca overhears 

1230
01:06:03,721 --> 01:06:05,530
this,
so she conspires with Jacob,

1231
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:07,510
um,
to,

1232
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:13,380
to slaughter to small goats and make his
father some stew because he wants to 

1233
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,060
make them stew out of venison.

1234
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,100
But Rebecca,
who's being,

1235
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:21,970
I would say,
let's say slightly deceitful or horribly

1236
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:26,050
lying that would be more accurate,
she conspires with Jacob.

1237
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:29,920
So Jacob kills two little goats kids and
boils up a stew.

1238
01:06:29,921 --> 01:06:31,390
And then he puts on some,
uh,

1239
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:37,300
uh,
goatskins because Esau was a hairy 

1240
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:37,300
character.
And,

1241
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,500
and Rebecca Dresses Isaac in east 
clothing because Isaac can't see very 

1242
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:46,441
well at this point.
And so then Jacob goes into his father 

1243
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:48,790
with the stew and he's trying to 
disguise his voice,

1244
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:53,791
but it doesn't work very well.
And so Isaac asks him to come close and 

1245
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,200
Jacob puts out his arm with the goat 
skin on it.

1246
01:06:56,201 --> 01:06:58,180
And,
and Isaac smells them too.

1247
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:00,990
And he smells like Esl.
And um,

1248
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,220
which maybe wasn't the best thing,
but,

1249
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:05,290
um,
and feels like,

1250
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:05,580
um,
and,

1251
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,820
and so,
uh,

1252
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,100
because Isaac thinks he's on his 
deathbed,

1253
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,470
he decides to deliver a blessing to 
hypothetically to east south.

1254
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,770
And so,
but it's Jacob.

1255
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,920
And so that's a big deal too because the
blessing is actually,

1256
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,140
as I said before with these ancient 
people,

1257
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:25,870
it appeared as though once you said 
something,

1258
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,880
you didn't get to take it back.
You couldn't say,

1259
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:31,690
well look,
you've deceived me so it doesn't count.

1260
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:37,290
It was like they weren't maybe as,
as well.

1261
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:40,990
Week might be one way of thinking about 
it,

1262
01:07:40,991 --> 01:07:43,720
but another way is they weren't quite as
attentive to context,

1263
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:46,000
you know,
because if I make you a deal and then it

1264
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:51,001
turns out that you've betrayed me,
I may feel that the deal is no longer 

1265
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:52,900
valid because the assumption was you 
were being honest to begin with.

1266
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:56,710
And that violates the whole spirit.
But that isn't how these people thought.

1267
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:58,750
They said once he promised man,
you promised.

1268
01:07:58,751 --> 01:08:02,950
And that was that.
So Isaac Blesses Jacob.

1269
01:08:02,951 --> 01:08:07,951
He says that God gives you the dew of 
heaven and the fatness of the earth and 

1270
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:12,181
plenty of corn and wine.
Let people serve you and nations bow 

1271
01:08:12,181 --> 01:08:12,610
down to you.
Be Lord over thy brethren,

1272
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:16,010
that's going to be rough on Esl.
Let thy mother's sons bow down

1273
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:21,010
to the cursive,
be everyone that curses and blessings 

1274
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:21,010
be.
He blesses it,

1275
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:24,110
and so there's a credit remarkable 
painting of that.

1276
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:29,710
So there's Rebecca.
She's looking pretty old and Isaac's 

1277
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:33,761
Look Pretty Blind and Jacob's taking 
directions from his mother and we might 

1278
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:36,800
say he's perhaps a little old to be 
taking moral lessons from his mother,

1279
01:08:36,801 --> 01:08:41,801
especially given how she's acting.
And so it's a pretty ugly scene 

1280
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:45,221
altogether,
especially that we also know that Jacob 

1281
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:48,850
already tricked Esau out of his 
birthright and so now he's taken the 

1282
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:52,860
birthright and he's taken the blessing.
And so as I said that Jacob,

1283
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:59,501
he turns out to be the father of Israel.
It's like he's a reprehensible 

1284
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:03,311
character.
These are major league betrayals that 

1285
01:09:03,311 --> 01:09:03,350
he's engaging and it's not trivial.
He really,

1286
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:07,040
really pulls the rug out from under his 
brother and you know,

1287
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:07,670
you could say,
well,

1288
01:09:07,671 --> 01:09:10,640
Esl is not as awake as he might be,
you know,

1289
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:15,320
he's kind of a wild man and fair enough,
but it's certainly seems to me that the,

1290
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,310
the predominant moral error falls on 
Jacob's shoulders.

1291
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,740
It's very treacherous behavior,
what he's doing.

1292
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:27,940
So then Esau shows up and he's got a 
nice stag for his dad and it's like 

1293
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:33,520
little late for that and he states that 
his brother was rightly named Jacob,

1294
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:37,670
which means supplanter because he's been
deceived twice and Isaac says,

1295
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,690
Isaac answered.
He's asking a yes.

1296
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:44,810
I was asking fundamentally if there's 
anything at all left over for him,

1297
01:09:44,811 --> 01:09:49,811
and Isaac can't give them the same 
blessing because that's already been 

1298
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:50,300
given.
So he has to think of something else.

1299
01:09:50,301 --> 01:09:53,180
And I'm Isaac says,
hold.

1300
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:57,440
I've made him my lord and all his 
brothers I've given to him for servants,

1301
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,930
which includes you and with corn and 
wine.

1302
01:09:59,931 --> 01:10:02,570
Have I sustained him?
What shall I now do on tv?

1303
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:06,890
My son and Esau said unto his father,
how have you even one blessing for me?

1304
01:10:06,891 --> 01:10:11,891
My father and bless me also,
and an esl lifted up his voice and wept 

1305
01:10:11,891 --> 01:10:16,541
and you know,
we already know that Esau is a pretty 

1306
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:16,541
tough guy by all appearances and you 
know,

1307
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:19,700
he's out there hunting on his own and 
camping and it's like he's no pushover,

1308
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:24,701
and the fact that this reduces him to 
tears is an indication of the magnitude 

1309
01:10:24,701 --> 01:10:24,770
of the betrayal.

1310
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:28,370
And Isaac says,
behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness

1311
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:31,640
of the earth and of the dew of heaven,
from above and by Thy Sword,

1312
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:34,640
thou shall live,
and thou shalt serve your brother and it

1313
01:10:34,641 --> 01:10:38,090
she'll come to pass when you will have 
the dominion and you'll break the yolk.

1314
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:43,091
His yoke off from died neck.
And the Esol hated Jacob because of the 

1315
01:10:43,091 --> 01:10:43,670
blessing where with his father blessed 
him.

1316
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:49,210
And Esau said in his heart,
the days of mourning for my father are 

1317
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,270
at hand.
Then I will slay my brother Jacob.

1318
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,610
So fundamentally,
you know,

1319
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:56,570
if Isaac dies or when he dies,
then we'll mourn for him.

1320
01:10:56,571 --> 01:11:00,310
And then Jacob better look the hell out 
because it's like it's,

1321
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:04,720
it's serious death coming his way.
And you know,

1322
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,320
he's got a,
he's got a point,

1323
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:10,850
he's in Dante's inferno,
I think I mentioned this at one point.

1324
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:13,710
So Dante's inferno is a very interesting
story.

1325
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:18,710
It's a descent into hell and it's 
actually one of the places that we sort 

1326
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:22,420
of derive the popular conception of hell
was partly based on Dante's,

1327
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:27,740
on dmts imagination on his work.
And what Dante was trying to do was to 

1328
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,460
discover the hierarchical structure of 
evil.

1329
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:34,790
And you know,
you might think there's a hierarchical 

1330
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,531
structure of good,
some things are better than other 

1331
01:11:36,531 --> 01:11:38,631
things,
but there's also a hierarchical 

1332
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:38,631
structure of evil.
Some evils are greater than other evils.

1333
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:40,440
And he put the trail in the,
in the,

1334
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,780
in the lowest part of health,
right?

1335
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:46,080
So if you were betraying people,
you were right beside Satan himself.

1336
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,360
And so,
and I think that's good,

1337
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:51,210
that's very smart.
While Dante was a genius after all,

1338
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:56,450
um,
and I think the reason for that is that 

1339
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:56,760
you see,
if someone trusts you,

1340
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,580
they're laying their vulnerability open 
to you.

1341
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,470
Now they might just be naive,
let's say.

1342
01:12:01,471 --> 01:12:04,520
And that's,
we won't think about that because you're

1343
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,880
just a child.
If you're naive,

1344
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:09,090
you can still be betrayed.
But if you're an adult and you trust,

1345
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:11,640
it's often because you,
if you're an actual adult,

1346
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:15,810
is you willingly open yourself up 
knowing that you could be hurt,

1347
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:17,370
right?
Because you're not naive anymore.

1348
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:22,371
So you decided to trust and you see all 
open myself up and I know that I'm 

1349
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:27,050
leaving myself open to you.
If you choose to use that power and then

1350
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,230
that's a good thing to know.
You know,

1351
01:12:28,231 --> 01:12:31,260
if you've been hurt as a child hurt,
as a naive person,

1352
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:31,800
you might say,
well,

1353
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:34,560
why should I ever trust to get?
Which is a really good question.

1354
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,020
And the answer is the reason you trust,
again,

1355
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:39,180
once you're an adult is because you're 
courageous.

1356
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,100
You're courageous.

1357
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:46,100
It's an act of courage to trust.
And the reason it's useful is because if

1358
01:12:46,201 --> 01:12:51,201
you trust someone,
you opened the door to reciprocity and 

1359
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:54,530
negotiation and cooperation and you 
entice the best part of the person 

1360
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:57,000
forward.
And so it's A.

1361
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,300
It's a courageous act.
But then if you betray someone,

1362
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:03,510
then what you've done is you've taken 
the best part of them,

1363
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:07,470
which is the part that will courageously
trust it with open eyes.

1364
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:10,200
Right?
And you've stuck a dagger in that.

1365
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:13,680
And so you've purposefully damaged the 
best part of the.

1366
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:17,010
And so that's why it's such a egregious 
fault.

1367
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:20,610
And,
and it's often people don't recover from

1368
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:23,370
that sort of blanket you.
If you be betray someone badly enough,

1369
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:28,371
you can,
you can damage them like you can give 

1370
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:28,371
them posttraumatic stress disorder if 
you really,

1371
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:32,040
if you really put your mind to it and 
you know that's not just a psychological

1372
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:32,640
disorder.

1373
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,540
If you have posttraumatic stress 
disorder,

1374
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:39,180
it produces permanent neurological 
alterations that make you more neurotic,

1375
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,390
more sensitive to negative emotion 
really for the rest of your life.

1376
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,290
Like you can,
you can recover from it to some degree,

1377
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:50,370
but stress will tend to re instantiate 
that ptsd.

1378
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:55,790
So you,
you hurt someone and it's not merely 

1379
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:55,790
cycled.
Not,

1380
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:58,230
not that psychological is merely,
but it's not merely psychological,

1381
01:13:58,231 --> 01:13:58,620
right?
It's,

1382
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:03,810
it's fundamental physiological damage.
So anyways,

1383
01:14:03,811 --> 01:14:08,811
Jacobs smart enough to get out of there.
And which is also not really a testament

1384
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:11,100
to his integrity,
right?

1385
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:16,410
I mean,
he's done these terrible things at the 

1386
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,420
behest of his mother because he wants 
power and,

1387
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:19,960
and he wants to get it without deserving
it.

1388
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:24,640
And then he finally goes too far and he 
hightails it out of there to his,

1389
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,240
to another family member,
to his mother's brother.

1390
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,600
And so it's not exactly the world's most
heroic story,

1391
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,110
that's for sure.

1392
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:40,380
And so now there's an interlude here,
and this is a really interesting 

1393
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,530
interlude.
It's the story of Jacob's ladder.

1394
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:45,100
So he's off to visit la ban or lab and 
who's,

1395
01:14:45,101 --> 01:14:46,050
uh,
his,

1396
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:48,970
his mother's brother.
And on the way he,

1397
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:54,380
he,
he has a sleep and he lighted upon a 

1398
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:57,601
certain place and tarried there all 
night because the sun was set and he 

1399
01:14:57,601 --> 01:14:58,750
took of the stones of that place and put
them for his pillows,

1400
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:03,050
which seems to indicate very bad 
planning on his part and,

1401
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,730
and lay down in that place to sleep.
And he dreamed and behold,

1402
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:11,731
a ladder set up on the earth,
and the top of it reached to heaven and 

1403
01:15:11,731 --> 01:15:12,640
beheld the angels of God ascending and 
descending on it.

1404
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:14,860
And behold the lord stood above it and 
said,

1405
01:15:14,861 --> 01:15:18,400
I am the Lord God of Abraham,
thy father and the god of Isaac,

1406
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,570
the land we're on to the I will give it 
and to thy seed.

1407
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:28,950
And so this story of Jacob's ladder has 
really possessed the imagination of the 

1408
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:31,210
West.
And then there's a reason for that.

1409
01:15:31,211 --> 01:15:36,211
It's because it's an archetypal story 
because the idea of a ladder that 

1410
01:15:36,211 --> 01:15:37,630
reaches to heaven is one of the oldest 
ideas of mankind.

1411
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,930
So you'll find it widely distributed 
among the shamanic cultures,

1412
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:45,931
for example.
And it's a hallmark of psychedelic 

1413
01:15:45,931 --> 01:15:45,931
experience.
That's another way of thinking about it,

1414
01:15:45,931 --> 01:15:50,790
which is a very peculiar thing.
So there's one representation of the 

1415
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:54,310
ladder you see got up at the top there.
I'm peeking out from the clouds.

1416
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:55,680
Now,
you know,

1417
01:15:55,690 --> 01:16:00,670
that's sort of where we get the idea 
that God is in heaven and the heavens up

1418
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:02,170
in the sky.
And,

1419
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:05,880
and that's an easy story to make fun of 
because you know,

1420
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,800
we've gone up to the moon and there's no
god there and,

1421
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:09,730
and,
but,

1422
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:14,790
but this,
this is not a reasonable way of 

1423
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,510
conceptualizing what these experiences 
are about,

1424
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,980
these experiences,
what this is the opening up there that's

1425
01:16:20,981 --> 01:16:23,860
more like an opening into an alternate 
dimension.

1426
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,210
That's a better way of thinking about 
it.

1427
01:16:25,211 --> 01:16:28,120
It's beyond like from,
from the Judeo Christian perspective,

1428
01:16:28,121 --> 01:16:31,360
one of the things you have to understand
is that God is beyond space and time.

1429
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:36,570
He's not in the universe,
he's outside the universe in some 

1430
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:39,901
manner.
And so the idea that that you have an 

1431
01:16:39,901 --> 01:16:42,550
experience of God and it's up,
isn't the AAP is the best that the human

1432
01:16:42,551 --> 01:16:47,551
imagination can do with what's 
essentially a form of extra dimensional 

1433
01:16:47,551 --> 01:16:50,560
experience or that's the best way to 
conceptualize it.

1434
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:52,690
And these experiences aren't rare.
You know,

1435
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:53,830
they,
they make the,

1436
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:56,470
they make up the core of,
of the shamanic tradition.

1437
01:16:56,471 --> 01:16:59,770
And so there's an intrusion of the 
ancient shamanic tradition,

1438
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:04,240
which is tens of thousands of years old 
into the biblical stories at this point.

1439
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:09,420
Now why Jacob had a essentially shamonic
experience is very difficult to tell 

1440
01:17:09,981 --> 01:17:12,380
because we don't know what these old 
people we're up to.

1441
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:17,410
Right,
and we don't know how much of the 

1442
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:17,410
archaic,
traditioned,

1443
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:20,900
archaic religious tradition was still 
extent at that at that point in time,

1444
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:25,901
but we certainly do know that our 
ancient forebears were using psychedelic

1445
01:17:26,311 --> 01:17:28,880
substances constantly like am Anita 
Mascara,

1446
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:29,960
mushrooms,
for example,

1447
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:33,050
which were widely used in India before 
they became extinct.

1448
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:38,051
That's the theory anyways,
and that seemed to be the basis of the 

1449
01:17:38,051 --> 01:17:39,560
Chemical Soma,
which a much has been written about,

1450
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:45,100
and so we hear it over.
This is a dream or has the vision and 

1451
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:49,541
perhaps that's what it was,
but perhaps that wasn't what it was 

1452
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:52,211
either and perhaps it was an experience 
that was induced by by the same 

1453
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:59,710
processes that shamonic people have 
always induced these experiences and so 

1454
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:00,350
we're going to go through this a little 
bit.

1455
01:18:00,351 --> 01:18:02,300
So anyways,
there's A.

1456
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:04,820
There's a connection between heaven and 
earth that opens up.

1457
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:05,660
That's,
that's,

1458
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,270
that's the,
that's the vision,

1459
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,220
and there's messengers moving up and 
down.

1460
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:15,221
Now,
one way you can conceptualize that is 

1461
01:18:15,221 --> 01:18:15,221
psychologically,
as we already discussed,

1462
01:18:15,221 --> 01:18:19,421
that you know there,
there are forces within you that are 

1463
01:18:19,421 --> 01:18:23,591
active and alive and you can think of 
them in some sense as messengers of the 

1464
01:18:23,591 --> 01:18:28,211
higher self and so you could think about
this as an image of a psychological 

1465
01:18:28,211 --> 01:18:30,830
reality,
but and so we can stick with that,

1466
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,300
but,
but

1467
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:36,680
here's some of the representations that 
have been made.

1468
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:40,250
I really liked the one on the right.
That's William Blake.

1469
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:45,251
I liked the helix idea and I don't think
that that's a fluke.

1470
01:18:45,741 --> 01:18:48,650
There are helixes and double helix is in
all sorts of images,

1471
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:53,710
imagery,
very ancient and very modern that are 

1472
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:54,380
associated with both healing and with 
this kind of vision.

1473
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:58,100
So,
and you see the blake representation.

1474
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:03,430
God is associated with,
well really with the sun and with light 

1475
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:07,310
and you see that on the left as well,
that wherever God is is where light is.

1476
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:10,580
And so that's a very interesting idea as
far as I'm concerned as well.

1477
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:16,360
There's some other representations,
one by chagall.

1478
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:28,490
So now there's this idea that there's a,
there's the possibility of opening up a 

1479
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:31,140
line of communication between the human 
psyche and the transcendent divine,

1480
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:36,560
and there's a.
there's a great image of Christ as 

1481
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:36,560
Panto.
They're so creative.

1482
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,210
The world at just one of the first 
mosaics,

1483
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:41,270
if I remember correctly,
and I wish I knew,

1484
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,810
remember where it was,
but I don't,

1485
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:48,050
but it's a very interesting image.
I'm having a carving of it made at the 

1486
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:51,771
moment by a friend of mine.
But you see Christ face it portrayed in 

1487
01:19:53,311 --> 01:19:55,080
a medieval manner and he's holding a 
book.

1488
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:58,470
So it symbolizes the importance of the 
book.

1489
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:03,500
You know,
as a means of transmitting wisdom and 

1490
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,580
his face is very asymmetrical and the 
eyes are different.

1491
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:10,610
One side and the other and half of the 
face represents the human part and the 

1492
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:12,810
other side of the face represents the 
divine part.

1493
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:17,810
And you know,
I also think about that psychologically 

1494
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:20,961
because I do think that that's the right
way to conceptualize human beings is 

1495
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:25,110
that there's an aspect of us mortal,
human and limited.

1496
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:28,350
But there's an aspect of us that's 
transcendent and divine as well.

1497
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:33,500
And it's latent in some sense,
but there are times when it manifests 

1498
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,800
itself,
and this is not speculation,

1499
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:40,850
right?
This is like the oldest experience of 

1500
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:43,341
human beings now.
It's not necessarily an easy experience 

1501
01:20:43,341 --> 01:20:46,521
to have,
but it's reported everywhere and it can 

1502
01:20:46,521 --> 01:20:48,030
be reliably induced as we've discussed 
before by chemical means,

1503
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:50,430
which and I don't know what that means 
exactly.

1504
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:53,220
We've talked a little bit about 
psilocybin mushrooms for example,

1505
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:58,221
and you could say that the mystical 
experiences that have been invoked in 

1506
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:01,881
the newest experiments down at at Johns 
Hopkins are derangements or forms of 

1507
01:21:02,521 --> 01:21:07,521
psychosis because they have some 
similarity to psychosis psychotic 

1508
01:21:07,521 --> 01:21:08,010
experiences.

1509
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:12,960
Although psychotic people were given lsd
in the sixties and they always said that

1510
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:17,961
that was something different than what 
they were having and if you give 

1511
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:18,840
psychotic people I'm fed up means you 
can make them worse.

1512
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,700
So there biochemically separate and we 
know that.

1513
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:25,830
But also the thing that's so interesting
about the psilocybin experiences is that

1514
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:31,400
they reliably produce mystical 
experiences that the people rate as 

1515
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:31,950
among the most important experiences of 
their life.

1516
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:36,030
And among those who have the psychedelic
experience,

1517
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:41,720
positive things happen to them.
And so that kind of messes with the 

1518
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:41,720
whole psychosis theory,
right?

1519
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,910
Because what are you gonna do you're 
gonna claim that you give someone a pale

1520
01:21:44,911 --> 01:21:46,950
and they have a psychotic break and then
they're healthier.

1521
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,000
It's like,
no,

1522
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:52,020
that isn't how psychotic breaks work.
You're not healthier after having one.

1523
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:57,260
You're like,
you're a broken Haig and it's not easy 

1524
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:57,260
to put you back together.
So,

1525
01:21:57,710 --> 01:22:02,710
and we know that people all over the 
world have discovered every manner of 

1526
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:03,420
psychedelic substance that you could 
possibly,

1527
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:08,720
while you imagine there's lots of hungry
people wandering the earth for a long 

1528
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,570
time and they eat every damn thing they 
could get their hands on and now,

1529
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:12,990
and then something very peculiar 
happened as a consequence.

1530
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:14,130
So.

1531
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:19,520
So I'm going to tell you a little bit 
about the harmonic,

1532
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:25,310
a tradition,
because it's associated with Jacob's 

1533
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:25,310
ladder.
So,

1534
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:26,980
um,
according to Eliana Mircea Eliade,

1535
01:22:26,981 --> 01:22:30,490
who was a great historian of religion,
a compatriot of viewings and,

1536
01:22:30,491 --> 01:22:35,491
and,
and the influenced each other quite 

1537
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:37,521
substantially.
Eliana believe that shamanism that used 

1538
01:22:37,521 --> 01:22:39,270
psychedelics was a degeneration from the
original,

1539
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:44,570
more pure shamanism,
but I think later scholarship has 

1540
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:46,890
demonstrated that that's incorrect,
that that the romantic ritual per se,

1541
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:51,891
was a direct consequence of the use 
discovery of an and ritualistic use of 

1542
01:22:52,321 --> 01:22:54,180
psychedelic substances.
But anyways,

1543
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:59,540
Eliana identified three pathways to 
shamanism and the Sherman in it,

1544
01:23:00,221 --> 01:23:05,221
in a tribe was more educated than the 
typical person with a larger vocabulary 

1545
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:12,930
and was the repository of the oral 
tradition and so learned all the stories

1546
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:18,241
that had been passed down.
Word of mouth and people by the way are 

1547
01:23:18,241 --> 01:23:18,241
very,
very,

1548
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:23,450
very,
very accurately tell the same story 

1549
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:23,450
across generations.

1550
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:24,670
That's been quite well documented so 
and,

1551
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:29,671
and people who can't read really can 
remember because what else are they 

1552
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:33,691
going to do?
Their memories are far greater than 

1553
01:23:33,691 --> 01:23:36,780
modern peoples memories because we can 
forget everything because we can just 

1554
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:39,601
look it up.
But they remembered things because they 

1555
01:23:39,601 --> 01:23:42,631
had no choice.
My father knew someone who was 

1556
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:42,631
illiterate and and,
and,

1557
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:46,660
and couldn't use numbers either when,
when he grew up in Saskatchewan,

1558
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,970
you know,
60 years ago,

1559
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:51,550
and he was a,
he had a sheep,

1560
01:23:51,551 --> 01:23:54,130
if I remember correctly,
and although he couldn't count,

1561
01:23:54,131 --> 01:23:59,131
he knew if one of his sheep was missing 
because he knew all the sheep and so he 

1562
01:23:59,131 --> 01:24:00,820
could tell just by looking if one of the
sheep was missing,

1563
01:24:00,821 --> 01:24:05,821
but he couldn't count and so well.
So people who don't have our particular 

1564
01:24:05,821 --> 01:24:06,970
set of skills,
first of all,

1565
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:10,500
they're not stupid and second they have 
other skills that we don't understand to

1566
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:11,500
fill in the gaps.

1567
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,950
So Eliana identified spontaneous 
vocation.

1568
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,830
So you were just,
you had this spirit of a showman,

1569
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:22,831
let's say.
So you're probably extremely high in 

1570
01:24:22,831 --> 01:24:22,831
openness,
let's say from a modern perspective,

1571
01:24:22,831 --> 01:24:24,320
hereditary transmission.
So you know,

1572
01:24:24,321 --> 01:24:27,310
your father was a showman and your 
grandfather was a showman and so forth,

1573
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:32,311
and you got initiated into that process 
or a personal quest in Siberia.

1574
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:39,180
This is from Eliana in Siberia.
The youth who is called to be a showman 

1575
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,540
attracts attention by his strange 
behavior.

1576
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,490
For example,
he seeks solitude,

1577
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:47,491
becomes absent minded,
loves to roam in the woods or 

1578
01:24:47,491 --> 01:24:47,491
unfrequently places,
has visions,

1579
01:24:47,491 --> 01:24:48,010
and sings in his sleep.
You know,

1580
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:51,100
if you put someone in a in a place 
that's deprived,

1581
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,970
that's where you're deprived from a 
sensory perspective,

1582
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:57,820
it fit normal.
People will hallucinate quite quickly,

1583
01:24:58,270 --> 01:25:03,270
so it seems.
What happens is that if you dampen down 

1584
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:05,761
the sensory input,
then you start to become aware of the 

1585
01:25:05,761 --> 01:25:05,761
background processes of your mind.

1586
01:25:05,761 --> 01:25:07,780
It's something like that.
It's like the signal to noise ratio.

1587
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:12,760
I got to get this right.
As the noise decreases,

1588
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:16,690
some of the noise become signal,
the background noise become signal,

1589
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,960
and you start to become aware of your 
own internal psychological processes.

1590
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:23,320
It's something like that.
He has visions and sings in his sleep.

1591
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:28,620
In some instances,
this period of incubation is marked by 

1592
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:31,291
quite serious symptoms among the Yakut.
The young man sometimes has fits of 

1593
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:32,890
theory and easily loses consciousness,
hides in the forest,

1594
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:38,100
feeds on the bark of trees,
throws himself into water and fire and 

1595
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,260
cutting themselves with knives.

1596
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:45,510
We went to a potlatch in northern 
northern Vancouver Island about a year 

1597
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:50,161
ago and they had this one dance.
It was the Kwakwaka'wakw natives and 

1598
01:25:50,161 --> 01:25:52,810
they had this interesting dance that was
the dance of the wild man.

1599
01:25:52,811 --> 01:25:57,811
And so the person who invited us was the
wild man and he was dressed up in tree 

1600
01:25:58,121 --> 01:26:03,121
branches and so forth.
And so he was the person who'd been in 

1601
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:05,971
the Bush too long and he in as a 
cannibal and there there was genuine 

1602
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:09,650
cannibalistic rites among these people.
Not so long ago.

1603
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:14,700
He came in as a cannibal and everybody 
had to wear this like cedar head dress 

1604
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,921
because if you had a cedar headdress on 
then the Cannibal wouldn't take a bite 

1605
01:26:17,921 --> 01:26:21,521
out of you and they actually took this 
route as seriously so you should have 

1606
01:26:21,521 --> 01:26:23,510
your Cedar headdress on.
And so he's looking around the crowd and

1607
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,920
there's like 400 people in this place 
and he could really act two.

1608
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:31,920
And so he's doing this wild man dance.
And then all the women stood up and 

1609
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,430
started to kind of dancing place and 
saying.

1610
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:37,640
And they were taming him.
So that was really cool.

1611
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:40,940
It was really interesting to see that 
because those people are about,

1612
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:43,310
they've had an unbroken culture for 
about 13,000

1613
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:48,311
years.
Say That's how long they've been out on 

1614
01:26:48,311 --> 01:26:51,051
the island there.
And it was very interesting to see that 

1615
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:53,441
dramatization of the domestication of,
of man by women laid out in that dance 

1616
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:58,871
in that way.
But it was also interesting in 

1617
01:26:58,871 --> 01:27:00,080
relationship to the shamanic tradition 
because he came in as a wild man,

1618
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:05,081
right?
And he had to be re civilized in some 

1619
01:27:05,081 --> 01:27:06,500
sense and brought back down to earth.
So,

1620
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:12,300
but by whatever method he may have been 
designated as Sharman is recognized as 

1621
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:16,121
such,
only after having received two methods 

1622
01:27:16,121 --> 01:27:16,121
of instruction.

1623
01:27:16,121 --> 01:27:17,870
The first is ecstatic dreams,
trances visions.

1624
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:22,640
The other thing that this guy told me,
I have no reason to doubt him.

1625
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:26,330
He's also not illiterate person.
Um,

1626
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:31,660
and so has a great memory.
He does carving traditional carving and 

1627
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:35,531
he's very good at it.
He carved a 53 foot totem pole that's 

1628
01:27:35,531 --> 01:27:37,460
now in front of the Museum of art in,
in downtown Montreal.

1629
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,500
So if you ever go there,
you can go see it,

1630
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:41,960
I won't be there forever,
but it's there right now.

1631
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:47,860
And uh,
he was taught to carve by his 

1632
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:50,171
grandparents and he said that he dreamed
in what the Haida images look like.

1633
01:27:51,231 --> 01:27:53,470
So the Kwakwaka'wakw kind of like the 
high,

1634
01:27:53,471 --> 01:27:56,960
that same sort of imagery he told me 
that he dreamed in those images.

1635
01:27:57,350 --> 01:28:02,350
So when he dreams,
that's the forum that the things he 

1636
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:06,041
dreams about takes.
And he also said that he would talk to 

1637
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:06,041
his grandparents and his dream.

1638
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:08,690
So if he was working on a piece of wood 
and trying to figure out how to carve it

1639
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:11,120
and he ran into a particularly difficult
problem,

1640
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:16,270
he dream in his,
he'd have a conversation with his 

1641
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:16,270
grandparents and they'd help them figure
out how to solve the problem.

1642
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:17,270
And then he'd wake up and he could go 
carve the.

1643
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:21,110
And the thing is he told me these things
sort of matter of factly,

1644
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:21,920
right?
Like,

1645
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:23,090
you don't.
You know what I mean?

1646
01:28:23,091 --> 01:28:27,500
It wasn't like he was telling me these 
weird things that happened to him,

1647
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:29,000
although he was doing that to some 
degree.

1648
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:34,120
I asked him a lot of questions about 
what he carved and what it all meant and

1649
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:35,990
um,
you know,

1650
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:38,900
that was just part of his explanation of
how he did it and he,

1651
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:43,940
he carved me a couple of doors that I 
have in my house and one of them is 

1652
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:44,450
quite interesting.

1653
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:45,290
Well,
the,

1654
01:28:45,291 --> 01:28:50,291
to make a panel and they're an 
underwater scene and under the water 

1655
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:55,331
there's a bunch of mythical monsters.
Some of them are killer whales and I 

1656
01:28:55,331 --> 01:28:57,980
think there's an octopus down there and 
carved in this particular style.

1657
01:28:57,981 --> 01:29:01,350
And he said that the other thing that 
happens to him when he dreams as he goes

1658
01:29:01,351 --> 01:29:05,160
down to the bottom of the water where 
these mythical creatures are and he gets

1659
01:29:05,161 --> 01:29:10,161
inspiration from them.
And so I thought that was extremely 

1660
01:29:10,161 --> 01:29:10,330
interesting to know.
We,

1661
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:14,280
we don't know what a mind that isn't 
hyper civilized,

1662
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:19,310
let's say hyper literate like,
like our minds are because we're so 

1663
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:23,040
bombarded by external stimuli can.
We have no idea what the natural mind is

1664
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:26,010
like really.
And so it was quite interesting to,

1665
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:31,760
to,
to listen to that and also to see the 

1666
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,220
consequences because you quite a great.
He's quite a great carver.

1667
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,270
So the first is ecstatic dreams,
trances visions.

1668
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:38,670
The second is traditional shamanic 
techniques,

1669
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:42,540
names and functions of the spirits and 
mythology and genealogy of the clan.

1670
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:47,670
A secret language.
This twofold teaching imparted by the 

1671
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:48,510
spirits and the old masters Sherman's 
constitutes initiation.

1672
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:49,470
Well.
So,

1673
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,920
you know,
modern people have a problem with that 

1674
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:54,920
because we don't really get initiated.
But I would say

1675
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:57,860
that,

1676
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:05,200
you know,
let's say that we're each on a quest of 

1677
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:05,200
some sort.
You wouldn't be here,

1678
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,430
I don't think if you weren't because why
else would you be here,

1679
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:10,910
can you.
And so you're on a quest of some sort to

1680
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,820
figure out,
to struggle with the meaning of life,

1681
01:30:13,821 --> 01:30:18,821
let's say.
And you don't want to do that alone 

1682
01:30:18,821 --> 01:30:20,570
because you only last 70 years and good 
luck figuring it out on your,

1683
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,370
on your own.
It's just not going to happen.

1684
01:30:22,371 --> 01:30:25,070
It's too complicated.
And you'll be too isolated,

1685
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:26,810
right?
If it's just you,

1686
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:29,510
that's insanity.
That's no one can stand that.

1687
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:33,230
And so you hope that other people have 
things to tell you and that your culture

1688
01:30:33,231 --> 01:30:34,460
has something to tell you,
you know,

1689
01:30:34,461 --> 01:30:39,461
so you're on a quest,
maybe not with the same intensity as a 

1690
01:30:39,461 --> 01:30:39,950
shamonic initiate,
but you know,

1691
01:30:39,951 --> 01:30:44,951
let's give you some credit and then 
you're also trying to understand the 

1692
01:30:44,951 --> 01:30:45,800
wisdom of the past.

1693
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,990
And that's the second part of this.
It's like,

1694
01:30:47,991 --> 01:30:52,991
okay,
well you're a human being and human 

1695
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:52,991
beings have been telling stories for a 
long period of time trying to figure out

1696
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:57,521
what's going on,
trying to figure out how to orient 

1697
01:30:57,521 --> 01:30:57,521
themselves in the world.
And so you know,

1698
01:30:57,521 --> 01:31:01,840
partly what you're doing here is exactly
what the shamonic initiate does in the 

1699
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,321
second part of the process,
which is to expose yourself to the 

1700
01:31:05,321 --> 01:31:08,240
degree that you can to names and 
functions of the spirits,

1701
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:12,290
mythology and genealogy of the clan.
And the secret language.

1702
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,800
This twofold teaching imparted by the 
spirits and the old master shamans 

1703
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,460
constitutes initiation.
So it's,

1704
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,660
that's the rebirth,
right?

1705
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:25,550
That's what initiation is.
It's being born again and,

1706
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:28,460
and that's the birth of the spirit 
rather than over the body.

1707
01:31:28,461 --> 01:31:31,430
It's something like that,
and so it's the rebirth of an integrated

1708
01:31:31,431 --> 01:31:36,431
psyche that's one way of thinking about 
it and a psyche that's that's 

1709
01:31:36,431 --> 01:31:39,230
individual,
but also grounded in common humanity and

1710
01:31:39,231 --> 01:31:42,500
the wisdom of common humanity and that 
makes you strong,

1711
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:47,920
or at least it makes you stronger 
because there's a limit to your 

1712
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,831
strength,
but God only knows to some degree what 

1713
01:31:50,831 --> 01:31:50,831
that limit is.

1714
01:31:50,831 --> 01:31:51,230
You know,
people can be unbelievably tough,

1715
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:55,910
unbelievably tough,
and I think it's even more admirable for

1716
01:31:55,911 --> 01:32:00,610
human beings to be tough because we're 
so conscious of we can be hurt and we're

1717
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:03,580
so conscious of what that hurt can lead 
to.

1718
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:06,010
You know,
you can have your family taken away from

1719
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:11,011
you and you can be destroyed,
and the fact that you can be courageous 

1720
01:32:11,011 --> 01:32:13,150
in the face of that at all is something 
that is absolutely unbelievable.

1721
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:15,430
Right?
And people deserve a lot more credit,

1722
01:32:15,431 --> 01:32:20,431
I think,
than people give themselves because the 

1723
01:32:20,431 --> 01:32:23,740
fact that we can be honorable under 
conditions of life and death,

1724
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,270
right?
Of suffering.

1725
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:30,271
That's,
that's a testament to the human spirit 

1726
01:32:30,271 --> 01:32:33,450
and there's a profound anti human ethos 
I think that pervades our culture.

1727
01:32:34,571 --> 01:32:39,571
You know,
that considers human beings cancers on 

1728
01:32:39,571 --> 01:32:39,571
the planet,
something like that,

1729
01:32:39,571 --> 01:32:40,600
you know,
and that there should be less of us.

1730
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:45,600
It's the same spirit that motivated the 
guy who wrote the book about it better 

1731
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,100
to have never been and it's like I don't
see it that way.

1732
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:48,700
You know,
I mean,

1733
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:52,390
I think people do pretty well for,
you know,

1734
01:32:52,391 --> 01:32:55,640
for having their leg caught in a bear 
trap and their head caught in advice.

1735
01:32:55,690 --> 01:32:59,380
They're actually doing pretty well 
because life is really hard and the fact

1736
01:32:59,381 --> 01:33:04,381
that we're not absolutely brutal and 
murderous all the time is really 

1737
01:33:04,381 --> 01:33:06,670
something remarkable given what we 
actually have to contend with it.

1738
01:33:06,671 --> 01:33:11,671
We can go out of our way to be honest 
and generous and altruistic and to care 

1739
01:33:11,671 --> 01:33:16,591
for each other and under unbelievably 
dire circumstances and to act nobody 

1740
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,790
sometimes under the most trying 
conditions,

1741
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:21,130
you know,
and soldier in the Gulag archipelago.

1742
01:33:21,131 --> 01:33:24,420
He tells story after story of people who
acted a bismal Lee,

1743
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:29,670
but also people who under the worst 
threats imaginable never sacrificed 

1744
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:30,820
their character.
You know,

1745
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:32,260
in reading about that is really.

1746
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:37,810
While it really makes you wonder,
that's what it does,

1747
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:43,650
the future shamans among the tongue 
tongass as they approach maturity go 

1748
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:46,951
through a hysterical or history crisis,
but sometimes their vocation manifests 

1749
01:33:46,951 --> 01:33:47,050
itself.
At an earlier age,

1750
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:50,560
the boy runs away into the mountains and
remains there for a week or more feeding

1751
01:33:50,561 --> 01:33:52,960
on animals,
which he tears to pieces with his teeth.

1752
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,940
He returns to the village filthy 
bloodstained,

1753
01:33:56,950 --> 01:34:01,950
and it's only after 10 or more days that
have passed that he begins to babble 

1754
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:04,300
incoherent words.
The strange behavior of future showman's

1755
01:34:04,301 --> 01:34:09,301
has not failed to attract the attention 
of scholars and from the middle of the 

1756
01:34:09,301 --> 01:34:13,290
past century,
several attempts have been made to 

1757
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:13,290
explain the phenomena as a mental 
disorder,

1758
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:14,710
but the problem was wrongly put four.
On the one hand,

1759
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:19,711
it is not true that showman's always are
always have to be neuropathic in 

1760
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,510
mentally deranged.
On the other hand,

1761
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:27,660
and this is the critical issue,
those among them who had been able to 

1762
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:28,600
become shamans precisely because they 
had succeeded in becoming cured,

1763
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:29,890
so it was.

1764
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:35,010
It's not the descent into this strange 
subterranean psychological state that 

1765
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:38,650
constitutes the transformation that 
makes the showman,

1766
01:34:38,651 --> 01:34:43,651
but it's the emergence back out of that 
and that's a journey to the underworld 

1767
01:34:43,651 --> 01:34:43,651
and and a rebirth.
Right?

1768
01:34:43,651 --> 01:34:48,451
And so there's this great book.
This is a great book by a guy named 

1769
01:34:48,451 --> 01:34:49,230
Henri Ellenberger,
Jay,

1770
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:52,840
and he was an existential,
a psychoanalyst and philosopher,

1771
01:34:52,841 --> 01:34:55,420
and he wrote a book called the discovery
of the unconscious,

1772
01:34:55,421 --> 01:34:58,130
which I would highly recommend it.
It's on my list of recommended readings.

1773
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:02,960
It is a great book if you want to know 
about the psychoanalytic tradition,

1774
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:09,210
it's the best introduction there is.
And he discusses Adler and young and 

1775
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:11,330
Freud and does a very credible job of 
all three,

1776
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:15,350
but also takes the history of 
psychoanalytic thought back three or 400

1777
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:18,680
years before Freud.
And so it's very engaging,

1778
01:35:18,681 --> 01:35:20,040
reading and,
and,

1779
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:21,740
and,
and very interesting.

1780
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:26,100
And one of the things Ellenberg shape 
points out quite clearly is an.

1781
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:31,150
And he associates this to some degree 
with the shamanic tradition that both 

1782
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:34,541
Freud and young union particular 
underwent very intense periods of 

1783
01:35:34,541 --> 01:35:36,530
psychological disturbance,
let's say.

1784
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:40,670
And I would say what was happening is 
that because they were questioning their

1785
01:35:40,671 --> 01:35:45,671
axioms at the most fundamental level,
they were deranging their cognitive and 

1786
01:35:45,671 --> 01:35:46,760
perceptual structures,
right?

1787
01:35:46,761 --> 01:35:51,761
And Ewan was also experimenting with 
imaginative techniques with visionary 

1788
01:35:51,761 --> 01:35:55,721
techniques which he,
which he did a lot and there was a 

1789
01:35:55,721 --> 01:35:56,720
period of his life where he was having 
constant,

1790
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,960
a constant stream of visions which you 
wrote down in a book called the red 

1791
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:05,151
book,
but at the same time he was still 

1792
01:36:05,151 --> 01:36:06,350
functioning as a psychiatrist and 
operating normally in the world.

1793
01:36:06,351 --> 01:36:07,080
And so,
you know,

1794
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:10,460
people have suggested that what he had 
was a psychotic break.

1795
01:36:10,461 --> 01:36:12,260
But that's ridiculous because you don't,
don't,

1796
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:14,060
that's not how it works,
man.

1797
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,500
If you're having a psychotic break,
you,

1798
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,600
you're not being an effective 
psychiatrist.

1799
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:22,750
Those things do not go together,
especially not for a long period of 

1800
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:22,750
time.
And so there,

1801
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:27,070
there's the possibility of extreme 
experience without cyclocross 

1802
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,510
psychopathology.
And so,

1803
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:31,740
um,
and the Burgy,

1804
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,420
he says much the same thing about Freud 
and about Charles Darwin as well,

1805
01:36:35,421 --> 01:36:38,030
who underwent a terrible period of,
of,

1806
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:42,560
of mental confusion,
I would say,

1807
01:36:42,561 --> 01:36:45,500
as a consequence of formulating his 
theory of evolution,

1808
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:47,210
which was really hard on him because he 
was a,

1809
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,660
he was a die hard Christian and he knew 
what he knew,

1810
01:36:50,661 --> 01:36:52,880
what the implications of his theory 
word.

1811
01:36:52,881 --> 01:36:54,470
He didn't know what to do about that,
you know,

1812
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,210
so it was very,
very hard on him.

1813
01:36:56,211 --> 01:37:01,160
So it's quite common for people of 
genius to go through an intense crisis,

1814
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:04,580
psychological crisis,
but then resolve that.

1815
01:37:04,581 --> 01:37:06,650
And the genius is in the resolution,
right?

1816
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,800
The precondition for the genius is the 
disillusion in some sense because you 

1817
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:15,491
have to be obsessed with a problem.
It has to grip you completely before 

1818
01:37:15,491 --> 01:37:19,031
you're going to concentrate on it.
So obsessively that you might come up 

1819
01:37:19,031 --> 01:37:21,941
with a solution.
But it's the people who come up with a 

1820
01:37:21,941 --> 01:37:24,140
solution that are the prophets in the 
Sharmane and so forth and so on and,

1821
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:25,940
and,
and so that's not.

1822
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:28,760
This isn't something that only 
characterizes our cultures.

1823
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:31,610
We just don't recognize it in our own 
culture properly,

1824
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,730
and that's a problem.
Well,

1825
01:37:34,731 --> 01:37:37,670
sometimes we do.
Right?

1826
01:37:37,671 --> 01:37:38,710
You remember that in,
in,

1827
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:39,860
in the lion king,
right?

1828
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,890
That he shows up.
He's the chairman,

1829
01:37:41,891 --> 01:37:42,480
he,
he,

1830
01:37:42,510 --> 01:37:47,510
he brings,
he brings a Simba down that tunnel dark 

1831
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:48,770
tunnel.
That's the dark night of the soul.

1832
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:52,730
He has them reflect upon himself in a 
pool when he reflects upon himself,

1833
01:37:52,731 --> 01:37:57,731
deeply sees the reflection of his father
then becomes a core thing of cosmic 

1834
01:37:57,731 --> 01:38:01,851
significance and his father appears in 
the sky just like God appears to Jacob 

1835
01:38:02,491 --> 01:38:07,491
and basically tells them that it's time 
for him to grow the hell up and to 

1836
01:38:07,491 --> 01:38:09,900
return to the devastated kingdom and to 
set it right.

1837
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,930
You know,
and so and that's right.

1838
01:38:12,931 --> 01:38:14,160
That's exactly right.
I mean,

1839
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:19,190
we live in the devastated kingdom.
That's an eternal truth and it's the 

1840
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:22,941
responsibility of the individual to grow
the hell up and to set it right because 

1841
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,860
when it's devastated and when things are
not in place,

1842
01:38:25,861 --> 01:38:30,861
then everyone suffers too much and 
that's not good and there's no excuse 

1843
01:38:30,861 --> 01:38:34,620
for not doing something about it because
you don't have anything better to do so.

1844
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:39,360
And even like children's movies tell you
this.

1845
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:44,870
So this is a fun one.
This is from the ead wind salter,

1846
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:49,800
ninth to twelfth century.
That's how Adam and eve,

1847
01:38:49,801 --> 01:38:54,300
but the,
there is speculation that the fruit that

1848
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:57,360
they're eating there,
you see these psilocybin mushrooms,

1849
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:03,680
right?
Because they're the only kind of 

1850
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:04,911
mushroom that girl like that.
So that's pretty wild you might say.

1851
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:11,210
And then this is the,
I think it's called banisteriopsis vine 

1852
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:12,240
if I remember correctly,
and it's what Iowasca is made out of and

1853
01:39:12,241 --> 01:39:14,490
it has this double helix forum which is 
very,

1854
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:15,960
very interesting.

1855
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:17,730
And they,
the people that natives,

1856
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:21,000
nobody could figure out how the hell 
they made this Iowasca which,

1857
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:24,480
which transports people spiritually in a
very intense manner.

1858
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:26,220
And there's a whole religion based on 
it,

1859
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:31,770
like a modern religion as well as the 
archaic religion and to to to make this 

1860
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:35,811
stuff,
they had to take two plants that don't 

1861
01:39:35,811 --> 01:39:37,581
grow anywhere near each other and like 
there's like a million plants in the 

1862
01:39:37,581 --> 01:39:38,490
Amazon,
so like how do you figure that out?

1863
01:39:38,491 --> 01:39:43,491
Nobody knows.
And then you have to cook them in this 

1864
01:39:43,491 --> 01:39:45,741
very particular way for a particular 
amount of time before you produce this 

1865
01:39:45,741 --> 01:39:47,610
stuff.
So one of the plants has dmt in it,

1866
01:39:47,611 --> 01:39:51,240
which is a very intense psychedelic,
but it's very short acting and the other

1867
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:56,241
has a Mao inhibitor.
So if you take the DMT and you take the 

1868
01:39:56,241 --> 01:39:58,980
Mao inhibitor,
then the DMT trip lasts for much longer.

1869
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:01,470
And so that's what these Amazonian 
natives figured out.

1870
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:04,620
No one has any idea how they managed it 
and if you ask them,

1871
01:40:04,621 --> 01:40:06,780
they tell you that the plants told them 
how to do it,

1872
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,320
which isn't much of an explanation as 
far as modern people are concerned.

1873
01:40:10,321 --> 01:40:14,700
But then when modern people take the 
IOWASCA and the plant,

1874
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,800
so to speak,
starts to talk to them.

1875
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:21,910
There are a little less leery of the 
whole theory that the plants had 

1876
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:22,120
something to do with this,
so you know,

1877
01:40:22,121 --> 01:40:26,370
and these things that these.
I'm loath to talk about this because I'm

1878
01:40:26,371 --> 01:40:29,580
not an advocate for drug use,
but by the same token,

1879
01:40:29,581 --> 01:40:32,610
you can't ignore empirical data.
It's not reasonable,

1880
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:38,240
and the empirical data that psychedelic 
substances can produce mystical 

1881
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,110
experiences and that those often have a 
transformative effect.

1882
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:45,111
I mean,
one of the latest study showed that if 

1883
01:40:45,111 --> 01:40:46,941
you took people who were dying of cancer
and you and you gave them silicide been 

1884
01:40:46,941 --> 01:40:50,270
in a sufficient dose to produce a 
mystical experience that you radically.

1885
01:40:50,271 --> 01:40:53,560
It decreased their fear of death.
It's like

1886
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:56,290
you gotta think about that,
man.

1887
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:58,390
That's,
that's tough.

1888
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:01,430
That's a tough experiment.
You just wouldn't expect that,

1889
01:41:01,431 --> 01:41:06,431
that you think you take someone,
you do range them intensely and then 

1890
01:41:06,431 --> 01:41:08,380
when they come back they're not.
Even though they're dying,

1891
01:41:08,381 --> 01:41:10,800
they're not nearly as afraid of dying.
You know,

1892
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:14,170
you got to kind of wake up and smell the
roses when you see something like that.

1893
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:17,140
And the people who are doing this 
research are very reliable people.

1894
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:22,040
So there's the Amanita Mascara,
you know,

1895
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:24,080
there's this old idea,
it's quite a funny idea.

1896
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:29,000
Toadstools so flies like avenue to 
Mascara and there are some,

1897
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:32,510
this is ridiculous.
There's some evidence that they actually

1898
01:41:32,511 --> 01:41:36,200
liked getting stoned so because animals 
will eat these,

1899
01:41:36,201 --> 01:41:39,590
like reindeer will eat these things too 
and they get pretty tripped out by them.

1900
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:42,920
And so I have this book on psychedelic 
use among animals,

1901
01:41:42,921 --> 01:41:44,540
which is a small book,
but.

1902
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:47,930
And so,
so there's that,

1903
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
there's this idea that toads used to sit
around the they haven't eaten miscarry 

1904
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,230
and wait for the stone flies to like 
bought badly around them and then snap 

1905
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:58,670
them up.
So that's pretty funny.

1906
01:41:58,910 --> 01:42:00,590
I think can.
So,

1907
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,380
and you know,
there are mushrooms in,

1908
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:07,760
in the US that are the oldest,
the oldest organisms on the planet.

1909
01:42:07,761 --> 01:42:08,840
Hey,
there's one mushroom,

1910
01:42:08,841 --> 01:42:11,210
I can't remember where it is,
but it covers something like,

1911
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:12,860
Oh God,
I don't know,

1912
01:42:12,861 --> 01:42:17,861
like square hundreds of square miles.
It's like this huge thing because it's 

1913
01:42:17,861 --> 01:42:17,900
all underground.
Right?

1914
01:42:17,901 --> 01:42:20,150
And they have these very complex 
networks of,

1915
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:24,740
of Mycelia they're called and they think
the thing is like 150,000

1916
01:42:24,741 --> 01:42:26,090
years old,
something like that.

1917
01:42:26,091 --> 01:42:29,630
So there's plenty of things about the 
world that we don't know,

1918
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:34,990
that's for sure.
There's the chemical makeup of the 

1919
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:39,280
classic psychedelics.
You see they all have the same 

1920
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:39,280
fundamental structure.

1921
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,730
This is Serotonin,
that's the one of the major brain 

1922
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:45,611
neurotransmitters.
And so what happens with the 

1923
01:42:45,611 --> 01:42:46,100
psychedelics is that they,
they alter the,

1924
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:49,540
they alter the brain function by 
altering the,

1925
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,480
the neurochemical utilization of 
Serotonin.

1926
01:42:53,570 --> 01:42:56,480
They changed the manner in which the 
serotonergic systems work.

1927
01:42:56,510 --> 01:43:01,510
And that is the serotonin system is very
basic system may because when you're an 

1928
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:05,441
embryo and your brain is developing,
it's the serotonin projections that 

1929
01:43:05,441 --> 01:43:06,830
basically orchestrate the development of
your brain.

1930
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,440
So they're.
And they're very archaic circuits,

1931
01:43:09,441 --> 01:43:10,940
very,
very archaic circuits.

1932
01:43:11,330 --> 01:43:15,390
So,
and this is the paper,

1933
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:18,420
I think I stole this from silicide,
Ben Griffiths,

1934
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:21,030
who's been doing a lot of this research 
suicide can occasion,

1935
01:43:21,031 --> 01:43:26,031
mystical type experiences having 
substantial and sustained personal 

1936
01:43:26,031 --> 01:43:28,850
meaning and spiritual significance.
So why,

1937
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:31,410
that's a good question.
Right?

1938
01:43:31,411 --> 01:43:33,600
Like so,
so here's a question for you.

1939
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:37,500
It is beyond dispute that human beings 
are capable of religious experience.

1940
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:40,870
Why?
Why is that?

1941
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:42,730
Exactly?
And they're like,

1942
01:43:42,731 --> 01:43:47,731
you can associate with psychosis,
but that doesn't work is the theory 

1943
01:43:47,731 --> 01:43:48,610
doesn't hold.
The theory doesn't hold water.

1944
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:51,710
It's not the same thing.
So why is it there?

1945
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:54,310
Exactly.
And it,

1946
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:56,710
it's not an easy thing to figure out.
Like I've been trying to figure.

1947
01:43:56,711 --> 01:43:59,320
I'm always trying to figure it a 
biological explanation for everything,

1948
01:43:59,321 --> 01:44:01,210
right?
Because if you want to find something to

1949
01:44:01,211 --> 01:44:03,300
stand on,
you want to make sure that it can resist

1950
01:44:03,301 --> 01:44:08,301
a challenge.
And so if I can find an explanation for 

1951
01:44:08,301 --> 01:44:08,950
something that's reductionistic and 
materialistic and biological,

1952
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:11,500
then I'm going for that.
But that's a tough one.

1953
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:15,610
Consciousness is a tough one.
The moral sense is a tough one.

1954
01:44:15,611 --> 01:44:18,490
They're not easy things to crack.
The Big Bang is a tough one.

1955
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:19,660
So

1956
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:28,950
you know what I mean?
A cynic might say that maybe sometimes 

1957
01:44:29,401 --> 01:44:32,940
when people are close to suicide,
they'll have a mystical experience,

1958
01:44:32,941 --> 01:44:34,560
you know,
and you maybe you say,

1959
01:44:34,561 --> 01:44:39,561
well,
it's a last ditch attempt of your brain 

1960
01:44:39,561 --> 01:44:40,620
to delude you into thinking that your 
life has some significance,

1961
01:44:40,621 --> 01:44:43,500
you know,
and that that's a plausible theory,

1962
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:48,420
but I don't think it accounts for the 
generality of the phenomena.

1963
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:52,300
So,
so I don't buy it.

1964
01:44:56,950 --> 01:45:01,950
What happens in the show,
manic experiences that the Scherman has 

1965
01:45:02,611 --> 01:45:06,000
the experience of being reduced to a 
skeleton first.

1966
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:11,510
So death,
a death experience on very realistic 

1967
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:14,931
death experience.
And then the next thing that happens is 

1968
01:45:14,931 --> 01:45:17,540
that he finds himself in a place where 
he's communing with his ancestral,

1969
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:22,560
the ancestral spirits.
And then after that there's the climbing

1970
01:45:22,631 --> 01:45:25,720
of something like the ladder,
Jacob's ladder say,

1971
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:30,190
and an encounter with God for all 
intents and purposes.

1972
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:35,880
And uh,
it's very widespread phenomena.

1973
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:39,870
It's the world tree.
And I thought about this a lot,

1974
01:45:39,871 --> 01:45:40,830
trying to figure out what this,

1975
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:47,560
what this represents.
According to a Yak who'd informant 

1976
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:50,100
that's in Siberia,
the spirits carry the future showman to 

1977
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:50,240
hell and shove them in a house for three
years.

1978
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:53,600
Here he undergoes is initiation.
The spirits cut off his head,

1979
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:56,000
which they set off to one side for the 
novice,

1980
01:45:56,001 --> 01:45:58,850
must watch his own dismemberment with 
his own eyes,

1981
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:02,060
disillusion to the primary elements in 
some sense,

1982
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:07,270
and hack his body to bits which are 
later distributed among the spirits of 

1983
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:10,481
various sicknesses.
It's only on this condition that the 

1984
01:46:10,481 --> 01:46:13,271
future showman will obtain the power of 
healing his bones then covered with new 

1985
01:46:13,271 --> 01:46:15,050
flesh and his.
Some Casey has also given new blood,

1986
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:20,110
so there's a death and resurrection 
experience that's associated with this 

1987
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:23,161
shamanic ritual.
We're here in the presence of a very 

1988
01:46:25,211 --> 01:46:27,940
ancient religious idea which belongs to 
the hunter culture.

1989
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:30,850
Bone symbolizes the final route of 
animal life.

1990
01:46:30,851 --> 01:46:33,520
The mold from which the flesh 
continually rises.

1991
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:36,820
It is from the bone that men and animals
are reborn for a time.

1992
01:46:36,821 --> 01:46:39,310
They maintain themselves in an existence
of the flesh.

1993
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:44,311
Then they die and their life is reduced 
to the essence concentrated in the 

1994
01:46:44,311 --> 01:46:44,860
skeleton from which they will be born.
Again,

1995
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:52,020
a good graphic representation of the 
experience.

1996
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:57,480
It's an old painting by,
I think it's Hieronymus Bosch,

1997
01:46:57,481 --> 01:47:02,481
if I remember correctly.
And I really liked that because it's 

1998
01:47:02,481 --> 01:47:05,430
reminiscent of the near death 
experiences that you hear people 

1999
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:05,430
describe and they're quite common as 
well.

2000
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:06,420
And,
and,

2001
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:09,780
uh,
I had a very weird experience once.

2002
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:12,390
I don't think I've told you this story.
I was,

2003
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:16,980
I was assessing someone who had gone 
through a car windshield and he was very

2004
01:47:16,981 --> 01:47:19,260
depressed and had happened a long time 
before,

2005
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:22,830
but he was very depressed and the 
insurance company was basically accusing

2006
01:47:22,831 --> 01:47:26,970
him of a malingering because he'd been 
depressed for so long and you know,

2007
01:47:26,971 --> 01:47:30,390
he'd sort of healed up and everything.
But if your left hemisphere is damaged,

2008
01:47:30,391 --> 01:47:32,340
especially the frontal part of your left
hemisphere,

2009
01:47:32,341 --> 01:47:35,970
then you can be in a chronic state of 
depression because the left hemisphere,

2010
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:39,300
generally speaking,
is responsible for positive emotion.

2011
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:42,330
And so if it isn't there,
then it's like negative emotion for you.

2012
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:45,780
And so I went and assessed him and I was
giving him this,

2013
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:50,930
I think it was called the MMPI,
the Minnesota multiphasic personality 

2014
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:52,020
inventory,
which is a kind of a standard,

2015
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:56,790
a path personality test,
half psychopathology test.

2016
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:59,460
And uh,
he was filling it out.

2017
01:47:59,461 --> 01:48:01,380
He was a very serious guy,
middle aged guy.

2018
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:04,860
Nothing about him was new age in the 
least.

2019
01:48:04,861 --> 01:48:09,861
He was like an accountant I think.
I think in fact he was an accountant if 

2020
01:48:09,861 --> 01:48:09,861
I remember correctly.
Um,

2021
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:15,950
and there was one question and it said,
my spirit has left my body.

2022
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:18,510
I think that's right.
It's very close.

2023
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:22,110
And he stopped and he asked me what,
well,

2024
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,910
he said,
I'm not sure how to answer this.

2025
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:26,130
And so I said,
well,

2026
01:48:26,131 --> 01:48:26,850
why?
And he said,

2027
01:48:26,851 --> 01:48:29,100
well,
after I went through the car windshield,

2028
01:48:29,101 --> 01:48:32,250
I was in a coma for three weeks,
something like that.

2029
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:37,250
And I died.
I think he said he died three times and 

2030
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:40,821
he said that he could remember he 
couldn't remember anything during that 

2031
01:48:40,821 --> 01:48:41,880
period of time and he couldn't remember 
the car accident.

2032
01:48:41,881 --> 01:48:44,970
That's retrograde amnesia.
It's quite common with head injuries.

2033
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:48,480
And he said that during one of those 
experiences,

2034
01:48:48,481 --> 01:48:50,190
and this is all he remembered from the 
hospital,

2035
01:48:50,191 --> 01:48:55,191
was that he came out of his body and 
went down the tunnel of light.

2036
01:48:56,251 --> 01:49:01,251
You've heard these near death 
experiences and then saw his family 

2037
01:49:01,251 --> 01:49:01,950
members there.
And so the heavenly light,

2038
01:49:01,951 --> 01:49:06,030
and then realize that it wasn't his time
and came back to his body.

2039
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,790
Now what was interesting about this guy 
was that,

2040
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:09,840
well,
first of all,

2041
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:12,270
I didn't ask him about this,
right?

2042
01:49:12,271 --> 01:49:17,271
He basically volunteered this story and 
it was instigated by this question and,

2043
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:22,200
and he didn't know that anybody else had
any hey,

2044
01:49:22,201 --> 01:49:27,201
ever had an experience like that because
I asked him if he'd ever heard anything 

2045
01:49:27,201 --> 01:49:27,201
about like that.

2046
01:49:27,201 --> 01:49:28,230
And he said No.
So that was interesting.

2047
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:31,830
But what really was interesting is how 
the hell did he remember that?

2048
01:49:32,970 --> 01:49:37,970
Right?
Because he had amnesia during that 

2049
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:37,970
entire period of time.
He was in a bloody coma.

2050
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:40,500
It's like he didn't remember anything 
but he remembered that.

2051
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:46,280
And so.
Well those experiences are more common 

2052
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:47,610
than you think.
And then there's a,

2053
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:50,090
there's a painting of one which is quite
interesting.

2054
01:49:50,091 --> 01:49:53,500
And that's like a tunnel to heaven.
It's the same basic idea.

2055
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:56,020
It's a little bit more suffering going 
on in this one I think.

2056
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:58,540
But that's pretty much typical of 
Hieronymus Bosch.

2057
01:49:58,541 --> 01:50:00,190
I mean,
I don't know what was up with that guy,

2058
01:50:00,191 --> 01:50:03,340
but he was.
He was one strange character.

2059
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:08,680
Now the scandinavians have this idea 
that the world is a tree,

2060
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:14,550
and I've been thinking about that a lot.
I think that the tree idea tree is 

2061
01:50:15,551 --> 01:50:19,450
something that is grounded in in matter,
let's say,

2062
01:50:19,451 --> 01:50:22,540
and that reaches up to heaven in the 
Scandinavian tree at the bottom.

2063
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:24,250
There's quite a cool idea at the bottom 
of that.

2064
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:29,460
See,
this tree is constantly being nod by 

2065
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:31,741
snakes.
You can sort of see the snakes at the 

2066
01:50:31,741 --> 01:50:33,841
bottom and at the same time it's being 
watered and the water makes the tree 

2067
01:50:33,841 --> 01:50:34,810
grow at the same rate that the snakes.
No,

2068
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:37,420
on its roots.
So it's like a Yin Yang idea.

2069
01:50:37,421 --> 01:50:42,421
You know,
that there's continual chaotic 

2070
01:50:42,421 --> 01:50:43,180
destruction and replacement at the basis
of whatever this process is.

2071
01:50:43,450 --> 01:50:45,730
But the tree seems to me to be a 
representation,

2072
01:50:45,731 --> 01:50:50,080
not so much of.
It's like a different dimensional space.

2073
01:50:50,081 --> 01:50:52,030
That's,
that's what's trying to be represented.

2074
01:50:52,031 --> 01:50:54,880
So imagine that you know,
your structured,

2075
01:50:55,600 --> 01:51:00,600
if you take powers of 10 magnification,
say human beings are boat in the middle 

2076
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:03,640
of the tiniest thing and the largest 
thing if you do it by,

2077
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:05,940
by powers of 10,
and so you know,

2078
01:51:05,941 --> 01:51:10,760
you have a subatomic level and an atomic
level molecular level and you know,

2079
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:11,500
then,
uh,

2080
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:17,340
that are maybe the level of organs and 
then there's you and then there's your 

2081
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:21,010
family and so on,
all the way up the tree fundamentally.

2082
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:26,070
And so I think that what this tree 
represents and this is the things that 

2083
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:28,150
thing that the shaman moves up and down,
I think that's what it represents.

2084
01:51:28,151 --> 01:51:30,160
It's this,
it's this different view of,

2085
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:33,280
of its dimensionality at something like 
that.

2086
01:51:33,281 --> 01:51:38,281
And I think that what happens in the 
psychedelic experiences that 

2087
01:51:38,281 --> 01:51:38,350
consciousness can travel up and down 
that structure.

2088
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:41,320
It's something like that,
and maybe not only up and down it,

2089
01:51:41,321 --> 01:51:45,160
but maybe right through it.
I know that's a radical claim.

2090
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:48,250
It's a really radical claim and it might
be wrong,

2091
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:52,510
but it's probably wrong even because 
most radical claims are wrong,

2092
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:54,980
but,
but,

2093
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:05,870
but I'm not so sure it's wrong.
Here's something cool.

2094
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:12,230
So that's the Scandinavian world tree.
And that was drawn by an anthropologist 

2095
01:52:12,641 --> 01:52:15,940
who visited the tribes in the Amazon who
use IOWASCA.

2096
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:23,290
No,
you see it's a snake.

2097
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:25,450
It's a tree with snakes.
Well,

2098
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:30,480
you know,
that's reminiscent of the story of Adam 

2099
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:31,510
and Eve obviously,
but it's also reminiscent of our primate

2100
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:32,530
dwelling place.
Right?

2101
01:52:32,531 --> 01:52:35,050
Because that was basically our ancestral
home,

2102
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:40,000
a tree surrounded by snakes and the 
snakes like to eat us and this is a long

2103
01:52:40,001 --> 01:52:41,050
time ago.
This is like

2104
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:45,800
50 million years ago.
It's really a long time ago.

2105
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:50,090
And so we don't know where these images 
come from precisely,

2106
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:55,480
but I do have the suspicion that we use 
the circuitry that we developed to 

2107
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:02,500
detect snakes to represent the unknown 
as such because it like a snake is 

2108
01:53:03,141 --> 01:53:06,200
something that comes out of the unknown.
And like we evolved,

2109
01:53:06,201 --> 01:53:11,201
right?
We all evolved out of an animal 

2110
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:12,980
substructure and so we had to get our,
our biological cognitive structure from 

2111
01:53:13,971 --> 01:53:18,971
somewhere and we have this capacity of 
thinking about the absolute unknown and 

2112
01:53:18,971 --> 01:53:19,810
the terrorists that are involved in 
that,

2113
01:53:19,870 --> 01:53:24,870
that the horrors that can emerge from 
what we don't understand and it stands 

2114
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:27,620
perfectly the reason that we would use 
circuits that were already pre developed

2115
01:53:27,621 --> 01:53:32,621
for that and that this is a reasonable 
representation of the existential 

2116
01:53:32,621 --> 01:53:34,340
structure of the world.
So.

2117
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:41,260
Right.
And I think I might've showed you this 

2118
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:41,830
before,
but it never ceases to amaze me this,

2119
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:45,640
this picture.
So my son drew this when he was nine,

2120
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:50,700
eight.
And so on the right you see mushroom 

2121
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:53,521
houses and they have the names of all 
his friends on them and so that's order,

2122
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:59,820
right?
And then on the left side you see chaos 

2123
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:02,761
there and that little orange thing is a 
bug and then there's a river that runs 

2124
01:54:02,761 --> 01:54:03,460
right down the middle.
And so that's like the,

2125
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:09,420
you know,
the Yin Yang symbol with the divided in 

2126
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:09,420
the middle.
So that's quite cool.

2127
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:09,730
And then there's,
there it is,

2128
01:54:09,731 --> 01:54:12,820
there's Jacob's ladder.
It's like Jack and the beanstalk,

2129
01:54:12,821 --> 01:54:17,821
which is by the way,
another variant of the same shamonic 

2130
01:54:17,821 --> 01:54:20,800
story and there are bugs going up and 
down it and then they're taking messages

2131
01:54:20,801 --> 01:54:25,801
from heaven and then up there and 
haven't got the sun and there's St Peter

2132
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:28,600
and I don't know where in the world he 
got this.

2133
01:54:28,601 --> 01:54:30,700
It's not like he had a lot of religious 
education.

2134
01:54:30,701 --> 01:54:33,610
I mean despite me.
Um,

2135
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:39,390
and you know,
there's the pearly gates up there and 

2136
01:54:39,390 --> 01:54:41,201
then that was the world as far as his.
He had a very well ordered psyche I 

2137
01:54:41,201 --> 01:54:43,270
would say and still does,
but when he drew that,

2138
01:54:43,271 --> 01:54:47,320
it just absolutely blew me away.
And so I had it laminated and it's in my

2139
01:54:47,321 --> 01:54:49,960
office because,
well,

2140
01:54:49,961 --> 01:54:52,240
I don't know because like,
what the hell do you make of that?

2141
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:52,980
You know,
that's,

2142
01:54:53,010 --> 01:54:55,060
that's why so.

2143
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:08,460
Well you sort of get the picture there,
you know,

2144
01:55:08,461 --> 01:55:13,461
the cathedral is the great cathedrals of
Europe or they're like the forest in 

2145
01:55:14,011 --> 01:55:14,850
stone,
right?

2146
01:55:14,851 --> 01:55:19,851
And they try to represent the light 
coming through the leaves and so it's 

2147
01:55:19,851 --> 01:55:21,360
sort of our ancestral forest home,
but it's,

2148
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:25,600
it's transformed into these great 
sculptures of stone and you know,

2149
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:30,800
they produce all because of the 
combination of light and darkness and 

2150
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:34,371
color.
But also I think for the same reason 

2151
01:55:34,371 --> 01:55:34,440
that huge trees produce Roi and people,
you know,

2152
01:55:34,441 --> 01:55:37,440
and we don't want them cut down,
they seem sacred in some sense.

2153
01:55:37,441 --> 01:55:42,140
And perhaps they are,
but no.

2154
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:43,800
And it also,
to me,

2155
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:48,810
this is an intuition that the,
the architects of these great cathedrals

2156
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:53,811
were trying to get.
They're trying to express something 

2157
01:55:53,811 --> 01:55:54,570
that's deep and structural heart.
They're trying,

2158
01:55:54,571 --> 01:55:56,580
trying,
trying to express the idea that if being

2159
01:55:56,581 --> 01:56:01,581
was constituted properly,
then it would be organized from the 

2160
01:56:01,581 --> 01:56:05,580
subatomic level all the way up to the 
highest cosmic level perfectly.

2161
01:56:05,581 --> 01:56:09,620
So every layer stacked on top of each 
other without any contradictions.

2162
01:56:09,621 --> 01:56:14,130
Now that would be an ideal mode of being
and everything would come together under

2163
01:56:14,131 --> 01:56:19,131
those circumstances.
And that's what's being expressed in 

2164
01:56:19,131 --> 01:56:22,041
these cathedrals.
It's not all that's being expressed 

2165
01:56:22,041 --> 01:56:22,041
because they're also shaped like a 
cross.

2166
01:56:22,041 --> 01:56:26,061
And you know,
the idea is that the center of the 

2167
01:56:26,061 --> 01:56:26,061
Cross,
which is the center of suffering,

2168
01:56:26,061 --> 01:56:29,070
is also the place of the individual and 
the place where the transformation takes

2169
01:56:29,071 --> 01:56:34,071
place.
That's all built into the architecture 

2170
01:56:34,071 --> 01:56:34,071
as well.
So

2171
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:41,910
then there's the tree like structures 
that make us up.

2172
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:48,680
It's stretched down to the tiniest 
realities,

2173
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:51,050
the microcosm,

2174
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:58,810
and there's this,
this idea,

2175
01:56:58,811 --> 01:57:00,730
it's all represented in the same way.
Again,

2176
01:57:00,731 --> 01:57:03,700
it's this idea,
especially the Mandela up in the top,

2177
01:57:03,701 --> 01:57:08,701
right?
It's the idea of perfection of 

2178
01:57:08,701 --> 01:57:10,630
crystalline structure and that's what 
the Yogis are trying to attain when they

2179
01:57:10,631 --> 01:57:13,480
organize their bodies.
They're trying to get every single layer

2180
01:57:13,481 --> 01:57:16,750
of there being aligned properly and it's
something like,

2181
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:19,450
and you can kind of see an echo of that 
in the.

2182
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:24,750
I think that's a Tibetan sand painting,
if I remember correctly on the on the 

2183
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:29,880
bottom left idea,
is that if you get yourself aligned 

2184
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:30,700
properly,
then the information can flow along that

2185
01:57:30,701 --> 01:57:33,160
tree.
That that's you without,

2186
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,970
without impediment.
Something like that.

2187
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:42,270
And that would be like a state of 
optimal health and that both physical 

2188
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:47,191
and spiritual exercises can put you in 
that state and that's while those are 

2189
01:57:47,191 --> 01:57:49,840
all clouds of ideas that surround this 
idea of a ladder to heaven.

2190
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:56,270
So Jacob is talking to God and God says,
behold,

2191
01:57:56,271 --> 01:58:01,271
I am with thee and I will keep the in 
all places where you go and bring you 

2192
01:58:01,271 --> 01:58:05,501
again into this land for I won't leave 
you until I have done that which I have 

2193
01:58:05,501 --> 01:58:07,160
spoken to you have.
And Jacob awakened out of his sleep

2194
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,840
had he said,
surely the Lord is in this place.

2195
01:58:10,841 --> 01:58:12,670
And I knew what not,
and he was afraid and said,

2196
01:58:12,671 --> 01:58:17,671
how dreadful is this place?
This is none other but the house of God 

2197
01:58:17,671 --> 01:58:17,980
and this is the gate of heaven.

2198
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,500
And Jacob rose up early in the morning 
and took the stone.

2199
01:58:21,501 --> 01:58:25,250
Then he had put for his pillows and set 
it up for a pillar and poured oil on top

2200
01:58:25,251 --> 01:58:26,960
of it.
That's a sacrifice.

2201
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:29,690
And he called the name of that place 
Bethel,

2202
01:58:29,691 --> 01:58:32,060
but the name of the city was called Luz 
at the first.

2203
01:58:32,061 --> 01:58:37,061
And Jacob vowed a vow saying,
if God will be with me and will keep me 

2204
01:58:37,061 --> 01:58:41,111
in this way,
that I go and will give me bread to eat 

2205
01:58:41,111 --> 01:58:42,790
and Raymond to put on so that I come 
again to my father's house in peace,

2206
01:58:42,791 --> 01:58:45,670
then shall the Lord be my God.
And this stone,

2207
01:58:45,671 --> 01:58:47,920
which I have said for a pillar shall be 
God's house.

2208
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:50,410
And they'll have all of that that is 
given to me.

2209
01:58:50,411 --> 01:58:55,411
I will surely give the 10th unto Thee.
And that's a pretty good place to stop.

2210
01:58:58,390 --> 01:58:59,950
So now I'll just

2211
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:06,440
conclude.
So you have this very morally ambivalent

2212
01:59:06,441 --> 01:59:11,441
character who's so far,
pretty much everything he's done that 

2213
01:59:11,441 --> 01:59:13,560
we're familiar with is not good.
So He's,

2214
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:15,890
he's betrayed his brother horribly,
twice,

2215
01:59:15,891 --> 01:59:20,891
badly enough so that he,
his brother wants to kill him and 

2216
01:59:20,891 --> 01:59:21,770
everyone can kind of sympathize with his
brother.

2217
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:27,340
So.
And then he runs away essentially 

2218
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:30,100
because his mother tells him to,
which is not exactly a testament to his 

2219
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:30,560
character.
And despite that,

2220
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:34,130
strangely enough,
he has this experience,

2221
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:37,130
you know?
And that's heartening,

2222
01:59:37,490 --> 01:59:39,410
I guess.
And that's the point,

2223
01:59:39,411 --> 01:59:44,411
is that people are predisposed to 
terrible error.

2224
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:49,780
There's no doubt about that,
and yet when I was writing my latest 

2225
01:59:51,081 --> 01:59:52,340
book,
I had a friend of mine,

2226
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:58,300
Norman Doidge wrote the foreword and 
Norman has written a couple of great 

2227
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:02,501
books and he's Jewish and he read some 
of what I'd written and he took me to 

2228
02:00:03,321 --> 02:00:06,410
task for making the God of the Old 
Testament,

2229
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:07,880
you know,
from a Christian perspective,

2230
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:13,060
too harsh and unforgiving,
and I rewrote a fair bit of it because 

2231
02:00:13,191 --> 02:00:16,160
of his criticism and because of what 
I've learned doing these lectures.

2232
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:18,920
It's like it's not exactly right.
You know what I mean?

2233
02:00:19,490 --> 02:00:22,100
What happens in the Old Testament is if 
you screw up,

2234
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:27,160
especially if you know you do and you 
decide that you're not going to do 

2235
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:27,530
anything about it,
so it's conscious and deliberate,

2236
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:32,980
then look the hell out.
You are in serious trouble and I 

2237
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:34,460
actually think that's also 
psychologically accurate.

2238
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:39,490
One of the things young pointed out,
and it's always struck me was that if 

2239
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:41,600
you don't know what you're doing,
this is actually in the gospel of Thomas

2240
02:00:41,601 --> 02:00:43,160
as well.
Interestingly enough,

2241
02:00:43,161 --> 02:00:48,161
is one of the gnostic gospels.
Christ tells his followers something 

2242
02:00:48,161 --> 02:00:48,530
like,
if you make a mistake and you don't know

2243
02:00:48,531 --> 02:00:50,750
what you're doing,
then you'll be forgiven for it,

2244
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:55,130
but if you make a mistake knowing what 
you're doing and you do it anyways,

2245
02:00:55,131 --> 02:00:57,910
then like good luck to you.
And,

2246
02:00:58,440 --> 02:00:58,910
and,
and,

2247
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:00,710
and I think that's,
I think that's,

2248
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:03,020
that's psychologically accurate.

2249
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:03,930
We,

2250
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:12,590
one of the things that's very 
interesting about the judgemental God in

2251
02:01:12,591 --> 02:01:17,591
the Old Testament however,
is that he can be bargained with and 

2252
02:01:17,591 --> 02:01:21,760
even if you make mistakes,
especially if you're unconscious of 

2253
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:22,130
them,
if you haven't learned yet,

2254
02:01:22,131 --> 02:01:27,131
let's say,
then you will always have the 

2255
02:01:27,131 --> 02:01:27,680
opportunity to return to the proper 
path.

2256
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:33,310
And that's.
People get cynical about that because 

2257
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:35,261
there's no this mostly Christian idea 
that you could live a terribly sinful 

2258
02:01:35,261 --> 02:01:35,970
life,
but if you repented on your deathbed,

2259
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:37,550
it's like heaven for you.
And it's like,

2260
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:39,740
well that's,
that sounds like great deal,

2261
02:01:39,741 --> 02:01:44,741
right?
It's like you can do whatever the hell 

2262
02:01:44,741 --> 02:01:46,901
you want until just before you die.
Of course you might not know when that 

2263
02:01:46,901 --> 02:01:46,901
is.
So that's a problem.

2264
02:01:46,901 --> 02:01:47,780
You then you can just say,
well,

2265
02:01:47,781 --> 02:01:49,760
I'm sorry,
and you know everything's forgiven,

2266
02:01:49,761 --> 02:01:54,761
but the problem with being cynical about
that sort of thing is that it's no 

2267
02:01:54,761 --> 02:01:55,900
trivial matter to repent,
you know,

2268
02:01:55,940 --> 02:02:00,940
because to repent means a figure out 
what you actually did and the worst 

2269
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:06,130
things that you did,
the more horrible it is to figure it 

2270
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:06,130
out.

2271
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:06,320
It's no joke,
right?

2272
02:02:06,321 --> 02:02:11,321
And there's no genuine repentance 
without understanding of the depth of 

2273
02:02:11,321 --> 02:02:15,010
your depravity.
And so if you lived to particularly 

2274
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:17,690
reprehensible life and you come to 
understand it,

2275
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:20,300
I think that in and of itself could kill
you.

2276
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:24,470
You know,
it's a terrible thing to wake up and see

2277
02:02:24,471 --> 02:02:27,380
what you've done.
If what you've done is truly terrible,

2278
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,970
so there's no easy way out.
It's not an easy out.

2279
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:36,110
It's just pure cynicism.
To associate that idea with an easy out.

2280
02:02:36,111 --> 02:02:41,111
It's not,
but there is that positive idea that 

2281
02:02:41,111 --> 02:02:45,460
it's continually represented is that the
individual is the source of moral choice

2282
02:02:46,130 --> 02:02:51,130
and the individual is prone to genuine 
error and temptation in a believable and

2283
02:02:53,361 --> 02:02:58,361
realistic way,
but that that doesn't sever the 

2284
02:02:58,361 --> 02:02:59,510
relationship between the individual and 
the divine.

2285
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:02,510
And the possibility of further growth 
and then I would say,

2286
02:03:02,511 --> 02:03:04,520
well thank God for that because without 
that,

2287
02:03:04,521 --> 02:03:06,290
like who would have a chance,
right?

2288
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:11,350
Who would have a chance?
And so the idea that the daddy as 

2289
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:17,200
presented the infinite,
let's say as presented in the Old 

2290
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:17,200
Testament,
is merely judgmental,

2291
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:17,890
is definitely wrong.
And,

2292
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:21,890
and is in fact something that you can 
contend with and arguing with.

2293
02:03:22,030 --> 02:03:23,480
Oh,
I'll close with one thing.

2294
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:29,380
One of the things that I learned while I
was going through this was the meaning 

2295
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:31,650
of the name Israel because Jacob 
eventually it gets named Israel and,

2296
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:35,060
and I'm jumping ahead a little bit to 
the next lecture,

2297
02:03:35,061 --> 02:03:40,061
but Israel.
And so he's also the father of Israel 

2298
02:03:40,061 --> 02:03:42,230
and the father of the 12 sons who make 
up the 12 tribes of Israel.

2299
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:45,350
But what Israel means is he who 
struggles with God.

2300
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:50,240
And that's such an interesting idea 
because it's again a psychological idea.

2301
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:55,241
And that's why I said earlier that it 
isn't obvious in the old testament what 

2302
02:03:55,241 --> 02:03:55,760
it means to believe in God.

2303
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:57,980
Because what Jacob does a struggle with 
God.

2304
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:03,400
And I think that that's a really good 
characterization of an ethical life 

2305
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,180
because if you're trying to lead an 
ethical life,

2306
02:04:05,181 --> 02:04:10,181
that's what you're doing is you're,
you're struggling like blind belief 

2307
02:04:10,181 --> 02:04:11,690
isn't helpful because you don't know 
what you're believing in,

2308
02:04:11,691 --> 02:04:15,440
like it's just not that helpful.
But if you're possessed by,

2309
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:18,530
by the desire to orient yourself 
properly,

2310
02:04:18,531 --> 02:04:23,531
but also confused by the,
by the existential structure of the 

2311
02:04:23,531 --> 02:04:23,531
world,
which we all are,

2312
02:04:23,531 --> 02:04:28,160
then,
then what you're doing when you're 

2313
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:28,850
trying to orient yourself properly in 
life is struggling ethically.

2314
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:32,510
And Jacob actually gets quite hurt.
He wrestles with God.

2315
02:04:32,511 --> 02:04:35,510
Literally God dislocates his,
his,

2316
02:04:35,810 --> 02:04:38,160
his thigh.
And so know the idea there is

2317
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:39,990
watch the hail out,
right?

2318
02:04:39,991 --> 02:04:43,260
The thing that you're contending with,
his powerful,

2319
02:04:43,261 --> 02:04:46,290
although you can contend with it,
that's the thing that's so interesting,

2320
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:48,780
but you know,
you do it at some genuine peril,

2321
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:52,140
which I think is exactly right.
But the idea that Israel.

2322
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:54,270
So there's Israel,
the state,

2323
02:04:54,271 --> 02:04:56,340
let's say in Israel,
the promised land and all of that,

2324
02:04:56,341 --> 02:04:58,530
but there's this more important idea,
which is again,

2325
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:01,560
a psychological idea,
which is the state of Israel,

2326
02:05:01,561 --> 02:05:06,561
which is the promised land is the state 
that everyone who wrestles with God 

2327
02:05:06,561 --> 02:05:10,980
exists in,
and that's not happy,

2328
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:14,370
naive belief in,
you know,

2329
02:05:14,371 --> 02:05:16,950
uh,
an eternally blessed afterlife.

2330
02:05:16,951 --> 02:05:19,170
It's not that it's not a wish 
fulfillment,

2331
02:05:19,171 --> 02:05:24,171
it's,
it's to be actively engaged in life and 

2332
02:05:24,171 --> 02:05:25,230
the difficulties of life,
right?

2333
02:05:25,410 --> 02:05:30,360
And trying to find the path because 
that's what wrestling with God is trying

2334
02:05:30,361 --> 02:05:31,500
to find the path.

2335
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:36,380
And that seems to me what belief means 
fundamentally in the Old Testament,

2336
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:41,400
perhaps in the new testament as well as 
that belief is expressed in trying to 

2337
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:46,251
find the path.
And that's an ethical struggle and it's 

2338
02:05:46,251 --> 02:05:46,530
a real struggle.
It's the struggle of life.

2339
02:05:46,531 --> 02:05:49,350
So as long as you're willing to engage 
in that struggle,

2340
02:05:49,710 --> 02:05:53,250
then hypothetically you have the divine 
behind you.

2341
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:59,120
And so I believe that.
I think that's true because the other 

2342
02:06:00,241 --> 02:06:04,290
thing I see is that the people who set 
things right,

2343
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:06,060
so the,
the,

2344
02:06:06,061 --> 02:06:07,020
uh,
the,

2345
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:11,360
the horrible forces of cosmic 
destruction don't do us see,

2346
02:06:11,361 --> 02:06:16,361
and the people who are trying to set 
things right are the ones that are 

2347
02:06:16,361 --> 02:06:19,341
struggling ethically and so and that 
there is a redemptive element to that 

2348
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:22,320
and I don't think there's any way of 
being cynical about that.

2349
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:25,870
So.
Well,

2350
02:06:25,890 --> 02:06:26,850
so thank you.
Will.

2351
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:35,560
Thank you.

2352
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:54,930
So remember to speak right into the mic 
because there are all these other people

2353
02:06:54,931 --> 02:06:57,540
watching that will hear it.
Will hear us.

2354
02:06:58,440 --> 02:06:59,250
So.
Okay.

2355
02:07:00,610 --> 02:07:04,000
Hi Dr Peterson.
So with the story of Jacob today,

2356
02:07:04,001 --> 02:07:09,001
there was a theme of betrayal and you 
can see that from the beginning because 

2357
02:07:09,001 --> 02:07:10,900
he was very angry and jealous of his 
brother and I was thinking are there any

2358
02:07:10,901 --> 02:07:13,720
stores or Wakening,
say about betrayal that does come from a

2359
02:07:13,721 --> 02:07:14,800
loved one,
right?

2360
02:07:14,830 --> 02:07:18,340
Where it's not from a place of soul,
black and white of anger,

2361
02:07:18,370 --> 02:07:20,730
resentment and bitter.
And how the parties,

2362
02:07:21,130 --> 02:07:23,560
um,
kind of recover from that.

2363
02:07:23,561 --> 02:07:26,210
Or is there any way to renamed up or is 
it as black and whites?

2364
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:29,240
If you'll be traced on one,
then it's like Jacob where he's.

2365
02:07:29,310 --> 02:07:30,340
He was bitter.
He was born

2366
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,250
hatred.
No,

2367
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:36,280
and in fact,
in this story it's not black and white 

2368
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:36,400
because we know we're only halfway

2369
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:40,990
through it and one of the things I've 
noticed as a clinician,

2370
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:46,050
let's say,
is that an as an observer of people in 

2371
02:07:46,050 --> 02:07:49,111
general,
is that I've never ever seen anyone get 

2372
02:07:49,111 --> 02:07:50,800
away with anything and Jacob doesn't get
away with any of this.

2373
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:54,790
And so,
you know,

2374
02:07:54,791 --> 02:07:59,791
he's humbled by his eventual experiences
and he learns that he did it wrong and 

2375
02:08:00,131 --> 02:08:03,520
there's reconciliation that happens 
throughout the story of Jacob.

2376
02:08:04,090 --> 02:08:09,090
So,
and there's minor betrayals and major 

2377
02:08:09,090 --> 02:08:09,090
betrayals.
You know,

2378
02:08:09,090 --> 02:08:12,601
that some of them have tremendously 
serious consequences in some of them 

2379
02:08:12,601 --> 02:08:16,111
have lesser consequences,
but there is an underlying idea that 

2380
02:08:16,111 --> 02:08:17,470
things can still be set right.
Even though it's.

2381
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:21,970
Well,
I think it takes Jacob some 20 years,

2382
02:08:21,971 --> 02:08:26,320
something like that to set things right.
And even then it's like touch and go.

2383
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:30,070
So if I answer your question,
okay.

2384
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:32,770
Yeah.
Hey,

2385
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:37,380
you speak frequently in your lectures 
about,

2386
02:08:37,470 --> 02:08:42,470
I guess the war between good and evil or
the struggle of life really is a 

2387
02:08:42,470 --> 02:08:47,121
struggle between good and evil being at 
the core of a conscious lived existence 

2388
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:52,610
and I guess on that note,
if you were 100 percent certain that 

2389
02:08:56,581 --> 02:09:01,581
there was no afterlife,
would you still be able to preach that 

2390
02:09:01,581 --> 02:09:02,310
there's a positive meeting in life?

2391
02:09:03,090 --> 02:09:08,090
If you're a 100 percent certain,
some atheists seem to be 100 percent 

2392
02:09:08,090 --> 02:09:10,710
certain and yet they still preach that 
there's some positive meaning to life.

2393
02:09:10,711 --> 02:09:13,490
Would you be one of those or would you 
turn into cane?

2394
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:15,030
You know,
so cynical.

2395
02:09:15,870 --> 02:09:18,660
I think that,
well as far as I'm concerned,

2396
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:23,900
one of the things I learned from 
studying 20th century history is that 

2397
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:27,360
like even if the idea that even if you 
take the most cynical of ideas,

2398
02:09:27,361 --> 02:09:32,361
let's say that life is irredeemable 
suffering and and perhaps isn't even 

2399
02:09:32,361 --> 02:09:37,131
justified because of that.
It still seems to me that you have an 

2400
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:40,170
ethical duty,
let's say,

2401
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:45,570
to live in a manner that reduces that to
the degree that that's possible.

2402
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:49,170
And so,
and I think that that can be experienced

2403
02:09:49,171 --> 02:09:54,171
as meaningful in some sense 
independently of the transcendent 

2404
02:09:54,171 --> 02:09:57,500
context.
Now I don't exactly know how to strip 

2405
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:00,351
off the transcendent context because one
of the things I would say that's 

2406
02:10:00,351 --> 02:10:02,850
happened to me is because I've spent so 
much time looking at the horrible things

2407
02:10:02,851 --> 02:10:06,940
that people have done is that it's like 
young said that he wanted.

2408
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,550
This is one of his famous quotes.
He said,

2409
02:10:08,940 --> 02:10:12,990
no tree can reach up to heaven unless 
its roots reached down to hell.

2410
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:17,760
And so as I've dug deeper into the 
depravity of human beings,

2411
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:22,650
my sense of the possibility of human 
beings has also grown.

2412
02:10:24,210 --> 02:10:29,210
What would you say in proportion and 
until I've become convinced actually 

2413
02:10:29,611 --> 02:10:31,740
that good is a more powerful force than 
evil.

2414
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:34,790
Evil.
Evil is an powerful force.

2415
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:37,490
And so I can't really strip the 
transcended way.

2416
02:10:37,491 --> 02:10:41,270
Now whether what bearing that has on 
eternity say on an afterlife?

2417
02:10:41,271 --> 02:10:42,230
I mean,
I,

2418
02:10:43,030 --> 02:10:44,120
I,
I,

2419
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:47,660
I can't say anything about that.
The only thing I guess I can say is that

2420
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:51,620
there are many things about being that 
we don't understand in the least.

2421
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:56,090
And we don't understand the nature of 
consciousness or the nature of time.

2422
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:58,350
So I,
I'm not,

2423
02:10:58,530 --> 02:11:00,620
I wouldn't despair about that,
but yes,

2424
02:11:00,621 --> 02:11:02,870
I think that life can still be 
meaningful without,

2425
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:06,920
without there being a necessity of an 
afterlife.

2426
02:11:07,190 --> 02:11:11,480
So,
no,

2427
02:11:11,481 --> 02:11:11,940
no,
no,

2428
02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:12,690
no.

2429
02:11:17,530 --> 02:11:21,040
By Dr Peterson.
So since studying your work,

2430
02:11:21,041 --> 02:11:26,041
one of the things that I found most 
fascinating is your analysis of the 

2431
02:11:26,041 --> 02:11:29,380
story of Cain and Abel.
And my question is,

2432
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:31,900
um,
if,

2433
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:37,020
if cain got to the point that he did 
right before a killing his brother 

2434
02:11:38,801 --> 02:11:43,801
murdering his ideal and decided that 
that was something he didn't want to do,

2435
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:48,910
what advice or guidance would you,
would you give a person that got to that

2436
02:11:48,911 --> 02:11:49,180
point?

2437
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:58,430
Well,
there's a story I read called the 

2438
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:04,760
cocktail party.
I've mentioned this before by ts Elliot 

2439
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:07,260
in the cocktail party,
there's a scene to play where this woman

2440
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:11,850
approaches a psychiatrist in and starts 
talking to him about her problems.

2441
02:12:12,180 --> 02:12:14,010
And she said something that surprises 
him.

2442
02:12:14,011 --> 02:12:16,710
She says,
I hope that I'm the problem.

2443
02:12:17,110 --> 02:12:17,760
And he says,
well,

2444
02:12:17,761 --> 02:12:19,650
why would you hope that?
And she says,

2445
02:12:19,651 --> 02:12:20,820
well,
I thought about it a lot.

2446
02:12:20,821 --> 02:12:24,990
And if the world is the problem,
then I'm done because I can't change the

2447
02:12:24,991 --> 02:12:26,460
world.
But if I'm the problem,

2448
02:12:26,461 --> 02:12:31,461
then maybe there's something about 
myself I can change and I can undo this 

2449
02:12:31,461 --> 02:12:35,550
terrible situation that I meant.
And so I would say that's repentance.

2450
02:12:35,551 --> 02:12:38,820
Fundamentally,
it's like there if,

2451
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:44,140
and I say this carefully because I 
understand that people are susceptible 

2452
02:12:44,221 --> 02:12:46,200
to bad fortune.

2453
02:12:48,630 --> 02:12:53,630
Sin and ignorance can make that worse,
but independently of that like good 

2454
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:55,920
people suffer.
Make no mistake about it,

2455
02:12:56,700 --> 02:13:01,700
but if things aren't right for you,
if you're resentful about being because 

2456
02:13:04,921 --> 02:13:09,921
that's the right way,
because that's the deepest way of 

2457
02:13:09,921 --> 02:13:12,831
thinking about.
If you read the writings of the people 

2458
02:13:12,831 --> 02:13:13,410
who do the mass killings for example,
that's what you see over and over.

2459
02:13:13,411 --> 02:13:18,411
It's cane.
It's like they are angry beyond 

2460
02:13:18,411 --> 02:13:21,800
comprehension at the intolerability of 
being and they're angry at God.

2461
02:13:22,350 --> 02:13:23,910
Even if they don't say it exactly like 
that,

2462
02:13:23,911 --> 02:13:26,270
they come so close to saying it like 
that,

2463
02:13:26,271 --> 02:13:28,170
that it's.
There's no difference.

2464
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:35,120
You know what God says?
Cain is look to yourself first before 

2465
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:38,511
you criticize being,
and that strikes me is right.

2466
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:42,720
It's because to not do that as arrogant 
beyond belief.

2467
02:13:42,721 --> 02:13:47,721
That's satanic arrogance.
Literally if something like that can be 

2468
02:13:47,721 --> 02:13:51,381
literal,
it's like don't make yourself the judge 

2469
02:13:51,381 --> 02:13:53,010
of being before you clean up your your 
room,

2470
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:58,310
let's say,
and it because the other thing too is 

2471
02:13:58,310 --> 02:14:03,030
this is something I learned in some part
from soldier Nixon when he was in the 

2472
02:14:03,030 --> 02:14:06,411
prison camps and trying to understand 
how these heroic people he saw could 

2473
02:14:06,411 --> 02:14:06,411
possibly manage it.

2474
02:14:06,411 --> 02:14:11,120
One of the exercises he undertook and he
really viewed this within a Christian 

2475
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:12,900
Orthodox context of Repentance and 
redemption,

2476
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:18,230
is he said he went over his life with a 
fine tooth comb and tried to imagine all

2477
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:24,651
of the ethical mistakes he made in his 
entire life that he knew were mistakes.

2478
02:14:24,841 --> 02:14:25,220
Right?
Hey,

2479
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:27,540
there was.
This was a soul search.

2480
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:32,570
Not,
wasn't relying on external standards of 

2481
02:14:32,570 --> 02:14:33,750
morality except in so far as we're 
inevitably influenced by those.

2482
02:14:34,020 --> 02:14:39,020
And then his idea was,
is there something I could do right now 

2483
02:14:39,020 --> 02:14:41,460
to put that right?
And that's the right question.

2484
02:14:41,461 --> 02:14:46,461
Like if things aren't going your way,
and I think that means that you're 

2485
02:14:46,461 --> 02:14:50,331
resentful and arrogant and deceitful.
Those are the three things that clump 

2486
02:14:50,331 --> 02:14:50,730
together.
I think that that,

2487
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:53,340
that constitute the core of evil at 
something like that.

2488
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:57,390
And so if you're possessed by that,
which is a hell,

2489
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:59,640
then it's repentance.

2490
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:04,640
That's the right answer.
And what that means is you have to 

2491
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:05,340
figure out what you did wrong and you 
have to pay for it,

2492
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:07,920
and then at least you could think,
well look,

2493
02:15:07,921 --> 02:15:12,600
I can try that with all of my soul,
let's say and see what happens.

2494
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:15,030
Right?
It could it be an experiment?

2495
02:15:15,031 --> 02:15:17,190
And then I would also say that that's an
act of faith.

2496
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:22,340
It's an act of faith to conduct that 
experiment because you put yourself on 

2497
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:22,340
the line,
right?

2498
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:24,450
And that's what an act of faith is.
You don't know the outcome,

2499
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:26,100
but you don't know the outcome of your 
life.

2500
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:28,730
So live in some sense as an act of 
faith.

2501
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:32,310
If you're putting faith in something 
that that's why you're moving forward.

2502
02:15:32,311 --> 02:15:34,710
You couldn't move forward without an act
of faith.

2503
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:36,330
You know,
and people say,

2504
02:15:36,331 --> 02:15:41,331
well,
I only move forward on the basis of the 

2505
02:15:41,331 --> 02:15:41,331
fact.
It's like,

2506
02:15:41,331 --> 02:15:44,151
yeah,
but you select the facts and there's an 

2507
02:15:44,151 --> 02:15:44,151
infinity of facts and they don't just 
tell you what to do.

2508
02:15:44,151 --> 02:15:48,270
So it's not a credible answer.
So if you're in that situation,

2509
02:15:48,271 --> 02:15:52,600
it's like look to yourself,
you know,

2510
02:15:52,930 --> 02:15:57,930
and one of the things about soldiers 
nets that's a bloody amazing is that's 

2511
02:15:57,930 --> 02:16:01,161
what he did.
And then he wrote the Gulag archipelago 

2512
02:16:01,161 --> 02:16:03,441
and you know,
he took an ax to the intellectual and 

2513
02:16:03,441 --> 02:16:05,880
moral substructure of,
of the totalitarian communist states.

2514
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:11,450
So while he was redeeming himself,
let's say he was simultaneously 

2515
02:16:11,450 --> 02:16:14,190
redeeming the world and you see 
something like that,

2516
02:16:14,191 --> 02:16:15,720
like you,
you got to wake up,

2517
02:16:15,721 --> 02:16:16,590
man.
That's,

2518
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:22,090
that was really something.
So yeah,

2519
02:16:28,870 --> 02:16:33,870
Dr Peterson,
I have a lot of questions that arise 

2520
02:16:33,870 --> 02:16:33,870
from your comments that the bell for 100
event,

2521
02:16:33,870 --> 02:16:38,401
you.
I'm one of three video your recent 

2522
02:16:38,401 --> 02:16:40,111
discussion with Ayaan Hirsi Ali and your
comments on Islam and the West in 

2523
02:16:40,111 --> 02:16:41,110
general.
And in your comments there's this common

2524
02:16:41,111 --> 02:16:43,420
theme that one of these things is not 
like the other.

2525
02:16:43,421 --> 02:16:47,470
You put the Judeo Christian tradition on
the one side and Islam on the other,

2526
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:52,800
specifically the quote complex problem 
of Islam and the quote as a quote 

2527
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,220
totalizing system.
Before I go further,

2528
02:16:54,221 --> 02:16:58,300
let me state that if hypothetically,
a final analysis of Islam resulted in as

2529
02:16:58,301 --> 02:17:02,110
total denunciation as your analysis of 
postmodernism or neo Marxism,

2530
02:17:02,350 --> 02:17:03,790
I wouldn't be personally offended at 
all.

2531
02:17:03,791 --> 02:17:08,791
This isn't a a personal question.
In your recent interview with ion or 

2532
02:17:08,791 --> 02:17:13,220
shelly,
she said Western values are superior to 

2533
02:17:13,220 --> 02:17:14,080
Islamic law and Islamic values.
I agree with that.

2534
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:15,730
Basically,
certainly in the context of,

2535
02:17:15,731 --> 02:17:17,080
let's say,
current global affairs.

2536
02:17:17,530 --> 02:17:19,450
I'll skip the quote from reason magazine
interview,

2537
02:17:19,451 --> 02:17:24,451
but you should read them because hers is
a worldview which is very much the west 

2538
02:17:24,451 --> 02:17:25,510
versus Islam.
Not Radical Islam,

2539
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:30,570
but Islam,
including necessarily the military 

2540
02:17:30,570 --> 02:17:32,881
option.
So my question is at the level of 

2541
02:17:32,881 --> 02:17:35,161
psychological significance of these 
stories at the level of mythology and 

2542
02:17:35,161 --> 02:17:38,161
archetype,
how Islam so different from thej 

2543
02:17:38,161 --> 02:17:38,650
Christian tradition because Adam,
Adam,

2544
02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:40,240
eve of Satan,
Shaytan,

2545
02:17:40,270 --> 02:17:42,430
so on and so forth.
Everything from the fall to the flood.

2546
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:48,780
A lot of what you've discussed in this 
lecture series is necessarily part of 

2547
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:48,780
Islam as well,
and in fact,

2548
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:53,311
I think one of the strongest criticism 
of Islam is that it's perhaps pretty 

2549
02:17:53,311 --> 02:17:56,101
unoriginal tonight.
You said that the moral presuppositions 

2550
02:17:56,101 --> 02:17:57,970
of a culture and instantiated in its 
stories.

2551
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:01,210
I see a lot of the same stories.
So current global fairs aside,

2552
02:18:01,211 --> 02:18:06,211
I'm asking it the deepest levels.
How different are these stories in the 

2553
02:18:06,211 --> 02:18:06,211
moral presuppositions?

2554
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:07,490
Okay,
well that's,

2555
02:18:07,550 --> 02:18:11,990
that's a killer question.
Well,

2556
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:17,500
okay.
So the first thing I would say is 

2557
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:17,500
fundamentally,
I don't know.

2558
02:18:17,780 --> 02:18:22,780
And so part of the reason that I'm.
One of the things I'm planning to do is 

2559
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:25,430
to have a series of discussions and 
plenty of people have contacted me about

2560
02:18:25,431 --> 02:18:28,340
discussing with Ion Hirsi.
Ali has,

2561
02:18:28,350 --> 02:18:33,350
as you know,
she has powerful and serious fobs and 

2562
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:38,540
they're not happy with her black and 
white distinction.

2563
02:18:39,620 --> 02:18:43,670
And so now I read infidel and I really 
liked that book.

2564
02:18:43,671 --> 02:18:44,390
Like I,
I,

2565
02:18:44,450 --> 02:18:47,150
my sense was that she,
she was a heroin.

2566
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:50,580
Now what that means in relationship to 
Islam,

2567
02:18:50,690 --> 02:18:53,120
that's a different story because she 
came out of a,

2568
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:55,510
uh,
like a,

2569
02:18:55,570 --> 02:19:00,570
a totalitarian,
let's say family structure in a 

2570
02:19:00,570 --> 02:19:04,511
relatively totalitarian society and you 
could make the case that there is a 

2571
02:19:04,671 --> 02:19:07,970
correspondence between that in Islam and
you could make the case that there isn't

2572
02:19:08,030 --> 02:19:13,030
in and of course that's the critical 
issue and so there's a couple of things 

2573
02:19:14,271 --> 02:19:19,271
that I can't wrap my head around with 
hap wrapped my head around easily in 

2574
02:19:19,271 --> 02:19:24,011
relationship to Islam and so one is what
I see as the failure to separate church 

2575
02:19:25,431 --> 02:19:29,060
from state and a problem.

2576
02:19:30,770 --> 02:19:35,770
Now it may not be a problem as such,
but it's certainly a problem in 

2577
02:19:35,770 --> 02:19:39,521
relationship to the relation between 
Islam and the West because we separate 

2578
02:19:39,521 --> 02:19:43,361
church from state now.
There's fundamentalists in the United 

2579
02:19:43,361 --> 02:19:44,150
States,
Christian fundamentalists who think that

2580
02:19:44,151 --> 02:19:48,410
that separation is a mistake.
So it's not only,

2581
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:53,260
it's not only an idea that's rooted in 
Islam that those should be united,

2582
02:19:54,010 --> 02:19:59,010
but it's definitely a problem with 
regards to our coexistence because 

2583
02:19:59,010 --> 02:19:59,560
that's a fundamentally different 
presumption.

2584
02:19:59,860 --> 02:20:01,870
Okay,
so that's problem number one.

2585
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:04,630
Problem number two,
for me,

2586
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:07,210
and again this may be a consequence of 
my ignorance,

2587
02:20:07,211 --> 02:20:12,211
which I'm trying to rectify.
Mohammed was a warlord and I,

2588
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:18,870
I don't know what to do about that fact,
like one thing you can say about Christ 

2589
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:25,560
hypothetically,
let's say I'm not talking about a 

2590
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:27,670
historical reality necessarily,
although I'm not denying it either,

2591
02:20:28,030 --> 02:20:33,030
is that of all the things he was war 
lord was definitely not one of them and 

2592
02:20:34,811 --> 02:20:39,811
I don't know what to do about that and 
so I don't know how to reconcile that 

2593
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:46,960
and I don't know how to reconcile.
Like not only was Mohammed a warlord,

2594
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:51,620
which I don't think is an unreasonable 
thing to proclaim.

2595
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:58,780
The expansion that he initiated was 
unbelievably successful.

2596
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:06,280
I mean within 600 years it was the 
biggest empire the world had ever seen 

2597
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:10,260
and a demolished Byzantine Christianity,
which is something that western people 

2598
02:21:10,260 --> 02:21:11,450
don't even know.
You know,

2599
02:21:11,451 --> 02:21:15,980
I've read thinkers who said that the 
west was so traumatized culturally,

2600
02:21:15,981 --> 02:21:20,840
let's say by the demolition of Byzantine
Christianity that we can't even study it

2601
02:21:20,841 --> 02:21:24,410
now.
And so I don't know if that's true,

2602
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:29,440
but I don't know that it's not true 
either and the Buddhists were wiped out 

2603
02:21:29,961 --> 02:21:32,000
of Afghanistan,
um,

2604
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:37,240
and we saw that echoed in the Taliban's 
destruction of those great Buddhist 

2605
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:38,720
monuments.
And so,

2606
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:44,860
so what I'm hoping is that there's a 
bridge

2607
02:21:46,530 --> 02:21:51,120
there better be a bridge and that's why 
I want to have these discussions because

2608
02:21:51,121 --> 02:21:53,610
I'd like to understand if there's a 
bridge.

2609
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:58,760
And so lots of people have sent me 
people who I should talk to who they 

2610
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:03,171
think represent Islam far better than I 
on her Zellie and perhaps they're 

2611
02:22:03,171 --> 02:22:07,970
correct and hopefully I'll get an 
opportunity to talk to them because I 

2612
02:22:07,970 --> 02:22:11,901
would like to know why I would like to 
know if what I think is wrong because if

2613
02:22:12,111 --> 02:22:14,580
it's wrong,
it's important that I know it's wrong.

2614
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:19,620
But at the moment I don't a,
I don't know what's wrong.

2615
02:22:19,621 --> 02:22:21,810
And B,
I don't see.

2616
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:31,100
I'm not sure what it signifies.
So.

2617
02:22:31,190 --> 02:22:33,350
And I don't think anyone is sure.
Right?

2618
02:22:33,351 --> 02:22:38,351
Because we have this entangled 
entangling of the civilizations.

2619
02:22:39,430 --> 02:22:40,700
You know,
when there's other things too,

2620
02:22:40,701 --> 02:22:44,090
like I'm not very happy with the Saudi 
Arabs in the wall.

2621
02:22:44,091 --> 02:22:47,880
Hobbies,
I don't think there are allies.

2622
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:53,970
I don't see how any Western woman can 
possibly think that there are allies and

2623
02:22:53,971 --> 02:22:58,971
I'm not happy with the fact that the 
petro dollars that we send them are 

2624
02:22:58,971 --> 02:23:02,360
transformed in substantial part into the
kind of propaganda that's definitely a 

2625
02:23:04,711 --> 02:23:09,090
threat to the west and I'm not very 
happy with the fact that our politicians

2626
02:23:09,690 --> 02:23:13,470
appear stupidly blind to that.
Now.

2627
02:23:13,471 --> 02:23:16,020
That may again be a consequence of my 
ignorance.

2628
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:20,210
It's certainly possible,
but those are the sorts of things that

2629
02:23:22,510 --> 02:23:27,510
that I can't reconcile.
And so you know,

2630
02:23:29,740 --> 02:23:34,740
I've seen.
I've also seen parallels between the 

2631
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:35,990
ideas that I'm presenting here and other
religious traditions,

2632
02:23:35,991 --> 02:23:38,210
Taoism,
Buddhism,

2633
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:43,480
Hinduism.
It's harder for me to bridge the gap 

2634
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:46,421
with Islam and I'm not sure why that is.
I think it has something to do with the 

2635
02:23:46,421 --> 02:23:49,850
things that I just laid out now.
What I don't know about Islam would feel

2636
02:23:49,851 --> 02:23:54,851
very many volumes,
many of which I have sitting on my 

2637
02:23:54,851 --> 02:23:55,160
shelves at home right now because I want
to do the reading,

2638
02:23:55,190 --> 02:23:57,590
you know,
as I progressed through this,

2639
02:23:57,591 --> 02:23:57,980
but

2640
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:04,060
Yep,

2641
02:24:10,850 --> 02:24:13,700
Dr Pearson.
Thanks for continuing this series.

2642
02:24:14,030 --> 02:24:17,840
Even as atheists appreciate the 
interaction and the,

2643
02:24:17,841 --> 02:24:19,220
uh,
the,

2644
02:24:19,221 --> 02:24:20,930
uh,
conversation.

2645
02:24:21,560 --> 02:24:26,560
I wanted to ask you something that is 
both emotional and analytical because 

2646
02:24:27,291 --> 02:24:32,291
oftentimes you're basically pegged as 
seeing things very analytically.

2647
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:36,830
So you were talking earlier about,
um,

2648
02:24:38,390 --> 02:24:39,890
you were talking about the,
the,

2649
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:44,920
the,
the juxtaposition between happiness and 

2650
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:46,440
um,
uh,

2651
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:49,910
honor even though I don't think they're 
mutually exclusive personally,

2652
02:24:49,911 --> 02:24:54,911
but if there's a situation,
let's say someone is truly in love with 

2653
02:24:56,121 --> 02:24:59,000
someone else and they loved them for 
many years and decades.

2654
02:24:59,420 --> 02:25:04,420
They have a whole history together and 
then someone and then one of the people 

2655
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:06,890
in this grouping,
um,

2656
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:12,580
start falling in love with someone else.
So it's not that there's less love for 

2657
02:25:14,331 --> 02:25:19,331
the original partner.
How analytically and emotionally do you 

2658
02:25:20,660 --> 02:25:24,160
take care of a situation like that when 
you feel

2659
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:27,460
that you want to stay honorable and be 
happy?

2660
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:33,600
Okay.
So the first thing I would say is the 

2661
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:33,600
devil's always in the details,
right?

2662
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:38,071
So one of the things that I'm not happy 
about with much modern moral theorizing 

2663
02:25:40,091 --> 02:25:45,091
is that it takes a story like that and 
then tries to extract out a general 

2664
02:25:45,821 --> 02:25:50,821
moral principle and often that's 
impossible because the particulars of 

2665
02:25:50,921 --> 02:25:54,700
the situation are very important.
But having said that,

2666
02:25:55,550 --> 02:25:57,520
all right,
so let me think about that for a minute.

2667
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:03,840
I'm not sure that it's possible to be 
honorable in a situation like that 

2668
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:07,471
because I think that you've acted out 
the violation already and having acted 

2669
02:26:07,991 --> 02:26:11,770
out the violation to confess it might be
the right thing to do,

2670
02:26:11,771 --> 02:26:14,320
although perhaps not,
you know,

2671
02:26:14,321 --> 02:26:19,321
because if you.
It isn't obvious to me that if you'd be 

2672
02:26:19,321 --> 02:26:20,140
trained someone then you get to have the
right to tell them about it.

2673
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:22,720
I know,
I know you're not,

2674
02:26:22,721 --> 02:26:24,740
I understand that.
Yeah.

2675
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:26,230
Yeah,
I understand.

2676
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:27,880
I understand.
Um,

2677
02:26:30,910 --> 02:26:35,910
my observation has been that if there's 
a tight relationship and if one party 

2678
02:26:36,401 --> 02:26:38,230
has betrayed by the other in that 
manner,

2679
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:42,430
that it's almost always irreconcilable.
It breaks it.

2680
02:26:43,490 --> 02:26:45,160
And,
you know,

2681
02:26:45,161 --> 02:26:50,161
I've,
I've helped people try to struggle 

2682
02:26:50,161 --> 02:26:51,961
through that bone on both sides of it.
The person who was betrayed and the 

2683
02:26:51,961 --> 02:26:52,910
person who did the betrayal,
um,

2684
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:55,780
I've seen people grow up and not do it 
again.

2685
02:26:55,781 --> 02:26:58,420
And this was in situations where their 
partner didn't know.

2686
02:26:58,930 --> 02:27:03,930
And in a couple of those situations it 
seemed to me that it might've even been 

2687
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:06,640
unnecessary learning experience for the 
person who did it,

2688
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:07,330
you know,
it,

2689
02:27:07,390 --> 02:27:09,430
it,
it helped them develop.

2690
02:27:09,610 --> 02:27:14,350
That doesn't mean I'm justifying it,
but life is complicated.

2691
02:27:14,710 --> 02:27:19,710
But,
but I think that society works better.

2692
02:27:20,761 --> 02:27:22,290
All things considered

2693
02:27:23,180 --> 02:27:25,370
when you make a promise and you stick to
it.

2694
02:27:26,060 --> 02:27:28,670
And one of the things I learned from 
reading young,

2695
02:27:28,671 --> 02:27:30,230
which,
which I really liked was,

2696
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,900
you know,
he believed that he had his affairs too.

2697
02:27:35,901 --> 02:27:38,420
So you might think about it as somewhat 
hypocritical,

2698
02:27:38,421 --> 02:27:43,421
but,
but I think that people can make 

2699
02:27:43,421 --> 02:27:45,140
mistakes without having what they think 
necessarily be wrong.

2700
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:50,620
You know,
he said that there were things in a 

2701
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:50,620
marriage that you can't have unless 
you're all in.

2702
02:27:51,590 --> 02:27:53,630
And I believe that.
I believe that.

2703
02:27:53,960 --> 02:27:57,830
And so if there's a back door open or 
the like to begin with,

2704
02:27:57,860 --> 02:28:02,860
or a backdoor opens,
then I think that there's something 

2705
02:28:02,860 --> 02:28:03,740
about the relationship that is lacking 
at least,

2706
02:28:03,741 --> 02:28:05,840
and I think you pay a big price for 
that.

2707
02:28:06,740 --> 02:28:11,740
So I mean it depends on whether you 
regard to marriage as a practical 

2708
02:28:11,740 --> 02:28:15,060
arrangement or a spiritual arrangement.
Now really it's both,

2709
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:16,860
you know,
both are important,

2710
02:28:17,970 --> 02:28:21,090
but if it's a spiritual arrangement or a
psychological arrangement above,

2711
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:27,340
then I do think that you don't get the 
transformation without being all in.

2712
02:28:28,220 --> 02:28:33,220
And if you violate it,
then even if you can work it out with 

2713
02:28:33,220 --> 02:28:36,491
your partner,
there's something that you will never 

2714
02:28:36,491 --> 02:28:37,010
get as a consequence.
So.

2715
02:28:38,110 --> 02:28:38,240
Yup.

2716
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:47,030
Last question.
Okay.

2717
02:28:47,460 --> 02:28:49,820
I hope I'll make this good.
Thanks.

2718
02:28:49,830 --> 02:28:54,830
Also for continuing to electric series.
I haven't listened to all of the 

2719
02:28:54,830 --> 02:28:56,190
lectures,
but it seems like you focus very much on

2720
02:28:56,250 --> 02:29:00,510
the appeal of the biblical stories to 
the individual psychology.

2721
02:29:01,290 --> 02:29:06,290
Do you have any thoughts on the relative
importance of crowd psychology to the 

2722
02:29:06,290 --> 02:29:10,570
appeal instinct,
power of the Bible and also the the 

2723
02:29:10,570 --> 02:29:13,520
reason why the Bible or the biblical 
stories took precedence over other 

2724
02:29:13,710 --> 02:29:16,020
ideologies which could have taken its 
place?

2725
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:17,420
Okay.
Well,

2726
02:29:17,421 --> 02:29:19,370
let's go to the second one first.

2727
02:29:25,630 --> 02:29:30,630
I think it's the same thing that happens
when someone both creates an edits,

2728
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:36,870
a great movie.
It's no one knows like imagine how many 

2729
02:29:37,661 --> 02:29:39,040
choices are there,
integrate movie.

2730
02:29:39,041 --> 02:29:44,041
Let's say it's an animated movie because
absolutely everything in an animated 

2731
02:29:44,041 --> 02:29:46,900
movie as constructed everything.
There's God only knows how many choices.

2732
02:29:46,901 --> 02:29:51,901
Like maybe there's millions of choices 
and each choice is guided by some 

2733
02:29:53,230 --> 02:29:58,230
intuition of narrative suitability or 
beauty or there's some higher ideal 

2734
02:29:58,930 --> 02:30:00,760
motivating it,
right?

2735
02:30:00,790 --> 02:30:03,330
The desire to produce a masterpiece.
Maybe that's it.

2736
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:05,260
That was certainly the case with the 
Disney movies,

2737
02:30:05,261 --> 02:30:10,261
for example,
and so that that aspiration then then 

2738
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:13,720
makes the decisions and so I would say,
well,

2739
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:19,560
something like that guided the writing 
and the selection of the stories in the 

2740
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:24,391
biblical Canon now could have there been
other stories included while the 

2741
02:30:24,971 --> 02:30:29,971
Catholics and the Protestants don't have
the same biblical tradition and neither 

2742
02:30:29,971 --> 02:30:33,361
do the Jews and the Christians and so it
isn't exactly clear what to make of 

2743
02:30:33,361 --> 02:30:33,880
that,
you know,

2744
02:30:34,090 --> 02:30:39,090
I mean that's a can in some sense,
to the discussion we just had about 

2745
02:30:39,090 --> 02:30:42,961
Islam and Christianity are in some sense
I've left that aside,

2746
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:50,490
that specific question except in so far 
as I've just answered because I'm trying

2747
02:30:50,491 --> 02:30:55,491
to take what we have,
which I know is at the root of our 

2748
02:30:55,491 --> 02:30:56,370
culture and to figure out what it is 
that we have,

2749
02:30:57,090 --> 02:30:58,710
why it is that we have at.

2750
02:31:00,690 --> 02:31:05,690
Well,
I made some attempt to explain that in 

2751
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:07,110
the manner that I just described,
but I don't have a final answer.

2752
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:08,790
I could.
It have been different.

2753
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:13,550
It could have been different at some 
levels,

2754
02:31:13,551 --> 02:31:15,520
but the same at others.
You know,

2755
02:31:15,530 --> 02:31:20,100
I mean one of the things that scholars 
of comparative religion who haven't been

2756
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:24,600
infected fatally with postmodernism have
definitely realized so young,

2757
02:31:24,601 --> 02:31:29,601
for example,
in Eliana and people who are interested 

2758
02:31:29,601 --> 02:31:30,930
in grand narratives.
One of the things they pointed out quite

2759
02:31:30,931 --> 02:31:32,520
clearly is that there's,
there's,

2760
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:37,560
there's a set of common mythological 
themes across many cultures and I tried 

2761
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:41,220
to outline that in maps of meaning and 
that that worked out quite nicely for me

2762
02:31:41,221 --> 02:31:46,221
at least as far as I was concerned 
because once I had the basic 

2763
02:31:46,221 --> 02:31:48,951
architectural structure mapped out,
it opened up all sorts of stories to me 

2764
02:31:48,951 --> 02:31:51,240
from all sorts of different cultures and
that's been unbelievably useful.

2765
02:31:51,241 --> 02:31:54,440
Like the Mesopotamian story of it.
The enuma elish when,

2766
02:31:54,490 --> 02:31:57,060
when I figured out what that meant as 
far as I was concerned,

2767
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:01,470
like I've never forgotten that.
It just seared itself into my memory.

2768
02:32:01,471 --> 02:32:04,290
And the same with the Egyptian stories 
and you know,

2769
02:32:04,380 --> 02:32:06,410
some Buddhist writings that I've read in
some.

2770
02:32:06,610 --> 02:32:11,610
The Tao Te Ching is also very powerful.
So I think that things can be different 

2771
02:32:11,821 --> 02:32:16,821
on one level and the same at another,
but that humanity kind of coalesces on 

2772
02:32:16,821 --> 02:32:21,141
what's the same over a reasonable period
of time because there isn't that many 

2773
02:32:21,141 --> 02:32:25,611
ways that human beings can live properly
as individuals and as groups together.

2774
02:32:26,870 --> 02:32:31,870
And so there's this constant force that 
makes our ethical presuppositions 

2775
02:32:31,870 --> 02:32:34,800
converge and then that's automatically 
expressed in the stories.

2776
02:32:35,370 --> 02:32:40,370
It's something like that now.
It's an imperfect process and it's full 

2777
02:32:40,370 --> 02:32:40,370
of error.
So.

2778
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:42,750
Yep.

2779
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:48,690
Thank you.

2780
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:53,880
Just one announcement.
Well two announcements.

2781
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,310
The next lecture I believe is November 
14th,

2782
02:32:56,311 --> 02:32:58,740
so I'll hopefully finish off the story 
of Jacob.

2783
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:03,800
Looks like it.
And then I'm also appearing on a panel 

2784
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:06,210
with Gad,
Saad and slash or an amateur on November

2785
02:33:06,211 --> 02:33:11,211
11th.
And there's still quite a few tickets 

2786
02:33:11,211 --> 02:33:13,791
available for that.
So if you're interested you could go to 

2787
02:33:13,791 --> 02:33:14,460
my website and pick up those tickets.
So it should be.

2788
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:16,470
Well,
hopefully it'll be interesting.

2789
02:33:16,471 --> 02:33:19,200
I think it will be and it might be too 
interesting.

2790
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:23,190
That's one possibility.
So we'll see.

2791
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:28,260
But I'm going to do two more of these 
this year and I hope I get through the 

2792
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:30,450
story of Joseph and then I can start in 
the new year with,

2793
02:33:30,670 --> 02:33:35,670
with exodus,
and that's a story that I know quite 

2794
02:33:35,670 --> 02:33:37,100
well and the exodus and leviticus and 
what's the one after that?

2795
02:33:37,110 --> 02:33:38,690
Um,
yes.

2796
02:33:38,700 --> 02:33:39,520
Thank you.
Um,

2797
02:33:39,930 --> 02:33:44,930
so I'm very much looking forward to that
because that is one killer story 

2798
02:33:44,930 --> 02:33:44,930
mountain.
So,

2799
02:33:44,930 --> 02:33:44,960
and,
uh,

2800
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:47,070
I've got some surprises for that as 
well.

2801
02:33:47,071 --> 02:33:50,190
So anyways,
thank you very much for coming and,

2802
02:33:50,191 --> 02:33:52,470
uh,
hopefully we'll see you November 14th.
