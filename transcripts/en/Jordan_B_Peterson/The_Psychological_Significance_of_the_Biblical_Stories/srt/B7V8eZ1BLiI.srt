1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,890
Yeah,

2
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,620
that's a hell of a welcome for someone 
who's going to talk about the Bible.

3
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,550
So I thought I would get farther than 
through genesis by the,

4
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,750
by this point,
but I'm,

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,830
I'm not unhappy about the pace either.
I've learned a tremendous amount and so 

6
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,280
hopefully what we'll do today is finish 
genesis completely.

7
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,220
And then I think I'll try to start up 
with exodus in me depending on what 

8
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:57,850
happens next year.
I have a busy travel schedule,

9
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,130
but I would really like to do it.
I really liked the exodus story and I 

10
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,130
understand it very well.
A lot of the stories in genesis,

11
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:08,150
especially after the first few stories 
say up to the Tower of Babel,

12
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,130
I had to do a tremendous amount of 
learning about,

13
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:13,040
which is really good,
but I do know the exodus story,

14
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,770
so I'm really looking forward to that.
So.

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,760
So let's dive right into it and see how 
far we can get today.

16
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,380
So we'll review first.
So Joseph's father is Jacob and Jacob is

17
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,090
the patriarch of Israel essentially that
the father of the 12 tribes.

18
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,310
And,
um,

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,700
we,
we,

20
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:37,460
you might remember that,
uh,

21
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,410
he had a very morally ambivalent pathway
through life and it's one of the things 

22
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:52,850
that I think so interesting about the 
stories in the,

23
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:58,230
in the Old Testament is that these so 
called patriarchal figures are very 

24
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:05,051
realistic and it's something that I was 
over being struck by that counts in the 

25
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:10,211
new testament that way.
There's lots of things that Christ does 

26
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,430
that you'd think would have been edited 
out over time and sanitized,

27
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:18,431
but they're not.
The Old Testament is definitely not a 

28
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:18,431
book that's been sanitized.
And that's,

29
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:19,400
it's quite interesting that that's the 
case.

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
So you sort of see people with all their
flaws and I've been trying to also 

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,900
derive some general conclusions about 
the moral of the story of the genesis 

32
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:38,261
stories and because these stories are 
fundamentally moral and moral as far as 

33
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:39,740
I'm concerned,
has to do with action,

34
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:39,980
right?

35
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,980
Because moral decisions are the 
decisions that you make when you're 

36
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,481
structuring action.
When you decide to do one thing or 

37
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,870
another,
generally want to do things that are the

38
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:55,070
best things that you can think of to do.
And hence good,

39
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,100
but sometimes you also want to do things
that are the worst things you can do,

40
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,910
you know,
because you're,

41
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,880
or resentful or bitter.
And so the moral decisions that you make

42
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,030
that govern your actions are really the 
most important decisions that you make 

43
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,960
in your life.
And it's not that easy to figure out how

44
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:15,961
to make moral decisions.
We don't have an unerring technology for

45
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:21,961
that the same way as we do for say,
making decisions about empirical 

46
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,800
reality,
which in some ways seem a lot simpler,

47
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,260
um,
partly because we can work collectively 

48
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,100
at it partly because we have a rigorous 
methodology for deciding what's true and

49
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:30,730
what's not.

50
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,080
So one of the things that's really 
struck me,

51
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,950
like it's an overarching theme,
I would say that emerges out of genesis,

52
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,850
especially after the really ancient 
stories say,

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,720
especially after the stories of Cain and
Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel.

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,360
When you get to the accounts of the 
historically for historically real 

55
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:03,931
people,
one injunction seems to be get the hell 

56
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,530
out there and do something.
You know what?

57
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,310
One of the major themes for all of the 
Patriarchs that we've talked about,

58
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:17,311
Abraham,
say Jacob and Joseph is move out into 

59
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,910
the world regardless of the 
circumstances at hand.

60
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,410
Now that's in,
in,

61
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,990
in the Old Testament stories that's 
basically portrayed as hearkening to the

62
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:30,760
voice of God.
Something like that.

63
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,970
Maybe you could think about that as 
destiny or psychological calling.

64
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,910
Um,
and the funny thing too is,

65
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:41,911
is that it's not that these people have 
an easy time of it when they heed that 

66
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:41,911
call.

67
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,130
So what's,
what's fascinating is that they often 

68
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,710
run into extreme difficulties right 
away.

69
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,500
And I think that's very interesting.
First of all,

70
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:54,220
because life is obviously full of 
extreme difficulties.

71
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,850
And second,
it's another example of the failure to 

72
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,240
sugarcoat things,
which is one of the things I think makes

73
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:05,800
a mockery of antireligious theories that
are even quite sophisticated say,

74
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:09,130
like Freud,
because Freud thought of religion as a,

75
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,530
as a wish fulfillment essentially.
And,

76
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,080
and also marks who thought about 
religion is the opiate of the masses.

77
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:22,081
It's if those were true.
It seems to me that there'd be a lot 

78
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,390
more wish and a lot less reality,
a lot less stark,

79
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,710
harsh reality.
No,

80
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,980
I mean the first thing that Abraham 
encounters is a famine and then he has 

81
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:38,251
to hide his wife and then he.
He basically journeys into a tyranny,

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,930
so that's about as bad as it gets in 
some ways,

83
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:45,820
and those themes recur continually and 
no one ever lives where they're supposed

84
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:50,821
to live.
They leave and live in Canaan and not 

85
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:50,821
the promised land,
and so it's a pretty rough.

86
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:55,800
It's pretty rough series of stories,
but the fundamental idea is something 

87
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:55,990
like

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,500
there's no time for sitting around.
There's time to go out into the world 

89
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,020
and engage,
and then there's.

90
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,400
There's hints about the proper and 
improper ways of engaging right?

91
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,520
So clearly the improper way to engage 
is,

92
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,610
I think,
most clearly delineated in the Cain and 

93
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,491
Abel Story and with Kane exemplifying 
the inappropriate way to engage with the

94
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:25,550
world and that's to engage with the 
world in a bitter,

95
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,640
jealous and resentful manner.
Now,

96
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:32,030
one of the things that I really liked 
about Cain and Abel story and that theme

97
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:35,450
recurs continually with the,
with the duality of the brothers,

98
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:35,880
right?
There's,

99
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,930
there's constant conflict between a 
perspective that's essentially like 

100
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,770
canes and uh,
and the,

101
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,730
and the opposite perspective,
which all,

102
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,090
which I'll get to in a minute,
but Cain sees that the world is a very 

103
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,030
tragic place and that the rewards are 
distributed unfairly and that there are 

104
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,740
people who do better and people who do 
worse,

105
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,980
and as a consequence of that,
he becomes bitter and resentful and 

106
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,450
curses God and then he becomes 
homicidal.

107
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,450
Fratricidal which is even worse than he 
destroys his own ideal than his 

108
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,650
descendants basically become genocidal,
something like that.

109
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,210
So that seems to be the wrong way to go 
about things,

110
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,540
you know,
unless your goal is to make things 

111
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,821
worse.
Like it's not like it has a limited 

112
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,750
number of things,
has nothing to object to.

113
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,230
He's got plenty to object to.
His situation actually is bad.

114
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,800
He's overshadowed terribly by his 
brother who everyone loves,

115
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,560
who does extraordinarily well and who's 
good at everything.

116
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,420
And the story is a bit ambivalent about 
the reasons for keynes failure,

117
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,030
although a fair bit of it's laid out his
own feet,

118
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,120
but he's definitely failing and so you 
can understand why he would have this 

119
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,620
terrible attitude.
But the problem is all it does is make 

120
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,161
it worse.
So it doesn't seem to be one of the 

121
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:57,680
things I've also learned as a 
psychologist,

122
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,210
sort of pondering these sorts of things.

123
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,220
It's often a lot easier to identify what
you shouldn't do then what you should 

124
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,280
do.
Like it's.

125
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,950
I think evil is easier to identify than 
good.

126
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,520
I think good is trickier,
but evil stands out to some degree and 

127
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,541
then at least you can say if you're 
trying to get as far away from that as 

128
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,361
possible,
we could even say just for practical 

129
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:21,821
reasons so your life doesn't become hell
and your family life doesn't become 

130
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:25,181
hell.
At least you could get as far away from 

131
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:27,641
that as possible.
Even if you weren't able to conjure up 

132
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,150
what would constitute the good as an 
Ame,

133
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:32,180
you could at least avoid those sorts of 
pitfalls.

134
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:37,181
And I do also think that it's pitfalls 
like that that really threatened our 

135
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:37,181
society right now.
You know,

136
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:41,741
that I see a tremendous rise in 
resentment fueling almost all of the 

137
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:47,231
political polarization that's taking 
place seems unfortunate given that by 

138
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:51,851
and large,
everyone on the planet is richer than 

139
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:51,851
they've ever been.
Now,

140
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,480
that doesn't mean there's no disparity.
There's,

141
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:55,710
but there's always disparity.
Anyways,

142
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,280
Jacob,

143
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,160
of course,
Jacob and Rebecca,

144
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:02,520
the deceiver,
Esau and Jacob ends up with,

145
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,520
with,
uh,

146
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,050
with Isaac's blessing.
And so that's,

147
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,380
that's a moral catastrophe.
And then he has to run because his 

148
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,680
brother wants to kill him.
And so that's the fratricidal motif.

149
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,790
Again.
I liked that too.

150
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,040
I think that's really realistic.
You know,

151
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,650
one of the things that Freud noted 
constantly,

152
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,750
and this is where Freud really is a 
genius,

153
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:29,751
is that the most intense hatreds and 
also sometimes the most intense love is 

154
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,290
within families.
You know,

155
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,210
when in the Freudian world of 
psychopathology,

156
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,890
it's all,
it's all inside the family.

157
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,950
And in fact,
the pathology in the Freudian world is 

158
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,370
actually the fact that it's all inside 
the family because people who get 

159
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,520
tangled up in the Freudian familial 
nightmare,

160
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:55,521
which is roughly to in structure,
can only conceptualize the world in 

161
00:09:55,531 --> 00:10:00,531
terms of their familial relationships 
that they've been so damaged by the 

162
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:04,041
enmeshment and the trauma and the deceit
and the betrayal and the blurred lines 

163
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:08,511
and all of that,
that they just can't expand past the 

164
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:08,820
family and go out in the world.

165
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,650
So the idea that brothers can be at each
other's throats,

166
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,130
I think is out.
It's a very powerful idea and it's not 

167
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,860
something that people like to think 
about.

168
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,460
So,
so Jacob has to leave and it's not 

169
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,460
surprising because mean what he did was 
pretty reprehensible.

170
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,380
He betrayed his brother,
but nonetheless,

171
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:32,610
he's the person who dreams of the ladder
that Unites Heaven and earth.

172
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,750
And that's a very perverse thing.
You know what?

173
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,970
One of the things I think it does is 
give.

174
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,420
In some sense,
it gives hope to everyone because it 

175
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,420
isn't,
you know,

176
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,380
if only the good guys when we're really 
in trouble,

177
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,340
right?
Because it's not that easy to be a good 

178
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,340
guy,
it's,

179
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,820
it's,
it's really not that easy and most 

180
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,920
people are pretty keenly aware of all 
the ways that they fall short,

181
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,950
even have their own ideals,
and so if there was no hope except for 

182
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,900
the good guys,
almost all of us would be lost.

183
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,440
And so that's one of the things I really
liked and was more surprised about with 

184
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,941
the old testament stories is that these 
people are very complex lives and they 

185
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:18,591
make very major moral errors by anyone's
standard and yet and yet the overall 

186
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,191
message is still hopeful and the message
that runs contrary to the message of 

187
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:28,230
evil say that message of good is 
something like,

188
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,260
well,
there's a lot of emphasis on faith.

189
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Right?
And that's a tough one because cynics,

190
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,650
people who are cynical about religious 
structures like to think of faith as the

191
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:48,381
willingness to demolish your intellect 
in the service of superstition and well,

192
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,470
there's something to be said for that 
perspective,

193
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,370
but not a lot

194
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,640
because the reality is much more 
sophisticated.

195
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:02,641
Part of the faith that's,
that is being insisted upon in the old 

196
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:07,501
testament is something like,
and I'm speaking psychologically here 

197
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,730
again,
that it's useful to pause it.

198
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:10,840
A hi.
Hi.

199
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:12,850
Good to aim at.
So,

200
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,130
and I,
I really think that's practically useful

201
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,860
to the research we've done with the 
future authoring program,

202
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,960
for example,
indicates pretty clearly that if you get

203
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:23,710
people to conceptualize an ideal and a 
balanced ideal,

204
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:25,990
you know,
so what do you want for your family?

205
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:28,660
What do you want for your career?
What do you want for your education?

206
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,550
What do you want for your character 
development?

207
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:33,340
How are you going to use your time 
outside of work?

208
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:38,810
Um,
how are you going to structure your use 

209
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,520
of drugs and alcohol and places where 
you might get impulsive?

210
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,290
How can you avoid falling into a 
horrible path?

211
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,290
If you really think that through and you
come up with an integrated ideal and 

212
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:47,290
you,
you put it above us,

213
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,080
something to reach for,
then you're more committed to the world 

214
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:57,760
in a positive way and you're less 
tormented by anxiety and uncertainty.

215
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,220
And so.
And that makes sense,

216
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:05,221
right?
Because here you are alive and 

217
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,170
everything,
and so unless you were Cape,

218
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,270
if you're not capable of manifesting 
some positive relationship with the fact

219
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,271
of your being,
then how could that be anything other 

220
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:18,241
than hellish because it would just be 
anxiety provoking and terrible because 

221
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:21,040
you're vulnerable and there'd be nothing
useful or worthwhile to do.

222
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,750
Well,
that's just not.

223
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,690
I just can't see that as a winning 
strategy for anyone.

224
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,900
You can make a rational case for 
adopting that strategy in that you know,

225
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,320
you can say,
well,

226
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:36,130
there's no evidence for for a 
transcendent morality or for an ultimate

227
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:36,460
meaning.

228
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,460
There's no hard empirical evidence,
but it seems to me that there's 

229
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,310
existential evidence as well that has to
be taken into account.

230
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,580
And of course psychologists have talked 
about this a lot.

231
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
I'm Carl Rogers,
for example,

232
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,570
in human for that matter.
Freud,

233
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:57,571
for that matter,
most of the great psychologists have 

234
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:57,571
pointed out that,
you know,

235
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:01,260
you can derive reasonable information 
that's solid from your own experience,

236
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:06,391
especially if you also talked to other 
people and you can kind of see in your 

237
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:07,390
own life when you're on a productive 
path.

238
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,650
It sort of ennobles and enlightens you 
or a destructive path and I think it's 

239
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:18,511
kind of useful to think that maybe the 
dichotomy between those two paths might 

240
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:19,990
be real,
you know,

241
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,320
and,
and because that also allows you to give

242
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,890
credence to your intuitions about that 
sort of thing.

243
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,120
But I don't anyways,
I don't think it's unreasonable to pause

244
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:35,121
it,
that since you're alive adopting the 

245
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,251
highest possible regard for the fact 
that you're alive and that you're 

246
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:39,580
surrounded by other creatures that are 
alive.

247
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,390
I just can't see how that can possibly 
be construed as a losing strategy.

248
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,570
And so that's the first.
So that's something like faith,

249
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:47,350
right?
It's faith,

250
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,650
it's not,
it's not only faith in your being but 

251
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,930
it's faith in being such.
And the faith would be something like if

252
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:58,931
you could orient your being properly,
then maybe that would orient you with 

253
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,030
being as such.
And you never know.

254
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,770
Like,
I mean it might be true.

255
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,030
There's no reason to assume that it 
wouldn't be true.

256
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,060
I mean,
even if you just take a strict 

257
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,531
biological perspective on this and think
about us as the product of three and a 

258
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:18,491
half billion years of evolution,
I mean we have struggled over all those 

259
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:22,880
billions of years to be alive and to 
match ourselves with reality.

260
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,000
And so because one of the things I've 
often wondered is,

261
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,310
you know,
life is definitely difficult.

262
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,400
There's no doubt about that and it's 
unfair and there's inequality and all of

263
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:34,250
those things and people are subject to 
all sorts of terrible things.

264
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:39,251
But I also wonder if you weren't 
actively striving to make things worse,

265
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,170
just how much better could they be?
You know,

266
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,180
because people are very.
They're like houses that are divided 

267
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,180
amongst themselves.
They're pointing in different directions

268
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:58,181
at the same time.
They're working at cross purposes to 

269
00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:01,271
themselves because of bitterness and 
resentment and an unprocessed memories 

270
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:06,080
and childhood hatreds and unexamined 
assumptions,

271
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:11,081
all sorts of things.
And you just gotTa wonder if you could 

272
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:13,100
push that aside and orient yourself 
properly.

273
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:18,101
And then the other thing that of course 
is stressed very heavily in the old 

274
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:22,241
testament and of course that goes 
through the entire biblical corpus is 

275
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:26,360
that it's not only enough to establish a
positive relationship with being,

276
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:30,110
which I think is the essential,
it's a good description of faith.

277
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,330
You have to make that decision,
right?

278
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:37,331
Because being is very ambivalent and you
can make the case that maybe it's 

279
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,540
something that should have never 
happened,

280
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,240
but that doesn't seem to be productive 
to me.

281
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:46,241
And faith seems to be,
I'm going to act as if being is 

282
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:48,710
ultimately justifiable and that if I 
partake in it properly,

283
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,230
I will improve it rather than making it 
worse.

284
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,810
So I think that's the statement of 
faith.

285
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,840
And then what seems to go along with 
that is something like truth in 

286
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,980
conception,
inaction.

287
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,330
You know,
even people like Jacob who are pretty 

288
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,551
damn morally ambivalent to begin with,
get hammered a lot by what they go 

289
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:11,150
through.
And what seems to happen is that they're

290
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:13,430
hammered into some sort of ethical 
shape,

291
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,490
right?
So by the mid point of their life's 

292
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,160
journey,
there are people who are solidly planted

293
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,460
who you can trust and who don't be trey 
being or themselves or their fellow man.

294
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,520
And so it's an interesting.
I mean it seems reasonable to me to 

295
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:37,601
first assume that you have to establish 
a relationship with something that's 

296
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:39,500
transcendent.
It might even be just the future version

297
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:44,501
of you and then second that you have to 
align yourself with reality in a 

298
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:49,560
truthful manner and that that's your 
best bet and

299
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,590
the biblical stories are actually quite 
realistic about that too because they 

300
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,450
don't really say that if you do that,
you're going to be instantly transported

301
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:02,370
to the promised land.
Like even Moses,

302
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:03,870
as we'll find out in the accident 
stories.

303
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,110
He never makes it to the promised land.
And so it's not like you're offered 

304
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,910
instantaneous,
final redemption.

305
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,670
If you move out forthrightly into the 
world,

306
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,030
establish a faithful relationship with 
being an attempt to conduct yourself 

307
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:25,941
with integrity,
but it's your best bat and it might be 

308
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:27,090
good enough,
and even if it's not good enough,

309
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,940
it's really preferable to the 
alternative,

310
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,330
which seems to be something closely akin
to hell,

311
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,770
both personal and social.

312
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,180
So Joseph's father is Jacob later 
Israel.

313
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:46,500
He who wrestles with God and we've 
talked about that a little bit.

314
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,340
It's sort of implicit in what I've been 
saying is that I think we all do that to

315
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:54,330
some degree.
We wrestle with reality itself.

316
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:57,540
That's for sure not only the reality we 
understand,

317
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:02,541
but the reality we don't understand,
which is sort of a transcendent reality 

318
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,960
and then maybe whatever reality is 
outside of that,

319
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:08,961
you know,
because the classic Judeo Christian 

320
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,881
conception of God is that there's time 
and space and of course there's lots of 

321
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:15,231
things about what exists in time and 
space that were completely ignorant to 

322
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:18,060
oven that's transcendent in that sense.
But then there's an idea that there is a

323
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:21,150
realm outside of that which is a.
well,

324
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:23,610
it's an interesting idea.
It's very sophisticated idea,

325
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:26,070
I think rather than a simple idea and 
it's.

326
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,190
It's difficult to know what to make of 
it,

327
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,550
but it doesn't really matter because I 
think regardless of what your attitude 

328
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:37,890
is towards those sorts of things,
intellectually,

329
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,110
you still end up in the same position as
Jacob for all intents and purposes,

330
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:48,111
practically speaking,
because I don't think that there's 

331
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:50,370
anyone who at some point in their life 
or perhaps even everyday doesn't at some

332
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:55,110
level wrestle with God and you could 
just call it well the nature of reality,

333
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,710
I suppose if you want to be,
say reductionistic about it,

334
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,210
but I don't think it makes any 
difference.

335
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:05,211
It's still something you're stuck with 
and it's not only the nature of reality 

336
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:10,401
itself that you have to struggle with,
but it's also the nature of your moral 

337
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:11,010
relationship to it,
your behavior in relationship to it.

338
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:14,880
So that's how you should perceive it and
how you should conduct yourself.

339
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,300
And then whether or not the,
the advantages of doing it properly are 

340
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,410
worth the difficulty and the 
disadvantages.

341
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,500
So that seems to me just a straight 
existential statement.

342
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:28,920
Then you know,
Jacob gets damaged by his wrestling,

343
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,540
which is also very realistic.
So anyways,

344
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,840
he also ends up as father of Joseph,
who's the favorite son,

345
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,380
son who's born in his old age,
to his favorite wife,

346
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,780
and that's who we're going to talk about
two today.

347
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,710
So you remember.
So Jacob is the for father of the 12 

348
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,461
tribes of Israel and there's his,
his wives and the son and the offspring 

349
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:57,130
that resulted.
Those are all the sons.

350
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:02,131
There's a daughter named Diana as well,
and Rachel is the woman he really loved 

351
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:04,420
and the first son he had with Rachel was
Joseph,

352
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:09,421
and that was when he was older.
And so that's in some sense why Joseph 

353
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:10,330
is his favorite.
So

354
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,960
this is the beginning of the story of 
Joseph.

355
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,990
Now Israel.
Jacob loved Joseph more than all his 

356
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,631
children because he was the son of his 
old age and he made him a coat of many 

357
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:25,070
colors and there's a lot packed into 
those two sentences.

358
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:30,071
You know,
the first is that now Israel loved 

359
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,690
Joseph more than all his other children.
That's probably not so good.

360
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:37,691
One of the things we've seen in the 
stories that have preceded this is that 

361
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:41,560
whenever there's marked preference on 
the part of parents for one child over 

362
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,830
the other,
with,

363
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,180
with,
with,

364
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,330
with Jacob,
and Esau was Rachel was,

365
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,380
uh,
Jacob was Rachel's favorite and Isa was,

366
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,610
um,

367
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,950
Isaac's favorite that didn't work out so
well that put a real twist in the entire

368
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,830
structure of the family.
And so there's a warning there right off

369
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:05,350
the bat you might say,
well,

370
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:08,050
you can't help having a preference for 
one child or another,

371
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:13,051
but I don't know if that's true.
And it's certainly something that you 

372
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:16,141
should be very cautious about because it
doesn't seem to work out very well 

373
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:17,110
because he was the son of his old age 
fair enough.

374
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,280
And he made him a coat of many colors.
That's a very interesting image,

375
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:24,460
that coat of many colors they have that 
idea.

376
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,390
And so I'm going to delve into that idea
because it sets the stage,

377
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,490
like it says what sort of person Joseph 
is.

378
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:32,680
He's favored,
he's younger,

379
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,920
he's favored.
But he also has this particular garment 

380
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:37,920
that characterizes him,
you know,

381
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,470
and one of the things I've really 
learned from analyzing women's dreams in

382
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:44,140
particular is that women very 
frequently,

383
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:49,141
in my experience,
very frequently dream of clothing as 

384
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:49,141
role.

385
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:49,840
And so if you're interpreting women's 
dreams,

386
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:53,800
then if they put on the shoes of their 
grandmother for example,

387
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,040
then you understand very rapidly that 
that dream is trying to make an 

388
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,421
association between their own behavior 
and something that's characteristic of 

389
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:05,500
either the state of being a grandmother 
or the particular grandmother.

390
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,090
And it makes sense,
right?

391
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:11,230
Because clothing protects.
But it also signifies a role.

392
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,590
And uh,
it's interesting in the old testament 

393
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,951
stories,
often if someone is going to act 

394
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:20,470
deceitfully they changed their,
they changed their outfit.

395
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:22,900
And that's Kinda what you do when you 
act deceitfully,

396
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,910
right?
You dress up like someone else,

397
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:29,140
you present yourself like someone else.
So anyways,

398
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:32,050
back to the coat of many colors.
Well,

399
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,990
for something to be many colored,
it sort of spans the entire gamut of 

400
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:45,121
possibility.
And so there's a hint there that if you 

401
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:47,881
want to be a full fledged person that 
you have to manifest a very large number

402
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:56,561
of traits.
And so I want to go into that idea a 

403
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,711
bit.
The first thing I want to talk about is 

404
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:00,680
some of the things that we've learned 
about what happens to you when you go to

405
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:02,720
a new environment.
You know,

406
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:07,130
there's this idea in very deep idea and 
clinical psychology,

407
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,310
a fundamental idea,
which is that if someone's anxious about

408
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:11,660
something,
what you do is you.

409
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,250
And it's getting in their way.
You take what they're anxious about,

410
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:18,680
new define it because that already 
delimits it,

411
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:23,681
right?
Because one of the problems with being 

412
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:23,681
anxious about something as you won't 
speak of it,

413
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:25,500
it's like voldemort.
And then if you don't speak of it you,

414
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,260
it's way bigger than it should be.

415
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,720
As soon as you start talking about it,
you cut it down to size.

416
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,550
And so,
and it,

417
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,520
it's for a bunch of reasons.
It's because you're not as.

418
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,620
You're not as afraid of as many things 
as you think.

419
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,930
And you're braver than,
you know.

420
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:44,530
And more and more capable,
so as soon as you're brave enough to 

421
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:44,530
start talking about what you're afraid 
of,

422
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,700
then you see that there's more to you 
than you thought and that there's less 

423
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,600
to the problem than you thought,
and then you can decompose it further 

424
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,770
into smaller problems and then you can 
figure out how to approach those smaller

425
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:59,771
problems and so and then it doesn't seem
to meet to be that you get less 

426
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:04,271
frightened.
It seems to be that you get more 

427
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:06,161
courageous,
which is way better than being less 

428
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:06,161
frightened because there's lots of 
things to be frightened about.

429
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:08,060
So if you're courageous that,
that really does the trick.

430
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,510
Now the question is what happens if you 
like,

431
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:16,511
let's say that you're a very socially 
inept and you don't know how to 

432
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:20,891
introduce yourself or to make any,
were established the initial parts of a 

433
00:25:20,891 --> 00:25:24,671
relationship with anyone.
And so then you start putting yourself 

434
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:25,670
in situations where you're required to 
do that.

435
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:30,680
And so then the question is how is it 
technically that you transform?

436
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,460
You say,
well,

437
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:32,510
you learn.
Well,

438
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:36,080
we want to be more specific about that.
What does it mean that you learn?

439
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Well if you're dealing with someone 
who's particularly socially inept and 

440
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,431
you're doing psychotherapy with them,
you might teach them how to shake 

441
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:47,950
someone's hand properly and say their 
name and remember the other person's 

442
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,851
name,
and so you just practice that with them 

443
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,190
so that they have the motoric routine 
down so that form of knowledge is built 

444
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,710
right into your body.

445
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,120
It's like,
look at the person,

446
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,040
put out your hand,
shake it.

447
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:02,750
Don't not like a dead Halibut,
but you know with a reasonable grip.

448
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,970
Say Your name.
Don't mumble it.

449
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,920
Look,
look at them so that they can hear you,

450
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:12,130
and then when they say their name,
try to remember it and that's meant so 

451
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,970
you can practice that with people and so
then they develop something that's 

452
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:15,970
Metorik,
right?

453
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,610
It's embedded right in their body and so
and then you can say to them,

454
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:24,611
well,
the other thing you can do is when you 

455
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:26,171
start a conversation is don't sit there 
thinking about what you're going to say 

456
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:30,281
next because then you won't be paying 
attention to the person and you'll make 

457
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:34,031
a fool out of yourself.
Because you'll manifest nonsequitors,

458
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:35,540
right,
because you'll get out of.

459
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:38,540
It's like if you're dancing and all 
you're paying attention to is where your

460
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:43,541
feet are,
then you're going to step on the other 

461
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:45,701
person all the time,
so you want to pay attention to the 

462
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:47,591
other person and then whatever 
automatized social knowledge you have 

463
00:26:47,591 --> 00:26:48,600
will come to the forefront.

464
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,850
So it's a good thing to know if you're 
socially anxious,

465
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:52,440
right?
If you're socially anxious,

466
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:57,441
one of the things you should do is pay 
way more attention to the person you're 

467
00:26:57,441 --> 00:27:01,041
talking to rather than less.
And you should pay as little attention 

468
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:04,641
as possible to yourself.
So if you feel yourself falling in 

469
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:08,241
because you're anxious,
then what you do is you push your 

470
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:08,820
attention out and pay attention to the 
person because to the degree that you've

471
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:13,821
been socialized,
then all your automatic responses will 

472
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:13,821
kick it.
So.

473
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:17,871
But anyway,
so you go out into the social world and 

474
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:20,570
you learn to shake someone's hand and 
you learn how to listen to them and ask 

475
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,510
them questions because that's the next 
thing.

476
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:24,990
Because people love.
You can't just ask them random questions

477
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:27,600
obviously,
but if they start talking to you and you

478
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:32,601
don't understand something about what 
they're saying or maybe something they 

479
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:33,000
said is interesting in you ask them a 
question,

480
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,210
they're pretty damn happy about that 
because it means you're actually paying 

481
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,001
attention to them and people actually 
love to be paid attention to because it 

482
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:41,400
hardly ever happens.

483
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,200
So they really,
really like it.

484
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:44,310
And so,
okay,

485
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:45,780
so,
so what's happening?

486
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:50,810
Well first of all,
you're mastering the automated motor 

487
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:50,910
movements,
right?

488
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,610
Where to point your eyes,
where to put your hands,

489
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,760
how to move your lips,
like really embodied knowledge.

490
00:27:56,761 --> 00:28:01,761
It's a special kind of memory and you're
practicing that and so that's building 

491
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:06,110
new skills for you.
And then by listening to the person and 

492
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,341
watching yourself interact,
you're also generating new new abstract 

493
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:16,101
information that enables you to 
conceptualize the world in a different 

494
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:19,191
way.
So if you go out to can you go talk to 

495
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:19,950
10 different people or 50 different 
people?

496
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,280
Then you get to listen to what those 50 
people said.

497
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:26,280
You get to watch how they're,
how they express themselves,

498
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:30,210
and you gather a corpus of knowledge 
that changes the way you perceive.

499
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:33,090
That broadens you as a social agent.
Okay,

500
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:38,091
so that's two forms of knowledge,
but then there's a third one which is 

501
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,660
really interesting,
which is that you know you have a lot of

502
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,590
biological potential and it's hard to 
know what potentially is,

503
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:48,591
but part of it is that you're capable of
generating proteins that you haven't 

504
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:49,950
been generating.

505
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,570
So you should get right on that by the 
way.

506
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,960
So,
but what the way that works in part is 

507
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,150
that if you put yourself in a radically 
new situation,

508
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,510
then your brain that there are genetic 
switches that turn on because of the 

509
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,420
demands of the new situation that code 
for new proteins.

510
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,660
So it's as if you have latent software.
That would be one way of thinking about 

511
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:17,390
that will only be turned on if you go 
into this situation where that's 

512
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,120
necessary.
And so then you might think,

513
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:19,620
well,
if that's the case,

514
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,710
how much have you could be turned on if 
you went a whole bunch of different 

515
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,990
places.
And that's a really,

516
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:29,991
really,
that's a profound question because one 

517
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:32,511
of the deep answers to how you should 
get your life together is you should go 

518
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:38,340
a very large number of places and turn 
yourself on.

519
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,210
And I want to walk through that a little
because there's a very rich symbolic 

520
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:49,170
world that expresses that.
So now the idea about having a coat of 

521
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:55,231
many colors would be that the person who
is the appropriate leader,

522
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,360
because remember,
or the proper person,

523
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:01,600
which would be the same thing.
One of the things that these old stories

524
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,780
are trying to express and to figure out 
is how is it that you should act which 

525
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,370
is the same as what constitutes the 
ideal.

526
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:14,371
Those are the same question.
And the hand here with Joseph is while 

527
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:18,841
you should wear a coat of many colors,
which means that you should be able to 

528
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:20,260
go have a drink in the pub with the guys
who were,

529
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,640
you know,
dry walling,

530
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:22,870
your,
your house.

531
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:27,871
And you should be able to have a 
sophisticated conversation with someone 

532
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:28,870
who's more educated in an abstract way.

533
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,840
And that maybe you should be equally 
comfortable in both situations,

534
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,160
right?
Because you might think,

535
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:37,600
well there's more,
one of the indications that there's more

536
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:42,601
to you is that you can be put more 
places and function properly and that 

537
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:48,091
would be a good thing to aim at because 
here's the other issue is that you know 

538
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:52,861
perfectly well that the fundamental 
tragedies of life and your exposure to 

539
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:56,920
malevolence in the course of that life.
So those being the worst things,

540
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,400
there's not a lot you can do to,
to alter that fundamentally because 

541
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,990
their conditions of existence,
you're going to be subject to your 

542
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,670
vulnerability and your going to be 
subject to malevolence.

543
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,720
That's that.
And you can't hide from it because it 

544
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,780
actually makes it worse.
So you're stuck with it.

545
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,640
So then the question is,
well,

546
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,460
what are your options?
And one option is to curse the structure

547
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:21,880
of being for being malevolent and tragic
and fair enough.

548
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,970
And the other is to make yourself so 
damn differentiated and dynamic and able

549
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:33,810
that you're more than a match for that.
Now that's not an easy thing,

550
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:35,860
but it doesn't matter.
Because like what?

551
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,280
What's the alternative?
There's no good alternative and that's 

552
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,521
also worth knowing.
So you see these ideas expressed in the 

553
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:50,200
strangest places and so we've talked a 
little bit,

554
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,080
I think in this,
in this series about Pinocchio,

555
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:54,520
but if we haven't,
it doesn't matter.

556
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,290
You see,
there's Jimminy cricket at the opening 

557
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,571
of the Pinocchio Movie,
pointing to a star,

558
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:06,760
which is roughly the Nativity Star for 
all intents and purposes,

559
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:11,761
and it's a.
it's a symbolic indicator of a of 

560
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:16,710
something diamond like and pure right 
glimmering in the darkness that's 

561
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:20,350
transcendent,
that above the horizon upon which to fix

562
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:23,530
your eyes,
and so that's the thing is you need that

563
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:28,531
technically and the reason you need that
is because we know enough about 

564
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:33,391
psychology now to know that almost all 
of the positive emotion that you're 

565
00:32:33,391 --> 00:32:36,571
going to experience in your life and 
positive emotion is analgesic by the 

566
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:36,571
way,
right?

567
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:40,800
It actually quells paint,
so it's not just positive and also gets 

568
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,000
rid of negative,
which is a big plus.

569
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,880
Almost all of the positive emotion that 
you're going to feel.

570
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,040
You're going to feel in relationship to 
a goal because you feel positive emotion

571
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,250
as you approach a goal,
and so if you want to feel positive 

572
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,461
emotion,
then you need a goal and then you might 

573
00:32:57,461 --> 00:32:57,461
think,
well,

574
00:32:57,461 --> 00:32:57,461
if you want to maximize that positive 
emotion,

575
00:32:57,461 --> 00:33:02,441
which is enthusiasm,
and also what pulls you out into the 

576
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:05,000
world as well as feeling good,
then you need the best possible goal.

577
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:10,180
Well that because that's going to engage
the largest segments of your being,

578
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,440
like if your goals too narrow,
then a bunch of you isn't going to be on

579
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:16,520
board for it.
You know?

580
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,700
If the goal is well developed and 
multifaceted,

581
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:21,440
then all of you can partake in that.

582
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Even your negative elements,
even your anger and your fear can get 

583
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,920
onboard with that.
Let's say so you need a goal,

584
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:29,690
man,
that's worthy.

585
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,650
You got us.
Thank you.

586
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:35,651
Good.
You need a goal that justifies the 

587
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:36,080
tragedy and malevolence of life.
That seems to be the bottom line.

588
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,820
Now maybe you think,
well,

589
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:39,500
there's no goal that can do that.
It's like,

590
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:44,501
well,
there are still better and worse 

591
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,870
schools,
so and I,

592
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:49,820
I'm not convinced that there are no 
goals that can do that.

593
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,160
I think that's an open question.
You'd never know that until you pursued 

594
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,471
the proper goal long enough to find out 
who you would be as a consequence of 

595
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:04,481
pursuing it.
So that's also your destiny or your 

596
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:04,481
existential voyage,
right?

597
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:05,870
It's also not something that anyone else
can do for you.

598
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:11,110
Someone can say,
get your act together for Christ's sake 

599
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,110
and get it.

600
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,170
Get good at it.
That's,

601
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,570
that'll make the world unfold best for 
you.

602
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:18,050
But there's no way you can know that 
without doing it.

603
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,680
So,
and unless you think you've done a 

604
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,161
particularly stellar job of that,
then you have no reason to doubt its 

605
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:30,020
potential validity.
So plus,

606
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:33,170
like crickets are telling you this.
And so you know,

607
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,500
there are a very reliable source.
Okay,

608
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:40,280
so you see the star,
The star recurs as a Motif in Pinocchio.

609
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:45,281
And one of the more interesting elements
of it here is that when Japan wants to 

610
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:50,081
transform his puppet Marionette,
whose being played by forces that 

611
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:55,181
operate behind the scenes,
which is really good definition of the 

612
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:56,090
persona from a union perspective,
right?

613
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,300
And also something indicative of 
something like an ideological or 

614
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,781
conceptual possession.
Japan who's a good guy is positive 

615
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:09,260
father figure read lifts his even though
he is a patriarchal figure,

616
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:09,560
right?

617
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,860
And a very competent one.
He's still even lifts his eyes up to 

618
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,471
something that transcends his mode of 
being positive as it is and wishes that 

619
00:35:17,471 --> 00:35:22,391
his creation would undertake the kind of
transformation that would make it 

620
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,930
autonomous and fully functional as a 
moral agent.

621
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,070
No strings.
Right?

622
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:33,310
So that's very interesting.
I think soldier hits and said the 

623
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,680
salvation of mankind lies only in making
everything that concern of all.

624
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,310
That's a pretty decent star,
like goal I would say.

625
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,750
And so what happens in the story is that
because,

626
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,800
and I think this is a symbolic 
representative of what I just described 

627
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,330
you,
that happens at a genetic level,

628
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:56,331
if you put yourself in new situations.
So Japan is roughly culture in the 

629
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:58,140
Pinocchio Story,
right?

630
00:35:58,141 --> 00:35:59,430
He's,
he's a craftsman.

631
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,510
He's,
he's,

632
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,030
uh,
and he makes Pinocchio.

633
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,530
So He's,
he's who's his son.

634
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:12,531
He's the socializing agent and he aims 
for something above mere socialization,

635
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,870
which is,
I think,

636
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:17,940
part of the mysterious element of human 
beings.

637
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,260
You know,
when our scientific models,

638
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:22,170
we basically have socialization and 
biology,

639
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,020
but there's always a third element and 
mythological stories,

640
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:30,021
which is whatever you might construe as 
the spontaneous action of consciousness 

641
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,240
that's associated with freewill.
And you know,

642
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:38,241
that's just basically being 
conceptualized in religious terms as 

643
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:41,001
something akin to the soul.
Now we don't have a category for that 

644
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:44,810
scientifically because what we try to do
scientifically is to reduce everything 

645
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,621
either to socialization or to biology.
But it isn't clear to me that that's.

646
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,200
It's perfectly reasonable from the 
perspective of practicality at a 

647
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,551
scientific level.
You don't want to multiply explanatory 

648
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:01,671
principles beyond necessity,
but there's many things that that 

649
00:37:01,671 --> 00:37:04,671
doesn't come to terms with,
such as the fact that we all treat each 

650
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:06,480
other as autonomous beings with free 
will and that that seems to work.

651
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:08,790
And that if we stopped doing that,
then things go to hell very,

652
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:09,600
very rapidly.

653
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,510
So,
and the mere fact that we have been able

654
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:16,470
to conceptualize what that conscious 
freewill might be,

655
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,440
metaphysically or physically,
it doesn't mean it doesn't exist,

656
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:21,210
it just means that we don't understand 
it.

657
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,130
I mean what it was only in the last 15 
years that we discovered that 95 percent

658
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:31,131
of the universe was made out of some 
kind of matter that we can't even whose 

659
00:37:31,131 --> 00:37:34,950
properties we can't even imagine except 
that it seems to have mass.

660
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,580
So anyways,
what happens is when Japan Eto reach 

661
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,570
lifts his eyes up to the star,
he,

662
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:48,140
so it's society aligning itself with the
proper goal with regards to individual 

663
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,780
development,
right?

664
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:53,781
So,
so there instead of society being at 

665
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:57,321
odds with the individual,
they line up and then what happens is 

666
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:58,050
nature comes on board and that's the 
blue fairy in the,

667
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:03,410
in the Pinocchio Story.
And that's seems to me to be a symbolic 

668
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,471
representation of what happens 
biologically when when you set the goal 

669
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:11,391
properly,
get your culture behind you and move 

670
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,881
into the world,
is that there's a biological 

671
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:14,280
transformation that occurs as a 
consequence of that,

672
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:18,600
which means that a bunch of you that 
hasn't been turned on turns on.

673
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,260
And I guess one question would be is 
what would you be like if you turned on 

674
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,650
everything inside of you that could be 
turned on?

675
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,480
Well,
that's a good goal.

676
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,600
That's a good thing to find out.
So now I'm going to introduce a couple 

677
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:39,171
of other ideas.
There's this idea in union psychology 

678
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:43,441
called the circumambulation and young 
had this idea that you had a potential 

679
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:48,571
future self which would be in potential 
everything that you could be and that it

680
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:53,941
manifests itself moment to moment in 
your present life by making you 

681
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:58,090
interested in things and the things that
you're interested in are the things that

682
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:01,510
would guide you along the path that 
would lead you to maximal development.

683
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:07,020
Now it sounds like a metaphysical idea 
or a or a mystical idea even,

684
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,280
but,
but it's not.

685
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,380
It's not,
it's a really profoundly biological 

686
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,380
idea.
The idea is something like,

687
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,391
well,
your setup so that you're automatically 

688
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:21,421
interested in those things that was 
fully expand you as a well adapted 

689
00:39:21,421 --> 00:39:21,610
creature.

690
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,700
Well like there's nothing radical about 
that idea.

691
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,820
How well what else could possibly be the
case unless there's something 

692
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,310
fundamentally flawed about you that is 
what the situation would be.

693
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,520
It's kind of interesting to think about 
how that would be manifest moment to 

694
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:38,560
moment,
but the idea is something like,

695
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:43,950
well,
your interest is captured by those 

696
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,980
things that lead you down.
The path of development will have better

697
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:46,150
be the case.
Okay,

698
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:51,151
so that's fine,
and so there's some utility in pursuing 

699
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:52,120
those things that you're interested in.
That's the call to adventure,

700
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:56,500
let's say so and the call to adventure 
takes you all sorts of places.

701
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:58,660
Now the problem with the call to 
adventure is like,

702
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:03,661
what the hell do you know?
You might be interested in things that 

703
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:06,931
are kind of warped and bent,
and often it's the case that when new 

704
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:10,660
parts of people manifest themselves and 
grip their interest,

705
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:15,661
say they do it very badly and shoddily 
and so you stumble around like an idiot.

706
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,940
When you try to do something new.
That's where the fool is the precursor 

707
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,450
to the savior from the,
from the symbolic perspectives,

708
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:27,451
because you have to be a fool before you
can be a master and if you're not 

709
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:27,451
willing to be a fool and you can't be a 
master,

710
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:29,790
so,
so you're going to.

711
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,040
It's an error error ridden process and 
that's also laid out the old testament 

712
00:40:35,081 --> 00:40:38,380
stories because the first thing that 
happens to all these patriarchal figures

713
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:42,490
when God kicks them out of their 
father's house when they're like 84,

714
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,030
is that they.
They run into all sorts of trouble.

715
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:48,040
And some of it's social too.
Some of it's natural.

716
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:50,710
Some of it's a consequence of their own 
moral inadequacy.

717
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,380
So they're fools and.
But,

718
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,410
but the thing that's so interesting is 
that despite the fact that they're 

719
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,800
fools,
they're still supposed to go on the 

720
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,391
adventure and that they're capable of 
learning enough as a consequence of 

721
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:08,041
moving forward on the adventure so that 
they straightened themselves out across 

722
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:08,041
time.

723
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:11,230
And so it's something like this and this
circumambulation that young talked about

724
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:14,300
was this continual,
we'll return to this,

725
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:18,100
this continual circling in some sense of
who you could be.

726
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,570
You might notice,
for example,

727
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:21,280
that there are themes in your life.
You know,

728
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,800
when you go back across your 
experiences,

729
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,720
you see,
you kind of have your typical experience

730
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:29,590
that sort of repeats itself and there 
might be variation on it,

731
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:34,591
like a musical theme,
but it's like you're circling yourself 

732
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:36,980
and getting closer to yourself as you 
move across time.

733
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:42,250
That's the circumambulation.
Now you remember that for a sec because 

734
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:42,250
we'll go back to it.
Okay?

735
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,060
So imagine that something glimmers 
before you.

736
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:47,270
It's an an interest that's dawning and 
you decide,

737
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,170
well,
first of all,

738
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,250
you're paralyzed.
You think,

739
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:50,870
well,
how do I know if I should pursue that?

740
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:54,650
It's probably a stupid idea,
and the proper response to that is,

741
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,800
you're right,
it probably is a stupid idea because 

742
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,141
almost all the,
all ideas are stupid and so the 

743
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:04,070
probability that as you move forward on 
your adventure,

744
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:07,070
that you're going to get it right the 
first time is zero.

745
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,340
It's just not going to happen.
And so then you might think,

746
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:15,341
well,
maybe I'll just wait around until I get 

747
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:15,470
the right idea and which people do,
right?

748
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:17,750
So they're like 40 year old,
13 year olds,

749
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:22,751
which is not a good idea.
And so they wait around until it's 

750
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,410
waiting for Godot until they finally got
it right.

751
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:27,050
But the problem is you're too stupid to 
know when you've got it right.

752
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:32,051
So waiting around isn't going to help 
because even if it's the perfect 

753
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:35,210
opportunity manifested itself to you in 
your incomplete form,

754
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,470
the probability that you would recognize
it as the perfect opportunity is zero.

755
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,590
You might even think it's the worst 
possible idea that you've ever heard of 

756
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:44,780
anywhere,
highly likely,

757
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,660
highly likely.
So,

758
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,790
so you ha,
there's a niche nature called that,

759
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,190
uh,
will,

760
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:52,670
will to stupidity,
which I really liked.

761
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,440
So because he thought of stupidity as 
being,

762
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,920
you know,
it's,

763
00:42:56,921 --> 00:43:01,921
it's,
you have to take it into account 

764
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:04,270
fundamentally and work with it and so 
and so you can take these tentative 

765
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:08,891
steps on your pathway to destiny and you
can assume that you're going to do it 

766
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:13,190
badly and that's really useful because 
you don't have to beat yourself up.

767
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:18,190
It's pretty easy to do it badly.
But the thing is it's way better to do 

768
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,821
it badly than not to do it at all.
And that's the continual message that 

769
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:24,380
echoes through these historical stories 
in genesis.

770
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:29,381
It's like these are flawed people.
They should have got the hell out of 

771
00:43:29,381 --> 00:43:33,311
their house way before they did and they
go out and they stumble around in 

772
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:38,201
tyranny and feminine self betrayal and,
and violence.

773
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:43,571
And,
but it's a hell of a lot better than 

774
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:43,571
just rotting away at home.
And that's the,

775
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:44,840
that's great.
So that's good.

776
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,520
And so why is that?
Well,

777
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:47,150
okay,
so you,

778
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:52,151
you start your path and you think that 
you're heading towards your star and so 

779
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:56,840
you go in that direction and then 
because you're here,

780
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:59,780
the world looks a particular way,
but then when you move here,

781
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:06,010
the world looks different and you're 
different as a consequence of having 

782
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,371
made that voyage and so what that means 
is that now that thing that glimmers in 

783
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:13,781
front of you is going to have shifted 
its location because you weren't very 

784
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:18,311
good at specifying it to begin with and 
now that you're a little sharper and 

785
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:22,271
more focused than you were,
it's going to reveal itself with more 

786
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:23,000
accuracy to you.

787
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:27,410
And so then you have to take a,
you know,

788
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,040
it's almost like 180 degree reversal,
but it because you know,

789
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:32,460
you've.

790
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,520
I mean you've gone this far and that's a
long ways to get that far.

791
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:44,090
But that's a lot farther than you would 
be if you just stayed where you were 

792
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:49,311
waiting.
And so it doesn't matter that you 

793
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,440
overshoot continually because as you 
overshoot,

794
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,830
even if you don't learn what you should 
have done,

795
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:59,430
you're going to continually learn what 
you shouldn't keep doing.

796
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,390
And if you learn enough about what you 
shouldn't keep doing,

797
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:08,630
then that's tantamount at some point to 
learning at the same time what you 

798
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,320
should be doing.
So it's okay.

799
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:15,450
So it's like this.
Now what's cool about it though,

800
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:20,451
I think is that as you progress,
the degree of overshooting starts to 

801
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:21,930
decline,
right?

802
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,110
And that we know that there was nothing 
hypothetical about that.

803
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,660
As you learn a new skill,
like even to play it,

804
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,370
play a song on the piano,
for example,

805
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:32,370
you overshoot madly making all sorts of 
mistakes to begin with.

806
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:33,930
And then the mistakes

807
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,100
they disappear.
There's a great ted talk,

808
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:43,300
I think it was about sky,
a setup,

809
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,320
a really advanced computational 
recording system in his home and 

810
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,491
recorded every single utterance his 
young child made while learning to 

811
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:57,231
speak.
And then he put together the child's 

812
00:45:57,231 --> 00:45:59,910
attempts to say certain phonemes and put
them in the list.

813
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:03,510
And you can hear the child deviating 
madly to begin with,

814
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,910
and then after hundreds and hundreds of 
repetitions,

815
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:10,911
just zeroing in on the exact phoneme so 
you know you might not know this,

816
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:14,130
but when kids babble,
because they start babbling when they're

817
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:19,131
quite young,
they babble every human phoneme 

818
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:20,130
including all sorts of phonemes that 
adults can't say,

819
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,400
and then they they die into their 
language so that after they learn,

820
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,980
say English,
then there's all sorts of phonemes they 

821
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:30,980
can no longer here or pronounced,
but to begin with,

822
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,340
it's all there,
which is really quite interesting,

823
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:36,300
but so they zip as they learn a 
particular language,

824
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:40,880
they zero in on the proper way to 
pronounce that in their errors minimize.

825
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,290
And every time you learn something,
now it's how it is.

826
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:48,291
And that's really useful to know too,
because it means that it's okay to 

827
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:50,670
wander around stupidly before you fix 
your destination.

828
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,980
Now you see that echoed in exodus,
right?

829
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,460
Because what happens is that the 
Egyptians or the Hebrews escape a 

830
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,301
tyranny,
which is kind of whatever you do 

831
00:47:02,301 --> 00:47:05,180
personally and psychologically.
When you escape from your previous set 

832
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,070
of stupidly held and ignorant and 
stubborn axioms,

833
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,080
it's like away from that tyranny.
It's like,

834
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:11,640
great.
I freed myself from that.

835
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:14,130
Well then what?
Well you think,

836
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,450
well now I'm on the way.
It's no,

837
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:20,451
you're not.
Now you're in the desert where you 

838
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:22,671
wonder around stupidly,
you know and worship the wrong things 

839
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:27,080
until you finally organize yourself 
morally again and had in the proper 

840
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,431
direction.
So that's worth knowing too because you 

841
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:31,431
think,
well,

842
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,860
I got rid of a lot of things,
baggage,

843
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:34,900
excess baggage that I didn't need in my 
life,

844
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:36,160
and now everything's okay.

845
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,640
It's like,
no,

846
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:41,641
it's not.
You've got rid of a whole set of 

847
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:42,700
scaffolds that were keeping you in place
even though they were pathological.

848
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:47,910
Now you have nothing and nothing 
actually turns out to be better than 

849
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,931
something pathological,
but you're still stuck with the problem 

850
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:52,930
of nothing.
And that's.

851
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,960
Well,
that's exactly why exodus is structured 

852
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:57,960
the way that it is.
It's that you escaped from maturity.

853
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,830
It's hooray.
We're no longer slaves.

854
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:02,380
Yeah,
well now you're nihilistic and lost.

855
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:05,710
It's not necessarily an improvement,
but it is,

856
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,600
but it is the pre.
See.

857
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:12,660
It's also useful to know that because 
you can also be diluted into the idea 

858
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,500
that imagine that you're trying to 
become enlightened,

859
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:18,010
which might mean to turn all those parts
of you on that could be turned on.

860
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:18,730
You think,
well,

861
00:48:18,731 --> 00:48:21,010
that's just a linear pathway uphill.
You know,

862
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:23,020
it's just from one success to another.

863
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,920
It's no,
it's not.

864
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,250
It's like here you are and you're not 
doing too badly in the first step is a 

865
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,131
complete bloody catastrophe.
It's worse and then maybe you can pull 

866
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:36,331
yourself together and you hit a new 
plateau and then that crumbles and 

867
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:40,471
shakes and bang.
It's worse again and so because part of 

868
00:48:40,471 --> 00:48:44,101
the reason that people don't become 
enlightened is because it's punctuated 

869
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:47,521
by intermittent deserts essentially by 
intermittent catastrophes and if you 

870
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:52,891
don't know that well then you're 
basically screwed because you go ahead 

871
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:54,280
on your movement forward and you 
collapse and you think,

872
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:55,030
well,
that didn't work.

873
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:56,110
I collapsed.
It's like,

874
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:58,750
no,
that's par for the course.

875
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,440
It's not indication that you failed.
It's just indication that it's really 

876
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,090
hard and that when you learn something,
you also unlearn something and the thing

877
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:10,570
you unlearned is probably useful and 
unlearning it actually is painful.

878
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:15,780
You know,
let's say if you have to get out of a 

879
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:15,780
bad relationship,
it's like not every,

880
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,290
not any real.
There isn't any relationship that's a 

881
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,590
hundred percent bad,
and so when you jump out of it,

882
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,620
well maybe you're in better shape,
but you're still lonesome and 

883
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,381
disoriented and you don't know what your
past was and you don't know what your 

884
00:49:28,381 --> 00:49:28,381
president is and you don't want to know 
what your future is.

885
00:49:28,381 --> 00:49:33,151
It's that's not.
That's why people stay with the devil 

886
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:33,330
they know instead of,
you know,

887
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,830
looking for the devil they don't know 
so,

888
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:42,120
so anyways,
the fact that you're full of faults 

889
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,370
doesn't mean you have to stop and thank 
God for that.

890
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:50,371
That's a really useful thing and the 
fact that you're full of faults doesn't 

891
00:49:50,371 --> 00:49:54,271
mean that you can't learn and so you can
pause it and an ideal and you're going 

892
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:59,371
to be wrong about it,
but it doesn't matter because what 

893
00:49:59,371 --> 00:49:59,650
you're right about his positing,
the ideal moving towards it,

894
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:05,010
if the actual ideal isn't conceptualized
perfectly well first surprise,

895
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,990
surprise,
because like what are you going to do?

896
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:12,990
That's perfect.
So it doesn't matter that it's 

897
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:12,990
imperfect,
imperfect,

898
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:14,710
it just matters that you do it and that 
you move forward.

899
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,920
So that's really,
that's really positive news as far as 

900
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:19,920
I'm concerned because you could actually
do that,

901
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,980
right?
You can do it badly.

902
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,930
Anyone can do that.
So that's,

903
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,690
that's useful.
Okay.

904
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:29,690
So like if you were an efficient person,
you would have just done that but you're

905
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:31,130
not.
But who cares?

906
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:32,570
You know,
you still end up in the,

907
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,440
in the same place and maybe the trip is 
even more interesting.

908
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:40,370
Who knows?
Probably two interesting young.

909
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,880
I began to understand that the goal of 
psychic development by which he means 

910
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,481
psychological development or spiritual 
development is the self.

911
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,320
There is no linear evolution.
There's only a circumambulation of the 

912
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,111
self are getting closer.
It's like it's like you're spiraling 

913
00:50:59,111 --> 00:51:01,661
into something,
something like that and the thing that 

914
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:05,261
you're spiraling into recedes as you 
move towards it and gets more and more 

915
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,380
sophisticated and well developed as you 
move towards it because you're not going

916
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:10,610
to run out of goals,
right?

917
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:12,710
No matter how much you have your act 
together,

918
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:18,220
there's probably undoubtedly 30 
dimensions along which you could get 

919
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:23,111
your act together a lot more so,
and some of those aren't even 

920
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:26,120
conceivable to you when you're in your 
initial on carved state,

921
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:30,020
let's say uniform development exists at 
most at the beginning.

922
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:32,270
Later,
everything points towards the center.

923
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,320
This insight gave me stability and 
gradually my inner peace returned.

924
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,430
So this is fun.
On the left there.

925
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:48,431
That's the sharp cathedral.
That's the one that has the maze in it 

926
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:51,881
that I told you about.
They actually light that up with lasers 

927
00:51:51,881 --> 00:51:53,900
now and so that's it lit up with lasers 
and so.

928
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,050
So they're turning it into a cathedral 
of light,

929
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,330
which I think is really fascinating and 
it's.

930
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,000
It's a continuation of the same idea,
right?

931
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:04,100
Because the stained glass windows were 
obviously,

932
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,740
I wouldn't call them primitive attempts 
to do that.

933
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:08,960
I mean stained glass windows are pretty 
impressive,

934
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:14,290
you know,
but it's an elaboration of the same 

935
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:14,290
thing.
So now you can go to that Cathedral.

936
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,820
They light up the whole town like that,
which is really something.

937
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,100
And so they're.
And there's how the cathedral is built.

938
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:20,950
It's across.
Um,

939
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:26,170
and do you remember the cross is an ex 
that marks the center of the world and 

940
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:26,990
the cross is the place where each 
individual is.

941
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:31,990
And I think that's the fundamental 
message of Christianity is the cross 

942
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,920
marks the place where every single 
individual is.

943
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:39,130
And it's a tragic place that consists of
suffering and exposure to malevolence 

944
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,310
and that the only way to come to terms 
with it is to accept it.

945
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,240
And that seems to me,
I don't see anything metaphysical about 

946
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,240
that statement whatsoever.
It's like,

947
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:51,230
well,
x marks the spot.

948
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,210
Fair enough.
You're in a spot,

949
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,010
you're right in the center of your 
world.

950
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:57,470
It's right in the center of the world as
far as you're concerned.

951
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:02,471
And the same with the rest of us.
It's characterized by suffering and 

952
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,620
exposure to malevolence.
There's no doubt about that.

953
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,230
What are you going to do about that 
bitter,

954
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,910
resentful,
hateful.

955
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,570
All that does is make it worse.
So you have to accept it.

956
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:17,170
Now,
that's not an easy thing because that's 

957
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:17,170
actually,
I would say,

958
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,500
a heroic task to voluntarily accept the 
conditions of your own existence.

959
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,620
And that happens at the cross.
So that's fine.

960
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,960
And that's associated with light.
Well,

961
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:26,100
that's good that that's associated with 
light.

962
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:28,320
You wouldn't want that to be associated 
with darkness.

963
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,540
That would be a bad thing.
So,

964
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,990
and so there's the,
there's the,

965
00:53:37,991 --> 00:53:38,280
uh,

966
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,180
the labyrinth that was built in 1200 
add.

967
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:49,250
And so the idea is you walk in here,
it's the same idea as that star sequence

968
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:53,000
of slides that I just showed you.
So here's the idea,

969
00:53:53,001 --> 00:53:55,080
is that north,
south,

970
00:53:55,470 --> 00:54:00,470
west and east.
So that's the whole world laid out in 

971
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,410
two dimensions.
And so the question is,

972
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:03,960
how do you get to the center?
Now we already know what the center is.

973
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:08,961
The center is the center of the Cross 
and that's the place of maximal 

974
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:12,410
suffering.
You could save maximal malevolence as 

975
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,261
well,
but it's also the place where that's 

976
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:15,630
transcended,
so how do you get there while the answer

977
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:16,140
is,
well,

978
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:19,950
you don't just stand on the outside 
looking in,

979
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:25,010
that's not gonna help,
so and you can't just run right to the 

980
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,941
center even if you're in California and 
so you have to walk in here and then you

981
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:38,031
see you go like this and you go to every
single place,

982
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:42,780
every single place on that,
on that little cosmos,

983
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:48,230
and then once you've gone to every 
single place and expanded yourself as a 

984
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:49,920
consequence of going north and west and 
east and south,

985
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,090
then there's enough of you so that 
you're at so that you can tolerate being

986
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:56,100
first of all that you can figure out 
where the center is,

987
00:54:56,101 --> 00:54:58,650
but also that you can tolerate being at 
the center.

988
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,310
And so that's what that represents.
And that's pretty.

989
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,920
And look,
I mean let's make no mistake about it.

990
00:55:04,921 --> 00:55:09,921
Hey,
people were pretty damn serious about 

991
00:55:09,921 --> 00:55:09,921
those ideas.
Like that's,

992
00:55:09,921 --> 00:55:14,230
that's quite the piece of work for 
people in the twelfth century in all of 

993
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,870
those.
Some of those damn cathedrals took 300 

994
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:20,271
years to build.
We don't build anything that takes 300 

995
00:55:20,271 --> 00:55:20,271
years,
you know,

996
00:55:20,271 --> 00:55:22,860
and people were putting a lot of effort 
into whatever these things meant,

997
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,860
you know,
and if you think they meant bearded man 

998
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:28,860
in the sky,
then you know,

999
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:33,590
it's hard to.
It's hard to account for the kind of 

1000
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:37,521
motivation that would produce these 
buildings with that kind of paucity of 

1001
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:39,540
conceptualization,
you know,

1002
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:43,180
the towns.
And it was certainly the case in charter

1003
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:47,970
that they groaned under the tax burden 
that was required to produce these.

1004
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Now you might think,
well that's partly tyrannical and no 

1005
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,000
doubt that's the case,
but,

1006
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
but that's not the whole story.
The whole story is that the people who 

1007
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,020
produce those buildings,
they thought about every bit of it.

1008
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:07,620
Nothing's accidental and they're trying 
to portray something just like that 

1009
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,760
window is trying to portray something 
that's the same thing as this.

1010
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,050
It's the center from which all things 
manifest themselves.

1011
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:18,160
You see that's Christ there and being 
portrayed as,

1012
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,160
as that center or the center within him,
something like that.

1013
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:23,880
Very much like the shockers and in,
in um,

1014
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,910
in a yogic practice,
same basic idea.

1015
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:33,300
It's the opening up of the internal 
structure and its proper realization.

1016
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,540
So there are people walking the 
labyrinth,

1017
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,480
so that's the coat of many colors,
right?

1018
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:51,481
That's this differentiated motive being 
that enables you to be competent at home

1019
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:58,320
in the widest possible number of places 
and that that's a real differentiation 

1020
00:56:58,871 --> 00:57:03,130
of your personality to breaking through 
the boundaries of your personality,

1021
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:08,131
including the ones that you impose on 
yourself to become someone who is useful

1022
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:13,330
wherever they're put.
And that's really relevant to this story

1023
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:17,980
of Joseph too because one of the things 
that happens to Joseph is that,

1024
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:23,100
well,
a lot of bad things happen to him 

1025
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:23,890
because he's the favorite of his father.
His brothers hated him,

1026
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,950
and so the first they're going to throw 
him in a pit.

1027
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,360
I think they do throw them in a pit.

1028
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,300
Then they sell them to be a slave.
Then he ends up in,

1029
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,890
well,
we'll go through the story.

1030
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:38,850
He ends up some places where you 
probably wouldn't want to go prison 

1031
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,941
being one of them,
but it doesn't matter because even when 

1032
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:45,280
they put them in prison,
he's actually not in prison.

1033
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,490
He just figures out how to make the 
prison work way better.

1034
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:52,090
Then he's in control of the prison and 
it's a really.

1035
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:54,730
It's an interesting.
I had this friend,

1036
00:57:55,510 --> 00:58:00,510
you know,
and he was very smart but very cynical 

1037
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,960
and he wasn't employed very well and he 
got a little older than he should have 

1038
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:09,040
given his level of intelligence and 
employability and so he had to take jobs

1039
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:10,930
that weren't very intellectually 
challenging.

1040
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:11,830
You know,
on.

1041
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:15,880
One of the things I tried to convince 
him of was that even if he worked,

1042
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,480
he wanted to work behind the parts 
department in an automotive store 

1043
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:21,910
because he liked cars,
but it was beneath them,

1044
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:23,590
you know,
because it was sort of a.

1045
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,050
As far as he was concerned,
it was a,

1046
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:32,100
he was too smart for a job like that,
which actually turned out not to be 

1047
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,431
true.
He wasn't smart enough for a job like 

1048
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:35,431
that or it wasn't wise enough.
But you know,

1049
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:38,860
I,
one of the things I tried to tell them 

1050
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,441
was that you're looking at the situation
wrong because even in a simple job,

1051
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:46,051
so called simple job,
like let's say dishwashing in a 

1052
00:58:46,051 --> 00:58:46,051
restaurant,
which I did an awful lot of.

1053
00:58:46,051 --> 00:58:50,520
It's not that simple.
You're dealing with a lot of other 

1054
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:50,980
people,
very fast staff changeover.

1055
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:54,130
You're feeding people,
you're helping them have a celebration,

1056
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:59,370
you're helping them take a break,
like you can do it really well and then 

1057
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:05,101
the kitchen can operate properly and 
then people can come out to the 

1058
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:07,891
restaurant.
It's not a bloody catastrophe and like 

1059
00:59:07,891 --> 00:59:08,920
you're even when you're doing something 
that's a menial job,

1060
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,570
so to speak,
like dishwashing,

1061
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,930
there are ways of doing it really badly,
resentfully and horribly and doing it 

1062
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,710
really well.
And as soon as you do it really well,

1063
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:19,240
it's not a menial job anymore.
It,

1064
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,740
it immediately transformed.
Now,

1065
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:21,980
I mean

1066
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,980
you can be around people who won't let 
that happen and you should go get 

1067
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,000
another job if that's the case,
but if you do it properly,

1068
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:34,001
then it's not meaningful at all.
And that's also a good way out of 

1069
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:36,020
resentment,
you think,

1070
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:36,940
well,
I've just got this,

1071
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:37,910
you know,
two bit job.

1072
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:38,360
It's like,
yeah,

1073
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:41,000
what if you did it as well as you 
possibly could,

1074
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,650
you know what would happen?
Well,

1075
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:44,900
the first thing that would happen is 
you'd get a lot smarter,

1076
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,530
that's for sure.
And that's hardly a negative thing.

1077
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:53,090
Okay.
So that's the coat of many colors.

1078
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,630
So it's an estimation of what Joseph is 
like and what we're seeing with all of 

1079
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:03,131
these patriarchal figures is the 
continual realization of the ideal 

1080
01:00:03,131 --> 01:00:03,740
person.
Right?

1081
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,510
You could think about it as success of 
approximations of the ideal person.

1082
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:12,380
And the story is exploring all sorts of 
different possibilities,

1083
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:16,070
including ones that are very violent and
catastrophic and malevolent.

1084
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:21,070
It's trying to cover the entire 
territory and to focus in on what the 

1085
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:24,470
proper way through the maze,
the maze of life,

1086
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:29,471
the labyrinth.
And the hint here is that while you 

1087
01:00:29,471 --> 01:00:32,180
should be multidimensional,
these are the generations of Jacob.

1088
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:37,210
Joseph being 17 years old,
was feeding the flock with his brothers 

1089
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,360
and the lad was with his sons of Bilhah 
and with the sons of Zilpah,

1090
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:41,840
his father's wives,
and Joseph brought unto his father.

1091
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:44,480
They're evil report.
Well,

1092
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,050
we already know that Joseph has Jacob's 
favorite,

1093
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:51,470
and so that doesn't make him very 
popular among his brothers.

1094
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:56,270
He's younger and now we also find out 
that he's been set up more or less,

1095
01:00:56,271 --> 01:01:00,170
as you might say,
a snitch because that's what this phrase

1096
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:05,171
means is that he goes out and watches 
his older brothers and if they do 

1097
01:01:05,171 --> 01:01:08,351
something they shouldn't do that.
He comes trotting back to Jacob and 

1098
01:01:08,351 --> 01:01:08,630
reports,
well,

1099
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:11,330
that's not going to make you popular.
So.

1100
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:12,290
And you would say,
well,

1101
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:13,640
is that Joseph's problem?

1102
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:18,560
Or Jacob's problem?
And I would say,

1103
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:20,450
and this is something I learned from 
reading too,

1104
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,710
is that that's a conspiratorial problem,
right?

1105
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:29,010
Is it's the parents that fault,
but so is the child who agrees to do 

1106
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:33,371
that.
They've got a little cabal going and you

1107
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:34,250
might say,
well,

1108
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:39,251
it's only the parents' fault,
but the sun will be taking advantage of 

1109
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:42,680
every advantage that offers him because 
he could say no to.

1110
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:44,630
I won't do that.
So anyways,

1111
01:01:44,631 --> 01:01:49,631
so Joseph is the favorite.
He's a bit of a teacher's pet.

1112
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:55,150
That's what it looks like now.
Israel loved Joseph more than all his 

1113
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:59,231
colors because he was the son of his old
age and he made him a coat of many 

1114
01:01:59,231 --> 01:02:02,051
colors.
And when his brethren saw that their 

1115
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:02,051
father loved him more than all his 
brothers,

1116
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,100
they hated him and could not speak 
peaceably unto him.

1117
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:09,430
So let's say you have a child or number 
of children and one of them is your 

1118
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:09,430
favorite.

1119
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,660
How should you treat that child?
Well,

1120
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:16,720
it isn't obvious that you do them any 
favors by overtly making them be your 

1121
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,330
favorite,
right?

1122
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:18,320
I mean,
first of all,

1123
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,490
maybe you don't them as much as you 
should.

1124
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:25,491
And second of all,
you definitely set up a Cain and Abel 

1125
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:28,470
like scenario in the household and that.
Or maybe it's new situation too,

1126
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:31,770
because you happen to love your child 
more than you love your spouse,

1127
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:37,010
which is,
that's not a recipe for familial 

1128
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:37,490
harmony.
So it's,

1129
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,390
it seems to be a bad idea.
Okay,

1130
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:44,130
so now we have two reasons that Joseph 
is not liked by his brothers is.

1131
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:49,131
One is,
well he's a bit of a rat fink and the 

1132
01:02:49,131 --> 01:02:52,431
other is that he's the,
he's the favorite and he's playing that 

1133
01:02:52,431 --> 01:02:56,360
to the hill by the looks of things.
And when his brothers saw that their 

1134
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,421
father loved him more than all his 
brethren and all his brothers and they 

1135
01:02:59,421 --> 01:03:00,630
hated him and could not speak peaceably 
unto him.

1136
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:06,510
And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told 
it to his brethren and they hated him.

1137
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:11,511
The more he said unto them,
here I pray you this dream which I have 

1138
01:03:11,511 --> 01:03:13,560
dreamed for.
Behold we were binding.

1139
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:17,160
We chiefs in the field and Lo my sheaf 
arose.

1140
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,280
And behold,
your sheaves stood round about and bowed

1141
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:25,281
to my sheaf and his.
And remember he's the young one,

1142
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:27,990
right?
And,

1143
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:30,300
and also the daughter of the favorite 
wife,

1144
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:32,670
which is another thing that's,
or the son of the favorite wife,

1145
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:34,860
which is another thing,
not really working in his favor.

1146
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:38,970
And his brethren said to him,
Shalt Thou indeed reign over us or shall

1147
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:41,820
thou indeed have dominion over us?
And they hated him,

1148
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:44,190
yet the more for his dreams and for his 
words,

1149
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,480
while there there's a shock,
you know,

1150
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,050
that makes perfect sense.
So when it gets worse,

1151
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:54,051
so you see here,
well there's the wheat sheaves bowing 

1152
01:03:54,051 --> 01:03:55,260
there and uh,
and then you see this,

1153
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:56,280
what's going on here?

1154
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,930
Well,
that's not the end of his,

1155
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:03,230
let's call it grandiosity.
And there's an idea to and in the Old 

1156
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:04,920
Testament,
especially in the stories of Joseph,

1157
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:07,500
that if God sends you a dream twice,
he really means it.

1158
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:13,010
And so I don't know if that's true,
although I do know that people have 

1159
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,771
repeating dreams.
It might be true that that a dream you 

1160
01:04:15,771 --> 01:04:17,970
have twice is really trying to punch 
something home.

1161
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:22,990
You know,
it's certainly the case that recurrent 

1162
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:25,281
nightmares are meaningful and that 
recurrent nightmares are associated 

1163
01:04:25,281 --> 01:04:30,081
quite tightly with decreased states of 
mental health and that if you can treat 

1164
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:32,880
the nightmare,
which is often quite easy by the way,

1165
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,020
then the some of the mental health 
problems will decrease,

1166
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,230
so repeated dreams seem to be important.
Anyways.

1167
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,170
He dreamed yet another dream and told it
to his brethren and said,

1168
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,820
behold,
I've had another dream,

1169
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:50,060
and be and behold the sun and the moon 
and the 11 stars bowed to me and he told

1170
01:04:51,451 --> 01:04:56,451
it to his father and to his brothers and
his father rebuked him and said unto 

1171
01:04:56,451 --> 01:05:00,070
unto him,
what is this dream that though history 

1172
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:02,151
of I in my and your mother and your 
brothers indeed come to bow down 

1173
01:05:02,151 --> 01:05:06,240
ourselves to the to the earth,
and his brothers envied him,

1174
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,110
but his father observed to say,
well,

1175
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:11,850
what the hell do you make of something 
like that,

1176
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:12,070
right?

1177
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:17,130
If someone tells you that it's like,
are they responsible for their dreams?

1178
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:23,670
We don't really seem.
We don't really hold ourselves 

1179
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:23,670
responsible for our,
for the dreams we have at night,

1180
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,800
and what do you make of a dream is like 
one of the things that [inaudible] 

1181
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,950
pointed out,
this is where he differed from Freud's 

1182
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:33,390
substantially is Freud tended to think 
that the dream head,

1183
01:05:33,391 --> 01:05:37,780
its meaning because it's contents 
weren't acceptable to the conscious mind

1184
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,130
and young said,
no,

1185
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:40,390
no,
you don't understand.

1186
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,480
That's not what happens.
What happens is the dream is doing the 

1187
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,061
best it can to express something that 
the person doesn't yet really know and 

1188
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:51,160
young thought about the dream as a 
manifestation of nature.

1189
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:52,930
It wasn't associated with the ego at 
all.

1190
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:56,800
It was just like you have a dream and 
there were things happening in it.

1191
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:58,930
The same way that when you walk into a 
dinner party,

1192
01:05:58,931 --> 01:06:00,490
there are things happening there.

1193
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:04,240
You know it's not.
The dream isn't something that's subject

1194
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:07,570
to your capacity for manipulation.
It's something that happens to you,

1195
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,910
not something that you do.
And so,

1196
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:13,270
so if someone has a dream like that,
well you've got three options.

1197
01:06:13,271 --> 01:06:17,830
You can just discount dreams altogether,
which is what people in the modern world

1198
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:22,831
tend to do,
which is a very bad idea because there 

1199
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:22,990
are thoughts and you shouldn't discount 
them.

1200
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:28,040
You know what I mean?
And they're hardly random as some 

1201
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,470
neuroscientists claim.
That's absolutely cockeyed theory.

1202
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:33,250
That random like television,
snow on a TV set,

1203
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:34,990
if it was random.
So,

1204
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,750
so one is while you just discount 
dreams.

1205
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:42,751
The other is that you consider the 
person a liar and a braggart and a 

1206
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:43,510
narcissist.
And the third is,

1207
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,550
well,
what's the third?

1208
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:50,080
It's like he dreamt that the sun and the
moon and the stars bowed down to him.

1209
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,760
You might think about that two or three 
times so,

1210
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:57,250
but it's not necessarily something 
that's going to make you happy.

1211
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,940
And his brother and went to feed their 
father's flock and check him.

1212
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:03,190
So they took off and Israel said unto 
Joseph,

1213
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:08,820
you're not thy brethren,
feed the flock and check him calm and I 

1214
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,410
will send thee unto him.
And he said him and he said to him,

1215
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,390
here,
here tomorrow.

1216
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:15,850
And when they saw him afar off,
even before he came near onto them,

1217
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:21,060
they conspired against him to slay him.
Rough people act then,

1218
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,150
right?
This is,

1219
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:24,820
this sort of thing is happening quite 
frequently.

1220
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,450
Um,
and they said to one another,

1221
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:30,460
behold,
the dreamer cometh.

1222
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,340
Come now,
therefore let us slay him,

1223
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:38,370
cast him into some pit,
and we will say some evil beast has 

1224
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,270
devoured him and we shall see what 
becomes of his dreams.

1225
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:42,730
So there's an echo of the Cain and Abel 
story there.

1226
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:43,960
Obviously,
you know what I mean?

1227
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:51,330
It's not quite as clear because it 
indicate enables store able is clearly 

1228
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:53,650
just doing well.
And here you can't quite get a handle on

1229
01:07:53,651 --> 01:07:58,651
Joseph's character.
You can't tell if he is actually the 

1230
01:07:58,651 --> 01:07:59,440
elect or if he's just a spoiled Brat 
with delusions of grandeur.

1231
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,210
But it doesn't matter because his 
brothers,

1232
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:09,211
they're so irritated at his.
The fact that he's favored and perhaps 

1233
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:13,381
even the fact that he might be someone 
destined for something,

1234
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:18,980
that they find it perfectly reasonable 
to destroy that.

1235
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,260
And it's so hard.
It's so interesting how often that motif

1236
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:28,190
of pulling down an ideal manifest itself
in these old stories,

1237
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:33,191
right?
It's the pattern is established in the 

1238
01:08:33,191 --> 01:08:36,011
Cain and Abel Story.
It just repeats and repeats and repeats 

1239
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:36,011
and I.
I think that's dead true.

1240
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:39,830
I think it just repeats all the time so 
that people are annoyed about how tragic

1241
01:08:39,831 --> 01:08:40,580
their lives are.

1242
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:45,940
They're annoyed that they're subject to 
malevolence and they're annoyed that 

1243
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:49,380
they're not doing as well as other 
people are doing and that makes them up,

1244
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,470
puts them exactly into this state of 
mind.

1245
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,810
Now,
maybe with modern people,

1246
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:57,410
if you're going to kill someone because 
you're resentful as a modern person,

1247
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,990
you don't generally slay them and throw 
them into a pit.

1248
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:05,290
You know what you do is you just killed 
them slowly over a few decades and it 

1249
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:06,770
isn't obvious to me that that's any 
better.

1250
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:12,190
So I've seen plenty of married couples 
who were in that situation.

1251
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:17,540
It's like,
it's like there is this Mitch Hedberg he

1252
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,600
used to complain about Turtleneck,
said it was like being strangled by a 

1253
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,111
really weak midget,
probably really politically incorrect 

1254
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,600
jokes,
but it's a funny joke.

1255
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:31,590
So,
uh,

1256
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:37,260
and then you see,
you see relationships that are like 

1257
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:41,291
that.
It's like each person has their hands 

1258
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:43,541
around the neck of the other person,
but they don't have enough courage to 

1259
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:46,241
actually to squeeze it,
just put enough pressure on to cut the 

1260
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:50,921
circulation off a tiny bit.
So the person just gets like a die over 

1261
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:52,700
a 30 year period,
something like that.

1262
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:57,140
So yeah,
and you all laugh because,

1263
01:09:57,141 --> 01:09:58,010
you know,
it's true.

1264
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:58,700
That's why.

1265
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:04,070
And we will say some evil beast has 
devoured him,

1266
01:10:04,071 --> 01:10:08,060
which would be true actually.
It would be the evil beast that's inside

1267
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:11,270
the brothers and we shall see what will 
become of his dreams.

1268
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,560
Huh.
That's uh,

1269
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:17,860
that's interesting too because.
So they want to spite themselves because

1270
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:22,670
maybe Joseph is something special and 
then they want to spite their farther,

1271
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:26,930
which is probably not the wisest idea 
because they owe him some gratitude.

1272
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:32,050
I mean,
maybe he's acting like a pain in the 

1273
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:32,050
neck.
There's some evidence for that,

1274
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,441
but this is a little bit harsh,
but they also want to spite God just 

1275
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:36,860
like Cain did because that's what it 
means.

1276
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:40,310
We shall see what will become of his 
dreams,

1277
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:42,170
right?
Because then as soon as you're,

1278
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,880
in some sense trying to fight against 
the intuition of someone,

1279
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:48,410
the natural intuition,
if someone,

1280
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:53,411
you've set yourself up against the 
structure of being itself and so pretty 

1281
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:58,841
bad,
and Reuben heard it and he delivered 

1282
01:10:58,841 --> 01:10:58,841
them out of their hands and said,
no,

1283
01:10:58,841 --> 01:11:00,230
let us not kill them.
And Ruben said unto them,

1284
01:11:00,231 --> 01:11:03,800
shed no blood but cast him into this pit
that's in the wilderness.

1285
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,080
It's like Reuben's the good guy in this 
story.

1286
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:12,460
And uh,
and there's no water in the pit by the 

1287
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,041
way,
lay no hand upon him that he might read 

1288
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:15,041
him out of their hands

1289
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:19,280
to deliver him to his father again.
So Robin was actually trying to save him

1290
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:26,320
steady,
might read him out of their hands to 

1291
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,251
deliver them to his father again.
And it came to pass when Joseph came 

1292
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:29,100
unto his brethren that they stripped him
of his coat,

1293
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:34,850
his coat of many colors that was on him,
and they took him and cast him into a 

1294
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:36,810
pit and the pit was empty and there was 
no water in it.

1295
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:46,770
And then they sat down to eat bread and 
lifted up their eyes and looked and 

1296
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,531
behold,
a company of ishmaelites come came from 

1297
01:11:49,531 --> 01:11:52,080
Gilead with their camels bearing spices 
and bomb and murmur going to carry it 

1298
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,560
down to Egypt.
And Judah said unto his brother,

1299
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,730
how does it profit us if we kill our 
brother and conceal his blood?

1300
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:00,750
So He's,
he's the practical guy here.

1301
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:05,770
What?
Why would we kill them when we can sell 

1302
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:05,770
them?
It's like,

1303
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:10,350
come let us sell him to the ishmaelites 
and let not our hand be upon him for he 

1304
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:11,920
is our brother and our flesh and his 
brother and we're content.

1305
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:17,910
Then they're passed by the midianites 
merchantmen and they drew and lifted up 

1306
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:21,451
Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to
the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver 

1307
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:25,000
to amount that echoes through into the 
future.

1308
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:28,780
And they brought Joseph into Egypt.
I've never really sure how these slavery

1309
01:12:28,781 --> 01:12:30,450
stories work.
It's like,

1310
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,370
so it's two 2,500,
3000 years ago,

1311
01:12:33,371 --> 01:12:36,490
and I decided I'm going to sell you to 
the Israelites and that just works out.

1312
01:12:36,491 --> 01:12:41,491
They I get the money,
you get to be a slave and they take you 

1313
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:44,221
away.
I don't really understand how that 

1314
01:12:44,221 --> 01:12:45,961
works.
I can't figure out how people were just 

1315
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,791
selling each other all the time.
But maybe if you're a family you can do 

1316
01:12:48,881 --> 01:12:49,030
it.

1317
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:58,650
So there are.
They sold him and Rubin returned to the 

1318
01:12:58,691 --> 01:13:03,691
pit.
And behold Joseph was not there and 

1319
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:03,691
Rubin rant is close.
So Rubin's very upset about this.

1320
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:05,230
And he returned unto his brothers and 
said,

1321
01:13:05,231 --> 01:13:08,020
the child is not in our.
Where shall I go?

1322
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:12,220
And they conspired.
They took Joseph's coat and killed a kid

1323
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,230
of the goats and dip the code in the 
blood.

1324
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:17,320
That's interesting too,
because blood is actually another color,

1325
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:20,440
right?
So he's got this coat of many colors and

1326
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:25,590
blood is definitely a color.
And so this is the addition in some 

1327
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,370
sense of the color of blood to Joseph's 
coat.

1328
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:32,850
And I would say it's probably a 
necessary color because I don't think 

1329
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:35,710
that you're serious enough till your 
code has been dipped in blood.

1330
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,840
Now it can happen in many ways.
And they sent the coat of many colors 

1331
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,120
and they brought it to their father and 
said,

1332
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,260
so they lied to him.

1333
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,850
It's very,
very nasty business.

1334
01:13:45,851 --> 01:13:48,940
This they.
They sell his son to slavery.

1335
01:13:48,941 --> 01:13:51,610
They claim that he's dead.
They lie to them,

1336
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,970
they put them into an extreme state of 
grief.

1337
01:13:55,540 --> 01:14:00,540
There's a lot of hatred underneath that 
write a tremendous amount of hatred for 

1338
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:05,290
Joseph and also for Jacob.
This we have found no.

1339
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:08,410
Now whether it be thy son's coat or not,
and he knew it,

1340
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:10,930
he said,
it's my son's coat and evil beast,

1341
01:14:10,931 --> 01:14:14,290
has him.
Joseph is without doubt,

1342
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:19,291
rent in pieces and Jacob Torres clothes 
and put sackcloth on his loins and 

1343
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:23,131
mourned for many days.
And all his sons and daughters rose up 

1344
01:14:23,131 --> 01:14:23,131
to comfort them,
either refused to be comforted.

1345
01:14:23,131 --> 01:14:25,150
And he said,
I'll go down into my grave.

1346
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:28,010
Morning,
my son does.

1347
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:33,030
His father wept for.
So that's Jacob collapsing at the news 

1348
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:43,730
and the midianites sold Joseph into 
Egypt,

1349
01:14:43,731 --> 01:14:48,731
onto Potiphar,
an officer of Pharaohs and captain of 

1350
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:48,731
the guard,
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and

1351
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:50,210
Potiphar,
an officer of Pharaoh,

1352
01:14:50,211 --> 01:14:53,180
captain of the guard,
and the Egyptian bought him of the hands

1353
01:14:53,181 --> 01:14:55,340
of the Ishmaelites,
which had brought him down thither.

1354
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,440
So now he's a slave.

1355
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,810
So now you'd think,
well that would be,

1356
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:06,440
this is a man who has a lot of reason to
be irritated out the structure of 

1357
01:15:06,601 --> 01:15:07,350
reality,
right?

1358
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:11,280
He's gone from being the favorite to 
being betrayed by all of his brothers.

1359
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:16,430
That's pretty rough.
And then he's been transformed into a 

1360
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:18,540
slave and now he's being.
He's being sold to work as a slave.

1361
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:22,290
So you'd think that that would corrupt 
his character because you know,

1362
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,510
one of the things,
I think this is the case anyways,

1363
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:29,690
I think people are always looking for an
excuse to have their character 

1364
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:30,330
corrupted.
Because if your character is corrupted,

1365
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:35,360
then you get to lie and you get to cheat
and you get to steal and you get to be 

1366
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:35,370
trained.
You get to act resentfully and he get to

1367
01:15:35,371 --> 01:15:40,371
do nothing and that's all easy.
It's easier to lie than to tell the 

1368
01:15:40,371 --> 01:15:40,371
truth.

1369
01:15:40,371 --> 01:15:41,250
It's easier to do nothing than to do 
something.

1370
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:43,830
So there's always part of you thinking,
well,

1371
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:47,640
I need a justification for being useless
and horrible because that.

1372
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:52,700
That'd be a lot less work.
And so then if something terrible comes 

1373
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:54,260
along,
you think a high.

1374
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,540
That's just exactly the excuse that I 
was waiting for.

1375
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,380
And then out all that comes,
you know,

1376
01:16:01,381 --> 01:16:06,381
soldier should Ipsen when he was in the 
concentration camps in Russia watching 

1377
01:16:06,381 --> 01:16:07,980
how people behaved,
you know,

1378
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:12,981
he said that there were people that were
put in the camps who immediately became 

1379
01:16:12,981 --> 01:16:16,491
trustees are guards and they were even 
more vicious than the people who had 

1380
01:16:16,491 --> 01:16:19,170
been hired as guards.
And his idea was that they had collected

1381
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:22,870
all that.
He called it fallenness,

1382
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,910
if I remember correctly around them in 
normal life,

1383
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:29,640
but they didn't have the opportunity to 
express it.

1384
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,470
But as soon as you gave them the 
opportunity,

1385
01:16:31,471 --> 01:16:33,060
it was like there.
It was right away.

1386
01:16:33,061 --> 01:16:38,061
And so,
so one of the messages that seems to 

1387
01:16:38,341 --> 01:16:43,341
echo through these old testament stories
is that just because something terrible 

1388
01:16:43,681 --> 01:16:45,960
happens to you doesn't mean that you get
to be,

1389
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,840
that you get to wander off the path and 
make things worse.

1390
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:55,370
And maybe it doesn't matter how terrible
it is that what happens to you,

1391
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:57,650
that's a tough call,
you know,

1392
01:16:57,651 --> 01:17:02,651
because you see people now and then in 
life who they've really got it rough 

1393
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:03,260
man,
like 50 bad things are happening to them

1394
01:17:03,261 --> 01:17:04,520
at the same time.
And you think,

1395
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:09,730
oh,
it's no wonder if you are bitter and 

1396
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:09,730
resentful and hostile and be like,
yeah,

1397
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:13,990
no wonder.
But then you meet people and socialize 

1398
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:16,550
again,
talked about this in the Gulag 

1399
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,921
archipelago.
He said he met lots of people in not 

1400
01:17:17,921 --> 01:17:20,530
lot.
He met enough people to impress him in 

1401
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:22,850
the concentration camp system who didn't
allow their misfortunes to corrupt them.

1402
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,840
And that's something man,
because maybe the only real misfortune 

1403
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,100
is to become corrupted.
That's a really useful thing to think,

1404
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,570
you know,
maybe the rest of it,

1405
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,720
maybe the rest of it is trivial in 
comparison.

1406
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:39,440
I know that's a rough thing because you 
can be in very harsh circumstances,

1407
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:44,441
but I do think there's something to that
and the Lord was with Joseph and he was 

1408
01:17:44,441 --> 01:17:46,070
a prosperous man and he was in the house
of his master.

1409
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:51,071
The Egyptian and his master saw that the
Lord was with him and the Lord made all 

1410
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:54,881
that he did to prosper in his hand.
So that's an echo of the idea that we 

1411
01:17:54,881 --> 01:17:55,040
encountered earlier about walking with 
God.

1412
01:17:55,070 --> 01:18:00,070
Right.
So Adam walked with God before he ate 

1413
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:03,310
the fruit with eve and then he wouldn't 
walk with God and they had noah walked 

1414
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,180
with God and Abraham walked with God.
And so the idea is,

1415
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:10,420
well,
that's that alignment with the highest 

1416
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:10,420
ideal.
I think it's something like that.

1417
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:14,260
And you know,
we could think about that as a 

1418
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:15,230
metaphysical claim as well,
but I don't think it is.

1419
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:20,090
I mean,
I've got thousands of letters now in the

1420
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:24,170
last year from people who have told me 
that they were in a pit.

1421
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:30,490
That's exactly right,
and that they decided that they were 

1422
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:33,860
going to try to put their lives together
and that it worked,

1423
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,090
and so that's really something,
you know,

1424
01:18:37,091 --> 01:18:38,660
and they write surprised.
It's like,

1425
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:43,661
well,
I decided that I was going to work hard 

1426
01:18:43,661 --> 01:18:45,911
at what I was doing and I wasn't going 
to lie any more than absolutely 

1427
01:18:45,911 --> 01:18:48,791
necessary.
I thought I'd give it a try for a few 

1428
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:48,791
months,
you know,

1429
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:49,250
and all sorts of good things started to 
happen.

1430
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:54,251
To me,
it's like maybe that's how the world 

1431
01:18:54,251 --> 01:18:56,921
works now.
Obviously it doesn't work like that all 

1432
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:56,921
the time.
Right.

1433
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:57,530
Because you can get sliced off at the 
knees.

1434
01:18:57,531 --> 01:19:02,531
I mean there's an arbitrary element to 
existence that's that you can't wish 

1435
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:06,740
away,
but that doesn't mean that there are.

1436
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,000
It doesn't mean that there aren't bad 
strategies and good strategies and so I 

1437
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:18,581
do think that one of the most 
fundamental existential questions is 

1438
01:19:18,581 --> 01:19:21,791
like,
if things aren't going well for you in 

1439
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:24,041
your life is,
are you absolutely certain that you're 

1440
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:24,320
doing absolutely everything you can to 
put things in order?

1441
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:29,830
Because if you're not,
then you shouldn't complain because you 

1442
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:32,531
don't know to what degree you're 
actually contributing or even causing 

1443
01:19:32,531 --> 01:19:32,810
the circumstance.
Now,

1444
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:36,200
that's a very annoying thing to think 
and I'm not trying to blame the victim.

1445
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:41,410
You know,
I know that people end up with lung 

1446
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:41,410
cancer because they were exposed to 
asbestos,

1447
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:41,810
you know,
I'm not trying to.

1448
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:47,230
Although I also know too that if you 
have lung cancer because you've been 

1449
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:48,560
exposed to asbestos,
that can be a tragedy or it can be hell.

1450
01:19:48,561 --> 01:19:51,170
And to some degree that depends on how 
you conduct yourself.

1451
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:56,680
So I mean,
I know that's pretty gloomy 

1452
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:56,680
possibilities,
right?

1453
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,970
But so anyways,
so Joseph as a slave,

1454
01:19:58,971 --> 01:20:03,971
but it turns out that he's a,
he hasn't sacrifice the integrity of his

1455
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:07,230
character.
And so it turns out that being it out,

1456
01:20:07,231 --> 01:20:12,231
that he's not asleep,
it's just that everyone around him 

1457
01:20:12,231 --> 01:20:12,240
thinks he's a slave,
but he's not.

1458
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:17,700
So that's pretty interesting.
He was a goodly person and well favored.

1459
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:22,730
Well,
so he's a good guy and he's an 

1460
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:25,461
impressive specimen as well.
This is pretty interesting given the 

1461
01:20:25,461 --> 01:20:26,790
current political climate,
I would say,

1462
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:32,360
and it came to pass after these things 
that his master's wife cast her eyes 

1463
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,750
upon Joseph and she said,
lie with me.

1464
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,450
That means that actually has two 
meanings,

1465
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:41,451
right?
But he refused and said unto his 

1466
01:20:44,441 --> 01:20:45,820
master's wife,
behold,

1467
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:50,850
my master does not know what's with me 
in the house and he's committed all that

1468
01:20:52,121 --> 01:20:57,121
he has to my hand.
There is no one greater in this house 

1469
01:20:57,121 --> 01:21:01,291
than I.
Neither has he kept back anything from 

1470
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:04,690
me but you because you are his wife.
How then can I do this great wickedness,

1471
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,820
wickedness,
and sin against God.

1472
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:15,060
And it came to pass that she speak to 
Joseph Day by day that he harkened not 

1473
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:17,890
unto her to lie by her or be with her 
being sexually harassed.

1474
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,200
Joseph,
and it came to pass.

1475
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:21,050
Well,
it's,

1476
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,600
it's right.
I mean,

1477
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:27,601
look,
look at the painting and it came to pass

1478
01:21:31,691 --> 01:21:36,691
about this time that Joseph went into 
the house to do his business and there 

1479
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:36,790
was none of the men of the house they're
within.

1480
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,240
And she caught him by his garment saying
lie with me,

1481
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:44,050
and he left his garment in her hand and 
fled and got him out.

1482
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,590
So that's kind of embarrassing for poor 
Joseph,

1483
01:21:47,591 --> 01:21:50,950
I would say,
and a bit on the suspicious side.

1484
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:54,910
And it came to pass when she saw that he
had left his garment in her hand and was

1485
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:59,911
fled forth,
that she called unto the men of her 

1486
01:21:59,911 --> 01:21:59,911
house and spake unto them,
see,

1487
01:21:59,911 --> 01:22:01,440
see he hath brought into Hebrew 
democracy.

1488
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,430
He came in unto me,
lie with me,

1489
01:22:03,431 --> 01:22:08,431
and I cried with a loud voice.
So what is it Hell hath no fury like a 

1490
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:13,750
woman scorned.
That's the proper commentary on that.

1491
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:18,780
And it came to pass when he heard that,
I lifted up my voice and cried that he 

1492
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:19,570
left his garment with me and fled and 
got himself out.

1493
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:23,680
And it came to pass when his master 
heard the words of his wife.

1494
01:22:23,681 --> 01:22:25,780
So that's the Faro,
which he spake unto him,

1495
01:22:25,781 --> 01:22:28,690
saying,
after this manner did thy servant to me,

1496
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,170
his wrath was kindled.
And Joseph's master took him and put him

1497
01:22:32,171 --> 01:22:37,171
in prison.
A place where the king's prisoners were 

1498
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:39,870
was,
were bound and he was there in the 

1499
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:39,870
prison.
Well,

1500
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:43,021
that sort of socks.
It's like first his brothers betray him 

1501
01:22:43,021 --> 01:22:45,670
and throw him in a pit and then he gets 
made a slave,

1502
01:22:45,671 --> 01:22:49,060
which is probably better than being in 
the pit and then he becomes sort of like

1503
01:22:49,061 --> 01:22:49,850
king slave.

1504
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:52,900
So that's working out pretty well and 
now someone lies about him.

1505
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:56,050
He gets betrayed again and now it's into
the prison with them and so it's this.

1506
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,550
It's this again,
right?

1507
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:02,640
It's the same thing.
It's sisyphus up with the Rock and then 

1508
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,300
down and its order,
chaos,

1509
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:07,120
order chaos,
and then you have to think,

1510
01:23:07,121 --> 01:23:08,170
well,
are you the order?

1511
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:13,180
Are you the chaos or you the thing 
that's moving between them because 

1512
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,790
that's the right thing to be because 
otherwise you're just ordering.

1513
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:19,390
That's a really bad idea or you're just 
chaos and that's a really bad idea.

1514
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:24,700
You can be the thing that's dynamically 
mediating between them and that's what 

1515
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:29,611
he's doing,
but the Lord was with Joseph and showed 

1516
01:23:29,611 --> 01:23:31,480
him mercy and gave him favor in the 
sight of the keeper of the prison.

1517
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:34,090
That's no easy thing to do.
I would think,

1518
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:39,091
you know,
it's like you're thrown in prison and 

1519
01:23:39,091 --> 01:23:39,091
now the jailer likes you.

1520
01:23:39,091 --> 01:23:43,390
How exactly are you going to manage that
much good thing to think about because 

1521
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:43,390
you might think,
well,

1522
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:48,390
if you are really in dire straits,
how is it that you should conduct 

1523
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,421
yourself so that you have the highest 
probability of having things work out 

1524
01:23:51,421 --> 01:23:52,390
and it's not saying,
well,

1525
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:55,070
Joseph took over the thumb screw,
you know,

1526
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:58,840
and started using that on the other 
prisoners that that's not the indication

1527
01:23:58,841 --> 01:24:00,700
here at all.
It's that he's doing something.

1528
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:06,030
He's acting like a person who isn't a 
prisoner even though he's in the prison,

1529
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:09,700
just like he was acting like someone who
wasn't a slave when he was a slave,

1530
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:15,360
and so it makes you wonder who you can 
be despite the fact that other people 

1531
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:22,700
think that you're whatever you appear to
be.

1532
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,970
And the keeper of the prison committed 
to Joseph's hand.

1533
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:30,971
All the prisoners that were in the 
prison and whatsoever they did there he 

1534
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:34,121
was the doer of it.
The keeper of the prison look not to 

1535
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:36,821
anything that was under his hand because
the Lord was with him and that which he 

1536
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:36,821
did.
The Lord made it to prosper.

1537
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:44,640
So it's a repeat.
It's a repeat of exactly what happened 

1538
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,950
when he was the slave of the pharaoh,
except it's one rung deeper into hell,

1539
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:48,880
so to speak.
Right?

1540
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:50,500
So it's slave pharaoh,
adherence,

1541
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:51,910
prisoner,
jail,

1542
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,560
master.
But it doesn't matter.

1543
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:58,561
The same thing happens.
So now Joseph has imprisoned and the 

1544
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:01,651
Pharaoh has a fit one day of peak and 
throws the chief of his Butler's into 

1545
01:25:01,651 --> 01:25:05,881
prison.
And the chief of his bakers and they 

1546
01:25:05,881 --> 01:25:05,881
have a dream.
Each of them.

1547
01:25:05,881 --> 01:25:05,881
And,
uh,

1548
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:11,080
Joseph interprets the dreams,
seems to be something that he can do.

1549
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:16,410
And he tells the Butler that history 
means that the fair was going to forgive

1550
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:23,941
him and put him back in his position.
And he tells the baker that the Pharaoh 

1551
01:25:23,941 --> 01:25:26,770
isn't going to forgive him and that he's
going to take off his head and hang them

1552
01:25:26,771 --> 01:25:29,950
in a tree,
which is rather rough dream.

1553
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,930
But that is what,
that's what happens.

1554
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:37,230
So anyways,
that the baker or the Butler goes free 

1555
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:37,230
and Joseph says,
look,

1556
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:41,341
you know,
maybe you could just keep in mind the 

1557
01:25:41,341 --> 01:25:43,261
fact that I did do a bit of a favor here
and told you something that was 

1558
01:25:43,261 --> 01:25:47,761
accurate,
but the chief didn't really remember 

1559
01:25:47,761 --> 01:25:47,761
once.
He.

1560
01:25:47,761 --> 01:25:51,720
Once he was freed interpreting dreams in
prison,

1561
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:59,340
and so now the pharaoh has a dream and 
he actually asked to dreams.

1562
01:25:59,491 --> 01:26:01,530
So it's another one of those doubled 
motifs.

1563
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:06,531
So the idea is these are really 
important dreams because they came in a 

1564
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:10,190
pair and behold there came out of the 
river seven well favored kind and fat 

1565
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:14,450
flesh.
So cattle and they fed in the meadow.

1566
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:19,510
Meadow and behold,
seven other cattle came up after the 

1567
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:21,290
motor of the river ill favored and lean,
fleshed,

1568
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:25,190
starving and stood by the other cows on 
the brink of the river.

1569
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:30,340
And the ill favored and lean fleshed 
kind did eat up the seven well favored 

1570
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:34,460
and fat.
So feral it woke fair enough.

1571
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:39,461
It's pretty nasty dream.
And then he has another dream to two 

1572
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:42,560
headed home and he slept and dreamt the 
second time.

1573
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:47,561
And behold,
seven years of corn came up upon one 

1574
01:26:47,561 --> 01:26:50,321
stock rank and good and behold,
seven thin years and blasted with the 

1575
01:26:50,321 --> 01:26:54,900
east wind sprung up after them and the 
seventh thin yours devoured the seven 

1576
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:58,901
rank and full years and pharaoh woke and
beheld it was a dream and then it says a

1577
01:26:59,151 --> 01:27:02,840
little later and for that the dream was 
doubled unto Pharaoh twice.

1578
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:07,900
It is because the thing is established 
by God and God will shortly bring it to 

1579
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:11,231
pass.
It's interesting because one of the 

1580
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:14,231
better theories about dreams is that 
they're part of the way that the right 

1581
01:27:14,231 --> 01:27:16,580
and left hemisphere communicate,
or maybe the nonverbal part of the brain

1582
01:27:16,581 --> 01:27:19,220
communicates with the verbal brand,
verbal part of the brain,

1583
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,760
and so the nonverbal part of the brain 
which is less differentiated and things 

1584
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:29,750
more globally,
is looking for patterns and anomalies in

1585
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:34,751
the world.
Things that don't fit well with the 

1586
01:27:34,751 --> 01:27:34,760
current way of conceptualizing the 
world.

1587
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:36,800
Things that make you anxious and 
uncertain,

1588
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:38,780
and those are things you haven't 
mastered,

1589
01:27:38,781 --> 01:27:43,781
right?
So they don't fit well into your 

1590
01:27:43,781 --> 01:27:43,781
conception of realization of the world 
by definition.

1591
01:27:43,781 --> 01:27:46,100
Because if you had mastered them,
they wouldn't make you anxious,

1592
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:51,110
nervous,
and so the the nonverbal parts of your 

1593
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:54,401
brain or like an alarm system,
they're looking around for places where 

1594
01:27:54,401 --> 01:27:57,221
you're probably wrong and then they put 
those in images and try to conceptualize

1595
01:27:58,191 --> 01:28:02,090
them so that you can update your model 
of reality to take them into account,

1596
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:04,580
but that also produces a fair bit of 
negative emotion,

1597
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:09,760
especially at night and so,
so we know that we know if you deprive 

1598
01:28:12,891 --> 01:28:15,590
people of dreams that they go insane 
very rapidly.

1599
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:18,830
Animals as well,
necessary part of mental equilibrium.

1600
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:23,330
The way you do that with rats in case 
you want to know is that you've got rats

1601
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:25,190
that you want to drive and saying this 
is how you do it.

1602
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:30,290
So you put the rat on a like a pedestal.
It's pretty small.

1603
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,470
And then when he fall,
that's surrounded by water and then when

1604
01:28:33,471 --> 01:28:35,870
he falls asleep,
his nose hits the water.

1605
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:39,560
Then he wakes up and so you can deprive 
the route of sleep and that doesn't.

1606
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,400
The rats don't respond to that very well
after some period of time.

1607
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:48,230
So that's one of the ways that that's 
been discovered,

1608
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:53,231
but anyways,
the dream does seem to be an update 

1609
01:28:53,231 --> 01:28:53,231
mechanism and so if,
if,

1610
01:28:53,231 --> 01:28:55,430
if you have a very powerful dream,
like a nightmare,

1611
01:28:55,550 --> 01:29:00,550
especially if it's repeating,
it's like something is trying to hammer 

1612
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:03,431
on the door that needs to be let in and 
often you don't know how to let it in 

1613
01:29:03,431 --> 01:29:04,170
and that's,
that's a problem.

1614
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:09,710
So then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph 
because he had talked to his,

1615
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,170
his butler,
and they brought them hastily out of the

1616
01:29:13,171 --> 01:29:18,171
dungeon and Joseph shaved himself and 
changed his clothes and came in unto 

1617
01:29:18,171 --> 01:29:22,161
Pharaoh.
I guess he didn't want to shock pharaoh 

1618
01:29:22,161 --> 01:29:23,760
with how people dressed in a prison.
And Pharaoh said Unto Joseph,

1619
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:26,040
I've dreamed a dream and there's none 
that can interpret it.

1620
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,950
I've heard safety that you can 
understand a dream to interpret it.

1621
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:30,780
And Joseph said,
it's not me.

1622
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:34,560
God will give Pharaoh announcer of 
peace.

1623
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:39,210
It's so Jacob isn't taking credit for 
his ability to interpret dreams,

1624
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,280
which also indicates quite 
interestingly,

1625
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:42,650
there's,
there's nothing to,

1626
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,810
despite the fact that he's successful 
and competent,

1627
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:49,080
he's not narcissistic.
If he happens to have this gift,

1628
01:29:49,081 --> 01:29:52,440
he regards it as a gift and not as 
something that you.

1629
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:57,700
He renounced his favorites,
just something that he happens to be 

1630
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:57,700
able to do,
and so that's,

1631
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:02,300
that's a hallmark of someone who's got a
pretty well put together personality as 

1632
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:06,471
far as I'm concerned because you know 
people have gifts that they didn't 

1633
01:30:06,871 --> 01:30:08,730
really earn.
Those will be your talents,

1634
01:30:08,731 --> 01:30:13,731
your intelligence,
your good looks if you happen to have 

1635
01:30:13,731 --> 01:30:13,731
good looks,
etc.

1636
01:30:13,731 --> 01:30:17,750
And they're not.
There's no sense being All puffed up 

1637
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:18,540
about that because it's.
It's great.

1638
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:23,541
It's luck of the draw though,
and the proper attitude is to note that 

1639
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:24,270
it's luck of the draw and to be grateful
for it.

1640
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:35,850
It's quite a fine painting that one hold
there.

1641
01:30:36,971 --> 01:30:41,971
Come seven years of great,
plenty throughout the island of Egypt 

1642
01:30:41,971 --> 01:30:43,090
and then there shall arise after seven 
years of famine and all the plenti shall

1643
01:30:43,091 --> 01:30:48,091
be forgotten and the famine shall 
consume the land and the plenty shall 

1644
01:30:48,091 --> 01:30:51,751
not be known in the land by reason of 
that famine following for it shall be 

1645
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:51,751
very grievous.

1646
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:56,230
So now we see to that jacob.
Well,

1647
01:30:56,231 --> 01:30:58,900
he can interpret dreams,
but he's also the sort of person who can

1648
01:30:58,901 --> 01:31:03,901
look into the future and think this is 
sort of what adam was called on to do 

1649
01:31:03,901 --> 01:31:08,790
when he got kicked out of the garden of 
paradise is you're going to be able to 

1650
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:12,421
conceptualize that even if things are 
going well now that that doesn't mean 

1651
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:13,300
that they're going to go well into the 
future.

1652
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:18,660
And so he's The ant and the grasshopper,
right in the grasshopper and the ants 

1653
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:20,080
story.
It's like everything's good,

1654
01:31:20,081 --> 01:31:25,081
but you should wake the hell up and you 
should test to see how things can go 

1655
01:31:25,081 --> 01:31:28,390
wrong and you can see if your systems 
can survive them.

1656
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:33,420
Things going wrong and which is 
something that I think we could all 

1657
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:38,130
harken tube because I think we do a very
bad job in the modern world of testing 

1658
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:41,671
to see if our systems can go wrong.
Okay.

1659
01:31:42,891 --> 01:31:47,891
So the pharaoh was pretty impressed by 
this dream interpretation and pretty 

1660
01:31:47,891 --> 01:31:47,900
worried about it and I guess he's a 
reasonable person,

1661
01:31:47,901 --> 01:31:49,910
despite the fact that he put joseph in 
jail,

1662
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:50,940
uh,
gifts.

1663
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:53,840
He didn't have much choice.
Now therefore,

1664
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:58,550
let pharaoh look for a man discreet and 
wise and set him over the land of Egypt.

1665
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:01,720
Let pharaoh do this and let him appoint 
officers over the land.

1666
01:32:01,721 --> 01:32:06,721
This is what joseph was saying,
and take up the fifth part of the land 

1667
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:07,990
of Egypt in the seven plenteous years

1668
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:15,810
and let them gather all the food of 
those good years that come and lay up 

1669
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:16,450
corn under the hand of pharaoh and let 
them keep food in the cities

1670
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,400
and just like that joseph has restored 
to his position.

1671
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:25,900
So pharaoh said unto joseph,
I am pharaoh,

1672
01:32:25,901 --> 01:32:30,901
and without these shall no man lifted up
his hand or foot in all of the land of 

1673
01:32:30,901 --> 01:32:34,150
Egypt,
and so he comes out of the prison and he

1674
01:32:34,151 --> 01:32:35,500
really,
in some sense,

1675
01:32:35,501 --> 01:32:40,501
as far as I'm concerned,
he actually occupies a position that's 

1676
01:32:40,501 --> 01:32:41,890
higher than the position of the pharaoh.
It depends on how you look at it because

1677
01:32:41,891 --> 01:32:44,560
the pharaoh is relegated himself to 
ceremonial status,

1678
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,290
right?
Joseph has all the responsibility,

1679
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,510
makes all the decisions.
So defacto,

1680
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:53,410
he's the pharaoh.
He doesn't get the glory precisely,

1681
01:32:53,411 --> 01:32:55,180
although he's not doing too bad for 
himself.

1682
01:32:55,420 --> 01:33:00,420
Now there's a lesson in that too.
I wrote these rules for corp a long time

1683
01:33:00,881 --> 01:33:03,580
ago and one of them,
I have written them into this,

1684
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:06,250
some of them into this book you guys got
a pamphlet about today.

1685
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:08,380
One of the rules that I didn't write 
about was,

1686
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:14,400
um,
note that responsive it note that 

1687
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,310
opportunity lurks where responsibility 
has been abdicated,

1688
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:17,680
which is really interesting.
I think.

1689
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:20,050
I mean,
I've seen people in their jobs,

1690
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:21,040
they say things like,
well,

1691
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:24,760
my guy worked with doesn't do any work.
It's like,

1692
01:33:24,761 --> 01:33:25,720
well,
you could do it.

1693
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,000
I mean,
I know there's limits to that,

1694
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:31,720
but one of their things you can do at 
work is make yourself indispensable.

1695
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:34,990
I mean,
you might get the cane types against you

1696
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:40,290
if you do that,
but there's something to be said for 

1697
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:42,541
being indispensable because when people 
start to be dispensed with you probably 

1698
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:44,740
won't be one of them.
Or even If you are,

1699
01:33:44,741 --> 01:33:47,830
then the fact that you're indispensable 
just means you can go somewhere else and

1700
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:50,530
be indispensable there.
Now it's just as useful.

1701
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:55,950
So it's very,
very difficult to permanently put down 

1702
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:02,100
someone who's really good at doing 
things because they can just go off and 

1703
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:06,151
do them somewhere else.
And one of the ways that you get like 

1704
01:34:06,151 --> 01:34:09,241
that is to take responsibility when 
someone else is failing to do so and you

1705
01:34:09,941 --> 01:34:10,330
think,
well,

1706
01:34:10,331 --> 01:34:12,700
I shouldn't have to do that.
That's one way of thinking about it.

1707
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,680
Another way of thinking about it is,
oh good,

1708
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:15,640
I get to do that.

1709
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:21,250
And the seven years of plenty isness 
that was in the land of Egypt were ended

1710
01:34:21,251 --> 01:34:25,060
in the seven years of dearth began to 
come according as joseph has said.

1711
01:34:27,190 --> 01:34:29,890
And the dearth was in all the lands.
Well,

1712
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:32,320
that's an archetypal story,
right?

1713
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:35,440
The archetypal story.
It's the business cycle story.

1714
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:38,230
It's a little harsher when you're 
starving,

1715
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:39,790
obviously,
but that's not the point.

1716
01:34:39,791 --> 01:34:44,791
The point is,
is that sometimes things are getting 

1717
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:47,791
good and sometimes things are getting 
bad and that's you can be sure that 

1718
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:49,030
that's the case that's going to happen 
to you.

1719
01:34:49,031 --> 01:34:54,031
And so the wise person takes stock of 
the fact that things are going to get 

1720
01:34:54,521 --> 01:34:59,521
bad.
Is this is the same thing that happens 

1721
01:34:59,521 --> 01:35:01,921
with noah?
It's like assume the flood because it's 

1722
01:35:01,921 --> 01:35:02,870
going to happen and you think,
well,

1723
01:35:02,871 --> 01:35:05,930
it's a hell of a world that has floods.
It's not if you have a boat,

1724
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,050
right?
It helps a lot.

1725
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:10,640
If if there's a flood and you have a 
boat,

1726
01:35:10,641 --> 01:35:14,330
it's like you can float on the flood and
then it's not such a problem,

1727
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:19,540
and so if you refuse to look out the 
fact that things are going to be going 

1728
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:26,180
downhill badly and that you're going to 
be in a pit at some point,

1729
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:30,920
you and your family perhaps then when it
happens,

1730
01:35:30,921 --> 01:35:35,921
it will be as bad as it possibly can be,
but if you're awake and alert to that 

1731
01:35:37,311 --> 01:35:40,070
possibility,
then you can mitigate it.

1732
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:48,200
And the dearth was in all the lands.
But in the land of Egypt there was bread

1733
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:53,530
and when the land of Egypt was famished,
the people cried to pharaoh for bread 

1734
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:54,320
and pharaoh said unto the egyptians,
go to joseph.

1735
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:55,730
What?
He says to you too,

1736
01:35:55,731 --> 01:35:59,090
do you do that?
And the fireman was all over the face of

1737
01:35:59,091 --> 01:35:59,980
the earth.
And joe boo,

1738
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:02,990
joseph opened up the store houses and 
sold to the egyptians,

1739
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:07,070
and the feminine waxed sore in the land 
of Egypt and all the countries came into

1740
01:36:07,071 --> 01:36:12,071
Egypt to buy to joseph to buy corn 
because the famine was soaring all the 

1741
01:36:12,921 --> 01:36:15,110
lands.
Now,

1742
01:36:15,111 --> 01:36:17,480
when jacob saw that there was corn in 
Egypt,

1743
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:22,690
jacob said unto his sons,
why are you standing around looking at 

1744
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:22,790
each other?
He said,

1745
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:28,060
I've heard that there's corn in Egypt.
Get down there and I from a buyer for us

1746
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:30,260
so that we may live and not die.

1747
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:35,410
It's pretty straightforward advice that.
And joseph's 10 brothers went down to 

1748
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:38,450
buy corn in Egypt,
but benjamin,

1749
01:36:38,451 --> 01:36:40,520
joseph's brother.
So that's the youngest one,

1750
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:41,510
right?
The only one left.

1751
01:36:41,511 --> 01:36:43,820
That's the one that was younger than 
joseph.

1752
01:36:43,821 --> 01:36:47,240
The only youngest one,
and also rachel's other son.

1753
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:52,480
But Jeff Benjamin,
joseph's brother jacob didn't send 

1754
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,890
because he was worried that something 
bad would happen to him,

1755
01:36:54,891 --> 01:36:59,891
which kind of indicates to me that maybe
jacob was a bit suspicious about what 

1756
01:36:59,891 --> 01:37:04,241
had happened to joseph the last time he 
sent all the brothers on a adventure.

1757
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,110
Joseph was the governor over all the 
land and and he,

1758
01:37:09,111 --> 01:37:14,111
It was that sold to all the people of 
the land in joseph's brothers came and 

1759
01:37:14,111 --> 01:37:15,350
bowed down themselves before him with 
their faces to the earth.

1760
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:19,520
While there's the dream.
Now the thing is too,

1761
01:37:19,521 --> 01:37:24,521
is that one question you have in your 
life is who should you bow down to?

1762
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:30,700
And you might say no one,
but that's not exactly the right answer 

1763
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:34,361
because that means that you don't have 
an ideal because you bow down to your 

1764
01:37:34,361 --> 01:37:34,361
ideal.
That's what makes it an ideal.

1765
01:37:34,361 --> 01:37:36,650
And if you don't have an ideal,
then what the hell are you going to do?

1766
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:40,730
So you have to bow down to something.
And so what happens here as well,

1767
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:46,780
the brothers are bowing down to the 
person who is so bloody resilient and 

1768
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:50,201
competent that they can take themselves 
out of a prison and become the ruler of 

1769
01:37:50,201 --> 01:37:51,890
the land that happened to vaclav havel,
right in czechoslovakia.

1770
01:37:51,891 --> 01:37:53,600
It also happened to,
um,

1771
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:56,130
mandela,
South Africa,

1772
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:59,640
like these things actually happened.
It's really something.

1773
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,760
So you'd,
god only knows what you might learn in 

1774
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:04,760
prison.
So,

1775
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:10,620
so they bow down to joseph and properly 
so you know he's,

1776
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:15,800
he is even without his coat,
he's still the person with a coat of 

1777
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,610
many colors and joseph saw his brothers 
and he knew them,

1778
01:38:17,611 --> 01:38:19,500
but he made themselves strange onto 
them.

1779
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:22,660
It's a number of years have passed and 
he spoke roughly onto the mini,

1780
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,480
said down to them,
where do you Come from?

1781
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:27,600
And they said,
from the land of canaan to buy food.

1782
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:31,080
And joseph knew whose brothers were but 
they didn't know who he was

1783
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:38,960
and they came back to jacob their father
and told him all that and said,

1784
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:42,530
the man who is lord of the country spoke
roughly to us and took us for spies.

1785
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:44,600
And we said to him,
we're,

1786
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:46,250
we're true,
man.

1787
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:49,160
Honest man were not spies.
We be 12 brothers,

1788
01:38:49,161 --> 01:38:51,410
sons of our fathers.
One is not.

1789
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:55,190
And the youngest is this day with our 
father in the land of canaan.

1790
01:38:56,180 --> 01:39:00,380
And the man said,
here's how I'll know that you're honest,

1791
01:39:00,381 --> 01:39:05,381
man.
Leave one of the brothers here with me 

1792
01:39:05,381 --> 01:39:05,750
and take some food for the famine of 
your households and be gone.

1793
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:07,940
And then bring your youngest brother to 
me.

1794
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,710
Then I'll know that you're not spies,
but that you're honest,

1795
01:39:11,711 --> 01:39:16,711
man,
and I'll deliver the other brother and 

1796
01:39:16,711 --> 01:39:17,740
you shall trade in the lounge so you 
don't have to starve to death.

1797
01:39:17,741 --> 01:39:22,741
And it came to pass as they emptied 
their sacks that behold every man's 

1798
01:39:22,741 --> 01:39:25,150
bundle of money in his sock.
And when both say in their fathers,

1799
01:39:25,151 --> 01:39:26,830
saw the bundles of money,
they were afraid.

1800
01:39:26,831 --> 01:39:31,831
So they had bought food from joseph and 
he gave them the food and then he put 

1801
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:36,211
all their money back in their socks,
which I can imagine would worry them to 

1802
01:39:36,211 --> 01:39:37,860
some degree.
and jacob said,

1803
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:43,460
me,
you have already bereaved of my 

1804
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:43,460
childrEn.
Joseph is not as is.

1805
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:43,510
Not now.
You'll take benjamin,

1806
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:46,360
benjamin away.
All these things are against me.

1807
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:48,850
And ruben spake unto his father,
saying,

1808
01:39:48,851 --> 01:39:51,100
slay my two sons.
If I bring him not to the,

1809
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:53,740
deliver them into my hand and I will 
bring them to the again

1810
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:56,580
and he.
And he said,

1811
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:01,640
nope.
My son shall not go down with you for 

1812
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:01,640
his brother is dead.
And he's left alone.

1813
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:04,290
If mischief befall him by the way in 
which you shall go,

1814
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:07,470
then you shall bring down my greer or 
gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

1815
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:11,850
Now there's a hand.
See what happens in the last part of the

1816
01:40:11,851 --> 01:40:13,980
jacob storage.
The joseph story is,

1817
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:19,130
and this is associated with the idea of 
putting your house in order your 

1818
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:23,331
individual house in order,
and then putting your family's house in 

1819
01:40:23,331 --> 01:40:23,331
order.
Let's say it's reversed a little bit,

1820
01:40:23,331 --> 01:40:28,000
this story because joseph puts himself 
together and then he puts the state of 

1821
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,180
of Egypt in order,
which is really quite interesting 

1822
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:33,990
because Egypt is the canonical tyranny 
right in the old testament.

1823
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:39,290
And so the idea is very,
very clear here that the person who 

1824
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:41,070
wears the coat of many colors can put 
the tyranny right,

1825
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:45,210
and then the next extension as well,
he has to put his family right now.

1826
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:50,210
You know,
generally the progression would be put 

1827
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:50,210
yourself right.
Then put your family right,

1828
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:50,580
then put the state right,
something like that.

1829
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:53,010
It doesn't really.
If you can do it in a different order,

1830
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:56,120
that's probably okay too.
But so,

1831
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:58,540
so that's what happens at the end of the
story is that,

1832
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:03,960
you know,
joseph is doing pretty damn well and so 

1833
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,070
is the state that he serves,
but that isn't good enough for him.

1834
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:11,430
He wants his family to be functional and
put together properly even though they 

1835
01:41:12,731 --> 01:41:17,450
did terrible things to him.
And that's very interesting because once

1836
01:41:17,451 --> 01:41:22,451
someone does terrible things to you,
then the logical thing or a logical 

1837
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:24,070
thing to think as well go to hell in a 
hand basket.

1838
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,280
You know,
like you,

1839
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,880
you deserve exactly what you get,
but

1840
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:36,720
it's not a very productive attitude,
especially if you're around people that 

1841
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,780
you have to be around,
you know.

1842
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:42,840
So like if it's your family and you go 
have a family dinner and one of you 

1843
01:41:43,031 --> 01:41:45,070
punches the other and then the other 
punches you back,

1844
01:41:45,071 --> 01:41:47,650
and then that's like the family dinner 
for the next 30 years.

1845
01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:52,890
It doesn't seem to be very productive.
Even if you're the person who happened 

1846
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:56,041
to get into the last blow because you're
going to have to put up with them at 

1847
01:41:56,041 --> 01:41:59,941
minimum.
It might be nice to just let what you 

1848
01:41:59,941 --> 01:42:02,740
can go go and work to make towards 
making things better.

1849
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:08,040
You have to get rid of the idea of 
revenge and resentment and all those 

1850
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:08,040
things that you carry along,
but,

1851
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:17,450
but it's probably better to think about 
how your family could be if it was 

1852
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:19,830
really functioning well and then just 
aim unerringly of that.

1853
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:25,080
I know that's not easy.
I mean people are very screwy and 

1854
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:28,860
there's no end to the depths of 
pathology within families,

1855
01:42:28,861 --> 01:42:32,130
but of course this story states that 
very clearly.

1856
01:42:32,131 --> 01:42:36,060
I mean they tried to kill them.
They sold him into slavery.

1857
01:42:36,061 --> 01:42:38,430
It's,
it's a pathological family,

1858
01:42:38,431 --> 01:42:39,590
let's put it that way.
And,

1859
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:43,470
but joseph's attitude is,
well,

1860
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:46,980
we got to set this right,
not least because of his father,

1861
01:42:46,981 --> 01:42:49,310
but it isn't only because of his father.
As you see,

1862
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:54,380
as the story unfolds and the famine was 
sore in the land and it came to pass 

1863
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:56,130
when they had eaten up the court in 
which they had brought out of Egypt,

1864
01:42:56,131 --> 01:42:59,460
their father said unto them,
go again and bias a little food.

1865
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:02,190
And judah spake unto him,
saying,

1866
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:07,290
the man did solidly protest on you,
not you will not see my face except your

1867
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:12,291
brother be with you.
They can't go back to Egypt without 

1868
01:43:12,291 --> 01:43:12,360
benjamin.
And they said,

1869
01:43:12,510 --> 01:43:16,160
the man asked is straightly of our eight
other kindred saying,

1870
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:18,470
is your father yet alive?
Have you another brother?

1871
01:43:18,710 --> 01:43:21,140
And we told them according to the tenor 
of those words,

1872
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:24,800
could we know that he would say,
bring your brother down?

1873
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:27,440
and judas said unto Israel,
his father,

1874
01:43:27,441 --> 01:43:29,540
send the lab with me and will arise and 
go,

1875
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:34,541
that we may live and not die.
Both we and vowel and also our little 

1876
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:34,820
ones,
I will be surety for him.

1877
01:43:35,690 --> 01:43:38,620
My hand shell,
they'll require him if I bring them onto

1878
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:42,080
the inset them before the lesson.
Let me bear the blame forever.

1879
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:47,400
Well,
so judah who played a pretty dismal role

1880
01:43:47,401 --> 01:43:52,401
in the original selling joseph into 
seems to obviously have learned 

1881
01:43:53,571 --> 01:43:57,440
something by this point since he's 
willing to put himself on the line,

1882
01:43:57,710 --> 01:43:59,840
you know,
to take responsibility for the situation

1883
01:43:59,841 --> 01:44:03,350
and to put himself on the line and to 
stand in for benjamin.

1884
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,860
So he's making himself into a 
sacrificial object of sorts,

1885
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:12,160
and so the game that joseph's playing,
because he sort of teasing his brothers,

1886
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:18,260
but he's also testing them.
The game that he's playing is twofold.

1887
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:23,360
One is have you bloody well learned 
anything or are you just as corrupt and 

1888
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:24,530
useless as you were before?
That's game number one.

1889
01:44:24,531 --> 01:44:29,531
Then game number two is maybe if I poke 
and prod you and put you into a 

1890
01:44:29,531 --> 01:44:30,890
relatively difficult and mysterious 
situation,

1891
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:36,130
I can get you to clue the hell in and 
adopt some responsibility and we can 

1892
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:36,710
move this whole mess forward.

1893
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:41,690
And so that seems to be happening.
So judah is taking responsibility.

1894
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:44,840
And ruben did that as well and the men 
took presence and they took double money

1895
01:44:44,841 --> 01:44:49,841
in their hand and Benjamin Rose up and 
went down to Egypt and stood before 

1896
01:44:49,841 --> 01:44:51,530
joseph.
When joseph saw benjamin with them,

1897
01:44:51,531 --> 01:44:56,531
he said to the ruler of his house,
bring these men home and slay and make 

1898
01:44:56,531 --> 01:44:58,580
ready food for these men shall dine with
me at noon.

1899
01:44:58,581 --> 01:45:03,581
And the men mandate is joseph bade in 
the man brought them in into joseph's 

1900
01:45:03,581 --> 01:45:05,090
house.
And when joseph came home,

1901
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:08,420
they brought them the presence which was
in their hand and bowed themselves again

1902
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:11,240
to him,
to the earth,

1903
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:13,430
and he asked them of their welfare and 
said,

1904
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:16,910
is your father well,
the old man of whom you speak is whom he

1905
01:45:16,911 --> 01:45:20,180
spake as a yet alive.
And they answered thy servant,

1906
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:22,580
our father is in good health.
He's yet alive.

1907
01:45:22,581 --> 01:45:24,910
And they bow down their heads and made 
obeisance.

1908
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,550
And he lifted up his eyes and saw his 
brother benjamin,

1909
01:45:31,551 --> 01:45:33,590
his mother's son,
and said,

1910
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:36,320
is this your younger brother,
of whom you speak unto me?

1911
01:45:36,321 --> 01:45:37,760
And he said,
god,

1912
01:45:37,761 --> 01:45:42,761
be gracious unto thee.
My son and joseph made haste for his 

1913
01:45:42,761 --> 01:45:43,970
bowels,
did urine upon his brother,

1914
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:48,380
and he sought were to weep.
And he entered into his chamber and wept

1915
01:45:48,381 --> 01:45:53,381
there.
And he washed his face and went out and 

1916
01:45:53,381 --> 01:45:53,381
reframed himself and said,
set on the bread.

1917
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:58,630
And they sat before them.
Now he plays another trick on his 

1918
01:45:58,630 --> 01:45:58,630
brother.
So he has them all sit at the table,

1919
01:45:58,630 --> 01:46:02,290
but he lines them up according to age.
And so he started to.

1920
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:08,590
What is he trying to do?
Sort of freaked them out fundamentally 

1921
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:13,300
and so at an imanage is that because 
they have no idea how in the world they 

1922
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:16,871
could possibly he could possibly pull 
something like that or if they think 

1923
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:19,691
it's magic and the men marveled at one 
another and he took and sent messages 

1924
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:24,720
unto them from before him,
but benjamin's mess was five times as 

1925
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:24,720
much as any of theirs.

1926
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:26,660
So what's he doing?
Well,

1927
01:46:26,661 --> 01:46:31,661
he's testing his brothers again.
The fact that when he was the child 

1928
01:46:31,971 --> 01:46:35,630
joseph,
that he got more meant that his brothers

1929
01:46:35,631 --> 01:46:37,910
got terribly Jealous and then murderous.
Right?

1930
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:40,100
And so now he's doing the same thing 
with benjamin.

1931
01:46:40,101 --> 01:46:40,850
He's thinking,
okay,

1932
01:46:40,851 --> 01:46:45,851
well I'll give this kid more than his 
share and a watch how these reprobates 

1933
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:55,010
and see if they've learned anything and 
so and he commanded the steward of his 

1934
01:46:55,111 --> 01:47:00,111
house saying,
fill the men sock with food as much as 

1935
01:47:00,111 --> 01:47:00,990
they can carry and put every man's money
in the sock as well.

1936
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:06,230
And put my cup,
the silver cup in the sax mouth of the 

1937
01:47:06,230 --> 01:47:08,931
youngest and his corn money.
And the steWard did according to the 

1938
01:47:08,931 --> 01:47:10,710
word that joseph had spoken.
As soon as the morning was light,

1939
01:47:10,711 --> 01:47:14,100
the men were sent away along with their 
transportation.

1940
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:20,760
The big cup is found in benjamin sack.
Well,

1941
01:47:20,761 --> 01:47:23,580
so benjamin's kinda young.
And

1942
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:31,800
joseph sends out people to find out 
where the company's going and they find 

1943
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,660
it in benjamin's,
in benjamin sock.

1944
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:39,540
And they're very upset about this.
They said that a harsh punishment would 

1945
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:41,500
be fall.
Whoever had the cop in his sack,

1946
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:47,070
they rent their clothes and late at 
every man his ass and returned to this 

1947
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:50,071
city and judah and his brothers came to 
joseph's house for he was out there and 

1948
01:47:50,071 --> 01:47:53,140
they fell before I'm on the ground,
very unhappy and apologetic.

1949
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:56,320
And joseph said unto them,
what need is this that you have done?

1950
01:47:56,380 --> 01:48:01,210
I don't you know that a man like I can 
certainly divine.

1951
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:04,000
I know what's going on.
And she would've said,

1952
01:48:04,001 --> 01:48:05,800
what shall we say?
What shall we speak?

1953
01:48:05,801 --> 01:48:07,900
Or how could we possibly clear 
ourselves?

1954
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:10,630
God found out the iniquity of thy 
servants.

1955
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:15,900
Behold we are your servants,
both we and also he with whom the cup is

1956
01:48:16,211 --> 01:48:19,980
found and he said,
god forbid that I should do so,

1957
01:48:19,981 --> 01:48:24,981
but the man in whose cup and whose hand 
the companies found he shall be my 

1958
01:48:24,991 --> 01:48:26,310
servant.
And as for you,

1959
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:31,760
get you up in peace to your father.
It's the discovery of the cup.

1960
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:40,220
Judah says,
now,

1961
01:48:40,221 --> 01:48:42,140
therefore,
when I come to this servant,

1962
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:47,141
my father,
my father and the loud be not with us 

1963
01:48:47,141 --> 01:48:47,141
and seeing that his life is bound up in 
the clouds.

1964
01:48:47,141 --> 01:48:48,470
Life.
It shall come to pass.

1965
01:48:48,471 --> 01:48:50,420
When he sees that the loud is not with 
us,

1966
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:55,750
that he will die and the servant shall 
bring down the gray hairs of thy 

1967
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:57,140
servant.
Our father with sorrow to the grave,

1968
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:01,220
for thy servant became security for the 
latin to my father saying,

1969
01:49:01,221 --> 01:49:04,340
if I bring him not unto thee,
then I shall bear the blame too.

1970
01:49:04,341 --> 01:49:07,070
My father forever.
Now therefore I pray thee.

1971
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:12,250
Let me stay instead of the lab and let 
the lord go with his brothers for how 

1972
01:49:13,311 --> 01:49:16,730
shall I go up to my brother and allowed 
to be not with me.

1973
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:22,720
Let's pair adventure.
I shall see the evil that will come on 

1974
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:22,720
my father.

1975
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:22,720
Okay,
so what's happened?

1976
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:23,660
Well,
they learned their lesson.

1977
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:29,620
So now judah again is willing to stand 
in the place of benjamin and become a 

1978
01:49:30,471 --> 01:49:35,471
slave himself.
And so now joseph has determined that 

1979
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:41,200
his brothers have developed their 
character to the point where 

1980
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,490
reconciliation might be possible.
You know,

1981
01:49:43,491 --> 01:49:48,491
it says you should forgive and forget,
but the conditions for that are quite,

1982
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:53,230
are quite specific.
You know,

1983
01:49:53,231 --> 01:49:55,300
if you're,
if you have a dispute with someone,

1984
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:58,960
they've wronged you in some sense and 
they apologize.

1985
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,110
The question is,
well,

1986
01:50:00,111 --> 01:50:01,920
what's the apology?
Well,

1987
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:05,110
it's a layout of a rationale.
It's something like,

1988
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:10,620
as far as I can tell,
here's the reasons I did this horrible 

1989
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:13,621
thing and here's what I've learned from 
it and here's what I'm going to do to 

1990
01:50:13,621 --> 01:50:17,971
try not to do it again.
And would you give me another crack at 

1991
01:50:17,971 --> 01:50:19,270
it?
That's the proper repentance,

1992
01:50:19,271 --> 01:50:19,570
right?

1993
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:22,120
And then you forgive because you're an 
idiot too,

1994
01:50:22,121 --> 01:50:27,121
and you'll probably do something stupid 
and maybe you'd like the same kind of 

1995
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:28,030
break at some point.
And and besides,

1996
01:50:28,031 --> 01:50:33,031
if we all held each other completely to 
Account at all possible times for 

1997
01:50:33,031 --> 01:50:34,900
everything,
then it just be hopeless because there'd

1998
01:50:34,901 --> 01:50:39,250
be no room for error.
So if forgiveness,

1999
01:50:39,251 --> 01:50:41,890
which joseph is showing is why is 
forgiveness,

2000
01:50:41,891 --> 01:50:46,891
he's not going to put himself out on the
line for people who haven't learned so 

2001
01:50:46,891 --> 01:50:50,821
that the same stupid thing can happen 
again so that they can continue to 

2002
01:50:50,821 --> 01:50:53,791
spread misery wherever they go.
He's going to find out if they've clued 

2003
01:50:53,791 --> 01:50:56,851
in a little bit and then if so,
then they can move on with putting a 

2004
01:50:56,851 --> 01:50:58,990
family together.
And so that breaks them up.

2005
01:50:58,991 --> 01:51:00,460
He says,
joseph could not refrain.

2006
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:04,300
Refrain himself before all of them that 
stood by him and he cried.

2007
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:08,620
And then he said,
get every man away from me.

2008
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:14,890
So all the people except for joseph's 
brother left and there stood no man with

2009
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:17,200
him while joseph made himself known unto
his brothers.

2010
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:22,390
Joseph said,
I'm joseph is my father is still alive.

2011
01:51:23,170 --> 01:51:26,560
And his brothers could not answer for 
they were troubled at his presence.

2012
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:28,630
It's like,
yeah,

2013
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:37,600
understatement of the decade there.
And joseph said unto his brothers,

2014
01:51:37,601 --> 01:51:39,040
come near to me.
I pray you.

2015
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:40,900
And they came near and he said,
I am joseph,

2016
01:51:40,901 --> 01:51:42,430
your brother,
whom you sold into Egypt,

2017
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:47,470
but don't be grieved or angry with 
yourself that you sold me hither for god

2018
01:51:47,471 --> 01:51:52,471
did send me before you to preserve life.
So now it was not you that sent me here 

2019
01:51:53,021 --> 01:51:55,930
but god,
and he's made me a father to pharaoh and

2020
01:51:55,931 --> 01:51:58,840
lord of all his house in a ruler 
throughout all the land of Egypt.

2021
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:01,990
Hurry and go to my father and say unto 
him,

2022
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:07,000
thus say they son joseph,
god has made me lord of all Egypt.

2023
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:12,210
Come down onto me and terry naught and 
thou shall dwell in the land of goshen 

2024
01:52:13,871 --> 01:52:18,871
and now shall be near unto me,
thou and thy children and their 

2025
01:52:18,871 --> 01:52:19,060
children's children and their flocks and
herds and all that thou hast.

2026
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:23,710
And either I will nourish you for yet 
there are five years of famine,

2027
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:27,010
less dow and I household and all that.
Thou has come to poverty,

2028
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:32,660
so that's the other thing that another 
bit of a hint that the bread hint here,

2029
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:40,360
who's the what's the most reliable 
source of bread?

2030
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:42,070
Well,
it isn't bread itself.

2031
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:46,670
It's whatever it is that gives rise to 
bread and what joseph is in this story.

2032
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:50,090
He's the force that gives ride rise to 
nourishment.

2033
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:54,500
That's an joseph is often considered a 
type of christ,

2034
01:52:54,501 --> 01:52:57,090
which means like a precursor in some 
sense that's.

2035
01:52:57,170 --> 01:53:00,060
That's one way of thinking about it and 
you can see that echoed right there.

2036
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:01,700
It's like,
well,

2037
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:04,850
what do you store up for?
Famine.

2038
01:53:04,851 --> 01:53:08,780
You store up character.
That's the best way through.

2039
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:15,280
Now that doesn't mean you don't also 
store up bread and they went out of 

2040
01:53:15,771 --> 01:53:20,771
egyPt and came into the land of canaan 
unto jacob and told him joseph is still 

2041
01:53:20,771 --> 01:53:23,150
alive and he's governor and jacob's 
heart fainted for he didn't believe them

2042
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:25,100
and they told him all the words of 
joseph,

2043
01:53:25,101 --> 01:53:27,380
which he said to them,
and when he saw the wagons,

2044
01:53:27,381 --> 01:53:29,870
which joseph had sent to carry him,
the spirit of jacob,

2045
01:53:29,871 --> 01:53:33,350
their father revived and Israel said,
it has enough.

2046
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,830
Joseph,
my son is he had live.

2047
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:39,850
I will go and see him before I die,
and Israel took his journey with all 

2048
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:43,421
that he had and came to beersheba and 
offered sacrifices unto the god of his 

2049
01:53:43,421 --> 01:53:46,991
father,
isaac and god spake unto Israel in the 

2050
01:53:46,991 --> 01:53:46,991
visions of the night and said,
jacob,

2051
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:48,620
and he said,
here am I.

2052
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:49,940
He said,
I am god,

2053
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:53,300
the god of my father.
Don't fear to go to each down into Egypt

2054
01:53:53,301 --> 01:53:56,060
for I will make you a great nation 
there.

2055
01:53:56,061 --> 01:53:59,390
And so that's how the israelites ended 
up in Egypt.

2056
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:04,930
I will go down with the into Egypt and I
will also surely bring the up again and 

2057
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:08,750
jacob shall put his hand upon his dies 
and Jacob Rose up from beersheba and the

2058
01:54:08,751 --> 01:54:13,751
sons of Israel carry jacob their father 
and the little ones and their wives in 

2059
01:54:13,751 --> 01:54:14,030
the wagons which pharaoh had sent to 
carry.

2060
01:54:14,810 --> 01:54:19,810
So the families now all united in the 
proper state of being that joseph has 

2061
01:54:19,810 --> 01:54:21,980
raged and they took their cattle and 
their goods.

2062
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:25,490
It's so interesting too because of 
course joseph isn't even.

2063
01:54:25,491 --> 01:54:29,630
He's a foreigner as well as being a 
former slave and prisoner,

2064
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,820
foreigner,
slave and prisoner,

2065
01:54:31,821 --> 01:54:36,821
and yet he ends up ruling Egypt sheer 
sheerly because of the force of his 

2066
01:54:36,821 --> 01:54:41,081
character and competence and that's 
really something to think about and they

2067
01:54:41,841 --> 01:54:46,841
took their cattle because that story 
there is that there isn't anything 

2068
01:54:46,841 --> 01:54:46,841
stronger than that.

2069
01:54:46,841 --> 01:54:50,900
Doesn't matter what the circumstances 
are that there isn't a forest that's 

2070
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:53,711
more powerful not,
and I don't think that that's naive.

2071
01:54:55,730 --> 01:55:00,730
In fact,
I think it's the exact opposite of 

2072
01:55:00,730 --> 01:55:00,730
naive.
No matter where you are,

2073
01:55:00,730 --> 01:55:05,621
you can generally make things better if 
that's what you want to do and unless 

2074
01:55:05,621 --> 01:55:07,520
you're in some place that's really hell 
itself,

2075
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:13,600
not usually is something that elevates 
you and elevates the people around you 

2076
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:19,180
and you can do that wherever you are 
because there isn't a place that's so 

2077
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:22,811
small that you can't do that.
That's the message of the prison and 

2078
01:55:22,811 --> 01:55:26,531
they took their cattle and their goods,
which they had gotten in the land of 

2079
01:55:26,531 --> 01:55:28,931
canaan and came into Egypt.
Jacob and all his seed with him and he 

2080
01:55:31,101 --> 01:55:34,080
sent judah before a month to joseph to 
direct his face onto gosh,

2081
01:55:34,081 --> 01:55:37,760
and then they came into the land of 
goshen and joseph made ready his chariot

2082
01:55:37,761 --> 01:55:40,970
and went to meet Israel,
his father and presented himself to them

2083
01:55:41,150 --> 01:55:43,320
and fell on his neck and wept on his 
neck.

2084
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:48,320
A good while and Israel said,
I can now die because I've seen your 

2085
01:55:48,481 --> 01:55:53,481
face because you're still alive,
and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying 

2086
01:55:55,591 --> 01:56:00,591
that father and thy brethren,
they're coming to the land of Egypt is 

2087
01:56:00,591 --> 01:56:03,861
before the in the best of the land.
Your father and brothers can dwell in 

2088
01:56:03,861 --> 01:56:07,281
the land of gosh and let them do well,
and if the now know any men of activity 

2089
01:56:07,281 --> 01:56:08,730
among them,
then make them rulers over my cattle.

2090
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:13,960
It gives them a job.
And joseph brought in jacob his father 

2091
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:15,240
and set up before pharaoh and jacob 
blessed pharaoh.

2092
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:19,800
That's a very interesting little turn of
events because you'd expect the opposite

2093
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:24,840
under those circumstances.
So it appears that jacob was a man of 

2094
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:29,570
relatively great self-possession because
that's not a.

2095
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:32,550
You wouldn't blast queen elizabeth.
In all likelihood,

2096
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:37,140
as you had a lot of gall and pharaoh 
said unto jacob,

2097
01:56:37,141 --> 01:56:37,770
how old are you?

2098
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:40,530
And jacob said,
I'm 130 years.

2099
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:46,040
Few and evil have been the days of the 
years of my life and I've not attained 

2100
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:48,060
into the days of the years of my life,
of my father's,

2101
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:53,210
in the days of their pilgrimage.
And jacob blessed pharaoh and went out 

2102
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:54,810
from before pharaoh and the Israel dwelt
in the land of Egypt,

2103
01:56:54,811 --> 01:56:58,860
in the country of gosh,
and and grew and multiplied exceedingly.

2104
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:01,680
And jacob lived in the land of Egypt.
Seventeen years.

2105
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:07,580
So the whole age of jacob was 147 years.
And the time drew nigh that Israel must 

2106
01:57:08,521 --> 01:57:09,660
die.
And he called his son.

2107
01:57:09,661 --> 01:57:14,360
Joseph said unto him,
if I have now found grace in thy sight,

2108
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:19,110
put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh 
and deal kindly and truly with me,

2109
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:21,150
bury me.
Not I pray thee in Egypt,

2110
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:27,050
but I will lie with my father's.
now shall carry me out of Egypt and 

2111
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:27,050
burnaby.

2112
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:29,640
And they're burying place.
And joseph said,

2113
01:57:29,641 --> 01:57:31,110
I will do,
as you've said.

2114
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:36,060
And it came to pass after these things 
that one told joseph,

2115
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:38,910
behold I father is sick,
and he took with him his two sons,

2116
01:57:38,911 --> 01:57:41,970
madison ephram and one told jacob and 
said,

2117
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:45,060
behold thy son,
and one told jacob and said,

2118
01:57:45,061 --> 01:57:47,430
behold thy son,
joseph cometh unto thee,

2119
01:57:47,690 --> 01:57:50,010
and Israel strengthened himself and sat 
upon the bed.

2120
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:56,150
And he Israel said unto joseph,
I'd not thought to see your face and 

2121
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:57,840
low.
god has also showed me your children.

2122
01:57:58,890 --> 01:58:03,890
And joseph brought them out from between
his knees and out himself with his face 

2123
01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:05,400
to the earth.
And joseph took them both a in his right

2124
01:58:05,401 --> 01:58:08,880
hand towards israel's lefthand and 
madison is lefthand toward Israel,

2125
01:58:08,881 --> 01:58:10,500
his right hand and brought them near 
unto him.

2126
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:16,310
And Israel stretched out his right hand 
and laid it upon eh firms had who was 

2127
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:19,671
the younger and his left upon madness's 
had guiding his hands purposefully for 

2128
01:58:20,101 --> 01:58:21,330
madison was the first born.

2129
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:24,930
And when joseph saw that his father laid
his right hand on the head of ephraim,

2130
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:29,931
it displeased him.
And he held up his father's hand to 

2131
01:58:29,931 --> 01:58:32,511
remove it from him.
Firms had under my head and joseph said 

2132
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:33,500
unto his father,
not,

2133
01:58:33,501 --> 01:58:37,530
not so my father for this is the first 
board put the right hand upon his head,

2134
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:39,780
head at his father,
refused and said,

2135
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:41,190
I know it my son.
I know it.

2136
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:44,590
he shall also be my people and he shall 
also be great,

2137
01:58:44,591 --> 01:58:49,591
but truly his younger brother shall be 
greater than he and his seed shall 

2138
01:58:49,591 --> 01:58:53,251
become a multitude of nations.
Another repeat of the same thing that 

2139
01:58:53,251 --> 01:58:53,430
happens continually.
It's.

2140
01:58:53,431 --> 01:58:58,431
It's when,
when god wants to intervene in human 

2141
01:58:58,431 --> 01:59:01,681
affairs,
what he does is invert tradition at 

2142
01:59:01,681 --> 01:59:03,881
something like that,
and so that's a sign that there's 

2143
01:59:03,881 --> 01:59:07,501
something new and special going on and 
that gives precedence to the younger 

2144
01:59:07,501 --> 01:59:10,951
child rather than the older child 
precedent to what is new rather than 

2145
01:59:10,951 --> 01:59:10,951
what's traditional.

2146
01:59:10,951 --> 01:59:15,720
Of course,
sometimes that's necessary because 

2147
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:18,060
tradition is insufficient and sometimes 
something new has to come into being in 

2148
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:22,201
order to update it.
And jacob called together his sons and 

2149
01:59:22,201 --> 01:59:23,290
said,
gathered together so that I can tell you

2150
01:59:23,291 --> 01:59:25,600
that which shall befall you in the last 
days,

2151
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:31,620
gather yourself together and here you 
sons of jacob and hearkened unto Israel 

2152
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:32,170
your father,
ruben.

2153
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:34,600
I'm not going to go through all 12 of 
these rubin,

2154
01:59:34,601 --> 01:59:35,680
thou art,
my firstborn,

2155
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:37,750
my might,
and the beginning of my strength,

2156
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:40,870
the excellency of dignity and the 
excellency of power.

2157
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:46,590
Now the story's quite interesting here 
because jacob blesses joseph's sons 

2158
01:59:49,601 --> 01:59:54,601
before he blesses his own sons,
and so what he's doing is placing the 

2159
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:59,710
rights of the firstborn into the sons of
his favorite son.

2160
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:04,690
And then he goes to his sons.
And so that has implications for the way

2161
02:00:04,691 --> 02:00:09,691
the biblical stories laid themselves out
from thence forward the excellent of 

2162
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,960
dignity in the excellency of power,
unstable as water.

2163
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:17,650
Thou shalt not excel because that went 
has stopped to thy father's bed.

2164
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:19,900
Then defiled it.
He went up to my couch.

2165
02:00:20,050 --> 02:00:22,930
You may remember that ruben slept with 
his fathers,

2166
02:00:22,931 --> 02:00:23,740
cucumber,
ca,

2167
02:00:23,770 --> 02:00:27,960
concubine.
Simeon and levi are brethren.

2168
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:30,640
Instruments of cruelty are in their 
habitations.

2169
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:36,230
So that painting there,
what happened with simeon and levi was 

2170
02:00:36,230 --> 02:00:41,011
that somebody lay with her sister diana,
and then offered to marry her and then 

2171
02:00:45,401 --> 02:00:50,401
had and then became circumcised because 
that was part of the deal and then how 

2172
02:00:50,401 --> 02:00:54,711
to older men circumcised.
And then simeon and levi went in when 

2173
02:00:54,711 --> 02:00:55,150
they were recovering and killed them 
all.

2174
02:00:55,330 --> 02:01:00,330
And then jacob and all his people had to
leave because all that irritated their 

2175
02:01:00,791 --> 02:01:05,791
relatives.
So see me.

2176
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:11,320
Simeon and levi are brethren,
instruments of cruelty or in their 

2177
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:12,910
habitations oh my soul.
Come out now into their secret.

2178
02:01:12,911 --> 02:01:15,610
Until their assembly might honor,
be not thou united.

2179
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:20,790
For in their anger they slew a man and 
in their self self will they dig down a 

2180
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:21,160
wall,
cursed be their anger,

2181
02:01:21,161 --> 02:01:23,440
for it was fierce and their route for it
was cruel.

2182
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:26,290
I will divide them in jacob and 
scattered them in Israel.

2183
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,510
Judah,
thou art,

2184
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:33,540
he who?
My brethren shall praise thy hand shall 

2185
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,920
be in the neck of dynamics that father's
children shall bow down before the judah

2186
02:01:35,921 --> 02:01:40,040
is alliance help from the prey.
My son art gone up.

2187
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:45,340
He stooped down.
He couched as a lion and as an old lion 

2188
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:47,810
who shall rosa bump the sceptre shall 
not depart from judah,

2189
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:52,220
nor a law giver from between his feet 
until shiloh come and unto him shall the

2190
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:57,221
gathering of the people be joseph is a 
fruitful bough,

2191
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:01,760
even a fruitful bough by a well whose 
branches run over the wall.

2192
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:05,150
The archers have sorely grieved him and 
shot at him and hated him,

2193
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:10,510
but his bowl abode in strength and the 
arms of his hands were made strong by 

2194
02:02:10,510 --> 02:02:11,180
the hands of the mighty god of jacob.

2195
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:14,570
For then since the shepherd,
the stone of Israel,

2196
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:22,330
even by the god of my father who shall 
help the and by the almighty who shall 

2197
02:02:22,330 --> 02:02:25,751
bless thee with the blessings of heavens
above blessings of the deep that a 

2198
02:02:25,751 --> 02:02:27,260
thunder blessings of the beasts.
Breasts in the womb,

2199
02:02:27,950 --> 02:02:32,950
the blessings of your father have 
prevailed above the blessings of my 

2200
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:33,920
progenitors unto the utmost bound of the
everlasting health.

2201
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:38,090
They shall be on the head of joseph and 
on the crown of the head of him that was

2202
02:02:38,091 --> 02:02:42,470
separate from his brother and all.
These are the 12 tribes of Israel.

2203
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:46,160
And this is it that they're farther 
spake unto them and blessed them.

2204
02:02:46,161 --> 02:02:50,630
Everyone according to his blessing,
he blessed them so that what we see here

2205
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:55,670
is an echo in some sense of what happens
in the mesopotamian creation story.

2206
02:02:55,671 --> 02:03:00,671
When the mesopotamian creation story is 
the dragon of chaos tie matt and her 

2207
02:03:03,021 --> 02:03:08,021
consort appsu freshwater and saltwater 
respectively in they're mingled 

2208
02:03:11,181 --> 02:03:11,690
together.

2209
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:14,600
and,
and that combination of chaos and order,

2210
02:03:14,601 --> 02:03:18,260
it gives rise to the first assembly of 
the ancient gods.

2211
02:03:18,261 --> 02:03:23,261
And then the ancient gods kill appsu 
casually and foolishly and enraged,

2212
02:03:24,801 --> 02:03:27,920
tie a mat with their foolishness and 
ignorance.

2213
02:03:27,921 --> 02:03:32,921
And she comes back with a vengeance in 
the meantime.

2214
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:36,860
And then she produces this huge army of 
monsters and puts king knew the worst of

2215
02:03:36,861 --> 02:03:41,861
the monsters out its head and that 
decides she's going to take out her 

2216
02:03:41,861 --> 02:03:43,340
creation.
And so that's a little warning from 3000

2217
02:03:43,341 --> 02:03:47,390
years ago about foolishly undermining 
your tradition.

2218
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:52,760
so anyways,
the gods in their friends and go out and

2219
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:57,761
try to fight against high mountain.
They come back with their tails between 

2220
02:03:57,761 --> 02:03:59,660
their legs continually.
But then a new god appears on the scene.

2221
02:03:59,661 --> 02:04:03,020
And that's marduk and he's got eyes all 
the way around his head and he can speak

2222
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:08,050
words of magic and they know that 
there's something new about this newest 

2223
02:04:10,161 --> 02:04:10,520
god.

2224
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:14,030
It's his capacity for vision in this 
capacity for articulate speech.

2225
02:04:14,330 --> 02:04:15,170
And so they say,
well,

2226
02:04:15,171 --> 02:04:18,170
why don't you go out and try to deal 
with the chaos?

2227
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:19,910
And mark says,
yeah,

2228
02:04:19,911 --> 02:04:20,810
okay,
no problem,

2229
02:04:20,811 --> 02:04:22,670
but here's the deal.
You elect me,

2230
02:04:22,671 --> 02:04:27,671
top god,
and now I determine the destiny of the 

2231
02:04:27,671 --> 02:04:31,031
world.
And so they're desperate because like 

2232
02:04:31,031 --> 02:04:31,031
thai,
matt is coming to get them.

2233
02:04:31,031 --> 02:04:33,280
That's chaos with the worst of all 
possible bonsers.

2234
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:35,510
They're probably thinking he's not going
to win anyways.

2235
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:40,320
And so they agree and how he goes and he
confronts timeout.

2236
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:45,350
He was the goddess of chaos and he cuts 
her into pieces and he makes the world 

2237
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:49,671
out of her pieces.
And one of his names is he who makes 

2238
02:04:49,671 --> 02:04:50,850
ingenious things out of the combat with 
tire math,

2239
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:53,970
which is so interesting.
That's such a remarkable.

2240
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:59,910
That's a remarkable bit of nomenclature.
So who's should be at the pinnacle,

2241
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:05,460
the forest that sees and speaks and goes
out to confront chaos voluntarily.

2242
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:08,760
You know how many years it took people 
to figure that out.

2243
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:12,570
That's like the pinnacle discovery of 
humanity.

2244
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:14,700
That's what that is.
And it's echoed here.

2245
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:17,790
You know,
you see simeon and levi are too angry.

2246
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:23,480
The other brothers,
they all have flaws and faults of 

2247
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:24,780
various sorts and so they're not 
elevated to the highest place,

2248
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:30,080
but joseph,
because he has his coat of many colors 

2249
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:30,780
and because he lands on his feet,
no matter where he goes and because he's

2250
02:05:30,781 --> 02:05:35,100
not resentful and bitter and malevolent 
and genocidal and,

2251
02:05:35,330 --> 02:05:40,330
and he's not shaking his fist at the sky
or yelling at god because of trump,

2252
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:43,410
let's say.
Then he's the,

2253
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:48,530
he's the right,
he's the right representative of the 12 

2254
02:05:48,530 --> 02:05:50,100
tribes.
And so that's brilliant.

2255
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:51,240
It's a brilliant story.

2256
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:58,460
All these are the 12 tribes of Israel 
and this is it that their father spake 

2257
02:05:58,460 --> 02:05:59,250
unto them and blessed them.
Everyone according To his blessing,

2258
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:04,080
he blessed them when jacob had made an 
end of commanding his son.

2259
02:06:04,081 --> 02:06:09,081
So it's the last thing he does to state.
He knows that these are the 12 tribes 

2260
02:06:09,081 --> 02:06:13,641
that will progress into the future of 
this people and now he's trying it.

2261
02:06:15,810 --> 02:06:20,810
The last thing he does is to try to 
hierarchically organize their relative 

2262
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:25,461
virtues as an indication of what has 
been learned and when jacob has made an 

2263
02:06:26,581 --> 02:06:29,520
end of commanding his sons,
he gathered up his feet into the bed and

2264
02:06:29,521 --> 02:06:32,040
yielded up the ghost and was gathered 
unto his people.

2265
02:06:32,220 --> 02:06:35,580
And joseph fell upon his father's face 
and wept upon him and kissed him.

2266
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:40,960
And joseph commanded his servants to the
physicians to embalm his father and the 

2267
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:41,580
physicians embalmed Israel.

2268
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:46,680
When the days of his morning we're past 
joseph's spake unto the house of pharaoh

2269
02:06:46,681 --> 02:06:51,681
sayIng,
if now I have found grace in your eyes 

2270
02:06:51,681 --> 02:06:55,580
speak,
I pray you in the ears of pharaoh 

2271
02:06:55,580 --> 02:06:55,580
saying,
my father made me swear of saying low.

2272
02:06:55,580 --> 02:07:00,501
I die in my grave,
which I have digged for me in the land 

2273
02:07:00,501 --> 02:07:00,870
of canaan.
There shalt thou burry me now,

2274
02:07:00,871 --> 02:07:01,950
therefore,
let me go up.

2275
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:04,320
I pray thee and bury my father and I 
will come again.

2276
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:09,680
And pharaoh said,
go up and bury thy father according as 

2277
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:12,330
he made these swear for his son's,
carried them into the land of canaan and

2278
02:07:12,331 --> 02:07:15,030
bury them in the cave of the field of 
mac pella,

2279
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:17,520
which abraham bought with the field for 
a possession of,

2280
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:22,780
of burying place of effort on the 
hittite before mammary and joseph 

2281
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:27,141
returned into Egypt.
He and his brother and all that went up 

2282
02:07:27,141 --> 02:07:30,470
to him and that all and all that went up
with him to bury his father after he is 

2283
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:32,100
brewed,
after he had buried his father.

2284
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:35,860
And when joseph's brethren saw that 
their father was dead,

2285
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:41,460
they said,
joseph will now hate us and will 

2286
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:44,260
certainly pay back to us all the evil 
which we did unto him.

2287
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:48,940
And they sent a messenger saying,
my father did command before he died,

2288
02:07:48,941 --> 02:07:53,941
saying four shall say unto joseph,
forgive I pray thee now the trespass of 

2289
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:56,260
thy brethren and their sin pretty 
sniffily.

2290
02:07:56,261 --> 02:07:59,470
Really for tHey did unto thee evil.
and now we pray thee.

2291
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:03,310
Forgive the trespass of the servants of 
the god of thy father.

2292
02:08:03,470 --> 02:08:05,410
And joseph wept when they spake unto 
him,

2293
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:09,010
and his brethren also went and fell down
before his face and they said,

2294
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:10,600
behold,
we be thy servants.

2295
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:16,980
And joseph said unto them,
fear not for am I in the place of god,

2296
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:19,390
but as for you,
you thought evil against me,

2297
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:22,240
but god meant it unto good to bring,
to pass,

2298
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:25,240
as it is this day,
to save much people alive.

2299
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:34,020
Now,
therefore fear not I will nourish you 

2300
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:35,851
and your little ones.
And he comforted them and spake kIndly 

2301
02:08:35,851 --> 02:08:38,221
unto them.
So the the idea there is that there is 

2302
02:08:48,011 --> 02:08:53,011
no evil,
so evil that good cannot triumph over 

2303
02:08:53,011 --> 02:08:53,011
it.

2304
02:08:54,250 --> 02:08:59,250
And joseph dwelt in Egypt.
He and his father's house and joseph 

2305
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:02,131
lived 110 years.
And joseph saw frms children of the 

2306
02:09:02,131 --> 02:09:05,341
third generation.
The children also have makir the son of 

2307
02:09:05,341 --> 02:09:06,070
menace that were brought up upon 
joseph's knees.

2308
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:12,390
And joseph said unto his brethren,
I die and god will surely visit you and 

2309
02:09:12,390 --> 02:09:15,310
bring you out of this land unto the land
where he swore to abraham,

2310
02:09:15,311 --> 02:09:19,720
to isaac and jacob and joseph took an 
oath of the children of Israel saying,

2311
02:09:19,721 --> 02:09:23,590
god will surely visit you and she'll end
you shall carry my bones from hence.

2312
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:28,800
So joseph died being 110 years old and 
they embalmed him and he was put into a 

2313
02:09:30,641 --> 02:09:34,840
coffin in Egypt.
And that's genesis.

2314
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:37,730
So

2315
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:45,240
thank you.

2316
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:55,240
So thank you all for persevering.

2317
02:09:55,490 --> 02:10:00,490
Thank you.

2318
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:26,540
Thank you.
Thank you.

2319
02:10:26,690 --> 02:10:29,120
This has been very worthwhile.
As far as I'm concerned,

2320
02:10:29,121 --> 02:10:34,121
I learned an awful lot and so I'm very 
much looking forward to continuing it 

2321
02:10:34,121 --> 02:10:37,360
and thank you all very much for your 
support and your rapt attention and your

2322
02:10:37,361 --> 02:10:41,230
seriousness in this endeavor and your 
care and all of that.

2323
02:10:41,231 --> 02:10:44,380
It's really been a privilege to be able 
to do this.

2324
02:10:44,410 --> 02:10:48,170
It's a completely surreal thing to 
manage.

2325
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:50,180
And uh,
so far,

2326
02:10:50,181 --> 02:10:55,181
you know,
I think about 5 million people have 

2327
02:10:55,181 --> 02:10:56,180
watched it.
So that's seems to be a very good thing.

2328
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:56,580
So

2329
02:10:58,330 --> 02:11:03,330
thank you.

2330
02:11:07,390 --> 02:11:12,390
I'm going to ask the question,
if you've asked a question in the last 

2331
02:11:12,390 --> 02:11:16,410
three sessions,
please don't ask a question today 

2332
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:20,100
because I never get through everyone and
so I'd like to have some questions from 

2333
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:23,020
people that I haven't answered questions
from before,

2334
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:24,070
if that's okay.

2335
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:28,340
I professor peterson,
just a two second.

2336
02:11:28,341 --> 02:11:30,710
Thank you very much for my community and
the jewish community.

2337
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:35,950
So many people who have been inspired by
you to be better people and I wouldn't 

2338
02:11:35,950 --> 02:11:36,830
be able to speak to without saying that.
So thank you very much.

2339
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:40,850
A couple of things.
The first thing I wanted to do is make a

2340
02:11:40,851 --> 02:11:45,851
quick comment that you might find 
interesting that in the jewish 

2341
02:11:45,851 --> 02:11:45,851
astrological calendar,
um,

2342
02:11:45,851 --> 02:11:50,440
we read the yearly cycle of the five 
books of moses and it just so happens 

2343
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:50,930
that we are reading this,
a part of the,

2344
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:53,240
of the twitter story that very 
interesting.

2345
02:11:53,241 --> 02:11:55,100
that's cool.
And synchronistic,

2346
02:11:56,510 --> 02:11:58,730
which brings me into a question that I 
wanted to ask you about,

2347
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:01,640
which is one question with two parts 
about your knowledge of,

2348
02:12:01,710 --> 02:12:02,720
of,
of hebrew,

2349
02:12:02,820 --> 02:12:05,330
um,
because if you look at the torah scrolls

2350
02:12:05,331 --> 02:12:07,460
that you find in a synagogue,
there are no vowels,

2351
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:09,320
there are no sentences.
There.

2352
02:12:09,321 --> 02:12:11,510
It is a,
it is chaos,

2353
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:13,700
chaos and order is trying to be bought 
into it.

2354
02:12:13,701 --> 02:12:18,701
I'm wondering how knowledge of you 
knowledgeable are you of the hebrew 

2355
02:12:18,701 --> 02:12:18,701
which has many layers of,
of,

2356
02:12:18,701 --> 02:12:19,200
of dimensional,

2357
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:22,740
staggeringly ignorant of it.
So,

2358
02:12:22,741 --> 02:12:23,160
you know,
I,

2359
02:12:23,161 --> 02:12:25,590
I read a lot of commentaries,
right?

2360
02:12:25,591 --> 02:12:30,591
I'm trying to zero in on the,
like with each of the phrases that we 

2361
02:12:30,591 --> 02:12:35,450
went through today,
I probably looked at 10 different 

2362
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:37,581
commentaries and so,
and then I have this underlying 

2363
02:12:37,581 --> 02:12:41,811
psychoanalytic knowledge that it's sort 
of like if you have a bunch of different

2364
02:12:42,990 --> 02:12:47,990
templates to look at things through and 
then something shines through all those 

2365
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:50,220
templates at the same time,
that's very unlikely.

2366
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:55,440
And sO then you can know a coincidence 
is one thing,

2367
02:12:55,771 --> 02:12:58,500
but five coincidence is that's no longer
a coincidence.

2368
02:12:58,501 --> 02:13:03,501
That's something else.
And so I think I'm hoping that despite 

2369
02:13:03,501 --> 02:13:07,041
the fact that there's many,
many things that I don't know that 

2370
02:13:07,041 --> 02:13:10,760
there's enough things that I do know to 
kind of weave my way through this with 

2371
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,270
some degree of utility,
if not certainty.

2372
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:15,040
Yeah.
BecauSe I just was just the second part,

2373
02:13:15,041 --> 02:13:16,590
which I guess maybe you don't know that 
the,

2374
02:13:17,290 --> 02:13:22,290
the jewish oral stories that date back 
almost as long as these stories which 

2375
02:13:22,290 --> 02:13:26,191
fill in a lot of mindblowingly crazy 
random and so many details about these 

2376
02:13:26,191 --> 02:13:30,871
stories.
And I was just wondering if you had 

2377
02:13:30,871 --> 02:13:30,871
encountered any of them before.

2378
02:13:30,871 --> 02:13:30,871
I've encountered some of them,
but again,

2379
02:13:30,871 --> 02:13:32,610
it's a,
it's well as you know,

2380
02:13:32,611 --> 02:13:34,560
it's a very,
very rich tradition.

2381
02:13:34,561 --> 02:13:38,160
And so I haven't encountered enough of 
it.

2382
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:42,330
Were you thinking of anything in 
sPecific specifically in relationship to

2383
02:13:42,331 --> 02:13:42,960
this story?

2384
02:13:43,330 --> 02:13:45,130
Not in particular.
I actually forgot it.

2385
02:13:45,131 --> 02:13:46,930
I was,
I was intending to bring you a,

2386
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:50,680
a book of majestic store.
That's a hell of a thing to say now.

2387
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:53,490
Well,
it just,

2388
02:13:53,710 --> 02:13:54,340
I dunno,
I,

2389
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:56,350
I felt like I had to say that.
Um,

2390
02:13:56,830 --> 02:14:01,830
but yeah,
maybe for the exodus version I'll bring 

2391
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:01,830
you back.

2392
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:01,830
All right.
That would be good.

2393
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:01,830
Yeah.
Okay.

2394
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:05,260
Hi,
Dr.

2395
02:14:05,260 --> 02:14:10,260
Peterson,
I would just like to ask you to please 

2396
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:10,890
talk about what you called a psychic 
death,

2397
02:14:10,891 --> 02:14:12,420
also known as an ego death.

2398
02:14:13,030 --> 02:14:13,790
Okay.
Sorry.

2399
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:14,470
Say that again.

2400
02:14:14,770 --> 02:14:19,770
Would you please talk about what young 
refer to as a psychic death also called 

2401
02:14:19,770 --> 02:14:20,270
an ego death.

2402
02:14:22,690 --> 02:14:25,150
That's what happens when someone who 
loves you betrays you.

2403
02:14:26,890 --> 02:14:28,060
Right?
So imagine that.

2404
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:32,800
Like the world is complicated beyond 
comprehension,

2405
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:37,980
right?
When you only see a very little bit of 

2406
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:39,691
it and the way you structured your 
understanding is you make assumptions 

2407
02:14:39,691 --> 02:14:41,100
about things and they're simplifying 
assumptions.

2408
02:14:41,101 --> 02:14:46,101
So if you trust someone,
you reduce their complexity massively,

2409
02:14:46,391 --> 02:14:47,560
right?
Because like,

2410
02:14:47,710 --> 02:14:52,710
let's say we were married,
then there's a whole bunch of ways that 

2411
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:53,770
you're going to act that are going to be
simpler.

2412
02:14:54,910 --> 02:14:59,910
Okay.
So then I can tolerate being around you 

2413
02:14:59,910 --> 02:15:00,460
in some sense because you're not 
everything at once.

2414
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:08,160
Now those simplifying structures are 
hierarchically assembled and some of 

2415
02:15:09,731 --> 02:15:13,030
them are far more important than others.
Trust is one of them,

2416
02:15:13,031 --> 02:15:15,070
especially trust in loved ones,
family members,

2417
02:15:15,071 --> 02:15:16,780
which is why I'd be trailed by a family 
member,

2418
02:15:16,781 --> 02:15:21,250
is really catastrophic because it 
destabilizes your past,

2419
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:22,600
right?
All the memories you have,

2420
02:15:22,601 --> 02:15:27,601
it destabilizes your present.
It destabilizes your future is shakes 

2421
02:15:27,601 --> 02:15:31,201
your faith in human beings including 
yourself and everything collapses and 

2422
02:15:31,201 --> 02:15:36,151
that's an ego death and so now 
underneath the ego as far as young was 

2423
02:15:36,911 --> 02:15:38,980
concerned,
was another structure that he called the

2424
02:15:38,981 --> 02:15:43,900
self and the self is this thing that 
remains constant across ego deaths,

2425
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:49,480
but it's.
It's deeper and less personal.

2426
02:15:49,630 --> 02:15:54,630
It's architectural and it's the thing 
that the eagle collapses into when it 

2427
02:15:54,671 --> 02:15:58,900
collapses and then rebuIlds the ego,
something like that across time,

2428
02:15:59,590 --> 02:16:03,880
but that's when an ego death is now.
There's variants of that because you can

2429
02:16:03,881 --> 02:16:08,200
have a voluntary or involuntary ego 
death and a voluntary ego.

2430
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:11,500
Death is when you learn a bunch and 
you're willing to let go,

2431
02:16:11,710 --> 02:16:14,870
so that would be your own emulation.
It's like your lighting,

2432
02:16:14,871 --> 02:16:15,620
your,
your a phoenix,

2433
02:16:15,621 --> 02:16:19,840
and your lighting yourself on fire.
That's a much better idea even though it

2434
02:16:19,841 --> 02:16:23,890
can still be really harsh.
The involuntary ego deaths,

2435
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:28,900
they're really hard on people.
People will do almost anything to stop 

2436
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:28,930
that from happening,
which is partly,

2437
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:34,080
they fight to maintain their group 
fostered axiomatic simplifications.

2438
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:41,490
It's not surprising because it's very.
You lose your like that ego death is a 

2439
02:16:41,771 --> 02:16:44,650
journey into the underworld or it's a 
collapse into chaos.

2440
02:16:44,850 --> 02:16:46,900
And that's not so bad if you do it 
purposefully.

2441
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:49,420
But in the pinocchio story,
for example,

2442
02:16:49,421 --> 02:16:54,421
that's exemplified by pinocchio going 
down to the depths to rescue his father 

2443
02:16:54,421 --> 02:16:54,940
from the whale.
Now he does that voluntarily,

2444
02:16:54,941 --> 02:16:57,490
but it damn near killed him right in.
First of all,

2445
02:16:57,491 --> 02:17:00,180
he hardly gets out of the whale.
Second,

2446
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:03,760
he actually drowns in dies,
but he comes back to life.

2447
02:17:03,970 --> 02:17:08,970
So even if you do it voluntarily,
it's still well think it's just better 

2448
02:17:09,321 --> 02:17:11,960
than doing it in voluntarily,
which is the other alternative.

2449
02:17:11,990 --> 02:17:13,070
So that's what it is.

2450
02:17:14,910 --> 02:17:15,450
You bet.

2451
02:17:21,690 --> 02:17:22,700
Hello,
Dr.

2452
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:23,550
Peterson.
Uh,

2453
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:28,640
so I've been listening to bach to all of
these biblical lectures for the second 

2454
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:29,510
time now.
and um,

2455
02:17:29,580 --> 02:17:32,730
I wanted to show you an observation I 
came upon because I was trying to find a

2456
02:17:32,731 --> 02:17:34,770
question that you haven't been asked 
before,

2457
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:37,620
which is harder than doing my ryerson 
exams,

2458
02:17:37,621 --> 02:17:40,370
that's for sure.
So,

2459
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:43,260
so I've noticed,
I think you're getting funnier.

2460
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:46,350
Oh yes.
Oh no.

2461
02:17:46,351 --> 02:17:48,570
I think michael koren said that this 
week I think.

2462
02:17:48,571 --> 02:17:53,571
But the word he used was bizarre.
I think actually I'm feeling better,

2463
02:17:53,611 --> 02:17:55,680
so that's,
I actually have a sense of humor.

2464
02:17:55,681 --> 02:17:57,150
It's,
it's hard to believe that.

2465
02:17:57,740 --> 02:18:02,740
So it sort of comes back when I'm not 
feeling like I'm going to die at any 

2466
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:03,020
moment.
So yeah,

2467
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:06,510
I basically noticed one,
you're making more attempts at jokes,

2468
02:18:06,511 --> 02:18:07,260
so that's great.

2469
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:12,940
Oh,

2470
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:19,260
thank you.
thank you to those Jokes are landing 

2471
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:22,241
more often.
But then there's this third element 

2472
02:18:22,241 --> 02:18:24,650
which I think was what steve martin quit
because of,

2473
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:29,680
which is that I think the audience is 
anticipating jokes more and they're 

2474
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:29,680
actually,
you know,

2475
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:34,360
I've noticed people laughing more at 
things that aren't intending to be 

2476
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:34,580
jokes.
So I was just wondering what you make of

2477
02:18:34,581 --> 02:18:36,710
that and um,
their intended.

2478
02:18:37,010 --> 02:18:42,010
I'm hoping they're intended,
just because I keep a straight face 

2479
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:42,010
doesn't mean they're not intended to be 
jokes,

2480
02:18:42,350 --> 02:18:43,880
so yeah,
no,

2481
02:18:43,881 --> 02:18:44,600
it's good.
look,

2482
02:18:44,601 --> 02:18:47,480
one of the things is like it's,
and I've tried to keep this,

2483
02:18:47,570 --> 02:18:50,330
I learned a while ago,
probably about five years ago,

2484
02:18:50,510 --> 02:18:55,510
that even when you're dealing with 
really serious matters that if you're 

2485
02:18:55,510 --> 02:18:57,140
not handling it with a light touch,
you're not an expert at it.

2486
02:18:57,141 --> 02:19:02,141
You're not a master at it,
and you'd think while there are some 

2487
02:19:02,141 --> 02:19:03,020
things that are so deep and dark that 
you can't handle it with a light touch,

2488
02:19:03,350 --> 02:19:06,500
and that's actually not true.
You can.

2489
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:08,870
That doesn't mean you make light of 
them.

2490
02:19:08,871 --> 02:19:11,030
It doesn't mean anything like that.
It's tHat you don't.

2491
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:15,110
It's minimal necessary force,
something like that.

2492
02:19:15,111 --> 02:19:17,300
You don't hit it any harder than you 
have to,

2493
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:22,560
and it's a.
It's an art when you're discussing 

2494
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:22,560
serious matters and so

2495
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:27,600
well,
one of the upshots of that is that 

2496
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:30,030
because we're discussing serious matters
and serious matters are being discussed 

2497
02:19:30,030 --> 02:19:33,611
in the ultra large right now,
it would be really good if everybody 

2498
02:19:33,611 --> 02:19:33,611
could keep their sense of humor.
You know,

2499
02:19:33,611 --> 02:19:37,460
when I see positive signs of that,
like there's a lot of satirical activity

2500
02:19:37,461 --> 02:19:38,420
on the net,
you know,

2501
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:41,450
and that could easily catalyze into 
horror mob,

2502
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:42,980
but it isn't,
it is,

2503
02:19:42,981 --> 02:19:47,981
it is,
you know that that's happening to some 

2504
02:19:47,981 --> 02:19:50,171
degree,
but a lot of it's satire and comedy and 

2505
02:19:50,171 --> 02:19:50,450
as long as we can keep a sense of humor 
about this,

2506
02:19:50,451 --> 02:19:55,451
then I think,
well we're not as close to disaster as 

2507
02:19:55,451 --> 02:19:56,890
we might be.
ANd so one,

2508
02:19:56,980 --> 02:20:01,980
one of the things that I have found 
rather ominous is that there are 

2509
02:20:01,980 --> 02:20:01,980
comedians,
first of all,

2510
02:20:01,980 --> 02:20:05,930
being persecuted for under free speech 
restriction legislation,

2511
02:20:05,931 --> 02:20:07,490
which I think is absolutely appalling.

2512
02:20:07,730 --> 02:20:12,730
But also that there were comedians now 
who won't perform on university 

2513
02:20:12,730 --> 02:20:15,971
campuses.
John cleese won't seinfeld.

2514
02:20:16,041 --> 02:20:16,490
That's like,
well,

2515
02:20:16,491 --> 02:20:18,440
you know how offensive he is.
It's no wonder that.

2516
02:20:18,450 --> 02:20:23,030
I mean he's like the straightest nicest 
comedian you could Possibly imagine.

2517
02:20:23,031 --> 02:20:28,031
he won't perform on college campuses.
I think louis ck won't perform an or or 

2518
02:20:28,031 --> 02:20:32,090
anywhere else,
but it's a bad sign.

2519
02:20:32,091 --> 02:20:34,280
But no humor.
Humor is good.

2520
02:20:34,281 --> 02:20:39,281
And it's interesting because I've been 
kind of watching how I'm represented on 

2521
02:20:39,281 --> 02:20:43,901
the web weirdly enough,
and there's all these memes that have 

2522
02:20:43,901 --> 02:20:43,901
emerged,
I don't know,

2523
02:20:43,901 --> 02:20:48,431
thousands of the bloody things and most 
of them are comical and that's good.

2524
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:51,060
Like people are,
are,

2525
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:54,650
are there,
whatever it is that they're doing,

2526
02:20:54,651 --> 02:20:59,651
I don't know what the hell it is,
but it's being done with a relatively 

2527
02:20:59,651 --> 02:20:59,960
light touch and that's really,
really good.

2528
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:02,810
that's how it should be.
You got to have a sense of humor.

2529
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:07,900
I mean,
it's one of the things that makes life 

2530
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:07,900
bearable,
so,

2531
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:09,890
or maybe even better than bearable.
So you bet.

2532
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:14,100
Dr.

2533
02:21:17,850 --> 02:21:22,850
So I want to say what a great lecture 
series and uh,

2534
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:28,470
this is the last one this year.
So a merry christmas to you and your 

2535
02:21:28,470 --> 02:21:28,470
family.
Thank you.

2536
02:21:28,470 --> 02:21:31,570
Thank you.
I just want to say this,

2537
02:21:31,571 --> 02:21:33,780
this,
don't gEt too enthusiastic about that.

2538
02:21:36,270 --> 02:21:39,080
I wrote you an essay of a question and 
then I use the,

2539
02:21:39,081 --> 02:21:44,081
uh,
the lecture or the essay writing guide 

2540
02:21:44,081 --> 02:21:44,880
on site to 30 to narrow it down to just 
a few pages,

2541
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,690
a few lines.
And then during this,

2542
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:50,040
uh,
this particular lecture,

2543
02:21:50,130 --> 02:21:52,650
like the zigzag slide manifest again and
I thought,

2544
02:21:52,750 --> 02:21:57,750
ah,
basically just had all my questions 

2545
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:57,750
answered.
So,

2546
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:59,760
um,
basicaLly I just,

2547
02:21:59,810 --> 02:22:00,840
I,
I want to ask,

2548
02:22:00,841 --> 02:22:04,190
um,
the idea of a,

2549
02:22:05,930 --> 02:22:08,550
your,
you've made a lecture that was,

2550
02:22:08,551 --> 02:22:11,550
um,
on youtube many years ago and uh,

2551
02:22:11,670 --> 02:22:14,460
you keeP referring to cain and abel and 
the,

2552
02:22:14,461 --> 02:22:19,461
uh,
the death of abel by cain and the curse 

2553
02:22:19,461 --> 02:22:19,730
in it.
and I think that that was the,

2554
02:22:19,731 --> 02:22:22,430
um,
that was the single brother,

2555
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:24,390
two brothers conflict.
Um,

2556
02:22:24,450 --> 02:22:29,450
but,
but here we have in the sense of jacob 

2557
02:22:29,450 --> 02:22:32,130
the 12.
There was one who was one who's good,

2558
02:22:32,131 --> 02:22:36,720
one who was enable archetype and there 
are 1211 that came after him.

2559
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:39,570
so that,
I don't know,

2560
02:22:39,571 --> 02:22:43,510
maybe there was something about the 
division or a.

2561
02:22:43,950 --> 02:22:45,300
No,
that's a good observation.

2562
02:22:45,301 --> 02:22:47,460
I hadn't thought about that.
Yeah.

2563
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:52,700
Well,
I mean there's a bit of variability 

2564
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:52,700
because ruben and ruben isn't quite as 
bad as the rest,

2565
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:54,930
but yeah,
I would say it's probably easier for the

2566
02:22:54,931 --> 02:22:56,370
cane side,
the multiply.

2567
02:22:57,300 --> 02:23:02,020
Luckily it's not as powerful because it 
doesn't do anything like it.

2568
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:05,640
Yes,
yes.

2569
02:23:05,641 --> 02:23:06,660
And you know,
you'll,

2570
02:23:06,690 --> 02:23:11,690
there's young was often included,
accused of manichaean isn't not 

2571
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:14,790
pronouncing that properly,
but there was a,

2572
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:18,330
there was a variant of christian dogma 
that held that good and evil.

2573
02:23:18,331 --> 02:23:22,710
We're separate metaphysical realities 
and that they were battling for the,

2574
02:23:22,980 --> 02:23:25,890
for governance of the cosmos,
something like that.

2575
02:23:25,891 --> 02:23:30,891
But they both had an independent 
existence and the classical christian 

2576
02:23:30,891 --> 02:23:33,360
idea which won out over that was the no,
that good was real,

2577
02:23:33,361 --> 02:23:38,361
but evil was the absence of good now 
that produced all sorts of the absence 

2578
02:23:38,361 --> 02:23:42,351
of good produces all sorts of 
consequences and it is interesting to 

2579
02:23:42,351 --> 02:23:45,921
read young because he does get kinda 
manichaean in his discussions and I 

2580
02:23:45,921 --> 02:23:50,490
think it was partly because he was so 
concerned about what happened in nazi 

2581
02:23:50,490 --> 02:23:51,390
Germany and then with a cold war 
afterwards,

2582
02:23:51,391 --> 02:23:56,391
you know,
because evil seem to be a palpable 

2583
02:23:56,391 --> 02:23:56,391
force.

2584
02:23:56,391 --> 02:23:57,780
BuT I don't think that it's as powerful 
as good.

2585
02:23:59,180 --> 02:24:04,180
But I do think it's easier for it to 
multiply because it's what's easier 

2586
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:08,301
path.
It's easy to be resentful and hostile 

2587
02:24:08,301 --> 02:24:10,140
and bitter and do nothing.
That's easy.

2588
02:24:10,650 --> 02:24:15,650
It's horrible and it's hard on people,
but it doesn't require a tremendous 

2589
02:24:15,650 --> 02:24:18,711
amount of faith or effort.
So maybe that is why it's multiplied in 

2590
02:24:18,711 --> 02:24:19,290
the final story in genesis.

2591
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:20,670
Yeah,
and I,

2592
02:24:20,671 --> 02:24:25,671
I've been reading ahead and for my own,
based on the interest of the present 

2593
02:24:26,570 --> 02:24:31,570
presented stories and I keyed in on a 
few other books and chapters in the 

2594
02:24:31,570 --> 02:24:33,320
bible,
first corinthians 13,

2595
02:24:33,321 --> 02:24:38,321
which is the love chapter,
and that cycles through the idea of I 

2596
02:24:38,321 --> 02:24:40,020
can have all things in life,
uh,

2597
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:41,300
knowledge,
power,

2598
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:46,360
but it's all passing and uh,
the law now and forever.

2599
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:47,930
Faith,
hope and love.

2600
02:24:47,990 --> 02:24:51,080
And then of course love trumps overall.

2601
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:52,750
Yeah.
Well the love the issue.

2602
02:24:52,780 --> 02:24:53,800
See I've,
I've been,

2603
02:24:53,850 --> 02:24:58,850
I've,
I thought a lot about the relationship 

2604
02:24:58,850 --> 02:25:00,481
between love and truth because I've 
thought and talked a lot more about 

2605
02:25:00,481 --> 02:25:03,991
truth and I think partly that's because 
love is a word that you can hardly even 

2606
02:25:03,991 --> 02:25:07,770
say because it's been so.
It's like it's being dragged behind a 

2607
02:25:07,770 --> 02:25:09,640
car through mud puddles.
It's something like that.

2608
02:25:10,330 --> 02:25:12,520
But let's,
let me Just finish it.

2609
02:25:12,521 --> 02:25:14,970
Liberating this idea,
but I think that the,

2610
02:25:15,070 --> 02:25:20,070
the,
the love idea is associated with w for 

2611
02:25:20,070 --> 02:25:23,731
me at least with what I discussed at the
beginning of this lecture with regards 

2612
02:25:23,731 --> 02:25:27,061
to faith.
Think you have to make a decision about 

2613
02:25:27,061 --> 02:25:30,991
what your attitude towards being is 
going to be and the proper attitude in 

2614
02:25:31,061 --> 02:25:34,720
my estimation is that you're working for
its betterment,

2615
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:40,420
you know,
and so maybe maybe you have the same 

2616
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:41,470
attitude towards being as you do towards
someone that you love,

2617
02:25:41,471 --> 02:25:46,471
like a son or a daughter or wife,
that you want things to be better and 

2618
02:25:46,471 --> 02:25:47,650
that.
So that's your aim.

2619
02:25:47,651 --> 02:25:52,651
So the aim is basically the aim is 
motivated by love.

2620
02:25:53,650 --> 02:25:56,930
You want things to be better because I 
think that's a good definition of law.

2621
02:25:56,950 --> 02:26:01,950
Like if you really care for someone you 
can tell because you want things to be 

2622
02:26:01,950 --> 02:26:06,271
better for them.
And then I think truth is nested inside 

2623
02:26:06,271 --> 02:26:07,720
that because I think that truth is the 
best servant of love,

2624
02:26:07,770 --> 02:26:08,680
something like that.

2625
02:26:14,710 --> 02:26:18,790
So I've been struggling with an idea 
recently that I was thinking maybe you'd

2626
02:26:18,791 --> 02:26:23,791
be able to help me out with.
Basically in a recent interview you 

2627
02:26:23,791 --> 02:26:27,601
talked about how myth is meant to 
reconcile inherent contradictions in 

2628
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:28,840
reality.
Right?

2629
02:26:29,150 --> 02:26:34,150
But,
but I'm sort of stuck between two 

2630
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:37,620
mythological or psychoanalytic ideas 
that I think are both really important,

2631
02:26:37,721 --> 02:26:41,440
but they seem to have a inherent 
contradiction within them that I've been

2632
02:26:41,441 --> 02:26:46,441
trying to figure out.
So on one hand you have this idea that 

2633
02:26:46,441 --> 02:26:48,040
there's times in your life where you 
have to identify things in yourself that

2634
02:26:48,041 --> 02:26:53,041
are insufficient or there's a problem 
somehow that you have to kind of have a 

2635
02:26:53,471 --> 02:26:58,471
controlled burn.
Or like a phoenix like transformation 

2636
02:26:58,471 --> 02:27:01,090
where you discard part of yourself that 
doesn't fit or it's not working.

2637
02:27:01,570 --> 02:27:04,480
But then on the other hand,
you have talked about this,

2638
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:08,260
this union idea where as you become 
really.

2639
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:12,070
When you get older,
you mature by reincorporating.

2640
02:27:12,071 --> 02:27:17,071
Things about yourself that you lost whEn
you were younger or that you're trying 

2641
02:27:17,071 --> 02:27:20,050
to integrate your shadow or you're 
trying to find parts of your personality

2642
02:27:20,051 --> 02:27:23,110
that.
That maybe you've been rejecting and try

2643
02:27:23,111 --> 02:27:26,040
and figure out how to bring them into,
into the folder and whole.

2644
02:27:26,170 --> 02:27:28,090
so he's got this quote that I really 
liked,

2645
02:27:28,091 --> 02:27:31,330
which is I'd rather be holding good.
Right,

2646
02:27:31,331 --> 02:27:32,320
right.
So,

2647
02:27:32,321 --> 02:27:37,321
so on one hand you may identify 
something as a problem and you want to 

2648
02:27:37,321 --> 02:27:40,300
get rid of it or burn it off.
But then on the other hand it seems like

2649
02:27:40,301 --> 02:27:45,301
the path to being stronger is to figure 
out how to put everything together.

2650
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:49,450
So there's the,
there's the,

2651
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:54,720
one of the things you wrote about in his
works on alchemy was an explanation of 

2652
02:27:54,761 --> 02:27:59,761
the prime l chemical dictum,
which was solve a coagula which meant 

2653
02:27:59,761 --> 02:28:02,860
dissolve and integrate.
Right?

2654
02:28:02,861 --> 02:28:04,480
So,
so imagine this,

2655
02:28:04,510 --> 02:28:09,510
imagine that.
Imagine you had a fairly hostile father 

2656
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:12,550
who was not very well controlled and his
aggression,

2657
02:28:13,660 --> 02:28:15,310
decent person.
Other than that,

2658
02:28:15,311 --> 02:28:20,311
but let's say that.
And so your reaction is I'm never going 

2659
02:28:20,311 --> 02:28:21,470
to be aggressive.
And so you've built a,

2660
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:26,760
like a moral structure that's part of 
your personality and there's possibility

2661
02:28:28,551 --> 02:28:30,050
floating around.
Outside of that,

2662
02:28:30,051 --> 02:28:32,390
did you,
you've denied an ethical,

2663
02:28:33,100 --> 02:28:37,370
you've denied any ethical.
What would you say?

2664
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:41,870
You've stripped the idea of aggression 
of any ethical utility whatsoever?

2665
02:28:42,410 --> 02:28:43,550
Okay,
so what happens?

2666
02:28:43,551 --> 02:28:46,370
This burns off and then that comes back 
up.

2667
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:51,400
Now you still have to integrate it.
So it's associated in some sense with 

2668
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:51,920
niches,
ideas,

2669
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:53,990
morality as cowardice.

2670
02:28:54,410 --> 02:28:59,410
Because one of nature's most trenchant 
critiques of traditional morality,

2671
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:03,680
let's say,
is that most of what passes for morality

2672
02:29:03,681 --> 02:29:05,630
isn't reality.
It's just cowardice.

2673
02:29:05,810 --> 02:29:08,720
It's not that I'm a good person and I 
don't hurt you.

2674
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:14,080
It's that I'm afraid to hurt you and 
because I don't want to admit that I'm 

2675
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:17,531
afraid to hurt you.
Then I say I'm moral because then I can 

2676
02:29:17,531 --> 02:29:20,450
mask my essential fear and cowardice in 
a guise of morality.

2677
02:29:20,690 --> 02:29:25,690
And that happens far more often than you
would think because harmless and moral 

2678
02:29:25,690 --> 02:29:30,131
are by no means the same thing.
So some of what you're burning off you 

2679
02:29:30,131 --> 02:29:34,871
can sit.
And this is where freud was such a 

2680
02:29:34,871 --> 02:29:36,941
genius,
I think is because he concentrated on 

2681
02:29:36,941 --> 02:29:37,790
aggression in sexuality,
which are perhaps the two most difficult

2682
02:29:37,791 --> 02:29:40,280
parts of a personality to integrate.
So that,

2683
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:42,770
um,
the,

2684
02:29:42,860 --> 02:29:47,860
the hyper simplified morality stops you 
from tapping into deeper recesses of 

2685
02:29:54,081 --> 02:29:58,040
your psyche and it's partly because 
there are primal forces.

2686
02:29:58,490 --> 02:30:01,480
It's not surprising that you don't want 
to have anything to do with them,

2687
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:05,060
that you stay away from situations where
they might make themselves manifest.

2688
02:30:05,061 --> 02:30:10,061
But the problem is by denying the worst 
in yourself in that manner of 

2689
02:30:10,061 --> 02:30:12,290
suPpressing it,
you preclude the possibility of the best

2690
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:17,740
because no one can be a good person 
without integrating their capacity for 

2691
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:18,390
aggression.
Because without that capacity,

2692
02:30:18,391 --> 02:30:23,391
you have for aggression.
You cannot say no because no means if 

2693
02:30:23,721 --> 02:30:28,721
you really say it,
no means there isn't anything that you 

2694
02:30:28,721 --> 02:30:30,130
can do to me that will make me change my
mind or,

2695
02:30:30,170 --> 02:30:34,130
or conversely it means I will play for 
higher stakes than you will.

2696
02:30:34,850 --> 02:30:38,930
And unless you've got your aggression 
integrated,

2697
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:41,600
there isn't a chance you can say that.
And if you did,

2698
02:30:41,601 --> 02:30:45,350
no one would take you seriously because 
they'd know it was just a show.

2699
02:30:46,010 --> 02:30:49,490
So one of the most useful things that 
young did,

2700
02:30:49,491 --> 02:30:52,940
I think was to work on this idea of the 
integration of the shadow because he was

2701
02:30:52,941 --> 02:30:54,770
really interested in the idea of evil,
right?

2702
02:30:54,770 --> 02:30:59,770
Especially working with trying to parcel
out what happened in nazi Germany and 

2703
02:30:59,770 --> 02:31:04,720
during the second world war.
What do you do with the part of you 

2704
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:04,910
that's aggressive and potentially 
malevolent?

2705
02:31:04,911 --> 02:31:09,911
You just crush it.
That's the super ego response in some 

2706
02:31:09,911 --> 02:31:12,971
sense.
do you just put it behind you so to 

2707
02:31:12,971 --> 02:31:13,580
speak?
Is that a possibility or do you admit to

2708
02:31:13,581 --> 02:31:18,581
its existence and bring it into the game
and that's c for.

2709
02:31:18,850 --> 02:31:20,460
For freud,
in some sense,

2710
02:31:20,490 --> 02:31:25,490
morality was super ego clamping down on 
the bed and there were fundamentally 

2711
02:31:25,490 --> 02:31:30,111
opposed.
Both young and piaget had a different 

2712
02:31:30,111 --> 02:31:30,111
idea and I think they were right.
It's like,

2713
02:31:30,111 --> 02:31:30,590
no,
no,

2714
02:31:30,591 --> 02:31:35,591
you invite the bad guys out to play,
and so you're an aggressive hockey 

2715
02:31:36,351 --> 02:31:41,351
player,
but it's disciplined aggression that 

2716
02:31:41,351 --> 02:31:45,571
makes you,
gives you access to a whole source of 

2717
02:31:45,571 --> 02:31:46,660
energy you wouldn't otherwise have.
And then with regards to sexuality,

2718
02:31:46,661 --> 02:31:51,661
it's like,
well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't 

2719
02:31:51,661 --> 02:31:54,010
constitute a virtue,
but neither does unavoidable virginity.

2720
02:31:54,370 --> 02:31:55,480
Right.
In fact,

2721
02:31:55,481 --> 02:31:59,350
I think that's worse because it also 
masks itself with virtue,

2722
02:31:59,970 --> 02:32:01,840
so like,
well you should be able to.

2723
02:32:02,870 --> 02:32:05,750
You should be able to do things that you
wouldn't do.

2724
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:10,820
That's,
that's like the definition of a 

2725
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:12,200
genuinely moral person.
They could do it,

2726
02:32:13,170 --> 02:32:16,380
they don't.
That's not cowardice.

2727
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:21,560
And so that's,
you burn off the things that get in the 

2728
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:21,560
way of that integration.

2729
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:27,500
When you say dissolve and integrating,
it'd be a good way to sort of bring the 

2730
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:31,131
two ideas together that the burning off 
and the difficult processes necessary 

2731
02:32:31,651 --> 02:32:36,651
because the elements of yourself are 
structured together in a rigid way that 

2732
02:32:36,651 --> 02:32:37,900
is not working properly.

2733
02:32:38,170 --> 02:32:43,170
Yeah.
That's what happens to Japan in the 

2734
02:32:43,170 --> 02:32:44,851
belly of the whale.
He's so caught in his presuppositions 

2735
02:32:44,851 --> 02:32:45,670
that he can't escape.
Right.

2736
02:32:45,671 --> 02:32:47,680
And so pinocchio represents the new 
forest.

2737
02:32:47,681 --> 02:32:50,080
So it's very interesting.
So when you watch pinocchio,

2738
02:32:50,081 --> 02:32:55,081
tried to rescue him.
The first thing joe petta does this 

2739
02:32:55,081 --> 02:32:55,750
confuse pinocchio with a fish because he
wants something to eat.

2740
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:59,080
But pinocchio is better than something 
to eat because he could rescue him so he

2741
02:32:59,081 --> 02:33:04,081
doesn't need to eat.
And then pinocchio wants to make a fire 

2742
02:33:04,081 --> 02:33:05,410
engine pedo objects because he's going 
to burn up all the furniture.

2743
02:33:05,590 --> 02:33:08,830
So like we don't need the damn furniture
if we're getting out of the whale,

2744
02:33:08,890 --> 02:33:10,150
you know,
and so,

2745
02:33:10,210 --> 02:33:12,390
so Japan and he's old,
so that,

2746
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:13,120
that,
that's the,

2747
02:33:13,510 --> 02:33:18,510
that's the rigid structure.
That's the old gear that has to die off 

2748
02:33:18,510 --> 02:33:21,601
before the new year can be born.
It's a forest fire that allows for new 

2749
02:33:21,601 --> 02:33:24,130
growth and that's how those things are 
put together and to see.

2750
02:33:24,130 --> 02:33:26,890
And it's useful to know too because if 
you burn something off,

2751
02:33:26,891 --> 02:33:27,490
you might think,
well,

2752
02:33:27,491 --> 02:33:29,170
there's nothing left.
It's like,

2753
02:33:29,171 --> 02:33:31,330
that's not true.
If it's dead wood,

2754
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:36,360
then you have room for new growth and 
you want to be doing that on a fairly 

2755
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:37,490
regular basis.
That's the,

2756
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:41,570
that's the snake that sheds its skin and
transforms itself,

2757
02:33:41,571 --> 02:33:42,140
right?
That's,

2758
02:33:42,590 --> 02:33:46,220
that's the death and resurrection from a
psychological perspective,

2759
02:33:46,221 --> 02:33:51,221
it's exactly the same idea.
Now we don't know the upper limit to 

2760
02:33:51,221 --> 02:33:51,221
that,
right?

2761
02:33:51,221 --> 02:33:55,061
Because we don't know what a person 
would be like if they let everything 

2762
02:33:55,061 --> 02:33:58,210
that they could let go,
let go and only let in what was 

2763
02:33:58,700 --> 02:34:00,110
seemingly,
let's say.

2764
02:34:01,070 --> 02:34:06,070
But you can See that it's funny,
we don't know that to some degree you 

2765
02:34:06,070 --> 02:34:09,581
can see People very far.
You can see people start to do that 

2766
02:34:09,581 --> 02:34:13,970
without.
That's not an rare experience and people

2767
02:34:14,761 --> 02:34:16,260
improve very rapidly.

2768
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:19,420
It can improve their very rapidly.
A lot of it's low hanging fruit,

2769
02:34:19,421 --> 02:34:23,950
like if he just stopped doing really 
stupid things that you know are stupid,

2770
02:34:23,951 --> 02:34:28,240
your life improves a lot so and it,
it frees you up.

2771
02:34:28,510 --> 02:34:33,510
It also means there's a,
there's an element there that's also 

2772
02:34:33,510 --> 02:34:36,061
associated with pride because people 
tend to take pride in who they are and 

2773
02:34:36,061 --> 02:34:41,001
that's a bad idea because that stops you
from becoming who you could be because 

2774
02:34:41,281 --> 02:34:46,281
if you're proud of who you are,
you won't let that go when it's 

2775
02:34:46,281 --> 02:34:46,440
necessary.
You won't step away from it,

2776
02:34:46,940 --> 02:34:51,940
you know,
and then you end up being your own 

2777
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:51,940
parody.
Something like that.

2778
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:54,780
That's also a very bad idea.
You want to be continually stepping away

2779
02:34:54,781 --> 02:34:59,781
from your previous self and so big and I
guess part of that too is that you have 

2780
02:35:00,361 --> 02:35:01,290
to decide,
you know,

2781
02:35:01,291 --> 02:35:06,291
are you,
are you order or chaos or you the 

2782
02:35:06,291 --> 02:35:09,801
process that mediates between them and 
if you're the process that mediates 

2783
02:35:09,801 --> 02:35:09,801
between them,
you,

2784
02:35:09,801 --> 02:35:14,210
you are the thing that transforms and 
that's the right attitude for a human 

2785
02:35:14,210 --> 02:35:18,881
being because that's what we are.
We're the thing that voluntarily 

2786
02:35:18,881 --> 02:35:21,740
confronts chaos and transforms.
That's what we are.

2787
02:35:22,370 --> 02:35:24,520
And so for better or worse,
you know,

2788
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:28,430
that's our deepest biological essence 
you might say,

2789
02:35:28,910 --> 02:35:32,060
and so you can let things go if you know
that there's more growth to come.

2790
02:35:32,990 --> 02:35:34,810
So yeah,

2791
02:35:39,030 --> 02:35:42,690
thank you.

2792
02:35:42,770 --> 02:35:47,770
One more.
Thank you for your time and thank you 

2793
02:35:47,770 --> 02:35:47,810
for spending your time with all of us.
Hey,

2794
02:35:47,811 --> 02:35:49,250
my pleasure.
It's been a pleasure.

2795
02:35:50,090 --> 02:35:53,090
So if I could,
since we are at the end of genesis,

2796
02:35:53,390 --> 02:35:58,390
I liked the opportunity to challenge or 
at least have you take another look at 

2797
02:35:58,390 --> 02:36:02,171
your position you've held with regards 
to reflection on the murder of evil.

2798
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:08,100
Uh,
I bring this up because it's actually a 

2799
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:10,121
part of genesis that has bothered me for
awhile and it's not like because it's 

2800
02:36:10,121 --> 02:36:10,880
not as straightforward as it's 
presented,

2801
02:36:10,881 --> 02:36:13,790
usually in straight.
I've been wrestling with it.

2802
02:36:13,791 --> 02:36:18,230
So in this series as well as in a couple
of your maps of meaning lectures,

2803
02:36:18,440 --> 02:36:23,440
you summarized it,
something to the effect of cane coming 

2804
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:26,531
to the conclusion that what he did leads
to a punishment which is more than he 

2805
02:36:26,531 --> 02:36:30,491
believes he can face,
which I believe to be born out of a 

2806
02:36:30,491 --> 02:36:33,881
natural reading,
a specific translation choices 

2807
02:36:33,881 --> 02:36:36,700
incorrectly made entry innocently made 
by editors Just for readability sake.

2808
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:42,880
So in genesis four,
13 cane does not say my punishment is 

2809
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:46,150
greater than I can bear.
He actually says they'll meat,

2810
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:50,700
so my sIn is greater than I can bear,
which is this,

2811
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:53,780
which is to say it's not his past 
actions.

2812
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:56,650
We'll just say it's not as past 
sections.

2813
02:36:56,660 --> 02:37:01,660
It's his future as consequences which a 
past actions not as feature 

2814
02:37:01,660 --> 02:37:03,460
consequences,
which he regrets for him to say,

2815
02:37:03,461 --> 02:37:05,030
oh,
won't iniquity or sin.

2816
02:37:05,330 --> 02:37:10,330
That is far too much for him to bear as 
a reflection on the reality of this 

2817
02:37:10,330 --> 02:37:11,720
corruPtion and not a plea of mercy to 
the dd despair him.

2818
02:37:12,290 --> 02:37:13,040
Okay,
well that's,

2819
02:37:13,070 --> 02:37:16,130
that seems to be a deeper interpretation
I would say.

2820
02:37:17,150 --> 02:37:22,010
And I think it's more that's the same 
line of reasoning that dusty see pursued

2821
02:37:22,011 --> 02:37:23,960
in crime and punishment,
right?

2822
02:37:23,961 --> 02:37:28,961
Because in crime and punishment,
skolnick of gets away with murder and 

2823
02:37:28,961 --> 02:37:32,681
then he cannot stand it.
He cannot stand that he did it because 

2824
02:37:32,681 --> 02:37:36,011
he's no longer the same person,
but even more he cannot stand that he 

2825
02:37:36,011 --> 02:37:37,070
got away with it.
so that's more in keeping with the,

2826
02:37:37,830 --> 02:37:39,370
with that interpretation.
So,

2827
02:37:39,690 --> 02:37:44,690
uh,
this also is reflected in the following 

2828
02:37:44,690 --> 02:37:45,670
verses for 14 where he states the 
consequences of his actions,

2829
02:37:45,910 --> 02:37:50,910
mainly that god's presence will be 
hidden from him and that he will be 

2830
02:37:50,910 --> 02:37:51,760
killed.
The first opens with the word hain,

2831
02:37:51,761 --> 02:37:56,761
which means indeed more or less.
And to note the sense of acceptance and 

2832
02:37:56,761 --> 02:37:59,350
not a complaint,
it is the difference between saying,

2833
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:00,520
oh no,
well god,

2834
02:38:00,580 --> 02:38:05,580
now hide his face from me and will I be 
hunted versus of course god will hide 

2835
02:38:05,580 --> 02:38:06,790
his face for me and I will be hunted and
killed,

2836
02:38:07,510 --> 02:38:12,510
which I've been wrestling lists and have
taken away to possibly mean that there 

2837
02:38:12,510 --> 02:38:16,270
are sins that we can do that we'll just 
push us too far.

2838
02:38:16,530 --> 02:38:17,310
Well,
okay,

2839
02:38:17,311 --> 02:38:17,940
there,
there,

2840
02:38:17,941 --> 02:38:18,930
there are.
Well,

2841
02:38:18,990 --> 02:38:20,960
okay,
so one of the.

2842
02:38:21,150 --> 02:38:26,150
Well,
one of the things that you see in 

2843
02:38:26,150 --> 02:38:27,060
posttraumatic posttraumatic stress 
disorder situations,

2844
02:38:27,061 --> 02:38:32,061
for example,
is that people view themselves doing 

2845
02:38:32,061 --> 02:38:33,900
something so terrible.
They don't know how to put it right.

2846
02:38:34,530 --> 02:38:39,530
So that.
So you could say under those 

2847
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:41,391
circumstances,
the face of god is hidden from them 

2848
02:38:41,391 --> 02:38:43,170
because they cannot,
they cannot atone for it.

2849
02:38:43,171 --> 02:38:48,171
They count reconciled themselves to it.
It's there all the time and they can't 

2850
02:38:48,171 --> 02:38:50,370
see anything good beyond it.
It's hell essentially.

2851
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:55,880
And so in sometimes when you're working 
with people with posttraumatic stress 

2852
02:38:55,880 --> 02:38:55,880
disorder,
you know,

2853
02:38:55,880 --> 02:39:00,681
you,
you kind of initiatE them into a 

2854
02:39:00,681 --> 02:39:03,891
philosophy of good and evil so that they
can see when joseph talks to his 

2855
02:39:03,931 --> 02:39:06,180
brothers and they've got all this guilt,
right?

2856
02:39:06,181 --> 02:39:11,181
and,
and he doesn't want them to have more 

2857
02:39:11,181 --> 02:39:12,180
guilt than necessary to fix themselves 
because it just burdens them.

2858
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:13,080
otherwise he says,
look,

2859
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:14,670
don't forget,
yeah,

2860
02:39:14,671 --> 02:39:15,300
yeah,
it was you.

2861
02:39:15,301 --> 02:39:19,320
But it's also god's doing.
And I had a client once who,

2862
02:39:19,350 --> 02:39:22,460
who had obsessive compulsive disorder.
And um,

2863
02:39:22,780 --> 02:39:26,610
he was a very smart guy.
He also happened to work in a active lab

2864
02:39:26,611 --> 02:39:31,611
that hug a lot of radioactive materials,
which wasn't the best place for someone 

2865
02:39:31,611 --> 02:39:34,881
with ocd.
And he was worried that he would make 

2866
02:39:34,881 --> 02:39:39,141
some mistake.
This is very common with ocd that would 

2867
02:39:39,141 --> 02:39:39,660
result in someone's suffering,
which you will,

2868
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:40,620
you,
you'll do that.

2869
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:45,980
And it wasn't until I could get him to 
conceptualize himself and his life in 

2870
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:50,931
part as a force of nature that he was 
able to reconcile himself to the 

2871
02:39:51,570 --> 02:39:56,570
possibility that an error on his part 
would produce catastrophic consequences.

2872
02:39:57,200 --> 02:40:02,200
But people often find themselves in 
situations where they just cannot 

2873
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:04,410
reconcile themselves to what they've 
done and that it makes sense to me that,

2874
02:40:04,970 --> 02:40:08,620
that the interpretation that you're 
describing that that makes,

2875
02:40:09,050 --> 02:40:14,050
that makes plenty of sense from a 
psychological perspective that will push

2876
02:40:14,431 --> 02:40:17,640
us to like just beyond our limit that 
are too far,

2877
02:40:18,150 --> 02:40:23,150
but there are also no consequences to 
our actions that are devoid of a truth 

2878
02:40:23,150 --> 02:40:24,480
we can accept and learn from.

2879
02:40:24,890 --> 02:40:28,320
And this is what I've kind of delved out
of this a bit with cain and abel.

2880
02:40:28,530 --> 02:40:31,890
So this is the case.
Why then does it take us so long?

2881
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:35,700
And it was so much self to now before we
accept personal responsibility,

2882
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:38,930
my face with tragedy,
especially when it's self inflicted.

2883
02:40:43,540 --> 02:40:48,540
Well I don't think you want to 
underestimate the contribution of just 

2884
02:40:48,540 --> 02:40:50,940
sheer dIfficulty.
Like you know,

2885
02:40:51,810 --> 02:40:55,740
let's say you,
you,

2886
02:40:55,810 --> 02:40:57,900
you,
you're grieving because someone close to

2887
02:40:57,901 --> 02:40:59,870
you died.
It's like,

2888
02:40:59,910 --> 02:41:01,590
well it isn't just that you've lost 
them.

2889
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:06,710
Although that's a big part of it.
It's that you have to rebuild yourself 

2890
02:41:06,710 --> 02:41:11,420
and it's really hard to do that.
So it is sort of proportional to the 

2891
02:41:11,420 --> 02:41:16,010
significance of your errors,
so if you commit an error and then you 

2892
02:41:16,010 --> 02:41:18,120
recognize that it's an error,
if it's a sort of surface area it's like

2893
02:41:18,150 --> 02:41:23,150
well you can just touch up the paint,
but sometimes the whole under structure 

2894
02:41:23,151 --> 02:41:28,151
is just rotten and then you don't know 
what to do.

2895
02:41:30,290 --> 02:41:31,700
And then.
So that's one problem.

2896
02:41:31,740 --> 02:41:34,920
Just sheer bloody difficulty.
And I see this with people very often.

2897
02:41:34,921 --> 02:41:37,170
It's like they're at a point in their 
divorce,

2898
02:41:37,171 --> 02:41:39,480
let's say,
and they don't know what to do.

2899
02:41:39,660 --> 02:41:42,780
They cannot solve the problem.
It's too complicated.

2900
02:41:43,470 --> 02:41:48,470
They just don't have the resources and 
maybe they've squandered some of their 

2901
02:41:48,470 --> 02:41:51,201
resources as well,
but sometimes they just don't have the 

2902
02:41:51,201 --> 02:41:53,451
resources.
And then if you add to that error and 

2903
02:41:53,451 --> 02:41:54,090
sin and malevolence and blindness and 
all those other things.

2904
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:56,850
people.
There's a guy named thomas says,

2905
02:41:56,880 --> 02:42:01,880
who wrote this really interesting 
article in the 19 sixties and book 

2906
02:42:01,880 --> 02:42:01,980
actually called the myth of mental 
illness.

2907
02:42:02,460 --> 02:42:07,460
And it was classic reading for clinical 
psychologist when I was training.

2908
02:42:08,220 --> 02:42:11,430
And the reason for that was,
that sounds pointed out,

2909
02:42:11,431 --> 02:42:16,431
and this is true,
is that lots of times if you're a 

2910
02:42:16,431 --> 02:42:19,770
psychotherapist,
people don't come to you because they 

2911
02:42:19,770 --> 02:42:21,861
have mental illnesses.
They had come to you because they have 

2912
02:42:21,861 --> 02:42:23,070
insoluble problems in their life.
You know,

2913
02:42:23,071 --> 02:42:26,370
like maybe they've had a two year affair
at work,

2914
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:32,720
their wife is alcoholic and they have a 
very and their father has alzheimer's 

2915
02:42:33,931 --> 02:42:34,440
disease.

2916
02:42:35,090 --> 02:42:36,930
It's like they just don't know what to 
do.

2917
02:42:37,650 --> 02:42:39,150
It's too much now,
you know,

2918
02:42:39,151 --> 02:42:44,151
they shouldn't have had the affair.
So there's a moral issue and maybe they 

2919
02:42:44,151 --> 02:42:44,970
should have intervened in the alcoholism
in the family.

2920
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:50,120
Maybe they use their wives,
alcoholism as an excuse to have the 

2921
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:50,120
affair.
You know,

2922
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:51,060
like these things get very tangled.
It's just,

2923
02:42:51,061 --> 02:42:53,850
it's so bloody complicated that people 
can't untangle it.

2924
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:59,660
So.
And I would say that's in keeping with 

2925
02:42:59,660 --> 02:43:02,271
the interpretation that you laid forth 
with regards to cain is it sounds like 

2926
02:43:02,271 --> 02:43:05,070
it's one of the reasons why it's so 
useful to read multiple translations,

2927
02:43:05,071 --> 02:43:08,160
right?
Because nuances matter.

2928
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:14,120
it sounds to me from that descriPtion 
that he actually woke up at least 

2929
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:16,570
briefly and noticed what he did and 
said,

2930
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:19,780
there's no coming back from this and and
it is.

2931
02:43:19,810 --> 02:43:23,860
You can easIly get places that you do 
not know how to come back from.

2932
02:43:23,890 --> 02:43:24,340
Now.
You know,

2933
02:43:24,341 --> 02:43:24,880
they say,
well,

2934
02:43:24,881 --> 02:43:29,881
all things are possible with god and 
there's always the possibility of 

2935
02:43:29,881 --> 02:43:30,490
redemption.
No matter how serious the sin,

2936
02:43:30,491 --> 02:43:35,491
but I'll tell you is sometimes people 
have no idea how to get back from where 

2937
02:43:35,491 --> 02:43:39,391
they went well,
and you can understand often why people 

2938
02:43:40,121 --> 02:43:41,620
wouldn't do that,
right?

2939
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:42,580
Yeah.
Well,

2940
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:47,940
that's a funny thing because one of the 
things Carl Rogers said too about 

2941
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:50,971
Psychotherapy is that you can't do 
psychotherapy with someone who hasn't 

2942
02:43:50,971 --> 02:43:54,331
recognized that they have a problem.
so it's a massive thing to recognize 

2943
02:43:54,331 --> 02:43:58,090
that you have a problem and it does open
the door perhaps to recovery,

2944
02:43:58,390 --> 02:44:03,390
but it also means that you've recognized
that you have a problem and that can be 

2945
02:44:03,390 --> 02:44:03,390
very,
very.

2946
02:44:03,430 --> 02:44:04,570
it's the desert,
right?

2947
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:09,750
You're out of the tyranny,
but you're in the desert and the sun's 

2948
02:44:09,750 --> 02:44:12,331
beating down on you and there's no 
necessary reason to presume that you're 

2949
02:44:12,331 --> 02:44:13,800
going to survive.
So thank you.

2950
02:44:13,810 --> 02:44:16,930
Have guidance.
Thank you all.

2951
02:44:19,580 --> 02:44:23,340
Thank you.
