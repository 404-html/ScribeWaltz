00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,870
Hello everyone,
it's been a very strange day.

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,940
So I'm going to tell you about what 
happened and then I'll start the 

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,031
lecture.
So I got up this morning and started to 

4
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:34,601
put my day together and I tried to sign 
into my gmail account and it said that 

5
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:41,951
it had been disabled because I violated 
the terms of service with g mail.

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,780
And I thought,
well,

7
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,740
I didn't violate any terms of service 
that I know of now.

8
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:56,690
I set up a new youtube channel yesterday
called Jordan b Peterson clips and so we

9
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:01,691
made some technical changes and so I 
thought maybe it had something to do 

10
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:04,931
with that.
And I had been shot out of Google one 

11
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,621
other time years ago.
So when you get a shout out like that,

12
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,340
there's a little form you can fill out.
And so I filled out the form and I said 

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,430
that I had been shot out and uh,
that I didn't know why.

14
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,610
And I sent it off.
And then I realized one of my staff 

15
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:29,690
members called me and said that she was 
locked out of the youtube account.

16
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,040
And I thought,
Oh yeah,

17
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,380
the youtube account is hooked to the 
Gmail Account,

18
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,800
so that meant that I couldn't get access
to any of my youtube videos.

19
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:39,530
They were still up and online,
but I couldn't get access to them.

20
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,870
I couldn't post last week's Biblical 
lecture for,

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,030
for,
for example.

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,240
And so that was worrisome and made me 
suspicious.

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,830
And then about two hours later,
something like that,

24
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:56,831
I got an email from Google and they said
that they had reviewed the my request to

25
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:03,041
be reinstated and that I had violated 
Google's terms of agreement or terms of 

26
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,830
service and they weren't going to turn 
my account back on.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And I thought.
And they didn't say why they didn't say 

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,100
anything.
I got,

29
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:15,080
there was no warning whatsoever about 
any of this.

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,080
They didn't tell me why.
And they didn't say why in the email 

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,050
response.
And so I wrote them back and I said,

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,770
because they said I could.
I wrote them back and I said,

33
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,880
this might not be a good idea,
basically,

34
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,010
and you might want to think about it.
And then I twitted tweeted what had 

35
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,010
happened.
Right.

36
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,571
I took screenshots and I tweeted and I 
contacted a whole bunch of journalists 

37
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:44,861
because it turns out that I know a whole
bunch of journalists and so and so.

38
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:50,321
Then what happened then was that I got a
call from the daily caller in the United

39
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,420
States.
I had done an interview with them last 

40
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,790
week,
which isn't posted yet and they 

41
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,041
interviewed me and within 20 minutes 
posted it online and so they have a 

42
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:07,741
fairly big audience and so that was good
and then somebody phoned me from Ottawa 

43
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:10,090
and I did a live radio show about that 
and that was good.

44
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,090
And then a number of other journalists 
contacted me and I sent them the 

45
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,260
information,
but another one of my staff actually,

46
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,390
my son emailed me and he said,
look,

47
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,940
you should hold off because maybe there 
still a mistake here.

48
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,410
And I thought,
yeah,

49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,390
there might be.
It might be just a mistake,

50
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,840
but then why in the world did I email 
google?

51
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:33,841
And they contacted me and they said they
would not reinstate it and they didn't 

52
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:37,051
provide me with any information.
So I contacted the other journalists and

53
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:37,690
I said,
well,

54
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,580
you never know,
maybe this is just a mistake,

55
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:44,581
so let's hold off.
And then while I was about half an hour 

56
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:48,811
later while I was trying to get into my,
I used this ad words account that's 

57
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:53,370
linked to google.
I don't run ads on my videos but I need 

58
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,551
the adwords account because it helps me 
add some little gadgets to the videos 

59
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:56,890
that I wouldn't otherwise be able to.

60
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,320
And I was.
I was playing with that.

61
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,750
The system came back online.
I thought,

62
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,710
well that's interesting and lots of 
people that emailed me and twittered me 

63
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,971
and some people within Google and some 
people elsewhere and they were doing 

64
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:15,901
whatever they were going to do to help 
me get all this material back up and 

65
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:15,901
running.
And so something worked.

66
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,720
My suspicions are that what worked was 
the publicity now.

67
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,710
So,
but maybe not,

68
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:25,711
you know,
it's very weird being in this situation 

69
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:29,551
because there has been a number of 
recent episodes where these larger 

70
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,090
companies,
facebook,

71
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,720
Google Patrion.
Not that it's a massive company,

72
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,910
but it's starting to become reasonably 
significant,

73
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,180
have decided on rather arbitrary grounds
to shut down their users.

74
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:46,360
And this is very ominous to me,
partly because we've,

75
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,550
we've turned our communications over to 
very large systems or very large systems

76
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:53,560
have emerged to mediate our 
communication,

77
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:53,770
right?

78
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,770
I mean there's lots of benefit to it so 
you don't want to get too cynical about 

79
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,561
it,
but we're blind with regards to the 

80
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:02,730
policies that regulate the,
the,

81
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,850
the actions,
the regulatory actions of these large 

82
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:07,850
organizations.
And that's really a bad thing.

83
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,520
And something else has even more 
ominous,

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,260
really ominous,
you know,

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,440
it's highly probable that we're going to
build political algorithms into our 

86
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:20,290
artificial intelligence and this sort of
thing will be regulated by machines that

87
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:25,291
no one understands and that's a really 
bad idea and that's a really likely 

88
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,670
possibility.
So anyways,

89
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,860
I was all confused about this.
I thought Jesus,

90
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,050
maybe I flew off the handle,
you know,

91
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:35,170
because I was sort of was stressful man,
you know,

92
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:38,380
because I have like 150,000
emails in that account.

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,970
Like that's a lot of emails and it's all
my correspondence for the last 10 years,

94
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:45,700
you know,
so it's an archive as well as an ongoing

95
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,080
email system.

96
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,080
I have a commercial email system that I 
just set up three weeks ago with like 

97
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,520
six different email addresses now to try
to organize my correspondent so I wasn't

98
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:59,521
completely unable to communicate but my 
was gone and that's a bloody disaster 

99
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:04,301
because like I've got things scheduled 
out forever and I don't remember what 

100
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:08,201
they are.
I can't even remember what I'm doing in 

101
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,661
a day so much less than a month.
But I thought maybe I flew off the 

102
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:15,401
handle and I was worried that I 
contacted the journalists too soon and 

103
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:15,401
you know.
But anyways,

104
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:18,470
it all worked out.
So then what happened?

105
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:21,830
Well,
just as I was coming to this lecture,

106
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,180
I stepped outside and there was little 
package outside.

107
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,580
Luckily it wasn't a bomb and there was 
an here's a package outside.

108
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,810
Nice little packages.
We look,

109
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,840
my wife and I looked inside it and there
was a couple of bottles of wine in 

110
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:34,840
there.
So that was nice.

111
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,131
And there was a little note and so I'm 
going to read you the little note 

112
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:39,131
because it's actually pretty 
interesting.

113
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,800
So.

114
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,180
So this person said that they had 
finally tackled the self authoring 

115
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,460
suite,
so they seem to be happy about that,

116
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,460
but that's not so interesting except 
peripherally.

117
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,510
A friend on twitter has contact with 
Google engineers.

118
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,060
She said,
quote,

119
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,420
I spoke with some friends inside Google 
who offered to help and I did get 

120
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,071
contacted by quite a few people at 
Google who said that they had been 

121
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,540
watching my lectures and so on and we're
happy about what I was doing.

122
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Anyways,
I spoke with some friends inside Google 

123
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,081
who offered to help,
but they suggest he set up a backup 

124
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:23,351
plan.
The teams are feeling significant 

125
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:26,201
pressure from advocacy groups and quote,
I have at least four Google engineers 

126
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:33,461
who offered to speak up on his behalf,
but they know the team dynamics and 

127
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:38,261
unfortunately especially youtube is an 
sjw cesspool.

128
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,250
I hope this information is useful to 
you.

129
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,510
It's like,
yeah,

130
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,830
it's kind of useful.
Alright,

131
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,820
so that was,
that was part of what happened today.

132
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,540
And so anyways,
I still don't really understand it 

133
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,521
right,
because I don't know why it got shut 

134
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,621
down and I don't know if anything I did 
got it turned back on and I don't know 

135
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:05,240
the reasons for it.
And that's also rather ominous.

136
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,570
It seems to me that when I was thinking 
it through and was that.

137
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,860
No,
I have a fairly,

138
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,300
what would you call it?
Respectable Youtube following and I 

139
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,790
don't know if you necessarily call it 
respectable.

140
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,910
It's fairly large youtube following and 
it seems to me that it would have been 

141
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,060
appropriate for Google if they were 
going to shut down my account to tell me

142
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:37,181
why I would think and also maybe look me
up maybe especially after I emailed them

143
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,760
and then maybe not to have emailed me 
back and said,

144
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,710
no,
we're not going to reinstate you,

145
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,410
but we're not going to tell you any 
reasons that they didn't say.

146
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,560
They wouldn't tell me any reasons.
They just didn't tell me any reasons.

147
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,070
And then it also seems very strange to 
me that it just all of a sudden went 

148
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,691
back on after two hours and so well.
So I don't know what to make of that.

149
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,020
Maybe more information will come to 
light over the next few days.

150
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:10,200
I hope that I didn't jump the gun,
but it's very,

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,800
very peculiar set of circumstances.
I thought it was kind of amusing 

152
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,670
actually,
that the video that they stopped me from

153
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:20,490
posting today was the last Biblical 
lecture.

154
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:25,491
You wouldn't necessarily think that that
would be the sort of thing that people 

155
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:26,220
would want to stop from being posted.
But um,

156
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,440
we're in very,
very strange times.

157
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,190
So that was my adventure for today.
And so I didn't,

158
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,720
you know,
I hate speakers who apologized to the 

159
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:40,720
crowd before they talk to them because,
you know,

160
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,210
if you're speaking to people and they 
put all this effort into coming,

161
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:50,211
then you shouldn't tell them what a 
sorry and useless creature you are 

162
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:50,400
before you talk to them,
you know,

163
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,950
and asked for their forbearance and 
forgiveness.

164
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,300
It's like,
it's a little,

165
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,750
you're a little late for that,
but I'm still gonna do that a little bit

166
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:01,890
today because I wanted to spend all day 
preparing this lecture.

167
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,680
I mean,
I've prepared it a lot before hand,

168
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,490
but that rattled me up a lot and so I 
didn't prepare as much as I could have.

169
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,910
Anyways.
We'll stumble forward and see how it 

170
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,910
goes.
I,

171
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm,
I'm,

172
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,760
I'm reasonably familiar with the stories
now and so onward and upward.

173
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,140
So I'm going to reiterate this,
you know,

174
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,530
I've learned something.
I have this idea that it would be a good

175
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,680
idea for young people and older people,
citizens of the West,

176
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,710
let's say,
to learn more about their culture and 

177
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,020
their civilization,
right?

178
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,110
Because it's a great civilization and 
it's,

179
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,540
it's,
it's taken a lot of work to put 

180
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:47,540
together,
but I don't think that we really know.

181
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,760
I mean I know a fair bit about it,
although I wouldn't consider myself 

182
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,040
nearly as educated as a person should 
be,

183
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,430
but I'm not too badly educated and.

184
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,080
But I tell ya,
going through these biblical lectures 

185
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,020
verse by verse just makes me even more 
aware of how unbelievably ignorant I am,

186
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,060
you know,
and partly for two reasons.

187
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,240
One is because I've been using this 
bible hub dotcom place and I think I 

188
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,501
told you last week,
but I wanted to reiterate it because 

189
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,800
it's important.
It's so interesting the way that they've

190
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:24,801
set it up because you can go through the
biblical stories verse by verse and then

191
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,170
for each verse there's a whole small 
font page of commentary from multiple 

192
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,780
sources and so you know,
not only is the Bible hybrid hyperlinked

193
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:37,650
in the way that I discussed in the first
lecture with all the verses referring to

194
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:39,780
not all the other verses but lots of 
them,

195
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,080
but it's,
and it's got its tendrils out into 

196
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,080
literature,
you know,

197
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,030
direct commentaries on the text,
but also all the,

198
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,280
all the literature that's been 
influenced by it.

199
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:50,870
So it's,
it's,

200
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,920
it's an unbelievably central and text 
and

201
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,220
it's so interesting to read a book where
every sentence has been commented on 

202
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,360
what really in volumes and then just to 
get a sense of that volume of material.

203
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:09,361
You know,
how much power brain power there's been 

204
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:09,361
put into this.
And,

205
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,350
and to also understand how bloody 
ignorant,

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,680
like I'm so ignorant about this.
There's all this work and it seems that 

207
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,660
we've left at to decay in the dust and 
it's a big mistake,

208
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:24,661
man.
It's a big mistake because the people 

209
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:24,661
who were writing these commentaries 
like,

210
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,290
you know,
a lot of it's from the 14th and 15th and

211
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,480
16th century.
It's kind of archaic and it's,

212
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,090
and it's,
some of it's outdated and some of it you

213
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:36,091
wouldn't agree with,
but if you read all the commentaries 

214
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:36,091
side by side,
you know,

215
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,270
you get a pretty good blast of wisdom 
coming at you.

216
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:42,271
And like the thing about wisdom is it 
stops you from running face first into 

217
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:42,310
walls.

218
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,140
You know,
it's not just there to,

219
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,410
to so that you can talk to people at 
parties about what university you 

220
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:49,630
graduated from.
You know,

221
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,070
and it's there because the information 
is unbelievably useful.

222
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,470
You know,
one of the things that I realized that I

223
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:01,471
want to return to tonight because I've 
been thinking a lot about this idea of 

224
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:01,471
the arc.
You know,

225
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:05,401
and I think I mentioned to you last week
that I'd figured out that there's this 

226
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:09,751
idea that noah was perfect in his 
generations and that meant that he has 

227
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:09,760
said his family in order.
It wasn't just him,

228
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:12,250
but he had said his family in order and 
because of that,

229
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,110
when,
when the catastrophe came,

230
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,830
like it comes to everyone,
he was able to withstand it because he 

231
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,400
had the support of the people who were 
near and dear to him.

232
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,740
And that's really important when things 
come along to lay you low,

233
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:27,250
like if you're alone and in the flood 
comes,

234
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,980
it's like man,
goodbye to you.

235
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,520
If you've got 10 or 15 people supporting
you in a tight network,

236
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:33,960
you know,
and,

237
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:38,961
and you're,
you're interrelationships with them are 

238
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:40,030
pristine and you can tell them the truth
and they can tell the truth back to you.

239
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,240
It's possible that you might be able to 
find that thin way that will preserve 

240
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,430
you.
When,

241
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,210
when,
when,

242
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,470
when you know the terrible things come 
knocking at your door.

243
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,850
And so there's this idea of the arc is 
very,

244
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:59,851
very concrete in Noah.
It's actually a structure that that he 

245
00:13:59,851 --> 00:13:59,851
inhabits.
You know,

246
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:02,200
what's a concretized almost like a 
child's story,

247
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:07,201
and,
and I'm not being cynical about that 

248
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:07,450
because there are some bloody brilliant 
child children's stories,

249
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:09,400
but you know,
it's really concretized,

250
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:11,800
but then Abraham comes along and instead
of an arc,

251
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:15,370
there's a covenant right now,
it says in the story of Noah,

252
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:18,490
that Noah walked with God and,
and of course Abraham,

253
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,910
it isn't clear exactly these walking 
with God or before God,

254
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:24,170
which we'll get into later,
but you see,

255
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:26,980
I see this as part of the increasing 
psycho psychology,

256
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:31,870
ization of the sacred ideas that were 
acted out by archaic people.

257
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,870
So first of all,
it's concretized in the form of a ship 

258
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,280
that actually sustains you when the 
floods come,

259
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:39,700
right?
It's,

260
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,900
it's very concrete imagery,
the sort of thing you might see in a 

261
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:44,900
movie.
But then with Abraham,

262
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,230
it turns into a psychological covenant 
in some sense.

263
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:49,820
It's like a contractual agreement.
Now it's a country.

264
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,400
It's a contractual agreement between 
Abraham and God,

265
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,710
but that doesn't really matter that.
I mean,

266
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,330
obviously it matters,
but it's only,

267
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,550
it's only half of what's important about
that.

268
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,850
The other half is that it's a contract 
and you know,

269
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,270
one of the things that you do with your 
ideal,

270
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:13,271
let's say as you establish a contract 
with it and you also establish a social 

271
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:13,280
contract with other people,
right?

272
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:18,230
That's what keeps society organized and 
so there's this idea that emerges in the

273
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:23,231
Abraham stories have a sacred contract 
and that has the same function as the 

274
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:26,690
arc and what it does because what 
happens in Abraham and we'll see more of

275
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:29,630
this today is that he,
you know,

276
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:34,631
God tells him to go forward into the 
world and we've talked about that last 

277
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:34,631
week and he does that.

278
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:38,770
He encounters famine and he encounters 
tyranny and he encounters powerful 

279
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,740
people who want to take from him.
What is his.

280
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,020
I mean,
God sends him out in the world,

281
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,610
but it's not like he has an easy ride of
it.

282
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:46,280
It isn't easy at all.
It's as hard as it can be,

283
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,550
but there's this consistent emphasis in 
the text and I think it's something 

284
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,680
really worth attending to that.
If you maintain your contract,

285
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:59,681
which and that has,
that has to do with honesty and trust 

286
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:00,780
and truth and all of those things.
If you maintain your contract,

287
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:05,781
then you have a good possibility,
the best possible possibility of making 

288
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:08,120
your way through the catastrophe and the
chaos and the.

289
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,060
I don't want to be naive about this.
You know,

290
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:16,061
when I read young and I started to 
understand the idea of the hero 

291
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:19,331
archetype,
you know the idea that the human being 

292
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:19,331
is a,
is a force,

293
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:23,431
a logos forest that can stand up against
chaos and catastrophe and tragedy and 

294
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:24,380
evil and prevail.

295
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,700
I never did think that that meant that 
if you did stand up and tell the truth,

296
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,740
that you would necessarily prevail,
right?

297
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,060
It's not,
it's not.

298
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,670
It's not a magic trick.
It's your best bet.

299
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,860
That's the thing.
You don't have a better option.

300
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,200
And so,
and that's what's.

301
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,190
That's what that I see the idea is 
emerging in the abrahamic texts.

302
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:46,400
It's like people are figuring this out.
That would be progressive revelation.

303
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:51,401
That's one way of thinking about it and 
you can think about that religious 

304
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:54,371
terms,
but you can also think about it as 

305
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:54,371
humanity consulting itself,
right?

306
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:57,050
Each individual talking to themselves,
which is what we do when we,

307
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,140
when we think and each individual 
communicating with every other 

308
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,441
individual and gathering a body of 
wisdom that helps people or orient 

309
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:11,261
themselves in the toughest conditions 
and it's an incremental process and I 

310
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:15,350
think that I really do believe that 
that's speaking purely secularly.

311
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,190
I do believe that that's what manifests 
itself in the biblical stories,

312
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:24,191
right?
It's the dawning enlightenment of 

313
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:24,191
mankind,
something like that.

314
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:28,360
As we start to understand the principles
by which we have to live in order to 

315
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,321
orient ourselves properly in the world.
So and I also do believe,

316
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,360
and this is,
this is the thing that's the unspoken 

317
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,420
question,
is like you don't.

318
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:43,421
You don't have any idea how rich and 
fulfilling your life could be despite 

319
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:50,651
its tragedy and limitation.
If you stop doing the things that you 

320
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:54,951
know to be wrong.
It's a really grand experiment and one 

321
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:57,900
of the things that God tells Abraham 
constantly as as the story progresses,

322
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,250
especially every time Abraham makes the 
sacrifice,

323
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,380
God says,
walk with me and be perfect at something

324
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:07,950
like that,
and and so the injunction is well,

325
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:12,951
aim,
high established this relationship with 

326
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:15,921
the highest thing that you can conceive 
of which you might as well do that 

327
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:15,921
because,
well,

328
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:15,930
what are you going to do?

329
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,930
Establish a relationship with the most 
mediocre thing you can conceive of or 

330
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,150
you're going to establish a relationship
with the lowest thing you can conceive 

331
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,101
of.
People do that and I wouldn't recommend 

332
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:31,191
it.
It's a really bad thing and there's a 

333
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:32,100
lot of pain associated with that and 
maybe you know,

334
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:37,101
there's the,
there's pain that can expand into a 

335
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:39,891
world destroying forests down that route
and there's absolutely no doubt about 

336
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,430
that.
So what is there something superstitious

337
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:46,431
and foolish about attempting to 
establish a contractual relationship 

338
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:48,720
with the source of all being?
I mean,

339
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:49,020
I,
I,

340
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,590
I just don't see that as a,
as an erroneous conception and you know,

341
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,920
it's not necessary perhaps to get lost 
in the details.

342
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:02,250
We can argue forever about what God 
might or might not be,

343
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:07,251
but we could at least say that the 
concept of God is an embodiment of 

344
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,850
humanities,
highest ideal,

345
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,650
right?
We could at least agree on that.

346
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,030
And then you might say,
well,

347
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:17,031
is that real?
And the first thing I would say about 

348
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,840
that is there's a lot of things about 
the world we don't understand.

349
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,020
And the second thing I would say is it 
depends bloody well on what you mean by 

350
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,720
real,
that's for sure.

351
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,180
And that turns out to be a very 
complicated question.

352
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,710
So.

353
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,130
Okay,
so we left Abraham,

354
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:40,131
remember at the end last time he had 
just gone off to fight a bunch of kings 

355
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:44,661
and get his nephew back,
which seemed to be a pretty courageous 

356
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:45,360
act.
And so that brought a story to an end.

357
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:48,570
And it's interesting.
I think what happens in the narrative is

358
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:53,571
that there's a story.
So Abraham is somewhere and he goes 

359
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:53,571
somewhere else,
right?

360
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:57,621
That's the story.
And he has adventures along the way and 

361
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:58,260
those adventures are usually the typical
kind of adventure,

362
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:01,200
which is a rift in the structure of the 
story.

363
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,380
And exposure to a kind of chaos and 
novelty and then a reconstitution of 

364
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,100
the,
of the motive being.

365
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,960
So that's classic classic story,
right?

366
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,910
You are somewhere.
You're a certain way,

367
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,520
you're moving forward.
Something happens that you don't expect.

368
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:17,250
It blows you into pieces.
It introduces chaos,

369
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:17,720
right?
You,

370
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,010
you face the dragon,
you get the gold,

371
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,420
or maybe the bloody thing eats you in.

372
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,840
The story is over and then and then you 
get to where you're going.

373
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,980
But then the question is,
well,

374
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:27,570
what happens when you get to where 
you're going?

375
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:32,571
And that's a really important issue 
because one of the things that happens 

376
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,510
to people all the time in their life is 
that they get to where they're going and

377
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:38,100
then they don't know what to do,
right?

378
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:40,740
So for example,
you graduate from university,

379
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,580
it's like,
okay,

380
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,880
story over.
Who are you now?

381
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,790
Who are you the next day?
And so,

382
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,450
so what happens is when you succeed,
then there's the success crisis.

383
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,520
And the success crisis is,
well,

384
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,850
I've run this story to its end.
Now what?

385
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,090
And that's exactly what happens in,
in the abrahamic stories.

386
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:05,710
And there are punctuated by a period of 
contemplation and sacrifice,

387
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:08,800
so every time an abrahamic story comes 
to its end,

388
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,900
then Abraham makes another sacrifice and
commune with God,

389
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:16,150
and then he figures out what to do next 
and that seems,

390
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,530
that seems right.

391
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,130
It seems psychologically right,
because what you should do when your 

392
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,830
story comes to an end,
when you've achieved what it is that you

393
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:27,070
want to achieve or perhaps when you're 
in terribly dire straights,

394
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,960
but we won't talk about that at the 
moment.

395
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,820
When you've achieved what you need to 
achieve.

396
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:32,020
Then the next question is,
okay,

397
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:35,590
well now I'm that person or I have that 
character.

398
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,680
What?
What do I need to do next?

399
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:39,760
And some of that is always,
well,

400
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:44,761
what do I need to give up now?
What do I need to let go of so I can 

401
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:44,761
move to the next plateau?
Right?

402
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:48,850
Assuming that your life is a hopefully a
sequence of upward moving,

403
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,760
what would you call them?
It's like Sisyphus,

404
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,250
except you're actually,
each time you climb up the mountain,

405
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,980
you get a little higher on the mountain 
at something like that.

406
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,900
So it says office with an optimistic 
bent and,

407
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,390
and,
and maybe if you push the rock up the 

408
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,390
mountain properly and let it roll down 
then.

409
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,850
And if you do that right,
then it's okay.

410
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:08,290
Every time you roll it back up,
it's,

411
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,530
it's better in some sense.
And I don't think that's unrealistic 

412
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,771
either.
And so Abraham goes and rescues his 

413
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:21,481
nephew from this tyrannical kings that's
very brave and he doesn't take any 

414
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:23,560
reward for it because as far as he's 
concerned,

415
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:25,360
it's just a manifestation of the right 
thing.

416
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,370
And then he has another vision after 
these things.

417
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:35,371
That's the battle of the word of the 
Lord came unto Abraham in a vision 

418
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:35,371
saying,
fear not Abraham.

419
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:37,180
I'm the shield and I exceeding great 
reward.

420
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,130
And Abraham said,
Lord God,

421
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:44,131
what will give me seeing I go childless 
and the steward of my house is this 

422
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:44,131
Eliezer of Damascus.

423
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,330
Abraham said,
behold to me,

424
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,330
that was given no seed and lo,
no one born,

425
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,150
one,
one born in my host is mine.

426
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:53,710
Air and behold,
the word of the Lord came to him saying,

427
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,160
this shall not be nine heir,
but he that shall come forth out of own 

428
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,470
own,
own bowels shall be done here,

429
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,530
and he brought him forth abroad and he 
said,

430
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:07,531
now look to heaven and tell the stars if
you're able to number the number of 

431
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:08,080
them,
and he said unto him,

432
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,740
so shall thy seed be and neighbor and 
believed in the Lord,

433
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:13,450
and he counted it to him for 
righteousness,

434
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,660
and he said unto him,
I am the Lord that brought the out of 

435
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,350
the Chaldees to give this land to you to
inherit it.

436
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:21,520
And he said,
Lord God,

437
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,620
whereby shall I know that I shall 
inherit it?

438
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,160
And then he does this sacrifice.
Take me an effort,

439
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,920
a heifer,
three years old and the sheep goat and a

440
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,660
ram and a turtle,
dove and a young pigeon,

441
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,040
and then God comes down and well,
Abraham goes into a trance.

442
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,540
That's what it appears to be in the 
story and has a great terror.

443
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,600
And then God appears to him and I'll

444
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
just review this commentary again.
This is from Joseph Benson and when the 

445
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,401
sun was going down,
that's about the time when you wash up 

446
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:54,401
for the evening and he's,
he's,

447
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:57,980
he's praying and waiting towards evening
a deep sleep fell upon Abraham,

448
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,380
not a common sleep through weariness or 
carelessness,

449
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:05,381
but a divine ecstasy that being wholly 
taken off from things sensible he might 

450
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:07,160
be wholly taken up with a contemplation 
of things spiritual,

451
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,900
very strange,
very,

452
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:13,901
very strange series of interpretations 
because it does seem that what happens 

453
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:16,490
to Abraham that he falls into some sort 
of revelatory trance.

454
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,970
And so,
um,

455
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,920
when,
uh,

456
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,950
as I've taken some pains to explain,
we don't really understand such things 

457
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,841
and,
and we can't rule out their existence 

458
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:30,770
because there's too much evidence that 
they do in fact occur.

459
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,040
Perhaps it's a technology that we no 
longer possess.

460
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:39,041
That's one possibility.
Perhaps we no longer know how to access 

461
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:39,041
these sorts of states of consciousness.

462
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,030
It's certainly possible and lower horror
of great darkness fell upon him.

463
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,780
This was designed to strike all upon 
this spirit of Abraham and to possess 

464
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,141
them with holy reverence.
Holy fear prepares the soul for holy 

465
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:54,290
joy.
God humbles first and then lifts,

466
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,300
lifts up.
Yeah,

467
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,340
well I think that's right too.
Like you know,

468
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:03,341
one of the experiences I've had in my 
life fairly commonly in a variety of 

469
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:07,931
different ways,
and this is especially true when I was 

470
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:09,320
paying a lot of attention to my dreams,
which I did for about 15 years.

471
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:14,321
I guess something like that now.
And then I would feel like I learned 

472
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:17,891
some things and had sort of consolidated
them and then before I went to sleep I 

473
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:17,891
think,
okay,

474
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,690
I'm ready to learn something else.
It's like,

475
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,040
and it didn't say that without 
trepidation and usually because usually 

476
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,431
when you learn something,
you know it's not that pleasant because 

477
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:34,451
you usually learn something about why 
you're wrong and the deeper the thing 

478
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:37,901
that you learn,
the more you learn about why you're 

479
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:40,001
wrong and there's a death that's 
associated with that because then you 

480
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:40,070
have to let that part of you that's 
wrong,

481
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:40,850
die.

482
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,510
And that's,
that's really,

483
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,880
that's the sacrifice,
right?

484
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:48,881
And so you have to make a sacrifice.
You have to be willing to make a 

485
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:49,970
sacrifice before you're going to learn 
something and the.

486
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,060
And perhaps your,
what you'll learn is in proportion to 

487
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:59,450
your willingness to make a sacrifice,
and I really do believe that.

488
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:04,540
I do believe that as well because I also
think that if you commit to something 

489
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,560
that means that you don't do a bunch of 
other things.

490
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:14,561
Right.
So that's the sacrifice of all those 

491
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:14,561
other things.
You commit to it and you set your sights

492
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:18,971
on it.
If you really commit to it and you get 

493
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:18,971
the sacrifice right,
so to speak,

494
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:22,430
then the probability that that thing 
will be successful vastly increases.

495
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,700
And I think that that's also not a naive
or or a naive way of thinking or a 

496
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,360
foolish way of thinking.
I,

497
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,490
my experience has been that that's the 
case.

498
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,820
And so back to the dream.
I mean,

499
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,270
I do think that we learn in trepidation 
and that most of the time,

500
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:43,271
if,
if you have to be laid low before the 

501
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:44,190
new revelation can make itself

502
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:49,190
manifest.
And I think that's also what happens to 

503
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,710
people often in psychedelic experiences 
when they have a bad trip,

504
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,290
is they don't get through the bad part 
of it.

505
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,430
And maybe that's because there's so much
mess in their lives now I'm speculating,

506
00:26:56,431 --> 00:27:00,750
but it's informed speculation.
There's so much mess in their lives that

507
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:05,751
the altered state of consciousness makes
manifest that it's like a little trip 

508
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:08,901
through hell and,
but the mess is so complete and 

509
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:11,610
comprehensive and all pervading that 
there's no way they can get through it.

510
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,920
Now,
if they could get through it and started

511
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:16,020
to sort those things out,
then you know,

512
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:18,540
there would be perhaps a,
what would you call it,

513
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,840
a competent Satori positive revelation 
at the end.

514
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,380
But the first thing is if you want to 
learn something is that you're going to 

515
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,620
encounter.
Well,

516
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,800
you have to figure out what's wrong 
before you.

517
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,520
You can figure out what wisdom you need 
next to guide yourself.

518
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,470
And that's no laughing matter.
Right?

519
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:38,680
And,
um,

520
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,090
so I think that that's what,
that's what this refers to.

521
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,030
I think that's the sort of psychological
experience that,

522
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:50,031
that refers to.
I also think we built this a little bit 

523
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:51,420
into this,
into the future authoring program.

524
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,450
You know,
I read this really cool paper once 

525
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,720
reviewed by this guy named Jeffrey Gray.
Jeffrey Gray wrote a book called the 

526
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,230
neuropsychology of anxiety man,
and that is a great book.

527
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,260
It is impossible to read.
It took me really.

528
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:09,290
It took me like six months to read it 
and the reason for that is that he 

529
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,521
reviewed about 3000 papers and they're 
all neurological papers and and and 

530
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,180
heavy psychological slash biological 
papers.

531
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:23,390
He actually read them all and he 
understood them and synthesize them and 

532
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:27,981
then he wrote this book about the 
synthesis and so and he's very very 

533
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:32,061
careful with this terminology and so to 
read the book you have to understand 

534
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:32,760
brain anatomy and you have to understand
neuro,

535
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,780
neuro pharmacology and you have to end 
understand animal behavior.

536
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,500
The whole literature on animal behavior 
knocked whole whopping dose of human 

537
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:45,510
psychology and cybernetics.
It's like it's a vicious book,

538
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,780
but you really learn something when you 
read it.

539
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:53,781
If you go through it by bit like it's 
had an overwhelming influence on 

540
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:55,770
psychology even among people who haven't
read it,

541
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,160
which is most of the people who cite it 
by the way and so,

542
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,670
but he said he.
He outlined this real cool study.

543
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Maybe it was a sequence of studies about
how to motivate rats and rats are a lot 

544
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,850
like us on,
you know,

545
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,660
in,
in positive and negative ways and uh,

546
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,040
you know,
biochemically and,

547
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,850
and,
uh,

548
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,610
psycho pharmacologically,
they're very,

549
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:21,500
very similar and they have very complex 
social environments and you know,

550
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,760
they have hierarchies and they play and 
they laugh.

551
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:28,761
Jaak Panksepp,
Jaak Panksepp found out that routes 

552
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:28,761
laugh.
If you tickle them,

553
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:29,220
you can tickle them with like the end of
a pencil eraser,

554
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,300
but you can hear them laughing because 
they laugh ultrasonically like that.

555
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,480
So you have to record it and then slow 
it down and then you can hear them 

556
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:38,480
giggling away when you take a lump.
So,

557
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
so which is,
you know,

558
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:40,150
you think,
oh,

559
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:45,370
in I spend $50,000
on his study demonstrating that rats 

560
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:45,370
laugh and you think,
well,

561
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,480
wait a second,
wait a second.

562
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:47,860
That's a major league study.
You know,

563
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,420
because he's outlined a eluded circuit 
that's a place circuit.

564
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,610
And Jaak Panksepp discovered the play 
circuit had mammals.

565
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:56,560
That's a bloody big deal.
You know,

566
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,710
if you get that by like rubbing rats 
with a pencil eraser.

567
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,920
Well good for you.
So anyways,

568
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,850
so great.
Talked a lot about how to motivate a rat

569
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,880
and you might've heard about bf skinner,
you know,

570
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:11,860
he used food pellets to motivate his 
rats,

571
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:16,861
but what you don't know about skinner is
that those rats were starved to three 

572
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:16,861
quarters of their normal body weight.

573
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:22,110
So they would,
they would work for food and so 

574
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,410
skinner's routes were kind of 
oversimplified,

575
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:26,860
but you can get rats to work for food.
They don't have to be that hungry.

576
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:28,930
You can get them to work for food and 
they'll do all sorts of things.

577
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:33,931
They'll press leavers and they'll open 
our open doors and they'll solve 

578
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:36,400
problems and you know,
they'll do all sorts of things.

579
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,200
And one of the things you can do to kind
of measure how much the rat is motivated

580
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:42,670
is,
let's say you've run them through a maze

581
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:45,100
and he knows there's some food at the 
end of the maze.

582
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,300
You can tie a little spring to his tail 
and see how hard he polls.

583
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:54,301
When you open the door to the maze,
so that's because that's how much prep 

584
00:30:54,301 --> 00:30:55,880
work the route is willing to do so you 
can measure that or you can see fast,

585
00:30:55,881 --> 00:31:00,881
he skitters down the maze and you can 
get an estimate about the rats 

586
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:04,471
motivation and so then you might say,
well how motivated is a hungry rat?

587
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,420
And the answer would be depends on how 
hungry is,

588
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,510
but there's another answer.
It also depends on what's chasing him 

589
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,351
when he was going after the food.
So if you have a rat and you have food 

590
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:21,121
over here and you walked in,
some cat older rats hate cat odor and 

591
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:25,950
it's innate.
They never have to see or smell acat to 

592
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,520
be absolutely petrified by cat odor.
And so if you walked in some cat odor 

593
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,290
and then opened the door,
that rat will zoom to that food a lot 

594
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,811
faster than it will if it's just hungry.
So a rat running away from something 

595
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:41,400
that it doesn't want toward.
Something that it does want is a very 

596
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,060
motivated rat.
And so one of the things we did with the

597
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:46,120
future authoring program that's Germane 
to this idea of terror,

598
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:48,200
because there's a business idea in the 
Old Testament,

599
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:52,240
the fear of God is the beginning of 
wisdom and it's a pretty harsh idea,

600
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,770
but,
but there's something really useful 

601
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,701
about it because one of the things you 
see with people all the time is that 

602
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:03,100
there maybe they're trying to stumble 
forward towards their ideal as poorly 

603
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:06,070
defined as it might be,
but then they're afraid,

604
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:06,270
right?

605
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,320
They're afraid about what they might 
encounter and that stops them because 

606
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,250
fear does stop people.
It freezes you like a prey on them.

607
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:17,251
And so people move ahead,
but then they get afraid and then they 

608
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:17,320
start moving ahead.
And so,

609
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,370
and that's not so good because negative 
emotion is a really powerful motivator.

610
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:24,430
So we're more motivated by negative 
emotion than positive emotion,

611
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,040
quantitatively speaking,
quantitative,

612
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,990
quantitatively speaking.
You can measure that.

613
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,480
And that's,
I think because we can only be so happy,

614
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,790
but we can really be suffering and it,
you know,

615
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,490
so we have to pay more attention to the 
negative.

616
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,800
And that's bad because the negative can 
stop you.

617
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:43,760
And then my clinical practice,
I often talk to people who are trying to

618
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:48,761
make a difficult life decision and they 
are weighing out the costs and the 

619
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:50,040
benefits of making the life decision,
you know,

620
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,330
and one of the things I always talk to 
them about is wait a second,

621
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:54,860
that's an incomplete analysis.

622
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,550
You have to weigh out the benefits and 
the costs of doing this and you have to 

623
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,000
weigh out the costs and benefits of not 
doing that,

624
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,390
not doing it.
And that's not the same as the zero that

625
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:07,220
you assume that you're starting with,
right?

626
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:12,550
Because to not make a decision also has 
a cost and sometimes the cost of not 

627
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,950
making a decision is far worse than the 
cost of making a decision,

628
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:21,130
even if the decision is risky.
And so one of the things you can derive 

629
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,170
from that,
and this is very useful,

630
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,250
I think,
is that

631
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,350
this is also why it's so useful to 
contemplate your mortality,

632
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:29,180
so to speak,
as you're screwed,

633
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:31,520
no matter what you do,
you know,

634
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:33,700
and that actually frees you,
is that you,

635
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:34,810
you,
you have power,

636
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,840
hey that has catastrophes.
And you have path b that has 

637
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,730
catastrophes and you don't get to have 
the no catastrophe path,

638
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:45,731
but you get to pick which one.
And that's really something because if 

639
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:49,151
you know that there's terrible risk 
associated with everything that you do 

640
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:53,651
and don't do,
then you can afford to take some risks 

641
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:53,651
because you're not,
you know,

642
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:57,340
this is all within the arc metaphor.
I'm still making the case that despite 

643
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,960
the fact that your life is essentially 
catastrophic,

644
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,900
you can,
you can make a covenant with the highest

645
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:05,840
ideal and that will take you through it 
the best way possible.

646
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,670
I'm,
I'm still making that case.

647
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,820
So.

648
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,460
So then you think,
okay,

649
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:17,461
well I'm trying to make this decision,
I'm going to go try to do something 

650
00:34:17,461 --> 00:34:17,461
difficult and isn't that terrifying?
And then you think,

651
00:34:17,461 --> 00:34:18,190
yeah,
but wait a minute,

652
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,010
what's really terrifying is not doing 
it,

653
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,850
and then you think about the cost of not
doing it.

654
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:28,180
So in the future authoring program,
we have people do this little meditative

655
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:29,020
exercise,
which is,

656
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:32,290
okay,
just think about your insufficiencies by

657
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:33,490
your own definition,
right?

658
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:38,491
The way that you don't do what you know 
you should do about the things that you 

659
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:43,501
do that you shouldn't do,
that you know you shouldn't do beyond a 

660
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:43,501
shadow of a doubt,
right?

661
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:47,611
There's some things like that and that 
that's bad habits and poor aim and all 

662
00:34:47,611 --> 00:34:52,151
of resentment and hatred and aggression 
and unresolved conflicts and all those 

663
00:34:52,151 --> 00:34:54,610
things that are demanding you and 
warping you and then think,

664
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:56,740
okay,
those things get the upper hand man,

665
00:34:56,741 --> 00:35:01,741
they get the upper hand and they take 
you the worst possible place you could 

666
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:01,750
go in the next three to five years.

667
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,780
What exactly does that look like?
And so you schedule that out and you 

668
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:06,780
think,
hey,

669
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,311
I don't want to go there.
And so the next time that attempt 

670
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:11,311
Taishan comes up,
you think,

671
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:15,481
well,
it'd be a lot better for me if I didn't 

672
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:15,481
succumb to this temptation.
It's like,

673
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,630
that's Kinda weak.
You'd look a little better if you didn't

674
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:18,880
eat like a cheese cake a day or 
something like that.

675
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,830
You know,
that's something,

676
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:22,860
but it's not the same as,
um,

677
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,660
I'm going to have diabetes and I'm going
to lose my damn leg and in,

678
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,200
in five years if I don't get my eating 
under control,

679
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:34,350
that's motivating.
And so then the temptation comes along 

680
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:34,350
and you think,
oh,

681
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,970
how about no,
seriously how?

682
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:42,230
No,
not just because a higher good would be 

683
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,651
obtained if I avoided it,
but because of a terrible catastrophe 

684
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:46,380
would be averted if I didn't.

685
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,130
And so well.
So you want to get your fear behind you,

686
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,380
right?
You want to get it behind you where it's

687
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:57,381
pushing you forward instead of in front 
of you where it's stopping you and you 

688
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:59,850
get your fear behind you,
pushing you forward by actually thinking

689
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,850
through the consequences of not putting 
your life together.

690
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:04,830
And the least of those is that you waste
it.

691
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:07,200
And suffer right,
because you're going to suffer anyways,

692
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:09,840
man,
so you wasted and suffer.

693
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,050
That's a bad deal because maybe if 
you're going to suffer,

694
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:18,051
you could at least do something knowable
and Glorious and upright and powerful 

695
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:21,210
and honorable and admirable and helpful 
and difficult.

696
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,430
You know,
that's just so much better.

697
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,470
And maybe that's good enough so that you
think,

698
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:26,220
hey,
you know,

699
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,770
little suffering,
it's basically worth it.

700
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,260
At least it's a way forward.
You know,

701
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,270
at least it's a way forward.

702
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,600
And he said unto Abraham,
know of assurity that thy seed shall be 

703
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,811
a stranger in a land that is not theirs.
And she'll serve those people and 

704
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:46,080
they'll flick them for 400 years.
God,

705
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,940
he's hedging his bets here a lot,
right?

706
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:50,670
He says to Abraham,
will go out into the world,

707
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:55,671
and then he confronts him with a famine 
and he confronts him with a tyranny and 

708
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,611
with powerful people.
He wants to take his wife and then he 

709
00:36:58,611 --> 00:36:58,940
loses his nephew and he has a fight with
nanny,

710
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,780
has to go fight a war and now you know 
he's reconstituting this covenant.

711
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:04,500
God says,
yeah,

712
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:09,040
you're going to have a nation is going 
to come from you,

713
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:13,490
but they're going to be slaves to 
tyrants for like 400 years is like,

714
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,170
he's not a great salesman.
Exactly.

715
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:19,900
But,
but the thing about it is that the thing

716
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:21,970
that I like about it is that it's 
realistic.

717
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:23,770
You know,
and you gotta think too,

718
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,740
because who knows why it is that the 
Bible exists or why people wrote it,

719
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:32,500
but you know,
if they're gonna sell you something.

720
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,870
I don't know if this is the way to do 
it,

721
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,360
you know,
because unless you're a salesman who is 

722
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,230
sophisticated beyond belief because 
you'd think that if it was just a matter

723
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:43,060
of controlling the masses,
let's say,

724
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,790
which is one St Marxist interpretation 
of religion or,

725
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,380
or providing people with a primitive 
defense against death anxiety,

726
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:55,381
which is essentially the Freudian 
interpretation that you'd kind of make 

727
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:57,430
the deals that got cut with Abraham a 
little more on the positive and polished

728
00:37:57,431 --> 00:38:00,480
side.
Instead of making them a realistic offer

729
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,800
constantly like they are.
And that that's also that.

730
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:08,870
That part of the reason I think it is 
reasonable to treat the Bible as 

731
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:08,870
literature.
It's,

732
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,600
it's more than literature.
It's something other than literature,

733
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,840
but you can treat it as literature and I
think the reason that you can treat it 

734
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,600
as literature is because the characters 
are all complex,

735
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:20,890
including the character of God himself 
is complex and sophisticated.

736
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:25,890
It's not one sided and it's paradoxical 
and incomprehensible at times,

737
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,010
but I think good literature is like that
because you know true art.

738
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,680
Here's something about true art.
This is something I learned from young.

739
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,960
It's so smart.
He was so smart.

740
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:40,650
So imagine that you inhabit the land 
that you know conceptually and 

741
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:42,550
practically,
and then imagine outside of that,

742
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:45,580
there's that massive space of things 
that you don't know,

743
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,520
and even outside of that,
there's this space of things that no one

744
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:49,300
knows,
right?

745
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,060
So it's the known territory surrounded 
by the unknown.

746
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:57,061
That's the canonical architectural 
landscape and the unknown manifests 

747
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:58,810
itself to you and that's where new 
knowledge comes from.

748
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:01,210
But the question is how is that 
knowledge generated?

749
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:06,211
And it doesn't just leap from completely
unknown to completely articulated in one

750
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:08,560
move,
that isn't how it happens.

751
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:13,561
It has to pass through stages of 
analysis before it becomes articulable.

752
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:18,990
And the first stage of analysis,
as far as I can tell is that you act it 

753
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,180
out.
So if something really surprises you,

754
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,960
the first way that you react to it,
your category is actually embodied.

755
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:25,510
You'd like this,
that that's your first category.

756
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,180
It's not conceptual at all.
It's embodied.

757
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,750
And then maybe you start to like you're 
at home at night and something startled,

758
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,780
senior freeze and then it's dark and 
then your imagination populates the 

759
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,670
darkness with whatever might be making 
the noise.

760
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,340
And that's the sequence.
It's like embodied response,

761
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,430
imaginative representation,
exploration,

762
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:50,550
articulation.
That's how information moves from the 

763
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,581
unknown to the known.
And artists are the people who stand on 

764
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:56,200
that images stick frontier and they and 
they put themselves out into the unknown

765
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,380
and they and they,
they take a piece of it and they and 

766
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,351
they transform it into some mythological
image and they don't know what they're 

767
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:05,800
doing exactly because they're guided by 
their intuition.

768
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:08,260
If they're real artists,
otherwise they're just propagandists.

769
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,220
They have to be contending with 
something they don't understand and what

770
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:14,470
they do is they make it more 
understandable,

771
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,120
you know,
and,

772
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:20,610
and then people gays it,
those artworks or this or they listened 

773
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:20,890
to the stories and then they start to 
become informed by them,

774
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:25,870
but they don't know how or why.
I was at the Modern Art Museum Museum of

775
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:27,910
art and in New York,
I'm afraid.

776
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:29,920
I don't remember which one 
unfortunately,

777
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,530
but I was in this amazing room,
you know,

778
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:33,880
it had all these

779
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,630
priceless paintings from the,
from the late renaissance hanging in it,

780
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:45,100
you know,
each painting worth who knows a billion 

781
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,100
dollars.
Maybe they're priceless painting.

782
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,121
So the room was,
it's a shrine and it was full of people 

783
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:50,670
from all over the world who are looking 
at these paintings.

784
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:51,030
You think,
well,

785
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:56,031
what the hell are these people doing 
coming to this room looking at these 

786
00:40:56,031 --> 00:40:56,031
paintings,
what are,

787
00:40:56,031 --> 00:40:59,361
what are they up to?
One of them was a painting of the 

788
00:40:59,361 --> 00:40:59,361
assumption of Mary,
right?

789
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:03,710
Brilliantly composed.
And there was all these people looking 

790
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:03,710
at it and I thought,
what are they doing?

791
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,120
They don't know what that means.
Sick.

792
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,350
Why are they looking at that painting?
Why is it in this room?

793
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:10,440
Why does it cost a billion dollars?
Why is that painting worth so much?

794
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,880
And the answer to that is,
well,

795
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:14,720
we don't really know like it happened to
their,

796
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:19,721
their sacred objects in some sense.
And we gaze at the in ignorance and 

797
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:23,931
wonder.
And the reason for that is that the 

798
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:25,470
unknown shines through the madness and 
partially articulated form.

799
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:26,520
And so,

800
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,100
well

801
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,420
that's the role of art.
And that's the role of artists

802
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,770
in all

803
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:48,430
real artists.
Real artists are contending with 

804
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:48,430
unknown,
right?

805
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,460
And they're possessed by it.
They have a personality trait,

806
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:52,130
openness that makes them do that.
They can't even help it.

807
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,970
And I've had lots of creative people in 
my clinical practice.

808
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,020
I can tell you the worst thing for 
creative people is to not be creative 

809
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,240
because they just die.
And it,

810
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,240
because it's,
it's,

811
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,020
it's,
it's like maybe you're a tree with a few

812
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,880
major branches,
you know,

813
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,580
that's your personality.
So if you're extroverted,

814
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:12,320
man,
you can't be cut off from people because

815
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:17,350
you just wither and if you're agreeable,
you have to be an intimate relationship 

816
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:17,750
or you die,
you know,

817
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,510
and if you're conscientious man and 
you're unemployed,

818
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:25,810
you're just going to eat yourself up 
because you have to have a duty and you 

819
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,290
have to carry a load because just can't 
stand it otherwise and open.

820
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:32,290
People have to be creative.
They have to be because otherwise they 

821
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:32,510
die.
They don't have any vitality,

822
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,960
and so they're cursed with the necessity
of putting a foot out into the unknown 

823
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,851
and making sense of it,
and then they're also cursed with 

824
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:42,851
necessity of trying to make a living 
while they're doing that,

825
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:47,741
which they can't because you can't.
It's almost impossible to monetize 

826
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:50,981
creative creative action.
As many of you who are creative will no 

827
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:51,350
doubt find out.
It's very,

828
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:54,590
very frustrating.
It's not that creative action is without

829
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,310
value,
right?

830
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:58,160
Because the creative people are 
entrepreneurs and the creative people,

831
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:03,161
revitalized cities,
and the creative people make things 

832
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:05,951
magnificent and beautiful.
You think about what's happened in 

833
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:06,410
Europe over the last thousand years,
say 2000 years,

834
00:43:06,411 --> 00:43:11,411
this amazing,
unbelievable collaboration to make 

835
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:15,770
things so beautiful that they're their 
jaw dropping when you walk into them and

836
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,840
you think about the economic value of 
that,

837
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:18,080
right?

838
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,200
I mean,
I think it's.

839
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,400
It's either France or Spain that's the 
most visited country in the world.

840
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:27,401
It's one of those two.
I think there's more tourists in France 

841
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:29,591
than there are people most of the time 
and part of the reason for that is it's 

842
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:30,800
just so damn beautiful.
You just can't stand it and you think,

843
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,510
what's the economic value of that?
It's absolutely incalculable,

844
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:40,430
and what's interesting too is that you 
build out beauty in and then the farther

845
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:44,180
away you get from it in time,
the more valuable it becomes,

846
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:45,500
right?
Instead of decaying,

847
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:48,860
it has exactly the opposite effect.
It's value magnifies.

848
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:53,861
And one of the things that I'm deeply 
ashamed of as a Canadian is that our 

849
00:43:53,861 --> 00:43:57,440
sense of beauty is so underdeveloped 
were so primitive print.

850
00:43:57,441 --> 00:44:02,441
It's not even primitive.
That's the wrong word because I know 

851
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:03,920
what it is.
It's,

852
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,840
it's,
it's second rate,

853
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:06,650
it's second rate.

854
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,590
At least it's terror too because people 
are afraid of beauty,

855
00:44:09,591 --> 00:44:14,060
but the idea that art is the 
conservatives really have a problem with

856
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:19,061
this in particular because conservative 
people tend to want to be that creative 

857
00:44:19,061 --> 00:44:19,061
and Mr.
Mr.

858
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,700
by temperament.
It's a mystery to me because they should

859
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:26,840
be concerned with economic development 
and beauty is so unbelievably crucial to

860
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:29,030
economic development and just yells out 
at you.

861
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:31,250
You know,
so anyway,

862
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,320
so that's what artists are doing.
And so one of the things I would say is 

863
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:36,320
by a damn piece of art,
you know,

864
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,970
find one that really speaks to you and 
buy a piece of art because you invite 

865
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,230
that into your life and it's,
it's an lookout if you do it,

866
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,070
if it's a real piece of art because 
you'll also get a little introduction to

867
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:50,670
the artist and then that'll seep into 
your life and that'll change things like

868
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:52,170
mad,
but it's really,

869
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:57,171
it's unbelievably worth it because it 
opens your eyes to the domain of the 

870
00:44:57,171 --> 00:44:57,870
transcendent.

871
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:02,870
That's the right way of thinking about 
our real piece of art is a window into 

872
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,681
the transcendent and that's what it is,
and you need that in your life because 

873
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:10,050
your finite and limited and bounded 
right by your ignorance and your lack of

874
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:13,470
knowing and unless you can make a 
connection to the transcendent,

875
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:16,920
then you don't have the strength to 
prevail and that's part of the covenant.

876
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:22,250
That's part of the covenant with God and
you can see that because you look at 

877
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,530
these magnificent cathedrals that our 
civilization built over the centuries,

878
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:26,250
you know,
some of those,

879
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:31,610
they're still building the Sangre de 
Familia in Barcelona,

880
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:33,840
right?
And it's an amazing building.

881
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:36,960
I think it's going to take them like 300
years to build that.

882
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:38,490
You know,
people in the Middle Ages,

883
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:40,260
they'd start building a cathedral and 
they think,

884
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,420
oh,
it won't be done this in 300 years.

885
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,720
You know,
imagine the vision that it took to 

886
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:47,720
invest in something like that.

887
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,620
We look at quarterly reports,
we can think 300 years into the future 

888
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,970
to build something of that kind of 
remarkable,

889
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,410
remarkable what those cathedrals are.
So they're perfect.

890
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,000
They're trees first,
right there,

891
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:00,780
a forest,
right,

892
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:05,781
the gothic cathedrals there,
there are forest and the sun is shining 

893
00:46:05,781 --> 00:46:08,811
through the branches.
That's the stain glass and they're the 

894
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:11,631
perfect balance of light and structure 
because they're representing something 

895
00:46:11,631 --> 00:46:15,891
about the proper structure of being 
which is something like the proper 

896
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:19,521
balance between light and structure and 
they represent like the sacred tragedy 

897
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:25,281
of mankind.
That's why they're in the shape of a 

898
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,321
cross and they're open to the sky.
That's why they have a dome and they're 

899
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:30,030
full of gold so that it glitters because
that's like the city of God.

900
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:30,860
You know,
and and,

901
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:36,060
and you,
you can see that that integral to our 

902
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:42,090
culture is the idea that beauty is one 
pathway towards God and it's.

903
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,370
And it's saying if you can't find 
another pathway,

904
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:49,371
then why don't you use beauty?
I'm sure most of you do that with music 

905
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:50,910
because music is the one thing that 
modern people can't be cynical about.

906
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,240
Thank God for that and being fascinated 
by music.

907
00:46:54,241 --> 00:46:56,910
Because of that,
it speaks meaning to people,

908
00:46:56,911 --> 00:46:58,140
right?
Even nihilistic,

909
00:46:58,141 --> 00:47:03,141
punk rockers are so damn engaged with 
their music that they can hardly stand 

910
00:47:03,141 --> 00:47:04,350
it and you can knock on them and say,
look,

911
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,740
you know,
you're having a transcendent religious 

912
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:09,740
experience and they'll just tell you to 
fuck off.

913
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:14,520
Got Cause.

914
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,090
That's what punk rock yourself to do.
But,

915
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,900
but that's still what's happening,
you know what I mean?

916
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,820
It's still what's happening.
So.

917
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,650
Okay.
So,

918
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,560
okay,
so I,

919
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:36,561
I got into all that because I was 
talking about about the Bible as 

920
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:36,561
literature,
you know,

921
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:40,800
and,
and trying to enter into layout because 

922
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,540
we need in our culture to justify the 
art.

923
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:47,050
And you have to.
I don't want to do that by talking about

924
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:52,051
high culture,
talking about something abstract and 

925
00:47:52,051 --> 00:47:52,051
evanescent that's the wrong way to go 
about it.

926
00:47:52,051 --> 00:47:53,770
This is vital.
You know,

927
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:59,010
one of the things that's really 
interesting about the University of 

928
00:47:59,010 --> 00:47:59,990
Toronto is that the one side of the 
campus where we are,

929
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:03,220
is beautiful,
medieval cathedral.

930
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,540
Another side is God awful factory and 
you know,

931
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,580
and,
and that,

932
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:14,610
and the thing is the attitude towards 
knowledge has paralleled that 

933
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,180
architectural transformation.
You know,

934
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:20,200
at one point the humanities,
let's say we're a sacred endeavor and so

935
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:25,201
was the art of being educated in the 
university and that's turned into like 

936
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:27,250
mass factory and that's reflected in the
architecture.

937
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,470
This isn't accidental.
None of this happens.

938
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,370
None of this happens by random chance.
You know,

939
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,440
it's not like there's a conspiracy or 
anything because there isn't,

940
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:38,320
but that doesn't mean that these things 
aren't tangled together.

941
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:43,321
And the loss of beauty in the 
universities is a catastrophe because 

942
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:46,300
without that,
but there's no call to higher being,

943
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:46,780
you know,
you.

944
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:52,230
This is also why I've mentioned to 
people that they should clean up their 

945
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,740
rooms.
That's become quite the Internet meme,

946
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,410
but I'm really serious about it because 
it's really hard to do that.

947
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:58,150
And I've been cleaning up my room by the
way,

948
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:03,151
for about four months now because my 
life was thrown into such a catastrophe 

949
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:04,570
and,
and also we were renovating and so.

950
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:09,340
But it isn't just that you clean it up,
you also make it beautiful and beauty.

951
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:12,790
It's really hard to make something 
beautiful and it's really worthwhile.

952
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:15,070
And what's really cool is if you learn 
to make something beautiful,

953
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:18,040
even one thing,
if you could just make one thing in your

954
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:18,850
life,
beautiful,

955
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:24,030
then you've established your 
relationship with beauty and then you 

956
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,600
can start to expand that relationship 
with beauty out into,

957
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,330
into the world,
like into other elements of your life.

958
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:32,830
And that is so worthwhile.
It's just incredibly crazily worthwhile.

959
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,310
And that's an invitation to the divine.
You know what?

960
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:38,320
You have to be daring to do that.
And people are terrified of it.

961
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:41,110
People are terrified of color.
They paint their walls beige.

962
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:46,320
They're terrified of art.
They buy some mass produced thing 

963
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,620
because they don't want anybody laughing
at them for their lack of taste.

964
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,960
And they would get laughed at because 
they have no taste.

965
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,780
But you have to while it's right,
because what do you know,

966
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,400
right?
You have to develop it.

967
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,400
And so you're going to stumble along and
make mistakes to begin with and you're 

968
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,611
going to show yourself.
Because if you buy who I think this is 

969
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:02,611
pretty,
and you know,

970
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:02,611
somebody comes over and goes,
hey,

971
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:05,320
what's up with you?
It's kind of hard on yourself esteem,

972
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:10,321
but,
but it's the stuff you're stumbling 

973
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:12,481
towards the right,
you're stumbling towards the Kingdom of 

974
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,880
God.
That's what you're stumbling towards 

975
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,171
when you try to make an aesthetic 
decision and to put something in your 

976
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:22,051
life that's beautiful and it's 
unbelievably worthwhile to do that and 

977
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:26,110
you have to steer clear of the frauds 
and the con artists and all of that and 

978
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,520
art is full of that of course,
because it's to distinguish between the 

979
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:29,830
real thing and the fraud,
but.

980
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,500
But it's unbelievably worthwhile.
And so back to literature,

981
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,920
and I'm telling you this partly because 
I've been thinking a lot about the 

982
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,160
humanities and the arts and practically 
speaking,

983
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:48,160
because I know that artistic types are 
also entrepreneurial types of the same 

984
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,001
personality types and so it's very much 
worthwhile to make an economic and 

985
00:50:52,001 --> 00:50:52,820
practical case for this sort of thing.

986
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:58,870
He studied literature in the humanities 
so that you can familiarize yourself 

987
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,110
with the wisdom of our civilization.
Man,

988
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:05,111
you should do that because people have 
been working on this thing for a long 

989
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:06,920
time and it's rich beyond comparison.
So why wouldn't you do that?

990
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:11,150
And you teach yourself to read and you 
teach yourself to speak,

991
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,000
and you teach yourself to think and you 
teach yourself to communicate,

992
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:19,001
and I can tell you if you can read and 
think and communicate,

993
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:24,310
you are absolutely 100 percent 
unstoppable and that's another thing 

994
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:29,681
that's so interesting about humanities 
education that's at the core of the 

995
00:51:29,681 --> 00:51:32,501
university.
It's like there's nothing more 

996
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:34,301
economically valuable than teaching 
people how to articulate themselves and 

997
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:35,000
communicate because they can identify 
problems,

998
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:37,820
they can formulate solutions,
they can negotiate to consensus,

999
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:41,000
they can negotiate on their own behalf 
or on the behalf of others.

1000
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,300
It's like there's absolutely no downside
to it except that there's responsibility

1001
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:50,540
that goes along with it,
but it doesn't matter because there's no

1002
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,010
escape from responsibility.

1003
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:55,220
You can either take it voluntarily or 
you can take it in voluntarily.

1004
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:57,440
Those are your options,
but there aren't any other options.

1005
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,970
And so we need to understand the role of
art and literature and and stop thinking

1006
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:03,920
about it as an option.
It's not an option.

1007
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,260
It's not an option.
What is it said,

1008
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:09,440
man does not live by bread alone.
That's exactly right.

1009
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,840
We live by,
but we live by literature.

1010
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,960
We live by art and literally not 
metaphorically.

1011
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:20,140
We cannot live without it because life 
is too dismal and tragic in the absence 

1012
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:24,170
of the sublime,
so and ourselves.

1013
00:52:24,171 --> 00:52:29,171
We have to be sharp so that we can 
survive properly an orient the world 

1014
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:32,891
properly and not destroy things,
including ourselves and so and so back 

1015
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,440
to the Bible,
which I do think is a reasonable.

1016
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:40,670
It's reasonably construed as a piece of 
literature because it's deep and because

1017
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:45,671
the people who wrote it had at least one
foot in the unknowable and they're 

1018
00:52:45,671 --> 00:52:48,440
trying to communicate what they 
experienced in the unknowable to make it

1019
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:53,710
known,
and that's partly what we're trying to 

1020
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,721
do in this series and what you're trying
to do while you're listening and all of 

1021
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:59,561
that and so good for that,
and also that nation whom they shall 

1022
00:52:59,561 --> 00:52:59,660
serve.

1023
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,050
I will judge and afterward they will 
come out with great substance.

1024
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,980
There'll be a period of tyranny.
You know,

1025
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,400
and there's a psychological truth to 
that too.

1026
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,400
One of the things I learned from reading
Nietzsche,

1027
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,930
because you can learn a lot from reading
nature,

1028
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:13,550
that's for sure.
He.

1029
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,260
He talked about the Catholic Church.
You know,

1030
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:20,261
Ninja is often construed as a great 
critic of Christianity and and he 

1031
00:53:20,261 --> 00:53:22,250
certainly was,
but he was no casual critic.

1032
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,580
In fact,
I think he was the sort of critic that 

1033
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:27,580
you'd like to have as a friend because 
he was the sort of critic that said,

1034
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:32,870
well,
here's the great things you've done and 

1035
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,520
that you could keep doing.
Here's a bunch of really neat things 

1036
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:35,520
that you did that you really should stop
doing.

1037
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,310
And he talked about the Catholic Church 
and he said,

1038
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,640
what the Catholic Church had done to the
European mind in particular was 

1039
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:44,550
discipline it.

1040
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,000
So that over a period of a thousand 
years,

1041
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:49,710
$1,300,
1400 years,

1042
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:54,950
there was this rule that there was a 
conceptual structure within which you 

1043
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:59,121
had to interpret everything and what 
that did was turn the European educated 

1044
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:01,550
you European mind into a systematized 
thing,

1045
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,650
cognitive entity,
and that once that systematizing 

1046
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,681
cognitive entity at been established,
then it could free itself from those 

1047
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:13,611
underlying disciplinary structures and 
go off and do such things as produced 

1048
00:54:13,611 --> 00:54:15,300
the scientific revolution,
for example,

1049
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,610
which required a credible systematic 
thinking.

1050
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,880
And so Nisha had this really interesting
idea about freedom and he believed that 

1051
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,680
slavery was an intermediary between the 
undeveloped the individual and the free 

1052
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,091
individual that you had to.
You had to submit yourself to some 

1053
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:35,661
intense disciplinary process for some 
period of time in your life before you 

1054
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:38,640
could develop any true freedom.
And so you think maybe you want to learn

1055
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:39,360
to play the piano.

1056
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,360
It's like,
that's not going to be any fun for a 

1057
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:44,360
really long period of time,
right?

1058
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,511
Because you're really bad at it and 
there's a million things you have to 

1059
00:54:47,511 --> 00:54:47,580
memorize and you have to stumble around.
Like,

1060
00:54:47,581 --> 00:54:48,600
uh,
well,

1061
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:53,730
like an amateur,
and the same thing happens when kids 

1062
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,211
learn how to read and some of them never
get past that point and they never get 

1063
00:54:56,211 --> 00:54:56,211
to the point where they can enjoy 
reading,

1064
00:54:56,211 --> 00:55:00,501
but in order to put yourself together,
you have to put yourself in a vice and 

1065
00:55:00,501 --> 00:55:04,461
allow yourself to be constricted and 
mangled and by the thing that enslaves 

1066
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:09,081
you,
but the goal should be that as a 

1067
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:11,931
consequence of submitting to the 
discipline that you become disciplined 

1068
00:55:11,931 --> 00:55:15,680
and then once you become disciplined,
you can emerge from the disciplinary 

1069
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,501
structure as someone who's free.
And that's something that's very much 

1070
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:18,510
we're thinking about as well.

1071
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:23,130
So that's illustrated conceptually in 
this,

1072
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,210
in this piece of literature,
let's say,

1073
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:32,211
because what,
what the psychological meaning of what 

1074
00:55:32,211 --> 00:55:35,931
God tells Abraham is that all people,
all people are subject.

1075
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,420
I mean not equally.
Obviously all people are subject to the 

1076
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:45,051
tyranny that proceeds freedom and that 
that ideas is repeated over and over in 

1077
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:50,301
the Old Testament.
It comes out most particularly in the 

1078
00:55:50,301 --> 00:55:50,301
story of Moses,
right?

1079
00:55:50,301 --> 00:55:53,361
Because of course,
that's the story of movement from 

1080
00:55:53,361 --> 00:55:53,361
tyranny.
Where do you go from a tyranny?

1081
00:55:53,361 --> 00:55:56,190
It's an absolute catastrophe.
You go from maturity into the desert.

1082
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,610
You know where you starve.
That's harsh.

1083
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:01,770
That's what happens in the story of 
exodus,

1084
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:07,040
and so that's so interesting too,
because what it means is that sometimes 

1085
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,390
if you're going to move up hill,
the first thing that happens is you move

1086
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:14,391
downhill a lot,
and so if you want to escape from the 

1087
00:56:14,391 --> 00:56:16,320
straits that bind you,
now you're not going to move forward and

1088
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:16,710
go up.

1089
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,800
You're gonna move forward and go down.
And that's another reason.

1090
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:24,890
This is also something that you haven't 
talked about a lot is that you know on 

1091
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,891
the road to enlightenment,
you encounter all the things that you 

1092
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:28,630
don't want to encounter first.
Like all the weaknesses of yourself,

1093
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:34,110
all the realizations of the tyranny of 
the world and the catastrophe of nature 

1094
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,861
and all of that.
And so you step out of your 

1095
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,320
encapsulation,
you're ignorant encapsulation and it's 

1096
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:40,810
immediate,
plummet into something that's a desert.

1097
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:45,811
Let's say,
where everything is chaotic and where 

1098
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:45,811
you're wandering around without 
direction.

1099
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:46,930
A real catastrophe.
So it's,

1100
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:52,150
you know,
because one of the things you might ask 

1101
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,031
yourself is that if enlightenment is 
possible and why aren't people 

1102
00:56:54,031 --> 00:56:55,480
enlightened?
Because if it was just a matter of going

1103
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:57,550
from a good place to a better place,
it's like,

1104
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:59,080
well man,
let's just get at it.

1105
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,280
It's no,
it's no problem.

1106
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:02,560
Right?
Why would we ever stop doing that?

1107
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:06,880
But it seems not to be that it's that 
you're here and that's not good and it's

1108
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:09,340
unstable and you step out of it and it's
like down,

1109
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,240
down to where you don't want to be,
and you have to contend with that and 

1110
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:15,400
then maybe you can start your struggle 
upward.

1111
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:20,820
And so Abraham,
God is telling Abraham this and he's 

1112
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,151
also telling him that it's okay.
It's rough though and now now shall go 

1113
00:57:24,151 --> 00:57:28,891
to their fathers in peace,
though shall be burned in the good old 

1114
00:57:28,891 --> 00:57:28,930
age.
But in the fourth generation,

1115
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:31,020
they shall come hither again.
That's the Israelites,

1116
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:36,150
the descendants of Abraham for the 
iniquity of the Amorites is not yet 

1117
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:40,081
full.
God is going to leave the tyrants alone 

1118
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:40,630
until they've manifested their full 
tyranny.

1119
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,690
For reasons that we don't fully 
understand and it came to pass that when

1120
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,570
the sun went down,
it was dark.

1121
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:54,200
Behold a smoking furnace and a burning 
lamp that passed between the pieces.

1122
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,920
All Albert Barnes set the oven of smoke 
and lamp aflame symbolize the smoke of 

1123
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,010
destruction,
which we've already talked about.

1124
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:06,011
This catastrophe of,
of the initial stages and the light of 

1125
00:58:06,011 --> 00:58:09,791
salvation.
They're passing through the pieces of 

1126
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,131
the victims and probably consuming them 
as an accepted sacrifice are the 

1127
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:14,690
ratification of the Covenant on the part
of God as the dividing and presenting of

1128
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:15,810
them were on the part of April.

1129
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:22,370
In the same day,
the Lord made a covenant with Abraham 

1130
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,950
Saying Unto Thy seed,
I've given this land from the river of 

1131
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:25,110
Egypt unto the Great River Euphrates.

1132
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,800
Now Sarai,
Abram's wife Barum,

1133
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,900
no children,
and she had a handmade and the Egyptian,

1134
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:37,620
whose name was Hagar.
So this is a big catastrophe for 

1135
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:37,660
Abraham,
especially in those times,

1136
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:42,661
and perhaps now as much.
Although perhaps people aren't as 

1137
00:58:42,661 --> 00:58:44,740
conscious of it as they once were.
For Abraham,

1138
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:49,210
without a biological son,
there was no.

1139
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:54,570
There was no.
There was no vision forward into the 

1140
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:54,570
future,
you know,

1141
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:58,581
and I mean we don't really know what 
sort of time span over which these 

1142
00:58:58,581 --> 00:59:00,160
archaic people thought,
but the medieval people,

1143
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,830
we already said good thing 300 years 
into the future without,

1144
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,130
without batting an eye,
and these people who were,

1145
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:11,190
who were concerned about their 
descendants were obviously thinking 

1146
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,621
about existence in a way that wasn't 
just focused on their immediate 

1147
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:13,621
existence.
Right?

1148
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:15,430
They were thinking about while their 
children and their grandchildren,

1149
00:59:15,431 --> 00:59:20,431
maybe their great grandchildren,
maybe the whole society that that 

1150
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:21,470
stemmed out from them and that's,
that's smart know.

1151
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:24,140
One of the things I learned from piaget 
at least in part,

1152
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:27,320
was that his idea of the equilla braided
state,

1153
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:32,321
which he thought about as partly part of
the biological basis of the idea of 

1154
00:59:32,321 --> 00:59:33,740
moral progress.
It's something like that.

1155
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:38,741
He was very,
very smart pig and we said that the 

1156
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,700
proper equilibrated state is one where 
imagine you have a family,

1157
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:43,240
you've got five people in it and you're 
doing what you want in your,

1158
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,630
in your family,
what's good for you,

1159
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:49,810
but you're doing it in such a way so 
that the other four members of your 

1160
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:52,220
family agree with what you do and that 
it also facilitates them doing what they

1161
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:57,221
want and what they should be doing,
and so it's a really tricky arrangement 

1162
00:59:57,221 --> 01:00:00,701
because it isn't just for you.
It's for you in a way that's for them 

1163
01:00:00,701 --> 01:00:02,630
and you can also see that that would be 
something that would be a multiplier,

1164
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:02,960
right?

1165
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,200
Because if you have everyone working 
voluntarily towards the same common 

1166
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:13,451
goal,
then you get a multiplying effect of 

1167
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:13,451
that and then you might think,
well,

1168
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:17,471
it's not just you and your family.
It's you and your family today and next 

1169
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,190
week,
next month,

1170
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,200
next year and 10 years from now.
So you have to take the time span into 

1171
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,461
account and then it should be you and 
your family in a way that works well in 

1172
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:30,731
society.
And then it should work well now and 

1173
01:00:30,731 --> 01:00:30,731
next week and next year,
and into the future.

1174
01:00:30,731 --> 01:00:31,100
It should be iterative,
agile,

1175
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,020
right?
That's like sustainability.

1176
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:36,040
It's something like the idea of 
sustainability and that's,

1177
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,250
that's I would say that's a reasonable 
way of conceptualizing the holy city.

1178
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,350
It's something like that.
If you're.

1179
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:44,270
If you're trying to make it concrete,
it's like,

1180
01:00:44,271 --> 01:00:45,830
how should you live your life?
Well,

1181
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:50,831
let's say you live your life in a manner
that justifies its limitation and 

1182
01:00:50,831 --> 01:00:50,831
tragedy.

1183
01:00:50,831 --> 01:00:55,060
That's a good start.
But then let's say that it does that in 

1184
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,881
a way that also reduces the limitations 
and suffering of the people that you 

1185
01:00:57,881 --> 01:00:59,150
interact with and now and into the 
future.

1186
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:03,830
Well maybe there's a way to do that.
I mean a good negotiation does that,

1187
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:08,831
right?
Because if you're negotiating with 

1188
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,181
someone like your wife for example,
what you want is for her to agree with 

1189
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:12,260
the negotiation.
And one of the things that Piaget said,

1190
01:01:12,261 --> 01:01:14,180
which I think was brilliant,
brilliant.

1191
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,450
He said,
if you take an equilibrated system,

1192
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,010
a family,
let's say,

1193
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,770
and a discipline celebrated system.
So that would be one way.

1194
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:26,390
Or let's say the father is a tyrant and 
everyone is operating under his whip and

1195
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,100
you put them in a head to head 
competition.

1196
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
The equilibrated system will outcompete 
the disequilibrium system because the 

1197
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,320
enforcement cost is such that it will 
slow the system down,

1198
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:41,670
you know,
because you'll get resistances from the 

1199
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:41,670
people inside the system.

1200
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,460
They'll work at the system will be 
working at counter purposes to itself.

1201
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:48,380
Plus there's enforcement costs and so a 
tyranny can be to neil calibrated system

1202
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:53,710
and I was really excited to encounter 
that idea because when I encountered it 

1203
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:58,010
I was also trying to figure out if there
was some quantitative difference between

1204
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:03,520
the system say of the Soviet Union in 
Mao's China and the systems of the west 

1205
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,691
apart from just arbitrary world 
interpretation as the postmodern 

1206
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:12,211
nihilists might have it.
If there is something fundamental at 

1207
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:15,041
stake in the terrible cold war that we 
fought or if it was just a matter of 

1208
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:15,080
opinion,
you know,

1209
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:20,081
when the pig Eddie and take was that.
Well roughly speaking is that the West 

1210
01:02:20,081 --> 01:02:22,490
was Nicola braided system.
Not perfectly equilibrated,

1211
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,620
but reasonably celebrated in that people
were essentially.

1212
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:30,621
Even if they were slaves to some degree,
they were at least voluntary slaves 

1213
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,040
instead of involuntary slaves and that 
that was better.

1214
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:37,280
The system was actually technically 
better and not just as a matter of 

1215
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,511
interpretation.
So that's a lovely thing to know and I 

1216
01:02:41,511 --> 01:02:41,511
think it's a really,
really solid,

1217
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,990
really,
really solid idea.

1218
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:44,330
I haven't been able to,
you know,

1219
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,830
put crowbars under that idea and lifted 
up.

1220
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:51,831
I think it's a good one.
So now Sarah Abraham's wife,

1221
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:52,920
barum new children's.
So.

1222
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:55,240
Okay,
back to children must one of what?

1223
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:00,650
One of the things that's we're thinking 
about with regards to reading these old 

1224
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:00,650
stories because we're so new.
We're very arrogant,

1225
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:01,270
modern people,
a,

1226
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,330
we look at these old stories and we 
think,

1227
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:05,760
ah,
we've transcended all that superstition.

1228
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:07,500
It's like,
don't be so bloody sure about that.

1229
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:11,100
These people weren't stupid.
And so there's,

1230
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:16,180
there,
there are ways that they viewed the 

1231
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,021
world that we don't have any more and 
one of them seems to be this concern for

1232
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:22,020
descendants because that just isn't part
of our way of thinking.

1233
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:26,190
We have very short term way of thinking.
Maybe it's not even one lifetime long,

1234
01:03:26,191 --> 01:03:30,210
it's certainly not multiple lifetimes 
long and it isn't clear to me at all for

1235
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:35,211
the best and you know the,
the constant complaint that the 

1236
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:38,571
environmentalists generate,
some of which is justified in some of 

1237
01:03:38,571 --> 01:03:40,740
which is just anticapitalist,
anti patriarchal nonsense that should be

1238
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:45,741
cleared out of that entire conversation 
is that we need to take a longer view 

1239
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,500
and consider more things in our purview.
We're not when we act and like that.

1240
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:51,660
Fair enough.
Like do we really want an ocean that has

1241
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:55,200
nothing in it but jellyfish because 
that's really what we're doing and we're

1242
01:03:55,201 --> 01:04:00,201
doing it very,
very rapidly and the data on that are 

1243
01:04:00,201 --> 01:04:02,391
very clear and so you know,
when you lift up your eyes and you make 

1244
01:04:02,391 --> 01:04:03,630
a connection with something that's 
transcendent,

1245
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,540
then that should bring more of the world
within your purview.

1246
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:11,540
And maybe that's concerned for the 
endless number of descendants that you 

1247
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:11,790
might have,
might think to,

1248
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:12,300
well,
you know,

1249
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:15,870
if you're a successful person,
if you have a successful family,

1250
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,500
God only knows how many people you will 
be the father of.

1251
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,290
Right?
It's completely because you're a nexus,

1252
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:27,291
right?
All sorts of things have come together 

1253
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:30,020
in the cosmos to produce you and then 
all sorts of things manifest themselves 

1254
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,740
from you.
You have no idea what your potential,

1255
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:36,890
the potential consequences of your 
actions might be as they cascade across 

1256
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:37,890
time,
right?

1257
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,920
You have no idea,
and so Abraham at least is concerned 

1258
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,951
with these sorts of things and God seems
to be concerned too because he promises 

1259
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:49,611
Abraham that if he maintains the 
covenant that the most important things 

1260
01:04:49,611 --> 01:04:53,460
that he needs will come to him and 
they're pretty serious about this.

1261
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:57,660
So Sariah talks to Abraham.
She's not very happy about the fact that

1262
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,970
she can't have children.
She says,

1263
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:04,971
behold,
the Lord hath restrained me from 

1264
01:05:04,971 --> 01:05:05,190
bearing.
I pray thee go in unto my made.

1265
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:10,730
It may be that I obtained children by 
her and Abraham hearken to the voice of 

1266
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:10,860
Siri.
Well,

1267
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:12,870
that's not a very trivial thing.
I wouldn't think.

1268
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:15,050
I don't imagine that that Sarah was 
through.

1269
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,340
I was very happy about turning her made 
over to her husband

1270
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:23,340
and potentially being usurped in the 
whole child bearing and the whole 

1271
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,420
childbearing process.
Not In the least,

1272
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,900
but it's also a major sacrifice on 
Sarah's part.

1273
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:31,390
There's no doubt about that on of 
course,

1274
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:36,391
it's very difficult for us to talk about
the ethics of the fact that Hagar was a 

1275
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,180
more or less than voluntary participant 
in this,

1276
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:39,940
but that was the times absolutely the 
case,

1277
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:45,330
and of course,
slavery in indentured servitude is the 

1278
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:45,460
way of mankind except in very,
very,

1279
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,560
very,
very limited circumstances.

1280
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,780
Carl young had something to say about 
that too,

1281
01:05:49,781 --> 01:05:54,781
which I really liked.
He said that part of the reason that 

1282
01:05:54,781 --> 01:05:55,780
modern people have.
It's not the only reason.

1283
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:58,060
There's the industrial revolution 
obviously,

1284
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:02,350
but part of the reason that modern 
people have been able to escape from the

1285
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:07,590
catastrophe of tyranny and slavery is 
because we've agreed to make ourselves 

1286
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:07,590
our own slaves.

1287
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:09,880
Right?
So instead of owning a slave,

1288
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:14,881
you own yourself in a sense,
and so you try it yourself off to work 

1289
01:06:14,881 --> 01:06:18,811
and exploit yourself so that you can 
stay alive and maybe it's not something 

1290
01:06:18,811 --> 01:06:20,260
that you want to do,
but you've taken on the role of slave in

1291
01:06:20,261 --> 01:06:22,420
some sense,
in relationship to your own survival.

1292
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:24,100
Instead of forcing someone else to do 
it,

1293
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:27,130
which is also something I think that's 
very noble about the West,

1294
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:31,090
is that we're willing to enslave 
ourselves as individuals and we're not,

1295
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,060
we're not doing that to other people.
Now we're doing it to some degree,

1296
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:35,950
obviously because the society is 
imperfect,

1297
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:38,020
but that's something that's very much 
worth thinking about.

1298
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:43,690
So an Abraham hearkened to the voice of 
Surrey and Surrey.

1299
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,960
Abram's wife took Hagar,
her maid the Egyptian after Abraham had 

1300
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,071
dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and
gave her to her husband Abraham to be 

1301
01:06:53,071 --> 01:06:53,071
his wife.

1302
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:57,370
That's the other thing that's been so 
interesting about doing this.

1303
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,650
One of the other things about doing this
biblical series,

1304
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:01,900
and it's one of the things that's so 
cool about Google,

1305
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:07,440
um,
despite the fact that they cut off my 

1306
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:07,930
account,
um,

1307
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:11,950
you can find any piece of art that ever 
existed on Google.

1308
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,660
And so that's great.
So,

1309
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:15,460
you know,
when I'm trying to illustrate these,

1310
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:20,940
these lectures,
I type in Abraham Renaissance and then 

1311
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,140
like I get 200 renaissance paintings.
It's so great.

1312
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:28,141
And then I can look at them.
And one of the other things that's so 

1313
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:30,571
remarkable is that all of these,
the major themes of the stories have 

1314
01:07:30,571 --> 01:07:32,860
been illustrated by people of 
spectacular,

1315
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:36,550
my mind,
mind expanding talent.

1316
01:07:36,551 --> 01:07:40,420
You know,
there's just this endless array of,

1317
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,560
well,
look at that.

1318
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,780
I mean,
that's an amazing painting.

1319
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,490
And so,
and there's an of this,

1320
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:47,910
uh,
there's,

1321
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,920
there's dozens of paintings on this 
theme and it's just another indication 

1322
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,780
of how obsessed people,
you know,

1323
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:58,800
this was the only book that existed for 
years and people were absolutely 

1324
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,330
obsessed by it and produced all these 
amazing things from it.

1325
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:06,930
And we're in danger of losing that.
And that's a big mistake because it's 

1326
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:10,411
magnificent.
A little humility would go a long way 

1327
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:13,471
towards restoring it.
And he went into unto Hagar and she 

1328
01:08:13,691 --> 01:08:16,880
conceived.
And when she saw that she had conceived,

1329
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:21,881
her mistress was despised in her eyes.
So Hagar was successful and that was a 

1330
01:08:24,381 --> 01:08:27,260
hallmark of feminine success.
Now.

1331
01:08:27,261 --> 01:08:32,261
And certainly then.
And so she started to Lord it over 

1332
01:08:32,261 --> 01:08:36,340
Sariah,
which seemed a little bit on the 

1333
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:36,340
ungrateful side,
I would say,

1334
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:40,451
because I made a big sacrifice to allow 
Hagar to become Abram's wife.

1335
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:43,040
And so a little bit of gratitude would 
have been an order,

1336
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,740
I suppose,
at least that's how the story goes.

1337
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,570
And Sarah,
I said unto Abraham,

1338
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,280
my wrong,
be upon thee.

1339
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:54,710
I have given my maiden to Buddhism.
And when she saw that she had conceived,

1340
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,480
I was despised in her eyes.

1341
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:02,070
The Lord judge between you and I,
and Abraham said unto him,

1342
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:02,810
[inaudible],
behold,

1343
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:05,510
thy maid is in dine.
Hand due to her as it pleases you.

1344
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:09,950
And when Sarah dealt hardly with her,
Hagar fled from her face.

1345
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,800
And the angel of the Lord Found Her by a
Fountain of Water in the Wilderness,

1346
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:14,780
by the fountain in the way to assure.
And he said,

1347
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:16,370
Hagar,
Sarah's maid,

1348
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:19,070
whence chemists and whether wilt thou 
go.

1349
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,890
And she said,
I flee from the face of my mistress.

1350
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:26,540
And the angel of the Lord said,
returned to my mistress and submit under

1351
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:28,340
her hands.
And the angel said,

1352
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,640
I will multiply your seed exceedingly,
that it shall not be numbered for 

1353
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,010
multitude.
And the angel said,

1354
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:38,570
behold thou art with child and shall 
thou shall bear a son and shall call his

1355
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:39,320
name,
Ishmael.

1356
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,800
And Ishmael means God hears by the way,
because the Lord hath heard thy 

1357
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,761
affliction and he'll be a wild man.
His hand will be against every man and 

1358
01:09:48,761 --> 01:09:52,270
every man's hand against him and he 
shall dwell in the presence of all his 

1359
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:52,270
brothers.

1360
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:58,540
And she called the name of the Lord that
spake unto her thou God CSB for she 

1361
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,470
said,
have I also hear looked after him,

1362
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:04,400
that me were for the wall,
well was called Beer la Roy.

1363
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,550
And that means the well of sees me in 
lives.

1364
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:11,780
It's an interesting interlude because 
you know Abraham,

1365
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:17,050
God has established his covenant with 
Abraham and obviously things are going 

1366
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:17,930
wrong in the household in a really 
serious way,

1367
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:23,230
like a really serious way because well,
he's now had a child by another woman 

1368
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:27,881
and that the two women are not getting 
along and one is beating the other 

1369
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:30,020
because of her insubordination and,
and contempt.

1370
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:33,740
And so she's so desperate,
she runs out into the desert where she's

1371
01:10:33,741 --> 01:10:38,741
probably going to die and God comes 
along and says anyways to to to to Hagar

1372
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:45,590
that her son Shell as well be the father
of nations.

1373
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:49,040
And so that's partly a reflection back 
on the power of Abraham's covenant,

1374
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,840
right?
Even though even though things are going

1375
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:54,650
terribly wrong locally,
let's say the fact that Abraham has made

1376
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:58,760
this overarching agreement with God 
means that all of these catastrophes are

1377
01:10:58,761 --> 01:11:01,970
taking place within a bounded space 
within the arc.

1378
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:03,890
We could say that's one way of looking 
at it.

1379
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:09,100
And I do think I do think that that's 
right because it seems to me that you 

1380
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,780
know,
if everything falls apart around you,

1381
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:14,040
there's this a couple of things you're

1382
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:19,040
going to want.
You're going to want someone standing 

1383
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,040
beside you that's for sure,
that you can trust.

1384
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,481
You're going to want your family around 
you and you want to want them to have 

1385
01:11:23,481 --> 01:11:27,201
your back and you're going to want to 
know that you didn't do some God damn 

1386
01:11:27,201 --> 01:11:28,800
stupid thing to bring all held down on 
yourself.

1387
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,190
And if you're lacking any of those,
when that crisis comes,

1388
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,950
there's a high probability it will 
flatten you and you won't be able to get

1389
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:35,550
up.
You know,

1390
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:40,850
it does seem to me,
you can ask yourself this question when 

1391
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:45,320
things collapse around you,
how much utility is knowledge of your 

1392
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,280
own moral virtue?
It's bad enough to be late.

1393
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:52,281
It's bad to be laid load,
but to be laid low and to know that you 

1394
01:11:52,281 --> 01:11:56,031
were the fault you were at fault for it,
and worse the things that you did that 

1395
01:11:56,031 --> 01:11:58,440
you knew you did that were wrong,
brought you there.

1396
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,500
Then I think you have nothing to stand 
on in that situation.

1397
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:05,910
And that's also the circumstances under 
which I think you're more more likely at

1398
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:08,040
least to be abandoned by people around 
you.

1399
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,240
So given that you know that the 
catastrophe is coming right,

1400
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,100
that the tragedy of life will strike 
you.

1401
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:14,940
The question is,
well,

1402
01:12:14,941 --> 01:12:16,590
how do you afford to fire yourself 
against that?

1403
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,820
And I'll obviously,
it's to some degree you do that by being

1404
01:12:20,821 --> 01:12:24,090
materially sensible and these old people
in the test,

1405
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,650
in the Old Testament,
these ancient people,

1406
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:30,651
they weren't blind to the utility of 
having a good crop and some animals you 

1407
01:12:30,651 --> 01:12:35,481
know that that's an that's an integral 
part of their life to take care of 

1408
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:38,901
themselves physically,
but they're also wise enough to know 

1409
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:42,120
that there is an element of moral this,
what would you call it?

1410
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:47,160
There's a necessity for moral 
integration that defends you against the

1411
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:52,161
catastrophe of existence even more 
effectively than anything material and 

1412
01:12:52,161 --> 01:12:56,850
even more that the stability of the 
material things is more dependent on the

1413
01:12:56,851 --> 01:13:00,540
integrity of your spirit than the 
integrity of your spirit is dependent on

1414
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:01,470
the material things.

1415
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:04,200
And I think the evidence for that is 
actually quite clear.

1416
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:09,440
I read it wrote,
read a very interesting book a while 

1417
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,721
back called the wealth and poverty of 
nations that was written by a Harvard 

1418
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,980
emeritus professor of history and one of
the things that he claimed I liked it.

1419
01:13:13,981 --> 01:13:18,981
I thought it was very smart.
Was that the only true natural 

1420
01:13:18,981 --> 01:13:19,530
resources,
interpersonal trust.

1421
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,560
If you can set up a society where people
trust each other,

1422
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:26,190
then it will instantly become rich and 
he used the example of Japan,

1423
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,760
which is a very conscientious society 
and very rich society,

1424
01:13:29,761 --> 01:13:31,980
but the Japanese have no natural 
resources,

1425
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:33,840
right?
None to speak of,

1426
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:39,200
and yet they're rich and then you have 
countries like the Soviet Russia and 

1427
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,120
much of South America where there's just
natural resources that you know,

1428
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:46,200
they're just like Venezuela.
It's just more natural resources than 

1429
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:50,121
you know,
what to do with and the places are 

1430
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:50,121
absolute catastrophes.

1431
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:52,170
Absolute catastrophes of cynicism and 
corruption.

1432
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:57,590
And so he attempted to document the 
relationship between default 

1433
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:02,421
interpersonal trust among citizens 
within countries and their productivity 

1434
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:08,171
in their,
their GDP and their standard of living 

1435
01:14:08,171 --> 01:14:08,171
and found a very,
very tight relationship.

1436
01:14:08,171 --> 01:14:11,710
And I liked that a lot and I've got a 
story about that quickly that I think is

1437
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:14,200
very interesting.
I'll tell you two stories.

1438
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:19,150
One sort of generic.
I'll tell you one personal first.

1439
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:24,151
So one day I lend my car to one of my 
graduate students and he took it to 

1440
01:14:24,151 --> 01:14:27,400
Montreal,
was this old Cadillac and he got.

1441
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:32,430
It was a really bad rainstorm in 
Montreal and he was in one of the 

1442
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:35,580
highways that are like set into the 
ground and there was like six inches of 

1443
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:39,031
water and he was turning a corner,
hit the brakes and skidded on the water 

1444
01:14:39,031 --> 01:14:40,510
and smacked it into the wall and on the 
corner of the,

1445
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:41,800
of the bumper,
you know,

1446
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,710
and so then he brought it back and he 
was very apologetic about it.

1447
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:45,820
And,
and uh,

1448
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:51,090
his name was matt shade will tell you 
that because Matt might hear this and I 

1449
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:52,420
can shame them and they get for doing 
this 20 years ago,

1450
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,620
you know,
and uh,

1451
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:57,850
he's a professor at the Ontario 
Institute of Technology,

1452
01:14:57,851 --> 01:15:00,490
I think now quite a successful one.
But anyways,

1453
01:15:00,491 --> 01:15:05,050
he brought the car back and I went and 
got it evaluated for damages.

1454
01:15:05,051 --> 01:15:07,930
It was like $1,700
or something to repair it and,

1455
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,290
or maybe more,
but it was almost as much as the car was

1456
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:12,490
worth.
And I thought,

1457
01:15:12,491 --> 01:15:14,380
well,
I'm not going to do that.

1458
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,440
So I went online and I typed in the part
and if you do that you can get people to

1459
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:23,740
bid on sending you used part from all 
over North America.

1460
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:28,741
So that's Kinda cool.
So there's all these junk dealers have 

1461
01:15:28,741 --> 01:15:28,970
got together and they have this network 
of communication.

1462
01:15:28,971 --> 01:15:31,140
So you put in the car part and then they
send you a bit.

1463
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:33,100
And so this guy said,
well,

1464
01:15:33,101 --> 01:15:36,190
I'll send you that bumper assembly,
which is the whole bumper and the lights

1465
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:39,060
for like 250 bucks.
And I thought,

1466
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:39,590
yeah,
okay,

1467
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:40,990
if you could do that,
that'd be good.

1468
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:46,320
So then I said yes.
And then he called me up about half an 

1469
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,830
hour later if this guy from way down 
south,

1470
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:49,720
he had a really deep sort of Mississippi
accent.

1471
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:51,490
He said,
wait a sec,

1472
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,950
was that for the bumper,
the bumper assembly?

1473
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,530
And I said,
well it was for the bumper assembly.

1474
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,190
He said,
oh,

1475
01:15:57,191 --> 01:15:58,690
I thought it was for the bumper and then
he said,

1476
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:00,610
but that's okay.
I'll send it to you anyways.

1477
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,740
And I thought,
well that's pretty good.

1478
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,000
So I said,
well thank you.

1479
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:07,690
And then I hung up and then half an hour
later he called me up again and he said,

1480
01:16:07,691 --> 01:16:12,691
look,
I just went out and looked at that 

1481
01:16:12,691 --> 01:16:14,041
bumper assembly and there's a plastic 
trim piece on this side and it has a 

1482
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:14,041
scratch in it.

1483
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:18,510
And I thought,
I better tell you that just in case you 

1484
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:18,510
didn't want it.
And I thought,

1485
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:18,880
wow,
that's so amazing.

1486
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:21,820
It's like there's a miracle man.
It's like this guy,

1487
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,790
he's somewhere in Mississippi.
I'm never gonna see him again.

1488
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:29,820
Ever.
Never going to have any contact with 

1489
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:29,820
them.
Like he made a bad deal,

1490
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:34,171
right?
Because the part was worth more than he 

1491
01:16:34,171 --> 01:16:34,171
decided to sell it to me for.
But he stuck with this deal.

1492
01:16:34,171 --> 01:16:35,830
And then he went over and above the call
of duty,

1493
01:16:35,831 --> 01:16:36,340
he said,
well,

1494
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:41,080
this part that I'm selling you to you 
for way less than it's worth is damaged.

1495
01:16:41,081 --> 01:16:42,610
So I thought I'd better tell you.
It's like,

1496
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:48,180
man,
you got to recognize a miracle when you 

1497
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:48,180
see one that was a miracle.
So I said,

1498
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,650
hey look,
thanks for calling man.

1499
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:55,830
So okay,
I can handle the scratch then the part 

1500
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,830
needed.

1501
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:58,660
And,
and I got the car fixed and forgave 

1502
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:58,660
Matt,
and you know,

1503
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,860
it had a happy ending.
So that's trust,

1504
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:05,520
right?
Because I didn't know him from Adam and 

1505
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,970
he's a primate full of snakes,
just like the rest of us.

1506
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:12,180
And yet he was willing to simplify 
himself to the point where I could just 

1507
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:15,221
take him absolutely at his word.
And that meant we could trade even 

1508
01:17:15,221 --> 01:17:15,221
though we were strangers.
It's like,

1509
01:17:15,221 --> 01:17:20,110
man,
do not underestimate the utility of 

1510
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:20,110
that.
And then there's Ebay.

1511
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:20,600
So when Ebay first started,
you know,

1512
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:26,020
the idea was not gonna work because 
you'll send me junk and I'll send you a 

1513
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,250
check that bounces and that'll be the 
end of Ebay.

1514
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:32,260
Right?
And so these escrow agents popped up so 

1515
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:35,561
you could insure your transaction with 
them moves for like 10 percent of the 

1516
01:17:35,561 --> 01:17:38,981
transaction.
They would get the check and the goods 

1517
01:17:38,981 --> 01:17:41,591
and make sure that they were okay and 
then send them on or ensure the 

1518
01:17:41,591 --> 01:17:41,591
transaction.

1519
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,450
But what happened was the escrow agents 
didn't make any money.

1520
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,270
And the reason for that was no one 
cheated.

1521
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,790
And you think about how amazing that is,
right?

1522
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:52,610
You bring these people together across a
whole continent,

1523
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:57,611
they've never seen each other before.
They're never going to interact with 

1524
01:17:57,611 --> 01:18:00,551
each other again,
and this was before there were any 

1525
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:02,291
reputation ratings on Ebay and yet the 
default transaction was you describe 

1526
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:04,700
your goods honestly,
including their flaws.

1527
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:07,670
You set a reasonable price.
I decided to pay you.

1528
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:11,030
You ship the goods and I pay you and it 
works,

1529
01:18:11,031 --> 01:18:13,910
and what happened was that Ebay 
produced,

1530
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:18,290
produced a tremendous amount of capital 
that was previously frozen,

1531
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,990
so frozen capitalist,
when you've invested money in something,

1532
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,840
but the thing is no longer useful to 
you.

1533
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:26,360
So the money is just sitting there 
frozen,

1534
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,800
right?
So to speak,

1535
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,380
and you can't get it loose because,
well,

1536
01:18:30,381 --> 01:18:32,000
you've got an attic full of junk.

1537
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,190
How are you going to get rid of that?
Oh,

1538
01:18:34,191 --> 01:18:39,191
he may,
and so all of a sudden all these things 

1539
01:18:39,191 --> 01:18:41,051
that were just junk became valuable and 
everybody got richer and none of that 

1540
01:18:41,051 --> 01:18:45,101
wouldn't.
It would have happened without the 

1541
01:18:45,101 --> 01:18:45,101
covenant that we established between 
each other.

1542
01:18:45,101 --> 01:18:48,940
That's predicated on trust.
And so you might say that trust is the 

1543
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:51,470
currency and currency is trust.
Because it's a promissory note,

1544
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,850
right,
and if people lie,

1545
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:57,851
then the currency gets debased very,
very rapidly and so the economy runs on 

1546
01:18:57,851 --> 01:19:01,781
trust and so that's part of the 
overarching covenant.

1547
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:11,650
So Abraham makes this covenant with God 
and he decides that he's going to aim 

1548
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:16,781
high and live a good life and tell the 
truth and that puts this boundary around

1549
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:19,130
him.
It's like a walled garden.

1550
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:24,160
It's like a walled garden and inside 
there there's all sorts of things that 

1551
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:24,440
are happening that are complex and 
difficult,

1552
01:19:24,441 --> 01:19:27,740
but outside there's a boundary and the 
boundary is,

1553
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:30,020
well,
maybe things won't.

1554
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:33,860
It's like God says,
after the flood he says,

1555
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:36,080
I'll never send a flood again.
That's part of the story.

1556
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:39,560
And so there's an intimation there that 
no matter how bad things get,

1557
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:41,990
they won't get so bad that they'll be 
catastrophic.

1558
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:44,390
But there's a,
there's a Coda to that which is that you

1559
01:19:44,391 --> 01:19:49,391
have to maintain the covenant and we 
don't know what that means,

1560
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:53,030
you know,
because you know,

1561
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:57,170
you think it's pretty obvious that if 
you treat people well,

1562
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:01,730
if you really think about it and you're 
not being naively optimistic and like,

1563
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:03,410
you know,
a nice,

1564
01:20:03,411 --> 01:20:05,660
good person for op with all the weakness
that,

1565
01:20:05,661 --> 01:20:06,340
that,
that,

1566
01:20:06,341 --> 01:20:07,000
that,
that,

1567
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:07,780
that,
uh,

1568
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:10,260
that,
that intimate,

1569
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:15,910
if you're being hard nosed insensible,
you understand that if you treat people,

1570
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:19,620
if you trust people,
that's an act of courage.

1571
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:20,730
If you're not naive,
right?

1572
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:25,910
If you're naive,
it's an act of stupidity because you 

1573
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:27,420
might get bit and you probably will.
And if you're naive and you get bit,

1574
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,610
you will suffer for it.
It'll traumatize you.

1575
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:32,100
But if you're not naive and you know you
can get that,

1576
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:32,820
then you might ask,
well,

1577
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:37,821
what should you do with people?
And the answer is you should trust them 

1578
01:20:37,821 --> 01:20:40,320
not because you're naive and not because
they couldn't betray you and not because

1579
01:20:40,321 --> 01:20:44,760
you don't know that they could be trail.
But because if you hold out your hand in

1580
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:47,820
trust and you're inviting the best part 
of that person to step forward,

1581
01:20:47,821 --> 01:20:50,970
and that won't happen unless you take 
that initial step and that's courage,

1582
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,220
not naivety.
And so to trust someone,

1583
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:58,221
once your eyes are open,
that's an act of courage and that opens 

1584
01:20:58,221 --> 01:20:58,650
up the world.
You know when you might say,

1585
01:20:58,651 --> 01:20:59,160
okay,

1586
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,960
and so there's this idea in this story 
that you can withstand it.

1587
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:16,260
A fair bit of the catastrophe of life by
establishing the proper covenant and by 

1588
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,990
acting in a trustworthy manner and 
extending your hand to people properly.

1589
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,090
And you might say,
well,

1590
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,200
okay,
that's sensible.

1591
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:28,250
I can understand how that would work and
I can certainly see how the opposite 

1592
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:28,250
wouldn't work.
Because you know,

1593
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:32,850
if I have to be absolutely terrified 
that you're going to be trained me at 

1594
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:34,390
every possible moment and we're in in 
negotiation,

1595
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:36,000
we're not going to get any work done 
man.

1596
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:41,010
Because I'm going to be figuring out 
what you're up to all the time and 

1597
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:44,521
you're going to be figuring out what I'm
up to all the time and we're just not 

1598
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:47,011
going to get anywhere.
You'll come and say you're going to do 

1599
01:21:47,011 --> 01:21:47,011
something and I can just simplify you.

1600
01:21:47,011 --> 01:21:47,560
I can say you're going to do what you 
said you do.

1601
01:21:47,561 --> 01:21:51,130
I don't have to worry about you.
And then the same applies to me and then

1602
01:21:51,131 --> 01:21:53,410
we can go do something and that's how we
generate wealth.

1603
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:54,700
So then you might say,
well,

1604
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,730
if what's the ultimate limit of that?
You know,

1605
01:21:57,731 --> 01:22:02,731
like we know that there's corruption in 
our society that people betray each 

1606
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:05,731
other than the deceit and all of that 
and it causes things like the periodic 

1607
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:10,051
collapse in 2008,
which was complicated but was partly 

1608
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:13,111
engendered by corruption.
Like what would be the upside if we 

1609
01:22:13,111 --> 01:22:15,850
acted,
if we really determined to act honestly,

1610
01:22:15,851 --> 01:22:18,850
what do you think it is that people 
would be able to do with the world if we

1611
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:22,600
stopped acting in a corrupt manner?
I mean,

1612
01:22:22,601 --> 01:22:24,030
what?
What's the like what,

1613
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,840
what is the upside?
Do you think we could,

1614
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:26,980
could,
could.

1615
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:29,620
How far back could we push aging?
Do you think?

1616
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,010
If we hit it hard for 50 years,
can we tripled our lifespan?

1617
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,230
It wouldn't surprise me.
You know,

1618
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,960
all these terrible diseases that we set 
the planet.

1619
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:43,110
We could get rid of them.
There's no reason for hunger and 

1620
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:43,110
starvation.
We make enough food.

1621
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:47,980
It's like what would happen if we 
stopped acting badly?

1622
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:51,490
How much better could things get?
Or you start locally.

1623
01:22:51,491 --> 01:22:53,770
I think you start with yourself and you 
start with your family,

1624
01:22:53,771 --> 01:22:56,800
but you know there's intimations of the 
divine.

1625
01:22:56,801 --> 01:23:00,880
There's intimations of the Kingdom of 
God and the Covenant with God in the Old

1626
01:23:00,881 --> 01:23:02,410
Testament.
It's like you think,

1627
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:04,990
well,
we speak secularly.

1628
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:05,770
You think,
well,

1629
01:23:05,771 --> 01:23:06,220
that's

1630
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:08,170
an unprovable assumption.
It's like,

1631
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:08,830
well,
we'll just.

1632
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:11,470
Hold on a sec.
What's the assumption here?

1633
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:14,110
Exactly?
What is the upper end for humanity?

1634
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:15,760
I mean,
who's,

1635
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:16,810
who's going to say?
Right?

1636
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:18,760
Who's going to say,
especially in this day and age,

1637
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:23,761
man,
there's so many things happening that 

1638
01:23:23,761 --> 01:23:25,441
you can't even comprehend them.
What could we do if we put all of our 

1639
01:23:25,441 --> 01:23:26,050
effort into it?
While you can experiment with that,

1640
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:27,580
because you can start in your own 
household,

1641
01:23:27,581 --> 01:23:32,581
you can start in your own room and you 
could make miracles happen in the 

1642
01:23:32,581 --> 01:23:34,660
confines of your own space.
There's no doubt about that.

1643
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:36,310
Oh,
you have to do is try.

1644
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,920
You'll see that that happens.
It happened and people are writing to me

1645
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:40,630
and telling me that they're trying this 
and that.

1646
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:45,631
That's exactly what's happening and so,
so we don't want to be too cynical about

1647
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:51,830
about where we might be headed,
and Hagar bore Abraham a son,

1648
01:23:51,831 --> 01:23:54,170
and Abraham called his son's name,
which Hagar bear,

1649
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:59,380
Ishmael,
who is by tradition the forefather of 

1650
01:23:59,380 --> 01:23:59,480
several Arab nations and of Mohammed 
himself,

1651
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:04,970
and Abraham was four score and six years
old when Hagar Ishmael to Abrams.

1652
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:11,480
So that's the end of another story.
And then so that section ends,

1653
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:16,100
and then again we have an encounter 
between Abraham and God who when Abraham

1654
01:24:16,101 --> 01:24:19,580
was 90 years old and nine 99 years old,
the Lord appeared to him and said,

1655
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:23,540
I am the Almighty God.
Walk before me and be thou perfect.

1656
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:34,420
Alexander mcclaren,
who is our,

1657
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:39,530
a biblical commentator who lived in the 
early 19th century,

1658
01:24:39,531 --> 01:24:44,531
said this phrase,
walking before God is not precisely 

1659
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:46,820
walking with God because that's what 
Noah did,

1660
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:48,560
right?
He says,

1661
01:24:48,561 --> 01:24:53,561
it's rather that have an active life 
spent in continual consciousness of 

1662
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:57,071
being naked and open before the eyes of 
him to have whom we have to give 

1663
01:24:57,071 --> 01:25:01,361
account.
I was pretty happy to stumble across 

1664
01:25:01,361 --> 01:25:01,610
that because I mean I might've picked 
and chosen.

1665
01:25:01,611 --> 01:25:06,611
Of course,
you'd never know that whether you do 

1666
01:25:06,611 --> 01:25:08,261
that,
but it does seem in keeping with the 

1667
01:25:08,261 --> 01:25:08,261
narrative strain of the chapter,
right?

1668
01:25:08,261 --> 01:25:11,530
Because what we've hypothesized so far 
is that God has called Abraham and said,

1669
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:13,800
you know,
get out there in the world gold,

1670
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:18,830
gold to where it's unknown.
Go to where you're a stranger and get 

1671
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:19,760
away from the familiar.
Go out to the unknown,

1672
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,670
establish yourself and great things will
come of it.

1673
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:25,910
Regardless of the proximal evidence,
great things will come of it,

1674
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,060
and so I think that's what the walking 
before God refers to.

1675
01:25:29,061 --> 01:25:31,130
It's not like Abraham is acting in 
certainty.

1676
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:36,280
There's no certainty here that that's 
the act of the leap of faith even 

1677
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:39,760
because it does require a leap of faith 
for you to move into the world because 

1678
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,170
the world is a catastrophe of self.
Evidently the world is a catastrophe and

1679
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:43,460
so there's,
there's,

1680
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:49,060
there's every reason for you to assume 
that you should just sit in your 

1681
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,200
basement and hide from it,
but that's not.

1682
01:25:51,201 --> 01:25:52,970
It doesn't help.
It doesn't make things better.

1683
01:25:52,971 --> 01:25:54,950
And the thing is perhaps you're not 
built for that.

1684
01:25:54,951 --> 01:25:59,951
You're not built to hide.
I don't think that people are built to 

1685
01:25:59,951 --> 01:25:59,951
hide.
I think it destroys them.

1686
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:04,280
So walking before God in sense means 
that Abraham

1687
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,270
is,
we could say,

1688
01:26:05,271 --> 01:26:10,271
is taking the lead.
He's the person that's going out there 

1689
01:26:10,271 --> 01:26:10,271
into the unknown.
God says,

1690
01:26:10,271 --> 01:26:11,120
well,
great things are gonna happen,

1691
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:13,250
but he's a little short on details.
That's for sure.

1692
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:16,850
So the weight is still on Abraham and 
that's a good thing because it also that

1693
01:26:16,851 --> 01:26:18,170
ennoble Abraham Ham,
right?

1694
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:23,171
That's the other thing that's so cool is
that if God had just laid out the whole 

1695
01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:23,171
story and,
and,

1696
01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:27,660
and you know,
brush the branches from Abraham's path 

1697
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:28,850
while he was walking forward,
well then there'd be nothing for Abraham

1698
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:33,851
to do.
There'd be no nobility in his own 

1699
01:26:33,851 --> 01:26:34,530
pursuit and this is another thing that 
we don't understand very well.

1700
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:39,580
It's a really tough thing to understand 
is like how much trouble would you want 

1701
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:42,260
there not to be.
It's a weird question,

1702
01:26:42,261 --> 01:26:44,300
right?
Because you want to have some to contend

1703
01:26:44,301 --> 01:26:44,690
with.

1704
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:49,900
You want to have something that,
that forces from you the best that you 

1705
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,720
have,
and so you have to have real problems.

1706
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,180
Something like that.
Would you dispense with all your real,

1707
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:57,590
but you could just lay down on a bed and
have pablum infused into your mouth.

1708
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:02,620
You know,
if all your problems were solved and so 

1709
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:05,830
maybe you want difficult problems that 
you can solve something like that 

1710
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:07,210
because there's some.
I don't know what it is about it.

1711
01:27:07,211 --> 01:27:12,211
There's a,
there's the overcoming and the and the 

1712
01:27:12,211 --> 01:27:14,141
growth that comes along with that.
There's something about the nobility of 

1713
01:27:14,141 --> 01:27:14,330
the enterprise.
You certainly see that when you go about

1714
01:27:14,331 --> 01:27:15,560
having children,
for example,

1715
01:27:15,561 --> 01:27:16,490
which is,
you know,

1716
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:19,280
the psychological literature is quite 
clear if,

1717
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:24,390
if you do moment to moment comparisons 
of people who have kids and people who 

1718
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:27,941
don't have kids,
the people who don't have kids are 

1719
01:27:27,941 --> 01:27:29,120
happier and so psychologists who tend to
get things wrong,

1720
01:27:29,121 --> 01:27:31,700
even when they make intelligent 
discoveries like that one,

1721
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:36,860
immediately some of them jumped to the 
conclusion that because happiness is the

1722
01:27:36,861 --> 01:27:41,861
goal,
that while there's something about 

1723
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:41,930
children that make you unhappy and 
that's not good,

1724
01:27:41,931 --> 01:27:42,440
it's like,
well,

1725
01:27:42,441 --> 01:27:45,050
wait a second,
and maybe that's the wrong metric.

1726
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:50,050
It's like,
of course you're less happy once you 

1727
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:50,050
have children because you have to worry 
about them.

1728
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:54,880
You know,
my neighbor down the street who's very 

1729
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,131
smart woman said to me once,
you can only be as happy as your 

1730
01:27:57,131 --> 01:27:58,520
unhappiest child,
which I thought was really good.

1731
01:27:58,521 --> 01:27:59,750
You know,
that's really smart,

1732
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:01,400
but then it isn't.
Well,

1733
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,140
if having children doesn't make you 
happy,

1734
01:28:03,141 --> 01:28:05,030
the answer isn't don't have children.
It's like,

1735
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:07,850
don't be so stupid about being happy.
That's the answer.

1736
01:28:07,851 --> 01:28:10,490
It's because there's a nobility in the 
pursuit,

1737
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:12,350
right?
And of course now you're responsible,

1738
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:17,560
you know you have a new baby.
You think especially if you're a new 

1739
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:17,560
parent,
you think,

1740
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:20,720
what the hell is this and what am I 
going to do with it?

1741
01:28:20,721 --> 01:28:21,470
You know?
It's like,

1742
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:24,770
and then you're,
you're done for the rest of your life.

1743
01:28:24,771 --> 01:28:29,771
You never sleep properly again because 
you're going to be worried about this 

1744
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:30,290
creature that you have to take care of 
it,

1745
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,880
but like,
what the hell good are you?

1746
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:35,930
If you're not doing that or something 
else equally difficult because you just,

1747
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:40,940
you just have been called out yet.
Unless you take on a responsibility like

1748
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:45,941
that,
the idea that life is that happiness is 

1749
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:46,550
the purpose of life.
It's like great for happiness,

1750
01:28:46,551 --> 01:28:47,630
man.
If it comes along,

1751
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:50,570
you should be thrilled that it's 
visiting you,

1752
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:53,900
but the notion that that's,
that that's what you should pursue.

1753
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:57,890
That's the weakest possible notion.
First of all,

1754
01:28:57,950 --> 01:28:59,360
as soon as something terrible happens to
you,

1755
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,770
you're done.
It's like life is to be happy.

1756
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:02,250
It's like,
well,

1757
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:04,590
now you have cancer,
so how's that?

1758
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:07,110
How the happiness thing work it out for 
you now,

1759
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:10,770
or maybe it's not you,
you know,

1760
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:15,771
maybe it's your father that has 
Alzheimer's disease or some damn thing 

1761
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:19,131
and you know it's like it's a rare 
person that doesn't have some 

1762
01:29:19,131 --> 01:29:19,131
catastrophe.
One,

1763
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,760
one person away from them.

1764
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,680
He's like,
life is to be happy.

1765
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:27,700
It's not right,
and we can at least derive that from 

1766
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:27,900
these stories.
That isn't what they say at all.

1767
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:32,500
God's perfectly happy in these stories 
to grant the people with whom he forms a

1768
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:36,480
covenant happiness and prosperity,
but there's never a word that that's the

1769
01:29:36,481 --> 01:29:39,990
purpose.
The rule is aim high and get your bloody

1770
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:41,610
act together.
That's the rule,

1771
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:46,611
and establish this contractual covenant 
with the ultimate ideal and that will 

1772
01:29:46,611 --> 01:29:49,260
see you through the catastrophes and 
that's a much more mature way of looking

1773
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:54,261
at life as far as I'm concerned because 
all you have to do is have your eyes 

1774
01:29:54,261 --> 01:29:57,531
half open and you see that the 
fundamental reality of life is tragedy 

1775
01:29:57,531 --> 01:29:59,550
and suffering.
There's that's inescapable.

1776
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,530
The quest.
That doesn't mean that it,

1777
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:06,740
it makes life unbearable or that it 
makes being something that shouldn't 

1778
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,010
have existed,
right?

1779
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:13,010
That isn't what it means,
but it means that you have to contend 

1780
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:16,071
with it and you have to get ready and 
the willingness to adopt responsibility 

1781
01:30:16,071 --> 01:30:18,510
for yourself and for others is,
is the precondition for that.

1782
01:30:18,511 --> 01:30:20,610
And,
and then maybe if you do that properly,

1783
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:22,380
then now and then you get some 
happiness.

1784
01:30:22,381 --> 01:30:27,381
You know,
you can sit at the end of the day and 

1785
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:29,121
you have half an hour where your 
conscience is clear and there's nothing 

1786
01:30:29,121 --> 01:30:29,850
that you need to be doing and you can 
relax and think,

1787
01:30:29,851 --> 01:30:31,560
you know,
that that's all right.

1788
01:30:31,561 --> 01:30:34,300
Things are okay and thank God for that.
And that's,

1789
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,420
that's maybe where you get your 
happiness.

1790
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:41,010
So that's something that's growing up,
man,

1791
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,170
obviously.
And,

1792
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:45,390
and to not know that and to not be 
taught that,

1793
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:49,500
like everyone should be taught that it's
so obvious we should be taught that.

1794
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:54,800
Well,
and that's partly what these biblical 

1795
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,451
stories do and I will make my covenant 
between me and Thee and will multiply 

1796
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,070
the exceedingly and Abraham fell on his 
face.

1797
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:04,380
Yeah and God talk with him saying,
as for me,

1798
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:07,620
behold my covenant is with Thee and Thou
shall be a father of many nations.

1799
01:31:07,621 --> 01:31:09,630
God says this a lot.
Tabor them right it.

1800
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,810
So it's almost like he has to remind him
now and then.

1801
01:31:11,811 --> 01:31:16,811
And it's not surprising because he keeps
going through these unbelievable 

1802
01:31:16,811 --> 01:31:16,811
adventures,
you know,

1803
01:31:16,811 --> 01:31:20,130
that are really psychologically and 
socially shattering.

1804
01:31:20,131 --> 01:31:24,390
So it's a good thing that this reminder 
pops up in a fairly frequently.

1805
01:31:24,391 --> 01:31:26,250
But of course Abraham is also open to 
it.

1806
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:28,650
And I think,
what does it mean?

1807
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:33,090
You know,
I'll talk personally for a moment.

1808
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:38,420
I guess.
So I've asked myself a lot of questions 

1809
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:38,420
in the last eight months.
Man,

1810
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:42,710
I can tell you that and I'm still asking
myself a lot of questions and I've been 

1811
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:45,090
conferring with a lot of people because 
I had lots of people who were helping me

1812
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:49,530
negotiate whatever the hell this is 
what's happening and you know,

1813
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:54,531
I could ask them how it was doing and 
they would tell me a bunch of things I 

1814
01:31:54,531 --> 01:31:54,820
was doing wrong and some things I was 
doing right and I could listen to them.

1815
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:59,830
And I was asking questions all the time 
about how the hell I should manage this 

1816
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:04,290
properly and you know what,
what I was trying to do and what seemed 

1817
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:08,830
to serve me properly was to figure out 
how to do it correctly.

1818
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:14,070
That was the issue.
It's like I didn't really care what 

1819
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:14,070
happened and I guess I really don't care
what happens,

1820
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:17,230
but I do care if I do it correctly 
because I don't want to screw it up.

1821
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:22,780
I don't want to screw things up.
And that seems to be a reasonable goal 

1822
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:22,840
for people.
I mean,

1823
01:32:22,841 --> 01:32:27,841
wouldn't you like that as a goal that 
you don't screw things up because he 

1824
01:32:27,841 --> 01:32:30,790
can't control to your life isn't fully 
under your control by any stretch of the

1825
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:35,791
imagination.
But it might be nice to not have your 

1826
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:36,040
conscience seating at you saying,
look,

1827
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:41,041
you know,
you had a big opportunity there and you 

1828
01:32:41,041 --> 01:32:42,790
mocked it up because you're weak and 
blind and he didn't listen.

1829
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:46,480
That's no good.
The cast the catastrophes bad enough,

1830
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:51,481
as I said,
without you being the bloody source of 

1831
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:51,481
it.
And so.

1832
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:56,910
Well that's Abraham falling on his face,
I guess.

1833
01:32:56,911 --> 01:32:59,580
And also communing with God.
It's like you do.

1834
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:02,880
He wants to get it right,
he wants to get it right,

1835
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:06,320
and there's these,
these things that beckon in promise,

1836
01:33:06,321 --> 01:33:06,490
but,

1837
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:13,550
but it's,
it's bloody easy to make a catastrophic 

1838
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:13,550
mistake and he'll do that in your life,
you know,

1839
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:21,860
and maybe humility is one of the things 
that can prevent that because you can 

1840
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:21,860
look and you can think,
okay,

1841
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:22,980
what am I doing wrong?
What am I doing wrong?

1842
01:33:22,981 --> 01:33:25,710
What can I do better?
How could I do this properly?

1843
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:27,960
And then maybe you know,
you get,

1844
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:31,140
you get,
you get the intimation of the proper way

1845
01:33:31,141 --> 01:33:36,141
to move forward.
And maybe that's what protects you when 

1846
01:33:36,141 --> 01:33:37,680
things are chaotic and in strife.
And who knows what that's worth,

1847
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:42,260
neither shall thy name anymore be called
Abraham,

1848
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:44,720
which means high king.
If I remember correctly,

1849
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:48,080
a Thai name shall be Abraham for a 
father of many nations.

1850
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:50,280
Have I made the oh,
Abrams,

1851
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,830
hi father.
Look at that.

1852
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:56,960
Abraham means father of a multitude and 
I will make the exceedingly fruitful and

1853
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:58,940
I will make nations of the productive 
right?

1854
01:33:58,941 --> 01:34:03,941
Productive.
And that seems to be something that's 

1855
01:34:03,941 --> 01:34:06,550
good to be.
I mean like one of the things that I've 

1856
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:06,550
thought about deeply,

1857
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:12,070
I thought deeply about death and the 
death of my family members and about 

1858
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:15,311
funerals.
And I thought about it partly because I 

1859
01:34:15,311 --> 01:34:17,171
had this weird experience once that I 
think I told you about where I took one 

1860
01:34:17,171 --> 01:34:20,021
of my clients to see an embalming,
which was very strange experience and I 

1861
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:22,940
had a chance to talk to the funeral 
directors because they have weird jobs,

1862
01:34:22,941 --> 01:34:25,100
you know,
and there's this idea,

1863
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,760
well the Freudian idea that people 
suffer from this terrible death anxiety 

1864
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:34,361
and there's a whole line of social 
psychological theory theorizing called 

1865
01:34:34,361 --> 01:34:38,261
terror management theory that's 
predicated on the idea that we defend 

1866
01:34:38,261 --> 01:34:39,470
ourselves against death anxiety with our
belief systems.

1867
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:41,990
And like puppets,
Ernest Becker's idea,

1868
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:44,060
he wrote the denial of death,
which is a great book,

1869
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:47,360
but there's a weakness in it because you
see some people who aren't like that,

1870
01:34:47,361 --> 01:34:52,361
you know,
like emergency room nurses aren't like 

1871
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:52,361
that.

1872
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:52,361
And palliative care nurses aren't like 
that might.

1873
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:54,020
My sister in law is a palliative care 
nurse.

1874
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:56,390
That's a hard job,
right,

1875
01:34:56,391 --> 01:35:01,391
because you go there,
you're caring for people you have and 

1876
01:35:01,391 --> 01:35:01,391
they're in pain and they're on their 
last legs.

1877
01:35:01,391 --> 01:35:05,861
You try to make them comfortable and you
have a relationship with them because 

1878
01:35:05,861 --> 01:35:05,861
how the hell are you going to make them 
comfortable?

1879
01:35:05,861 --> 01:35:10,271
If you don't,
then they go and die on you and that 

1880
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:10,271
just happens.
That's what happens every day.

1881
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:14,560
Right?
And what's weird is that people can be 

1882
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:14,560
palliative care nurses.
It's like,

1883
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,251
how do you figure that out?
Because people can actually thrive in 

1884
01:35:18,251 --> 01:35:20,930
the face of death strangely enough.
And like these funeral parlor directors,

1885
01:35:20,931 --> 01:35:23,090
they were interesting to talk to because
that's all they do,

1886
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:24,290
right?
They just deal with.

1887
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,600
They deal with death and grief all the 
time and it was very interesting talking

1888
01:35:29,601 --> 01:35:31,370
to them because I talked to two of them.

1889
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,550
They found their job extremely 
meaningful and I asked them,

1890
01:35:34,551 --> 01:35:34,860
well,
you know,

1891
01:35:34,861 --> 01:35:37,160
what does that,
what does that do to your life?

1892
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:42,190
You know,
you're saturated with death and 

1893
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:44,321
suffering and there,
and this is the same answer that I got 

1894
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:47,690
from the palliative care nurses,
that it doesn't undermine your life.

1895
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,720
It enriches it now,
who would guess that?

1896
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:51,290
Right?
I mean,

1897
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:53,450
what the hell?
That just doesn't make any sense at all,

1898
01:35:53,451 --> 01:35:58,451
but what it does is speak to human 
possibility because God only knows how 

1899
01:35:58,451 --> 01:35:59,540
tough you are.
You know what I mean?

1900
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:02,060
If you read history and you read about 
what people have done,

1901
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:02,930
you think,
wow,

1902
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:05,030
we're pretty tough.
People are.

1903
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:11,530
I read a,
there is a shipwreck in the Antarctica 

1904
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:16,820
100 years ago or so,
and I read the story.

1905
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,850
It was not a biography.
If I remember correctly of the,

1906
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:20,900
of the captain.

1907
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,060
I might be wrong about that,
but I've got the basic story,

1908
01:36:23,061 --> 01:36:24,170
right?
Well,

1909
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:29,500
they had a ship wreck and the Antarctica
was then they were there for a whole 

1910
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,290
year in the Antarctic arc,
you know,

1911
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:32,190
and none of them died.
Not One.

1912
01:36:32,191 --> 01:36:34,310
He didn't lose a single man,
not one.

1913
01:36:34,311 --> 01:36:39,311
He kept the morale high and then they 
took this boat that was on the ship and 

1914
01:36:39,311 --> 01:36:40,910
they crossed like 400 miles of the 
roughest ocean,

1915
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,430
the roughest,
frigid ocean in the world.

1916
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:45,950
Right?
You don't go in that ocean and then they

1917
01:36:45,951 --> 01:36:50,951
went to an island and they walked across
the island across these mountains that 

1918
01:36:50,951 --> 01:36:55,331
no one else has ever climbed since,
and they went to the city on the other 

1919
01:36:55,641 --> 01:37:00,641
side of the island and they got a boat 
and they went and rescued their 

1920
01:37:00,641 --> 01:37:03,250
compatriots and everyone survived.
It's like endurance is the name of the 

1921
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:03,250
book.

1922
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,190
You read that book,
man.

1923
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,690
You think,
wow,

1924
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:07,810
people are really tough,
you know,

1925
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:10,100
and if,
and it's ridiculous.

1926
01:37:10,101 --> 01:37:15,101
So who knows how tough you are and maybe
you find out by going out to find out 

1927
01:37:15,101 --> 01:37:16,010
how tough you are.
Right?

1928
01:37:16,011 --> 01:37:19,640
So you take on a challenge,
one that you think you can master,

1929
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:24,910
just that's just a bit beyond your grasp
and you master it and then you're a 

1930
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:24,910
little tougher and you think,
hey,

1931
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:28,250
that worked out pretty well,
and so then you're more of a monster and

1932
01:37:28,251 --> 01:37:33,251
then you go out and find another 
challenge that's even bigger and you 

1933
01:37:33,251 --> 01:37:33,251
think,
well maybe I can do that too.

1934
01:37:33,251 --> 01:37:37,600
And then all of a sudden you can and you
get a little bit bigger and God only 

1935
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,751
knows what the limit is of you and you 
find out by pushing yourself against the

1936
01:37:41,181 --> 01:37:46,181
world.
And of course that's what Abraham is 

1937
01:37:46,181 --> 01:37:46,181
doing.

1938
01:37:46,181 --> 01:37:47,780
And so see,
we're very pessimistic.

1939
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:51,740
US modern people you know,
were pessimistic about humanity,

1940
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:52,970
that's for sure.
Dismal,

1941
01:37:52,971 --> 01:37:56,850
wretched planet destroying cancer on the
planet,

1942
01:37:56,851 --> 01:38:01,620
right as the club of Rome described us 
so pleasantly back in the 19 sixties,

1943
01:38:01,621 --> 01:38:03,360
you know,
and I don't know,

1944
01:38:03,361 --> 01:38:08,361
maybe we're ashamed of the Cold War and 
maybe we're ashamed of all the 

1945
01:38:08,361 --> 01:38:10,690
destruction in the 20th century and the 
hydrogen bomb and you know,

1946
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:16,150
the continuing catastrophes of our 
societies were deeply ashamed of that 

1947
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:20,211
and ashamed of ourselves personally.
But it's a hell of a thing to call us a 

1948
01:38:20,211 --> 01:38:24,111
cancer on the planet.
There's just no excuse for that because 

1949
01:38:24,111 --> 01:38:27,261
what you do with cancer is eradicated.
And I don't think that that's a very 

1950
01:38:27,261 --> 01:38:31,521
knowable motive personally.
And I think it says a lot about the 

1951
01:38:31,681 --> 01:38:36,681
people who would use such phraseology 
that they would dare to conceptualize 

1952
01:38:36,681 --> 01:38:36,681
humanity in that manner.

1953
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:42,380
But you know,
it'd be nice if we could be optimistic 

1954
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:43,770
and I think began the problem with being
optimistic is that it's naive.

1955
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:46,530
So then the question is,
is there an optimism that's not naive?

1956
01:38:46,531 --> 01:38:51,531
And I think there is an optimism that's 
not naive as in just a visualization of 

1957
01:38:53,431 --> 01:38:58,380
how strong people can be.
So one of the things that I tell people,

1958
01:38:58,381 --> 01:39:01,260
I've told my students in my class in 
maps of meaning,

1959
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:05,910
here's a goal.
You want to be the person at the funeral

1960
01:39:05,911 --> 01:39:08,490
of your father that everyone can rely 
on.

1961
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:14,480
How would that be?
You want to be the person who's broken 

1962
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:14,480
and,
and,

1963
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,530
and useless and adding to the misery in 
the corner.

1964
01:39:16,531 --> 01:39:19,980
And look,
I'm not making light of people's grief.

1965
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,080
You know,
I understand grief,

1966
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:25,290
but who do you want to be when there's a
crisis,

1967
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:31,300
right?
Do you want to be the person that 

1968
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:31,300
everyone can turn to for strength?
It's like,

1969
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:31,320
why the hell not?
Why not?

1970
01:39:31,321 --> 01:39:36,321
That is a goal.
That would be a good goal because then 

1971
01:39:36,321 --> 01:39:37,620
if there's a crisis and there will be,
it won't be such a bloody crisis because

1972
01:39:37,621 --> 01:39:39,240
there'll be someone there that can deal 
with it.

1973
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:46,850
You know,
so when I went and talked to these 

1974
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:46,850
people at the funeral home,
I envisioned that I thought,

1975
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:50,631
okay,
well this is something you have to 

1976
01:39:50,631 --> 01:39:50,631
contend with.
If you're going to be alive and adult,

1977
01:39:50,631 --> 01:39:55,370
you have to contend with death and 
suffering and you have to be ready for 

1978
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:59,511
it and you have to be there for the 
person because that's how they're going 

1979
01:39:59,511 --> 01:40:02,850
to have.
And so there a goal man.

1980
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,220
And in this time of nihilism,
you know what's,

1981
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:10,310
what's the point of life?
People ask and they're taught that at 

1982
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:11,190
universities.
What's the point of life?

1983
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,410
Everything's interpretation.
Humanities.

1984
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,840
A cancer on the planet.
You know?

1985
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:17,430
Well,
how about no?

1986
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:22,610
How about not that?
How about the do something to us and I 

1987
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:45,701
will establish my covenant between me 
and Dan seed after thee in their 

1988
01:40:45,701 --> 01:40:46,880
generations for an everlasting covenant 
to be a God unto Thee,

1989
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:51,910
unto thy seed,
after the and I will give unto thee to 

1990
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:54,190
thy seed after the the land we're in now
art a all

1991
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:59,280
the land of Canaan.
Because of course Abraham went out into 

1992
01:40:59,280 --> 01:40:59,280
the land of strangers,
right?

1993
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:04,480
But it says that he'll master if he,
if he keeps his covenant,

1994
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:09,780
he'll master the land of strangers.
That's a wonderful thing to know and I 

1995
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,440
think a true thing,
you know,

1996
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:12,850
because if you're dealing with 
strangers,

1997
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,040
I've dealt with lots of strange people 
in my life.

1998
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:18,430
If I'm a clinical psychologist,
and that isn't to say that everyone that

1999
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:20,800
I've dealt with was strange because 
that's not the case,

2000
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:26,600
but I have encountered some very strange
people and you know,

2001
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,130
the way to deal with strange people is 
to.

2002
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,400
You never lie to a strange person.
That's the thing,

2003
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:39,030
especially if they're paranoid.
You never lie to someone who's paranoid 

2004
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:39,190
it.
It will come back to bite you.

2005
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,570
And if you're in an extreme situation 
with someone who's very unpredictable,

2006
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:48,940
the only thing you have that works is 
the truth that works.

2007
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,130
I'll tell you a little story.
This is in my book.

2008
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:59,790
So I had this landlord in Montreal.
He lived next door to me and he was an 

2009
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:03,121
ex hell's angels biker.
He'd spent a lot of time in prison and 

2010
01:42:03,121 --> 01:42:06,931
his wife had borderline personality 
disorder and she committed suicide when 

2011
01:42:06,931 --> 01:42:09,520
I lived there.
And he was a rough guy and he was at Caa

2012
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,060
Quebec law.
He spoke ul,

2013
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:13,620
which I could hardly understand.
And uh,

2014
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:17,020
he didn't really know what to make of me
and I didn't really know what to make of

2015
01:42:17,021 --> 01:42:18,060
him.
Um,

2016
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:20,860
but we got along,
you know,

2017
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:24,460
I was very careful talking to him as,
as you might imagine,

2018
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:25,920
but,
but I,

2019
01:42:25,921 --> 01:42:26,740
I was,
it was very.

2020
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:29,950
And we went over to my wife and I went 
over there and we had a spaghetti dinner

2021
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:34,951
one night and we sort of communicated.
And I bought a poster from him because 

2022
01:42:34,951 --> 01:42:35,800
he made these wooden posters that had 
neon on them.

2023
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:40,800
And that's how he made a living.
He'd Kinda trained himself to be a bit 

2024
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,531
of an electronics guy and so we made 
these things and he was trying to quit 

2025
01:42:43,531 --> 01:42:44,020
drinking and we talked about that.
He was a lot older than me.

2026
01:42:44,021 --> 01:42:47,790
He was like 20 years older than me.
I was about 25 at this point and uh,

2027
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:54,330
we got along pretty well,
but every now and then he'd go out and 

2028
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:56,160
get a drink and he could really drink,
you know,

2029
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:59,230
like he was one of these guys who could 
drink like 60 beer and you think,

2030
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:01,330
well no one can drink that much and 
you're wrong.

2031
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:05,530
I studied alcohol for like 10 years,
some of my subjects,

2032
01:43:05,531 --> 01:43:10,531
father's drank 40 ounces of vodka a day 
and had been doing it for 20 years so 

2033
01:43:10,531 --> 01:43:11,590
you can drink a lot and he could drink a
lot.

2034
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:13,180
And what would happen?
He was trying to,

2035
01:43:13,181 --> 01:43:18,181
not drink,
but he'd go out and go on a binge and 

2036
01:43:18,181 --> 01:43:20,041
then he'd be gone for like three days 
and he drink up all his money and then 

2037
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:25,710
we'd hear him out in the backyard 
howling at the moon with this little 

2038
01:43:25,710 --> 01:43:25,750
little ugly dog.
He had,

2039
01:43:25,751 --> 01:43:29,050
you know,
and he'd held and the dog would hell and

2040
01:43:29,051 --> 01:43:30,680
he'd haul them and the dog would haul 
and,

2041
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:36,020
and it was a rather unsettling and made 
my wife nervous and uh,

2042
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:39,700
but worse,
you know now,

2043
01:43:39,701 --> 01:43:42,920
and then he'd come to the door at like 
three in the morning,

2044
01:43:42,921 --> 01:43:47,921
hey,
and he'd knock on the door and he'd be 

2045
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:50,131
standing there and I don't know how much
experience you've had with rough guys 

2046
01:43:50,771 --> 01:43:53,360
who are and who were drunk,
but it's,

2047
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:59,320
they can be upright and unconscious at 
the same time.

2048
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:01,730
And so that was the state that he was 
in,

2049
01:44:01,731 --> 01:44:06,731
you know,
he'd be just swaying and he asked me if 

2050
01:44:06,731 --> 01:44:09,731
I would like to buy his toaster or his 
microwave because he needed some money 

2051
01:44:09,731 --> 01:44:14,141
to keep drinking and you know,
I didn't really want to buy his toaster 

2052
01:44:14,141 --> 01:44:14,141
or as microwave.

2053
01:44:14,141 --> 01:44:18,190
But when the x hell's angel,
you all speaking 60 beard,

2054
01:44:18,611 --> 01:44:23,611
drunk Quebecois biker shows up at your 
door at three in the morning and the 

2055
01:44:23,611 --> 01:44:25,760
offers you to sell offers to sell you 
his microwave.

2056
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,960
The easiest thing is to say,
I really need a microwave.

2057
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:36,360
So.
So you know,

2058
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:41,150
I bought the microwave and toaster and 
some other things,

2059
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:47,020
but then,
but then my wife talked to me and she 

2060
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:48,990
liked my landlord,
you know,

2061
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:53,000
even though she was afraid of him,
she liked him and she said,

2062
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:58,030
you can't buy any more,
any more appliances because it's not 

2063
01:44:58,030 --> 01:44:59,240
good for him.
And I thought,

2064
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,690
Huh,
that's an interesting problem,

2065
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:08,020
you know,
so what the hell am I going to do about 

2066
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:10,181
this because no,
I don't want to buy your microwave just 

2067
01:45:10,181 --> 01:45:11,060
doesn't seem to be the right answer at 
three in the morning.

2068
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:16,480
So.
So one time he took me out on his 

2069
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,220
sevenfifty Honda and he put me on the 
back of it.

2070
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:24,250
He wanted to show me his layer,
I guess his hangouts and I got his 

2071
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:27,581
wife's helmet on but it didn't fit it 
just sit on the top of my head and he 

2072
01:45:27,581 --> 01:45:30,530
said,
I go to the bike and he said if the cops

2073
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,540
chase us,
we're not stopping.

2074
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:36,890
And then away we went and we went to 
these,

2075
01:45:36,891 --> 01:45:41,891
like these bars downtown on the wrong.
They were very rough places and he got 

2076
01:45:41,891 --> 01:45:44,510
into like four fights that night because
he was a rough guy,

2077
01:45:44,511 --> 01:45:49,511
you know,
and these kind of punk guys would come 

2078
01:45:49,511 --> 01:45:52,121
up to him and sort of challenge them and
act stupidly around him and he was very 

2079
01:45:52,121 --> 01:45:55,571
skeptical and if you were acting 
stupidly around him for any length of 

2080
01:45:55,571 --> 01:45:58,781
time,
he just hit you because he felt that 

2081
01:45:58,781 --> 01:45:58,781
that's what you deserved.
And perhaps he was right,

2082
01:45:58,781 --> 01:45:59,240
you know,
so.

2083
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:02,450
So I had a firsthand opportunity to 
observe him.

2084
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:05,360
So anyways,
he sure enough,

2085
01:46:05,361 --> 01:46:08,420
about a week or two after we had this 
conversation,

2086
01:46:08,421 --> 01:46:10,040
he showed up at the door,
knock,

2087
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:10,700
knock,
knock,

2088
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:13,040
you know,
open the door and they're standing there

2089
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:17,390
with his eyes half closed and he was 
swaying and he had.

2090
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:19,490
I don't remember what the appliance was 
this time,

2091
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:23,030
but he wanted to sell it to me and I 
said,

2092
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:29,110
I'm not all I can buy this.
I'm not going to buy this because I know

2093
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,660
you're trying to quit drinking.
And if I give you this money then you're

2094
01:46:32,661 --> 01:46:36,050
going to go and drink it up.
And it's not going to be good for you.

2095
01:46:36,051 --> 01:46:41,051
And what else did I tell them?
I think I told him as well that this 

2096
01:46:42,591 --> 01:46:47,591
whole thing of him coming to my house at
like two in the morning was scaring my 

2097
01:46:47,591 --> 01:46:49,620
wife who we liked and that it had to 
stop and believe me,

2098
01:46:49,621 --> 01:46:54,621
man,
I was thinking about what I was saying 

2099
01:46:54,621 --> 01:46:57,620
because he was watching me like a rough 
guy watches you and a rough guy watches 

2100
01:46:57,781 --> 01:47:02,781
you like this.
He thinks if you say one thing that 

2101
01:47:02,781 --> 01:47:06,270
indicates contempt,
you're going to bloody well paid for it.

2102
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:09,710
And so I was finding my words like,
you know,

2103
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:12,060
I was crossing a swamp and trying to 
look for the,

2104
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:16,650
for the rocks underneath the surface.
And I said what I had to say very,

2105
01:47:16,651 --> 01:47:20,160
very carefully.
And he looked at me for about 15 seconds

2106
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:24,840
and that's a long time to be locked out 
at three in the morning.

2107
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:30,840
And he laughed and he never came back to
sell me anything again.

2108
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:36,470
And we got along fine.
But that's a good seal illustration of 

2109
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:40,221
this issue with regards to truth and 
success in the strange land.

2110
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:47,750
Because I was in the strange land when I
was talking to my neighbor,

2111
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:53,750
my landlord Dan and I managed to say 
what was true carefully enough so 

2112
01:47:55,231 --> 01:48:00,231
despite the fact that he was a very 
violent person and then he was very 

2113
01:48:00,231 --> 01:48:05,091
intoxicated person and then he had every
reason to be suspicious of me and we 

2114
01:48:05,091 --> 01:48:08,280
couldn't communicate very well and I 
didn't do what he wanted,

2115
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:13,910
that he took it and he left and there 
was no problem and life went on just 

2116
01:48:16,171 --> 01:48:21,171
fine after that and so we don't want to 
underestimate the utility of 

2117
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:28,820
establishing this bounded relationship 
with the ideal and attempting to live 

2118
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:33,870
with some nobility in truth will aiming 
at the highest ideal.

2119
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:39,050
There's nothing about that.
That's anything but strengthening and 

2120
01:48:40,201 --> 01:48:45,201
positive and it's exactly what you need 
to set against the catastrophe and 

2121
01:48:47,491 --> 01:48:50,670
uncertainty of life and as far as I can 
tell,

2122
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:56,990
that's what these abrahamic stories are 
attempting to communicate.

2123
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:01,660
So we'll stop there.
Thank you.

2124
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:17,590
Thanks.

2125
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:31,200
I have to make an announcement.
I'm going to do a talk August 22nd I 

2126
01:49:32,781 --> 01:49:34,790
think.
Not sure of the date,

2127
01:49:34,791 --> 01:49:38,390
but I'll.
I'll find out with Gad,

2128
01:49:38,391 --> 01:49:41,780
Saad from Concordia and so

2129
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:49,570
with an x social worker named Serena 
sing and with faith Goldie,

2130
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:51,400
I think faith is going to be there as 
well.

2131
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:55,840
So the tickets for that will go on sale.
I'm not hosting this,

2132
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:59,860
someone else's dealing with it,
but the tickets for that will go on sale

2133
01:49:59,861 --> 01:50:03,010
within approximately a week and I'll 
post that on my.

2134
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:06,280
I'll probably make an announcement on 
youtube but I'll twitter,

2135
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:08,110
tweeter it,
twitter it and all of that.

2136
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,910
So.
And I think I mentioned to you guys last

2137
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:15,460
week that I would like to continue this 
series,

2138
01:50:15,461 --> 01:50:19,210
but I think I'll do it once a month and 
I'll try to do it in this theater,

2139
01:50:19,211 --> 01:50:22,390
but I haven't got word from the people 
who run the theater.

2140
01:50:22,391 --> 01:50:25,000
That's the university.
Whether or not it'll be accessible,

2141
01:50:25,001 --> 01:50:27,160
but I'll figure something out.
And so.

2142
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:28,030
Oh,
hi.

2143
01:50:28,031 --> 01:50:33,031
Serena.
Serena is the person who's going to be 

2144
01:50:33,031 --> 01:50:33,031
hosting this.

2145
01:50:33,031 --> 01:50:34,810
So August 22nd at 10:00
PM.

2146
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:38,470
Seven 10 PM at Ryerson Monday.
Okay.

2147
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:40,520
Tickets go on sale Monday.
All right.

2148
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,900
And then.
And then,

2149
01:50:42,901 --> 01:50:45,850
uh,
oh,

2150
01:50:45,851 --> 01:50:50,851
there's a special freedom of speech 
edition of the Hemingways Restaurant 

2151
01:50:50,851 --> 01:50:51,640
Jordan Peterson discussion group 
tonight.

2152
01:50:51,910 --> 01:50:53,410
So that's at 10:00
PM.

2153
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:57,790
So you're all welcome to attend that.
So that's 1:42

2154
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:59,650
cumberland street.
Okay.

2155
01:50:59,651 --> 01:51:03,760
So that's it for announcements I guess.
And then let's say for questions.

2156
01:51:03,761 --> 01:51:08,761
Yes.
I was going to let you ask the first 

2157
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:08,761
question.
Last time was not okay.

2158
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:10,480
So I will do that.
And so let's make sure again,

2159
01:51:10,481 --> 01:51:15,481
everybody to speak into the Mike clearly
so that the youtube people can hear and 

2160
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:17,950
you know,
the ghostly youtube people.

2161
01:51:19,330 --> 01:51:20,590
And so go ahead.

2162
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:24,500
I was quite impressed with your 
presentation last week and uh,

2163
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,130
I wasn't quite sure where it was going 
at one point in,

2164
01:51:27,131 --> 01:51:28,420
wouldn't it?
Neither was on.

2165
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,510
And that's okay.
Because at what point I,

2166
01:51:31,511 --> 01:51:36,511
I listened,
I thought what you basically were 

2167
01:51:36,511 --> 01:51:36,511
talking about,
this is what I saw,

2168
01:51:36,511 --> 01:51:40,660
you were embodying mind,
body and spirit and bringing it all 

2169
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:41,410
together as one.
And you touched on it a bit tonight when

2170
01:51:41,411 --> 01:51:42,700
you,
when you talk about truth,

2171
01:51:42,701 --> 01:51:43,990
this is where we need to go.
Right?

2172
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:46,330
And I know you say be positive and all 
that and yeah,

2173
01:51:46,331 --> 01:51:47,650
that's right.
I agree.

2174
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:51,100
It's scary what's going on right now.
However we have the power to stay in the

2175
01:51:51,101 --> 01:51:53,800
positive.
What you talked about last week,

2176
01:51:53,801 --> 01:51:58,801
you talked about using our intuition,
which I consider our higher self using 

2177
01:51:58,801 --> 01:52:00,070
consciousness.
And you made reference,

2178
01:52:00,071 --> 01:52:02,890
I can't remember exactly what you,
what you said,

2179
01:52:02,891 --> 01:52:07,891
but you held your hand and you talked 
about emotions and bringing intellect on

2180
01:52:08,411 --> 01:52:11,080
top.
And when you said emotions,

2181
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:14,290
everything just lit up for me because 
I'm thinking that's our heart Chakra.

2182
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:17,290
That's what combines our lower self or 
physical being,

2183
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:18,470
the material stuff,
all the,

2184
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:22,420
all the stuff that doesn't really 
motivate us with their higher self.

2185
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:24,400
And when I'm going to use talked about 
emotion,

2186
01:52:24,401 --> 01:52:25,990
I wanted to talk about the emotion of 
love.

2187
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:29,500
And I find so many people are terrified.
It's a four letter word.

2188
01:52:29,501 --> 01:52:31,450
I know,
but it doesn't have to be bad.

2189
01:52:31,570 --> 01:52:36,570
Okay.
So I remember why when I talked to you 

2190
01:52:36,570 --> 01:52:36,570
last week,
why I wanted you to ask this question.

2191
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:37,500
So.
Okay.

2192
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:42,501
So I've talked a lot in this lecture 
series about truth and no,

2193
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:47,660
I think there's a battle in the biblical
stories all the way through between love

2194
01:52:47,661 --> 01:52:50,090
and truth in terms of their primacy and 
so,

2195
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:53,480
and I've gone to contrasted lot on truth
in my own thinking,

2196
01:52:53,481 --> 01:52:56,420
but I,
and it's hard to talk about love because

2197
01:52:56,421 --> 01:52:58,340
it's a word that people have mouth to 
death,

2198
01:52:58,370 --> 01:53:03,370
you know,
as soon as you start talking about love 

2199
01:53:03,370 --> 01:53:03,560
than people should just go into a 
different room and listened to you,

2200
01:53:03,561 --> 01:53:04,300
you know,
because it,

2201
01:53:04,301 --> 01:53:09,301
it gets,
it can get sappy and new age just like 

2202
01:53:09,301 --> 01:53:09,920
that.
And I don't like that at all,

2203
01:53:09,921 --> 01:53:14,921
but,
but it's still something that has to be 

2204
01:53:14,921 --> 01:53:14,921
contended with.
And I think.

2205
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:17,360
So I've been trying to conceptualize,
let's say,

2206
01:53:17,361 --> 01:53:20,210
what this covenant might might 
constitute.

2207
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,360
And I think the love part.
So here's this.

2208
01:53:23,361 --> 01:53:26,960
So you know,
there's this book by Girtha called Faust

2209
01:53:26,961 --> 01:53:30,740
and it's in two volumes.
First one in to logically enough.

2210
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:33,290
One was written much later than the 
other hand.

2211
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:37,510
Faust basically sells his soul to the 
devil for,

2212
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:42,550
for knowledge.
And the devil in faust is 

2213
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:44,891
Mephistopheles.
And Mephistopheles is quite a well 

2214
01:53:44,891 --> 01:53:46,880
developed character and Gert that has 
mephistopheles save what he's about,

2215
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:51,770
which is really quite cool.
So it's like the adversary of the world,

2216
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:55,340
evil itself gets a chance to speak and 
make its case.

2217
01:53:55,610 --> 01:54:00,610
And [inaudible] thought this was so 
important that he actually had 

2218
01:54:00,610 --> 01:54:02,921
mephistopheles announced himself once in
faust one and then using the same words 

2219
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:06,740
you phrase differently again in part 
two.

2220
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:08,930
It really struck me.
It really struck me.

2221
01:54:08,931 --> 01:54:13,931
And so what Mephistopheles says is that 
the world is such a charter house of 

2222
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:20,570
suffering and destruction that it would 
be better if it never existed.

2223
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:26,590
And so that what he's working to is to 
bring existence to an end because it is 

2224
01:54:27,201 --> 01:54:30,920
not justified by it's suffering.
It's like that's.

2225
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:34,790
It's an argument very similar to the 
argument that's made by Ivan.

2226
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:37,860
Camera.
Camera.

2227
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:41,230
Thank you.
Thank Russians.

2228
01:54:41,231 --> 01:54:46,231
A.
You can't pronounce them or live with 

2229
01:54:46,231 --> 01:54:46,231
them.
You can,

2230
01:54:46,231 --> 01:54:48,800
but he basically,
he's an atheist and does a very good job

2231
01:54:48,801 --> 01:54:53,801
of detailing out the atheist argument or
maybe an anti theist argument and he's 

2232
01:54:53,801 --> 01:54:55,800
arguing with his.
His brother Alioscha,

2233
01:54:55,900 --> 01:55:00,900
who's a monitor monastic novitiate,
who was a very good guy but not an 

2234
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:04,361
intellect,
Ivan's an intellect and a very powerful 

2235
01:55:04,361 --> 01:55:06,000
one,
and he basically tells Lee Osha that the

2236
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:09,050
all of the cosmos isn't worth the 
suffering of one child.

2237
01:55:09,051 --> 01:55:14,051
He tells this story about this and this 
Dostoevsky took this from a newspaper 

2238
01:55:14,051 --> 01:55:17,651
about this parents that lost their four 
year old daughter and an outhouse 

2239
01:55:17,651 --> 01:55:22,061
overnight,
and she screamed about it until she 

2240
01:55:22,061 --> 01:55:22,061
froze to death.

2241
01:55:22,061 --> 01:55:25,930
And so Dostoevsky used that argument.
He tied that into Ivan's anti theist 

2242
01:55:25,930 --> 01:55:27,650
argument against Lee Osha.
It's very,

2243
01:55:27,651 --> 01:55:32,651
very powerful argument.
The brothers Karamazov is an absolutely 

2244
01:55:32,651 --> 01:55:33,560
mind boggling,
amazing book.

2245
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,840
I would highly recommend it.
Um,

2246
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:40,400
and so that's the Mephistopheles and 
perspective Mr Feeley and prospection.

2247
01:55:40,401 --> 01:55:43,000
It's perspective is that being itself is
so corrupted,

2248
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:46,020
shouldn't exist.
So then you think,

2249
01:55:46,021 --> 01:55:47,940
okay,
well that's fair enough.

2250
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,340
That's a decent argument.
It's understandable,

2251
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:54,570
but the problem comes when you try to 
implement that and what happens when you

2252
01:55:54,571 --> 01:55:56,130
implement it,
as far as I can tell,

2253
01:55:56,131 --> 01:56:01,131
you adopt out messed emphasis,
Ophelia and attitude of bitterness and 

2254
01:56:01,131 --> 01:56:04,251
resentment and destruction is that you 
make all the suffering that you're 

2255
01:56:04,251 --> 01:56:07,221
complaining about far worse and I think 
that's what happened at the base of 

2256
01:56:07,221 --> 01:56:11,751
things in the 20th century,
is that there was a powerful movement 

2257
01:56:11,751 --> 01:56:14,250
among human humanity to bring being 
itself to a halt.

2258
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:18,370
You know what culminated in the 
development of the hydrogen bomb and the

2259
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:23,390
high probability for many,
many periods of time that we were going 

2260
01:56:23,390 --> 01:56:26,850
to do something permanent and fatal,
which seems like a bad idea.

2261
01:56:26,851 --> 01:56:28,190
It seems like a bad idea.
Well,

2262
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:33,200
so what's the opposite of the myth,
Ophelia and attitude and I think the 

2263
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:36,621
opposite of that is what's presented in 
the biblical stories in the guise of 

2264
01:56:36,621 --> 01:56:41,001
love and that is the wish that things 
would be good.

2265
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:44,490
It's something like that.
That's what love is,

2266
01:56:44,491 --> 01:56:49,491
I think,
is that it's the attempt to orient 

2267
01:56:49,491 --> 01:56:51,741
yourself towards making things better 
and it's predicated on something like a 

2268
01:56:51,741 --> 01:56:56,400
deep appreciation for being deaf despite
its suffering and deficiencies and maybe

2269
01:56:56,791 --> 01:57:01,791
a decision that you're going to act to 
bring about things to move things 

2270
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:06,591
towards the good.
And I think that's the thing that sets 

2271
01:57:06,591 --> 01:57:06,650
the parameters of the,
of them.

2272
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:11,690
It's,
it's the opposite of the Memphis to and 

2273
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:12,390
attitude.
It's like to work towards the betterment

2274
01:57:12,391 --> 01:57:17,391
of being because you've decided that 
you're going to open your heart to 

2275
01:57:17,391 --> 01:57:17,391
existence,
something like that.

2276
01:57:17,391 --> 01:57:20,010
And it's within that framework that 
truth takes place,

2277
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:23,270
I think is truth has to serve something 
kicked in.

2278
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:28,280
True conserve truth,
but it has to be bounded inside 

2279
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:31,101
something.
And I think that's what it's bounded 

2280
01:57:31,101 --> 01:57:31,101
inside.
So

2281
01:57:31,101 --> 01:57:32,380
what I was going to refer to it that was
um,

2282
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:34,440
David Hawkins,
royal power versus force,

2283
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:37,680
and he put it on a quantifiable scale.
All different emotions.

2284
01:57:37,681 --> 01:57:40,920
He called a consciousness.
Any put love at 528 hertz.

2285
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:46,400
He put shame at 20.
I'm not sure if I've got these 100 

2286
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:46,400
percent right.
I'm guilty,

2287
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:50,871
I think at 30 fear at 50 and it shows 
you how far the people who are really 

2288
01:57:50,871 --> 01:57:54,921
knocked down have to get to love and I'm
thinking if we could quantify love on a 

2289
01:57:54,921 --> 01:57:59,391
term,
it means different things to everybody 

2290
01:57:59,391 --> 01:58:01,311
and rightly so,
but can we get to that frequency and if 

2291
01:58:01,311 --> 01:58:02,190
you look at the Solfeggio notes,
you know the musical notes.

2292
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:04,220
Have you heard?
I'm afraid of.

2293
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:09,280
I'm going to.
I'm going to ask you to stop if you 

2294
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:09,280
want,
because I should.

2295
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:09,980
I should go to another question if you.
Thank you very much.

2296
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:11,400
Okay.
Let's,

2297
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:24,500
so you've been an educator through the 
rise of the smartphone and my question 

2298
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:27,240
basically relates to procrastination and
task delay,

2299
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:32,720
needless task delay specifically and 
given the unprecedented level of 

2300
01:58:32,881 --> 01:58:35,040
distraction that we have in today's 
world.

2301
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:40,190
I just wanted to get your perspective 
from a psychological standpoint on other

2302
01:58:40,261 --> 01:58:45,261
than cleaning your damn room,
what would you suggest to a student 

2303
01:58:45,261 --> 01:58:48,751
who's looking to overcome these lands?
Well,

2304
01:58:49,181 --> 01:58:52,300
I think with any,
let's call it addictive process,

2305
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:55,750
mean emails powerfully.
Addictive,

2306
01:58:55,751 --> 01:58:56,930
right?
Partly it's a,

2307
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:59,260
it's a slot machine and I mean that 
technically,

2308
01:58:59,261 --> 01:59:04,261
so when you pull,
that's a variable ratio reinforcement 

2309
01:59:04,261 --> 01:59:04,570
schedule,
if I remember correctly,

2310
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:09,610
and it's very addictive because if you 
pull on the slot machine arm enough,

2311
01:59:09,611 --> 01:59:14,611
you will win and you never know which 
pole will reward you and so not only is 

2312
01:59:17,081 --> 01:59:21,040
that addictive,
it's very hard to extinguish that and so

2313
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:27,570
emails like that because there's always 
something beckoning and now and then 

2314
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:30,601
it's a jackpot and social media is like 
that because you know people are posting

2315
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:35,860
interesting things and so well,
how do you overcome an addictive process

2316
01:59:35,861 --> 01:59:39,070
and partly you do it by replacing it 
with something better,

2317
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:40,390
right?

2318
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:44,440
So when people study drug and alcohol 
use,

2319
01:59:44,441 --> 01:59:48,280
they often make an elementary mistake,
which is to try to figure out why people

2320
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:49,960
use drugs and alcohol.
Now it's,

2321
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:55,140
that's not a smart thing to wonder.
We know why people use cocaine.

2322
01:59:56,590 --> 02:00:01,590
Cocaine directly stimulates the systems 
that produce positive emotion,

2323
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:04,150
so like,
so there's no mystery there.

2324
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:06,670
The mystery with cocaine is very,
very simple.

2325
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:09,730
Why don't people take cocaine all the 
time until they die?

2326
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:14,970
That's the mystery really.
Because you can get isolated rats to do 

2327
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:14,970
that.
So and,

2328
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:19,760
and for some people alcohol has the same
kind of effect except it's mediated by 

2329
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:24,031
opiates,
but often what people have to do to get 

2330
02:00:24,031 --> 02:00:27,241
themselves out of an addictive process 
is to find something better to do to 

2331
02:00:27,241 --> 02:00:30,991
replace it.
And so I would say the problem with the 

2332
02:00:30,991 --> 02:00:34,291
gadgets,
and I mean there are amazing things is 

2333
02:00:34,291 --> 02:00:36,781
that they interfere with the proximately
interfere with medium to longterm goals 

2334
02:00:38,890 --> 02:00:39,580
I would say.

2335
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:44,880
And so I think the first thing you have 
to do to bring them under control is 

2336
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:46,090
figuring out what it is that they're 
used is interfering with.

2337
02:00:46,091 --> 02:00:47,540
It has to be something important,
right?

2338
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:50,260
So you think,
well I want to do something important.

2339
02:00:50,630 --> 02:00:52,120
What is that?
Oh,

2340
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:54,460
it could be personal.
Maybe you want to have a relationship.

2341
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:56,590
You want to get married,
you want to have kids,

2342
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:58,930
you want to have a career that's 
meaningful.

2343
02:00:58,931 --> 02:01:03,931
You know you want to have a life,
you want to have an abrahamic adventure 

2344
02:01:03,931 --> 02:01:04,240
and be the father of nations,
let's say,

2345
02:01:04,241 --> 02:01:09,241
well,
you can't be ratting away on your cell 

2346
02:01:09,241 --> 02:01:09,241
phone and doing that.
And so I think,

2347
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:14,340
I think part of it is to set your sights
high ed and make a plan and figure out 

2348
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:20,101
who you could be and see if obsessive 
utilization of smartphone fits into that

2349
02:01:21,671 --> 02:01:23,980
vision of nobility.
And it will,

2350
02:01:23,981 --> 02:01:27,430
partly because there are unbelievably 
powerful communication devices.

2351
02:01:27,431 --> 02:01:29,380
But so,
so often it's,

2352
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:34,480
it's for lack of something better to do 
and it also interferes.

2353
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,940
So that's about the best I can do with 
that.

2354
02:01:45,930 --> 02:01:46,900
So,
uh,

2355
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:52,150
you've been,
you've been talking with some of the 

2356
02:01:52,150 --> 02:01:55,091
conservative candidates for leadership 
this year on know you talked with most 

2357
02:01:55,091 --> 02:01:55,280
all of them,
right?

2358
02:01:55,370 --> 02:01:57,280
Not all of them,
but a number of them.

2359
02:01:57,810 --> 02:01:59,150
You talked with Andrew though,
right?

2360
02:01:59,151 --> 02:01:59,780
Yes,
I did.

2361
02:01:59,781 --> 02:02:01,080
Yes.
So I'm,

2362
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:04,700
so something very interesting popped up 
in my facebook feed.

2363
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:08,660
So it was a ad for the Conservative 
Party and um,

2364
02:02:08,661 --> 02:02:13,661
it was suggesting that we a cut cut 
funding to public universities that 

2365
02:02:15,021 --> 02:02:18,260
don't support free speech.
And that was probably my fault.

2366
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,900
Yeah.
See precisely because,

2367
02:02:20,901 --> 02:02:25,040
because this is something you say in 
some of your wild or moments you suggest

2368
02:02:25,041 --> 02:02:30,041
that we should cut the university's 
funding by 25 percent and let them 

2369
02:02:30,041 --> 02:02:32,720
battle it out for the remains and he's 
taken that to,

2370
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:33,650
you know,
his,

2371
02:02:33,651 --> 02:02:37,520
his platform.
But now what you're doing is a will your

2372
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:39,140
will.
One of the things you're doing is you've

2373
02:02:39,141 --> 02:02:41,180
created this website,
um,

2374
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:45,020
that identifies a,
the postmodern lexicon and helps people.

2375
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:49,460
I'm a distinguished between a postmodern
courses and not.

2376
02:02:49,461 --> 02:02:52,430
And so people don't take them or take 
them if they want.

2377
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:55,650
Yeah.
So that's it.

2378
02:02:55,970 --> 02:03:00,970
It'd be interesting to know,
like what sort of malevolent 

2379
02:03:00,970 --> 02:03:03,290
postmodernist just study you 
meticulously and try to use all your,

2380
02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:06,110
uh,
knowledge of it anyway.

2381
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:06,830
So,
but,

2382
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:11,860
but what you've said though,
you said that what we need to do is 

2383
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:11,860
starve it out from the source.

2384
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:13,920
Yeah.
That look.

2385
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:15,190
So when.
Yeah,

2386
02:03:15,191 --> 02:03:16,280
I do.
I know where you're going.

2387
02:03:16,281 --> 02:03:18,980
So about two weeks ago,
three weeks ago,

2388
02:03:18,981 --> 02:03:22,070
I went up to northern Saskatchewan.
My parents have a cottage up there.

2389
02:03:22,071 --> 02:03:23,750
It's way the hell out in the middle of 
nowhere.

2390
02:03:24,170 --> 02:03:26,030
And there,
there's no cell phone,

2391
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:29,750
although we do have internet now,
which is probably add in good.

2392
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:32,120
But anyways,
I got to take a bit of a break,

2393
02:03:32,121 --> 02:03:37,121
which was good because I haven't really 
been able to think more broadly about w 

2394
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:40,610
say what I'm doing because who the hell 
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

2395
02:03:40,611 --> 02:03:41,630
Exactly.
This is a,

2396
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:45,680
this is all very strange and,
but,

2397
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:47,930
but one thing I thought about,
I was out on the lake,

2398
02:03:47,931 --> 02:03:51,920
I was canoeing around and I thought I'd 
thought about war.

2399
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:54,860
No,
because I was very irritated.

2400
02:03:55,400 --> 02:04:00,400
I'm very irritated about what's happened
to the universities and there's a hint 

2401
02:04:00,471 --> 02:04:05,471
of malevolence about it and I,
I'm not a fan of ideological possession 

2402
02:04:05,471 --> 02:04:10,300
and I've been set back up on my heels a 
lot over the last eight months by the,

2403
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:17,520
the onslaught of what emerged when I 
said that there was words I wouldn't 

2404
02:04:18,381 --> 02:04:18,830
say.

2405
02:04:19,550 --> 02:04:23,960
And so it's put me into a defensive 
posture,

2406
02:04:23,961 --> 02:04:27,290
let's say.
And I have been thinking in terms of war

2407
02:04:27,291 --> 02:04:28,430
metaphors,
you know,

2408
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:34,270
like this is a battleground and that 
there's a war going on an ideological 

2409
02:04:34,491 --> 02:04:37,010
war.
And I do believe that that's,

2410
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:42,650
but then I was reading and I did this 
partly for this course,

2411
02:04:43,681 --> 02:04:48,681
I was reading the sermon on the mount 
and one of the things it says is resist 

2412
02:04:48,681 --> 02:04:51,120
not evil and I don't know what to make 
about line.

2413
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:56,720
And so I was talking to a bunch of 
people about it and reading about it a 

2414
02:04:56,720 --> 02:04:56,970
lot and trying to figure out what it 
meant.

2415
02:04:56,971 --> 02:04:59,190
And partly what it means is don't waste 
time,

2416
02:05:00,210 --> 02:05:05,210
right?
Because when you fighting against 

2417
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:05,210
something then there's something else 
you're not doing.

2418
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:07,050
And then I thought also when I was out 
there on the lake,

2419
02:05:07,051 --> 02:05:12,051
I thought,
well do I really want to be in a war 

2420
02:05:12,051 --> 02:05:12,051
because war.
That's not,

2421
02:05:12,051 --> 02:05:12,660
that's not,
that's not,

2422
02:05:13,650 --> 02:05:16,140
that's not heaven,
that's for sure.

2423
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:18,420
It's really stressful and people get 
hurt.

2424
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:24,410
And so I thought,
well maybe that's just the wrong way of 

2425
02:05:24,410 --> 02:05:24,600
thinking about it even though there's a 
battleground issue here.

2426
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:27,840
And I thought,
well wait a second,

2427
02:05:27,841 --> 02:05:32,841
maybe,
maybe the right thing to do in a 

2428
02:05:32,841 --> 02:05:35,301
situation like this.
And this is maybe something that those 

2429
02:05:35,301 --> 02:05:36,090
on the alt right might consider.
Is that

2430
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:41,100
the right thing to do?
Maybe is to outline a better way

2431
02:05:42,730 --> 02:05:44,980
rather than go out directly on the 
attack.

2432
02:05:44,981 --> 02:05:49,981
Now that might be seem somewhat at odds 
with my idea of the website and perhaps 

2433
02:05:50,081 --> 02:05:51,640
it is somewhat at odds with that.
I'm.

2434
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:56,910
I'm not sure about that,
but what I'm trying to do instead of 

2435
02:05:56,910 --> 02:06:01,290
conducting this like a war,
let's say is two conducted like a 

2436
02:06:01,290 --> 02:06:04,900
movement towards something better and 
that would be better.

2437
02:06:04,901 --> 02:06:07,600
Now with regards to cutting the 
university's funding.

2438
02:06:07,601 --> 02:06:09,760
I thought about that too and I thought,
wait a second.

2439
02:06:09,761 --> 02:06:14,761
That's not gonna work out because it's 
inviting political interference into 

2440
02:06:14,761 --> 02:06:18,661
higher education.
Now the political interference might be 

2441
02:06:18,661 --> 02:06:22,171
over the counter balancing kind because 
the evidence that the humanities in 

2442
02:06:22,171 --> 02:06:25,831
particular have tilted almost 100 
percent to the left is overwhelming and 

2443
02:06:25,831 --> 02:06:30,451
so maybe some counter balance from the 
right would set things more towards the 

2444
02:06:30,451 --> 02:06:34,831
middle,
but the problem is is when you open up 

2445
02:06:34,831 --> 02:06:35,650
the door to political interference with 
higher education content,

2446
02:06:35,651 --> 02:06:37,690
you can't close the door again.

2447
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:43,620
And so on reflection,
I thought that it probably was a sub 

2448
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:46,790
optimal idea and that would be better.
Instead was to and what are,

2449
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:48,640
this is what I want to do.
When I launched the website,

2450
02:06:48,641 --> 02:06:51,220
I want to ask students,
the students who will be using it.

2451
02:06:51,221 --> 02:06:52,840
It's like,
what do you want from university?

2452
02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:54,280
Because here's,
here's your options.

2453
02:06:54,281 --> 02:06:59,281
You can.
You can come out ideologically 

2454
02:06:59,281 --> 02:06:59,281
possessed,
right?

2455
02:06:59,281 --> 02:07:03,130
You can buy this doctrine is 
pathological doctrine and you can become

2456
02:07:03,131 --> 02:07:08,131
bitter and resentful and you won't learn
to communicate properly and you won't 

2457
02:07:08,131 --> 02:07:11,560
read the great works of civilization and
you won't learn to think and write.

2458
02:07:11,710 --> 02:07:14,800
You won't become knowable in body and 
spirit.

2459
02:07:17,310 --> 02:07:19,440
Is that what you want?
Or do you want the opposite?

2460
02:07:19,441 --> 02:07:24,441
Do you want a real education?
And then I want to explain what that 

2461
02:07:24,441 --> 02:07:27,651
means like I did tonight to some degree.
You know that there's absolute value in 

2462
02:07:27,651 --> 02:07:31,430
learning how to put yourself together 
and to communicate and to familiarize 

2463
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:31,430
yourself with,
with,

2464
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:35,070
with the classic works of civilization.
And I want to offer that.

2465
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:38,410
I want to do what I can to offer that as
the proper alternative.

2466
02:07:38,411 --> 02:07:43,030
Instead of staying in school winston,
this notion of a battle which is just,

2467
02:07:43,450 --> 02:07:45,220
I just don't think it's the right 
metaphor.

2468
02:07:45,730 --> 02:07:50,730
So either in Dr Peterson.
I just want to say that I think what 

2469
02:07:50,730 --> 02:07:52,240
you're doing is absolutely miraculous.
It's helps change my life.

2470
02:07:52,550 --> 02:07:57,550
Sure.
At least raise your hand if Dr Peterson 

2471
02:07:57,550 --> 02:07:59,900
has helped change your life.
So for the better or for the worse,

2472
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:02,830
asked him to look.
Well,

2473
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:04,790
it's about,
it's about 40 people maybe.

2474
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:06,020
And that's miraculous

2475
02:08:06,830 --> 02:08:09,630
and I think in your thinking is going to
be.

2476
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:15,020
It's going to be,
it's gonna be all over the place in the 

2477
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:18,020
Canadian election in two years and I 
think that that's a horrible thing to 

2478
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:18,020
say.

2479
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:20,940
You better watch out for it buddy and 
uni and,

2480
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:21,480
and,

2481
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:24,850
and there's,
there's gonna be a lot of talk about how

2482
02:08:24,851 --> 02:08:26,380
um,
how,

2483
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:31,440
how Andrew Scheer's a political message 
is going to stem from yours.

2484
02:08:32,321 --> 02:08:34,420
And I think it's really important that 
he,

2485
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:40,140
he doesn't censor himself like other 
conservative politicians are doing and 

2486
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:44,580
because I don't know,
we need to unite under a valid,

2487
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:47,440
thoughtful,
articulate,

2488
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:49,540
conservative voice.
And what do we have now?

2489
02:08:49,590 --> 02:08:51,070
We have,
we have trump,

2490
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:52,600
that's what's,
you know,

2491
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:57,250
we don't have any,
we don't have any strong articulate male

2492
02:08:57,251 --> 02:08:59,020
voices in our,
in our,

2493
02:08:59,021 --> 02:09:00,910
um,
in our political discourse right now.

2494
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:01,810
That's what it feels different.

2495
02:09:01,850 --> 02:09:04,120
Only time for you to develop one.

2496
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:07,090
So it looks like you're on the right 
path.

2497
02:09:08,660 --> 02:09:12,640
Thanks.
Hello

2498
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:18,660
Peterson,
thank you for everything you've done 

2499
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:18,660
this past year and I do mean everything,
the political stuff,

2500
02:09:19,530 --> 02:09:21,470
lecture series,
so it gets you to move just to.

2501
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:22,980
Yes.
Great.

2502
02:09:23,010 --> 02:09:24,030
Belted out man.

2503
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:24,960
Okay.
So,

2504
02:09:24,961 --> 02:09:26,160
uh,
I'll try to be succinct.

2505
02:09:26,161 --> 02:09:28,820
I have two comments on one question.
First Common,

2506
02:09:28,821 --> 02:09:33,821
as you mentioned,
how you were prevented from uploading 

2507
02:09:33,821 --> 02:09:33,821
your youtube video from last week.
Um,

2508
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:36,360
I actually attended that lecture and I 
make pretty detailed notes.

2509
02:09:36,361 --> 02:09:38,010
So if you want maybe I can email you.

2510
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:39,190
It's okay.
I've got it.

2511
02:09:39,191 --> 02:09:41,660
It's my accounts reinstalled.
Reinstall,

2512
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:45,970
reinstall restored.
Yeah.

2513
02:09:45,971 --> 02:09:47,860
And so it's okay.
It's okay.

2514
02:09:47,861 --> 02:09:52,861
It's,
it's straightened out and I'm going to 

2515
02:09:52,861 --> 02:09:54,780
upload all the videos to a bunch of 
other sites and so this isn't going to 

2516
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:54,780
happen again.
So.

2517
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:55,450
But I appreciate that.

2518
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:57,960
Some lectures and I do want to get them 
online.

2519
02:09:57,961 --> 02:09:59,850
Yeah.
My second comment is about,

2520
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:04,860
um,
sort of kind of going into the 

2521
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:08,121
commentaries of Christian theology is 
over over the centuries are like you've 

2522
02:10:08,121 --> 02:10:08,121
known yourself.
Um,

2523
02:10:08,121 --> 02:10:12,920
I just would like to encourage everybody
to also look at not just western 

2524
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:14,820
Christianity but also eastern 
Christianity,

2525
02:10:14,821 --> 02:10:17,970
like the Orthodox writing's a,
there's a big difference between the two

2526
02:10:17,971 --> 02:10:22,971
in that the western sort of theology 
comes out of the Roman Roman law,

2527
02:10:24,270 --> 02:10:29,270
Roman justice.
So there's a lot more of an emphasis on 

2528
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:29,270
can adjust the sin.
Christ came,

2529
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:32,370
he died on the cross for our sin.
So there's that look kind of like legal,

2530
02:10:32,610 --> 02:10:34,300
a payback.
Do you know what I mean?

2531
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:37,790
Whereas the eastern,
the eastern theology is a lot more,

2532
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:43,180
um,
it's focused a lot more in love and on 

2533
02:10:43,180 --> 02:10:43,860
sort of the,
uh,

2534
02:10:43,861 --> 02:10:45,200
the positive aspects.

2535
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:50,440
And if you do read like the first four 
centuries of Christianity where there 

2536
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:50,440
was no schism,
uh,

2537
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:54,080
there's very little mention of a,
sort of a legalistic frame where it gets

2538
02:10:54,081 --> 02:10:55,890
a lot more,
I don't know,

2539
02:10:55,891 --> 02:10:58,880
a prosaic are more heartfelt.
I guess.

2540
02:10:58,910 --> 02:11:01,490
So I think it's important that we also 
in the West,

2541
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:04,520
look at the eastern counterpart,
um,

2542
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:09,820
especially more so now because I,
I do perceive a lot of fake love as 

2543
02:11:09,891 --> 02:11:12,740
being at the center of this my level and
said you mentioned so like,

2544
02:11:12,741 --> 02:11:17,741
you know,
this whole thing about I'm demonizing 

2545
02:11:17,741 --> 02:11:20,321
the opposition saying that they're,
they're heartless to have no love this 

2546
02:11:20,321 --> 02:11:21,080
and that.
I perceived that as a lot of fake love.

2547
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:24,350
Um,
and I think that we have to keep in mind

2548
02:11:24,351 --> 02:11:26,420
what true love is.
Sometimes it looks ugly.

2549
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:28,490
Like in dealing with psychiatric 
patients,

2550
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:31,850
maybe like other countries are not as 
liberal as Canada,

2551
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:34,100
but the of results a lot more often 
units.

2552
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:36,260
There's as many psychiatric patients on 
the road,

2553
02:11:36,261 --> 02:11:38,120
for example,
in Greece where I'm from.

2554
02:11:38,540 --> 02:11:41,990
So yeah,
that was kind of my comment that we need

2555
02:11:41,991 --> 02:11:43,910
to focus a little more on what real love
is,

2556
02:11:43,911 --> 02:11:45,050
I think,
and not just the,

2557
02:11:45,051 --> 02:11:50,051
uh,
the kind of love that he put on a scale 

2558
02:11:50,051 --> 02:11:50,051
because I don't think that he can put 
love on a scale.

2559
02:11:50,051 --> 02:11:51,670
So I've been talking to some of,
you know,

2560
02:11:51,671 --> 02:11:56,671
to this Guy Jonathan Palio,
who's an Orthodox carver and he started 

2561
02:11:56,671 --> 02:12:00,811
a youtube channel and he's talking a lot
about Orthodox issues and I'm pretty 

2562
02:12:00,811 --> 02:12:02,440
ignorant when it comes to Orthodox 
Christianity,

2563
02:12:03,310 --> 02:12:08,310
but from what I understand of it so far,
there's plenty to be learned.

2564
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:09,580
So yeah,

2565
02:12:10,050 --> 02:12:13,860
I more than myself just recently came 
back to my faith two years ago.

2566
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:16,620
Basically that was the original 
Christianity.

2567
02:12:16,621 --> 02:12:20,510
Then there was a schism of 1054 in 
between East and west because of the,

2568
02:12:21,690 --> 02:12:25,470
the conflicts that these new 
Christianity Christians have a pope.

2569
02:12:25,650 --> 02:12:30,650
And then after that you also had the 
schism internally within the West 

2570
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:31,170
between Catholicism and,
and the Protestants.

2571
02:12:31,290 --> 02:12:34,950
So that's kind of like the big 
difference said at Christianity actually

2572
02:12:34,951 --> 02:12:39,951
came from the east.
So I think that's why it's important 

2573
02:12:39,951 --> 02:12:42,561
that we look at demos ancient times 
because those were the ones that are 

2574
02:12:42,561 --> 02:12:42,840
closest to the original message.
Um,

2575
02:12:42,870 --> 02:12:45,200
so not my question,
um,

2576
02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:52,210
it's about atheism.
You might hear a lot of times people 

2577
02:12:52,210 --> 02:12:55,611
criticizing anybody that has any sort of
belief in a deity or a God that you're 

2578
02:12:56,161 --> 02:12:58,320
just somebody that has an imaginary 
friend,

2579
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:00,230
you know,
like the,

2580
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:03,810
the heavenly father that you have to 
adhere to,

2581
02:13:04,020 --> 02:13:08,210
that you have no world of your own.
So then there's also like,

2582
02:13:08,310 --> 02:13:11,460
what are the counter argument be that,
okay,

2583
02:13:11,461 --> 02:13:14,880
so if I have a good relationship with my
father and that's why I'm more likely to

2584
02:13:14,881 --> 02:13:17,340
accept a higher degree than I could ever
be,

2585
02:13:17,341 --> 02:13:19,590
that you as an atheist,
um,

2586
02:13:19,950 --> 02:13:23,880
maybe you have conflict with your father
and that's why you're an adverse to kind

2587
02:13:23,881 --> 02:13:27,030
of submitting to a higher being that 
I'm,

2588
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:29,740
the kind of dictates your life while 
you're,

2589
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:33,630
you're attempting a psychoanalysis of 
atheism,

2590
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:34,670
you know,
and,

2591
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:38,910
and there's many factors that go into 
atheism.

2592
02:13:39,290 --> 02:13:44,290
Um,
I would say that you could make that 

2593
02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:44,850
case in some situations,
but not in all.

2594
02:13:45,190 --> 02:13:47,100
Um,
I do think though,

2595
02:13:47,430 --> 02:13:50,520
and I think this is perhaps where your 
question is stemming from,

2596
02:13:50,521 --> 02:13:55,521
is that it's no fluke that at the same 
time that one of the consequences of the

2597
02:14:00,781 --> 02:14:05,781
death of God that Nietzsche announced 
back in the late 18 hundreds is the all 

2598
02:14:05,781 --> 02:14:09,000
out assault on masculinity that's 
occurring in our culture now.

2599
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:14,930
And those things are associated and I do
think that does have to do with a lack 

2600
02:14:15,001 --> 02:14:20,001
of faith in the masculine spirit.
And that's a very bad thing because 

2601
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:25,140
what's a bad thing for everyone 
obviously because women have a partially

2602
02:14:25,141 --> 02:14:28,410
masculine spirit and they have to put up
with men.

2603
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:32,940
And so to demolish that or to fail to 
nurture it,

2604
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:37,941
which is certainly what's occurring is 
just a pathway to absolute disaster.

2605
02:14:38,850 --> 02:14:40,460
So.
Yup.

2606
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:49,410
Peterson.
So this is the type of question that you

2607
02:14:49,411 --> 02:14:51,630
hate because it's in the category of 
why,

2608
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:54,070
why you believe what you believe.
And uh,

2609
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:56,250
it's a type of question that makes you 
say,

2610
02:14:56,251 --> 02:15:01,251
if I have it right from the last time,
what the hell makes you think it's any 

2611
02:15:01,251 --> 02:15:01,340
of your business on?
Okay.

2612
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:05,490
Try to frame it properly.
And I'm asking this lecture 10 of 12 and

2613
02:15:05,491 --> 02:15:08,100
after having listened to quite a few 
hours of you year and elsewhere,

2614
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:11,520
and so in your second interview with 
transluminal media,

2615
02:15:11,521 --> 02:15:13,470
you lay out a few things.
I have some quotes here,

2616
02:15:13,471 --> 02:15:18,471
I'll skip them for brevity.
You get to the point where you're 

2617
02:15:18,471 --> 02:15:20,310
discussing the embodiment of the logos 
by Christ as a historical figure,

2618
02:15:20,910 --> 02:15:22,650
and then you say,
quote,

2619
02:15:22,710 --> 02:15:26,190
is this resurrection real?
Did his body resurrect?

2620
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:29,110
I don't know.
In today's lecture you,

2621
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:34,200
you,
you alluded to the fact that there are 

2622
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:34,200
states of consciousness that perhaps we 
don't know how to access anymore,

2623
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:36,250
and let's say that I'm with you there.

2624
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:41,270
Let's say I'm with the idea that there 
are unknown or unknown ways to get 

2625
02:15:41,270 --> 02:15:44,151
intimations of the divine.
That the embodiment of the logos is 

2626
02:15:44,151 --> 02:15:44,390
associated with physiological 
transformations,

2627
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:49,850
the upper limits of which are unknown 
and that we might currently classify as 

2628
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:53,271
paranormal.
But to dump it right back down to my 

2629
02:15:53,271 --> 02:15:55,941
level,
I'm asking about the guy commonly 

2630
02:15:55,941 --> 02:15:58,370
depicted with long hair nailed to a 
cross until that is a door knob and all 

2631
02:15:58,370 --> 02:16:02,481
of this goes to the heart of the 
question of literalism and religious 

2632
02:16:02,481 --> 02:16:03,330
interpretation.
It goes to the heart of what we're doing

2633
02:16:03,331 --> 02:16:08,331
here at this lecture series.
Are we examining the psychological 

2634
02:16:08,331 --> 02:16:11,151
significance of these stories?
Are we entertaining the possibility of 

2635
02:16:11,151 --> 02:16:11,730
these fantastical events?
I might be struggling with the concept,

2636
02:16:11,731 --> 02:16:15,900
but I haven't been able to square away 
and reconcile those statements by you.

2637
02:16:15,901 --> 02:16:20,901
So the question is on the,
on the question of the resurrection of 

2638
02:16:20,901 --> 02:16:21,690
Christ.
Why is your answer to your own question?

2639
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:24,150
I don't know.
Instead of at the very least,

2640
02:16:24,330 --> 02:16:25,080
probably not.

2641
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:35,750
Well,
you're definitely right about me hating 

2642
02:16:35,750 --> 02:16:37,591
that question.
Well,

2643
02:16:42,221 --> 02:16:46,390
I called this series the psychological 
significance of the biblical stories for

2644
02:16:46,391 --> 02:16:47,370
a reason.
You know,

2645
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:52,440
and the reason was that I'm partially 
qualified to talk about such things.

2646
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:00,840
When I step outside of that,
then I'm not where I should be.

2647
02:17:04,670 --> 02:17:09,670
I don't think that.
See,

2648
02:17:11,671 --> 02:17:14,670
I don't think that this is.
I'm not going to get this right.

2649
02:17:14,671 --> 02:17:19,671
I can't get the words exactly right.
This isn't about what I believe 

2650
02:17:19,671 --> 02:17:23,481
personally.
It's partly because I don't know what I 

2651
02:17:23,481 --> 02:17:24,060
believe.
I don't know what I believe.

2652
02:17:24,450 --> 02:17:29,450
The world's a very strange place.
I've had some very strange experiences 

2653
02:17:29,450 --> 02:17:32,991
in it.
I don't think it's helpful for me to 

2654
02:17:32,991 --> 02:17:36,890
step outside my jurisdiction and 
speculate precisely.

2655
02:17:37,820 --> 02:17:42,820
The easiest thing would be to say,
I think I said,

2656
02:17:44,871 --> 02:17:49,871
but I had to say today,
I don't think that we know what the 

2657
02:17:49,871 --> 02:17:52,380
upper limits of human possibility are.
I don't know what that means.

2658
02:17:52,381 --> 02:17:55,170
Metaphysically.
What I do understand from the gospels is

2659
02:17:55,171 --> 02:18:00,171
that even the accounts of Christ's 
resurrection are complex and difficult 

2660
02:18:00,171 --> 02:18:00,480
to understand.

2661
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:08,130
I think from reading you in large part 
that you can make a very strong case for

2662
02:18:08,531 --> 02:18:11,110
the symbolic meaning of the death and 
resurrection.

2663
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:16,140
I think it does stand for the capacity 
of the human logos to die and resurrect 

2664
02:18:16,181 --> 02:18:21,181
continually as it strives upward.
I'm not willing to say that that's all 

2665
02:18:21,761 --> 02:18:26,761
it means because I don't know what 
everything means and I don't know about 

2666
02:18:28,451 --> 02:18:30,910
the fundamental metaphysics of being 
like.

2667
02:18:30,911 --> 02:18:35,911
I do believe that it's accurate to 
construe being as a battle ground 

2668
02:18:35,911 --> 02:18:37,240
between good and evil.
I believe that.

2669
02:18:37,630 --> 02:18:41,320
I believe that is the most accurate way 
of representing being.

2670
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:44,530
It's not the most accurate way of 
representing the objective world.

2671
02:18:44,770 --> 02:18:49,770
That's not the same thing.
Being is that set of experiences which 

2672
02:18:49,770 --> 02:18:54,541
we inhabit and that's only partly 
objective and it's not obviously 

2673
02:18:54,541 --> 02:18:59,461
reduceable to the material.
Not any straightforward way because we 

2674
02:18:59,461 --> 02:19:00,610
don't understand the material substrate 
of being at all.

2675
02:19:01,060 --> 02:19:06,060
You know it's.
It's and when we do attempt to 

2676
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:06,060
understand it,
say at the quantum level,

2677
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:08,740
we run into mysteries that that baffle 
the most,

2678
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:14,400
the most intelligent of us and aware.
So I'm going to have to leave the 

2679
02:19:14,471 --> 02:19:19,471
question hanging,
but partly because partly because I 

2680
02:19:19,471 --> 02:19:20,980
don't know what I think,
but partly because

2681
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,400
there has to be aligned between what I 
believe in,

2682
02:19:26,490 --> 02:19:29,530
what what I can communicate.
You know,

2683
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:33,200
what you believe is beyond your capacity
to articulate.

2684
02:19:33,201 --> 02:19:36,020
If you the most at the deepest levels of
belief,

2685
02:19:36,021 --> 02:19:41,021
and I can only share with you what I 
have actually come to understand and 

2686
02:19:41,021 --> 02:19:43,190
there's things that I don't understand 
and that's definitely one of them.

2687
02:19:44,220 --> 02:19:49,220
I don't know how to draw a line between 
the symbolic significance of the 

2688
02:19:49,490 --> 02:19:54,490
biblical events,
say the symbolic and psychological 

2689
02:19:54,490 --> 02:19:57,071
significance of the biblical events and 
the metaphysics that's underneath them 

2690
02:19:57,071 --> 02:19:59,900
and I think you see the same thing in 
young because when you own rights,

2691
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:01,190
technically,
informally,

2692
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:04,490
he never talks about God.
He always talks about the image of God,

2693
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:09,670
which is not the same thing.
The image of God would be your 

2694
02:20:09,670 --> 02:20:12,761
subjective experience of God.
It says nothing about the objective 

2695
02:20:12,761 --> 02:20:16,391
reality of God because your subjective 
experience can't say much about 

2696
02:20:16,391 --> 02:20:17,570
objective reality,
but even in young you get this mix.

2697
02:20:17,570 --> 02:20:19,820
You know,
sometimes it's psychological,

2698
02:20:19,821 --> 02:20:23,000
but then he,
he makes a metaphysical move and I think

2699
02:20:23,001 --> 02:20:28,001
that reflected also his,
the limits of his knowledge because 

2700
02:20:28,001 --> 02:20:29,210
young had profound revelatory 
experiences.

2701
02:20:29,211 --> 02:20:31,730
It was a very strange person.
You know,

2702
02:20:31,731 --> 02:20:36,620
and I,
I think so.

2703
02:20:36,621 --> 02:20:41,621
I think what's best for me is to stay on
the ground that I'm competent on and to 

2704
02:20:42,291 --> 02:20:47,291
say what I can say about the psychology 
and to reach beyond that briefly when 

2705
02:20:47,961 --> 02:20:50,180
it's necessary,
but other than that to leave it the hell

2706
02:20:50,181 --> 02:20:54,860
alone until I understand it better,
assuming that I ever do so

2707
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:10,900
because of these lectures.
I've been reading the Bible and 

2708
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:11,090
obviously not finished,
but I'm fairly familiar with,

2709
02:21:11,770 --> 02:21:14,840
with how it goes and the.
I've been thinking about two parts of it

2710
02:21:14,841 --> 02:21:19,841
in specific,
which is the story of Isaac and the 

2711
02:21:19,841 --> 02:21:23,410
Crucifixion of Christ and particularly 
one of the things that Christ says on 

2712
02:21:23,410 --> 02:21:25,430
the cross,
which is my God,

2713
02:21:25,431 --> 02:21:26,840
my God,
why have you forsaken me?

2714
02:21:27,290 --> 02:21:32,290
And I've been trying to understand that 
because that's one hell of a thing for 

2715
02:21:32,290 --> 02:21:32,290
the son of God to say.

2716
02:21:32,290 --> 02:21:33,580
And you think that would have been 
edited out.

2717
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:34,600
Yeah.
No,

2718
02:21:34,601 --> 02:21:35,680
seriously.
It's like,

2719
02:21:35,681 --> 02:21:37,270
why isn't that gone?
You know,

2720
02:21:37,271 --> 02:21:37,570
it,
it,

2721
02:21:37,571 --> 02:21:38,290
it,
it's,

2722
02:21:38,390 --> 02:21:40,250
it's very inconvenient.
Yeah.

2723
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:42,940
And in,
well we haven't,

2724
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:44,930
you haven't touched on the story of 
Isaac yet,

2725
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:47,630
but there's this thing,
the cold topology,

2726
02:21:47,631 --> 02:21:50,900
which I'm sure you're aware of,
but basically the idea that what's going

2727
02:21:50,901 --> 02:21:55,901
on in the Old Testament,
he served the laying out of types for 

2728
02:21:55,901 --> 02:21:58,361
Christ and that Isaac is essentially a 
type of Christ because they have all 

2729
02:21:58,361 --> 02:22:02,531
these similarities.
And so I've been thinking about it in 

2730
02:22:02,531 --> 02:22:06,131
that context and thinking about the 
parallels between them in between Isaac 

2731
02:22:06,471 --> 02:22:11,471
and Christ.
And one of the things that also struck 

2732
02:22:11,471 --> 02:22:11,471
me was mostly the differences between as
I can Christ.

2733
02:22:11,471 --> 02:22:16,231
And the main difference it seems to me 
is sort of a difference in direction of 

2734
02:22:16,231 --> 02:22:19,571
sacrifice.
So the sacrifices of Abraham is Abraham 

2735
02:22:19,571 --> 02:22:23,111
sacrificing his son to God and then the 
sacrifice of Jesus is God sacrificing 

2736
02:22:23,870 --> 02:22:28,870
his son to.
And I've been trying to understand 

2737
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:31,230
basically how that works and in relation
to the,

2738
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:35,500
in Western civilization for 2000 years.
Yeah.

2739
02:22:35,730 --> 02:22:38,220
Well there is these transformations of 
sacrifice,

2740
02:22:38,221 --> 02:22:43,221
right?
So the next thing that happens in these 

2741
02:22:43,221 --> 02:22:46,641
stories is that the circumcision 
circumcision starts to come in as a 

2742
02:22:46,651 --> 02:22:51,651
sacrifice.
And it seems to be something like the 

2743
02:22:51,651 --> 02:22:52,740
beginnings of replacement for sacrifice 
of animals.

2744
02:22:52,750 --> 02:22:53,550
It's,
you know,

2745
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:56,740
there's this psychology ization of 
sacrifice.

2746
02:22:56,741 --> 02:22:58,830
So first it's pure external,
enact it out,

2747
02:22:58,831 --> 02:23:01,410
and then it becomes something that's 
more conceptual,

2748
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:03,960
like it becomes embodied in the form of 
the circumcision,

2749
02:23:03,961 --> 02:23:08,961
and then it becomes more conceptual and 
that conceptual transformation keeps 

2750
02:23:08,961 --> 02:23:08,961
occurring.
And,

2751
02:23:08,961 --> 02:23:13,870
and it seems to,
while it culminates to some degree in 

2752
02:23:13,870 --> 02:23:15,240
this idea of the sacrifice of Christ,
who's,

2753
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:18,150
who's God sacrificing his son to 
mankind?

2754
02:23:18,151 --> 02:23:20,340
But the sacrifice is much more complex 
than that,

2755
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:25,341
right?
It's also Christ sacrificing himself to 

2756
02:23:25,341 --> 02:23:28,581
God.
And I think that the issue there is 

2757
02:23:28,581 --> 02:23:30,360
something like,
well,

2758
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:33,690
let's say you're supposed to offer up 
the best that you have to God.

2759
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:38,700
That's the sacrifice.
That's what happens with the high 

2760
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:39,060
quality animals that,
that Abel sacrifices.

2761
02:23:39,061 --> 02:23:44,061
Okay,
but there's something better than the 

2762
02:23:44,061 --> 02:23:44,061
best that you own.
Well,

2763
02:23:44,061 --> 02:23:44,700
what's that?
Well,

2764
02:23:44,850 --> 02:23:46,800
part of it might be,
well,

2765
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:52,070
the relationships you have with people,
are you willing to sacrifice them to 

2766
02:23:52,070 --> 02:23:55,911
pursue the highest good will?
Then are you willing to sacrifice 

2767
02:23:55,911 --> 02:23:58,200
yourself or your son like your son might
be?

2768
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:03,210
That's a tough one.
I can understand the idea of sacrificing

2769
02:24:03,211 --> 02:24:08,211
yourself better.
I'm still wrestling with this story of 

2770
02:24:08,211 --> 02:24:11,811
Isaiah obviously,
because that's such a complicated story 

2771
02:24:11,811 --> 02:24:11,970
and I do think it's reasonable to think 
about it as a form of foreshadowing.

2772
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:17,180
At least the way the Bible is set up.
Of course people who aren't Christian 

2773
02:24:17,180 --> 02:24:17,180
would agree with that,
but that,

2774
02:24:17,180 --> 02:24:18,070
that's fine.
Um,

2775
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:21,810
the idea that you would offer yourself 
as a sacrifice to God,

2776
02:24:21,890 --> 02:24:24,270
that seems to me to follow quite 
logically because,

2777
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:30,020
well,
obviously you have nothing greater to 

2778
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:30,020
give them the best of yourself.
Right?

2779
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:31,860
So you sacrifice yourself to the highest
good.

2780
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:35,520
And that's part of the,
that's part of the way in which humanity

2781
02:24:35,521 --> 02:24:37,410
is redeemed.
That makes sense to me.

2782
02:24:37,411 --> 02:24:39,910
That just seems like for me,
that's,

2783
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:42,090
that's a pretty straightforward 
psychological truth.

2784
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:43,650
The son issue.
That's,

2785
02:24:44,190 --> 02:24:47,220
that's a lot tougher thing to wrestle 
with because

2786
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:49,300
one of the things I was thinking with 
the,

2787
02:24:49,310 --> 02:24:54,310
uh,
with what Jesus says on the cross is 

2788
02:24:54,310 --> 02:24:58,170
that one of the interpretations of that 
is basically that Jesus in that moment 

2789
02:24:58,170 --> 02:24:59,160
is human,
basically is not the,

2790
02:24:59,410 --> 02:25:03,070
not just Jesus the human,
right.

2791
02:25:03,490 --> 02:25:08,490
But that always kind of felt a little 
bit like avoiding the question to me 

2792
02:25:08,490 --> 02:25:11,110
because you can just pause it,
something like the trinity and then say,

2793
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:16,170
oh,
but in this moment that doesn't go 

2794
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:16,170
right,
that doesn't count.

2795
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:16,800
So,
but if,

2796
02:25:16,850 --> 02:25:21,850
if we think about it in that way of like
the difference in the direction of 

2797
02:25:21,911 --> 02:25:26,911
sacrifice.
And it seems to me that in the 

2798
02:25:26,911 --> 02:25:27,460
sacrifice,
whoever's making the sacrifice surf aims

2799
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:32,520
toward something so Abraham is so 
reaching for the divine when he 

2800
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:34,030
sacrifices,
when he's going to sacrifice his son.

2801
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:39,580
And so that would mean maybe God is 
reaching towards the human.

2802
02:25:39,930 --> 02:25:44,930
And so that would make some sense of 
that interpretation that Christ is only 

2803
02:25:44,930 --> 02:25:44,930
human in that moment.
Right?

2804
02:25:44,930 --> 02:25:49,120
That it's the sacrifices accomplished 
then the richmond down accomplished.

2805
02:25:49,870 --> 02:25:53,110
But I'm still left with a question.
What do I make of that?

2806
02:25:53,230 --> 02:25:55,780
Because that's one intuitive.

2807
02:25:56,520 --> 02:25:59,670
I mean it's useful to have a problem 
like that because it gives you something

2808
02:25:59,671 --> 02:26:01,260
to think about,
right?

2809
02:26:01,330 --> 02:26:04,680
Something to study further and it's.
It's a major.

2810
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:07,380
It's a major problem.
I mean the whole issue of,

2811
02:26:07,710 --> 02:26:08,520
well,
we could say,

2812
02:26:08,730 --> 02:26:13,730
well,
what's the relationship between the 

2813
02:26:13,730 --> 02:26:15,321
divine and the human,
which is obviously brought to the 

2814
02:26:15,321 --> 02:26:15,321
forefront and the idea of Christ,
right?

2815
02:26:15,321 --> 02:26:19,641
But it's a personal issue because part 
of the issue is what's the relationship 

2816
02:26:19,641 --> 02:26:23,901
between you as a finite entity and the 
transcendent infinity that surrounds you

2817
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:29,720
while there's some relationship?
Because here you are and the 

2818
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:32,520
transcendent infinity around you exists.
So there's a relationship.

2819
02:26:32,790 --> 02:26:34,800
The question is what is the 
relationship?

2820
02:26:34,801 --> 02:26:37,220
And we don't know that and,
and,

2821
02:26:37,490 --> 02:26:41,940
and it's dramatized in that story.
And so I mean,

2822
02:26:41,941 --> 02:26:46,941
partly the reason that there's so much 
conflict and confusion in that story is 

2823
02:26:48,271 --> 02:26:50,340
because it's trying to bring opposing 
things together,

2824
02:26:50,341 --> 02:26:50,550
right?

2825
02:26:50,550 --> 02:26:53,340
How can something be God and man at the 
same time,

2826
02:26:53,490 --> 02:26:57,030
it's just like the genie,
which is the root word of genius.

2827
02:26:57,031 --> 02:27:02,031
By the way,
the genie is this incredibly powerful 

2828
02:27:02,031 --> 02:27:03,150
force that can grant wishes,
right,

2829
02:27:03,510 --> 02:27:05,640
but it's constrained in this tiny little
space.

2830
02:27:05,641 --> 02:27:09,480
There is an intimation there that for 
something to be real,

2831
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:13,170
it has to straddle the divide between 
the finite and the infinite,

2832
02:27:13,710 --> 02:27:16,200
and that's what human beings do.
I think to some degree,

2833
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:21,620
and that's dramatized in that story,
but it doesn't mean that we understand 

2834
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:24,891
it.
I mean you know that sometimes you're 

2835
02:27:24,891 --> 02:27:25,620
going to feel that way when you're 
called upon to make a sacrifice.

2836
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:29,560
You're going to feel that you've been 
betrayed by everything,

2837
02:27:29,561 --> 02:27:31,080
and I'm in the store is set up that way,
right?

2838
02:27:31,081 --> 02:27:34,650
Christ is betrayed by tyranny.
He's betrayed by his best friends.

2839
02:27:34,651 --> 02:27:39,651
He's betrayed by his mortality,
like it's an archetypal story because,

2840
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:42,810
and he's innocent,
so the story can't be any worse.

2841
02:27:42,811 --> 02:27:47,340
That's why it's our temple,
and I mean the story says to some degree

2842
02:27:47,341 --> 02:27:51,450
that under such conditions,
even God himself would have doubt.

2843
02:27:51,540 --> 02:27:54,270
It's something like that and that's a 
real.

2844
02:27:54,930 --> 02:27:58,110
That's a powerful idea.
It's a very powerful idea.

2845
02:27:58,740 --> 02:28:01,560
So that's the best I can make out of 
that for now.

2846
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:08,520
Thank you.

2847
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:14,520
We have to stop,
so we'll convene again in a week.

2848
02:28:15,101 --> 02:28:16,090
Thank you very much.

2849
02:28:17,750 --> 02:28:19,380
You.
