1
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,410
Okay,
well I thought this time that I would 

2
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,121
actually cover some of the biblical 
stories so,

3
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:24,640
and hopefully a number of them,
as I said last time,

4
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm going to go through this while as 
fast as I am able to,

5
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:34,201
I want to do it as completed job as 
possible and of course the probability 

6
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,160
that I'll get through the entire Bible 
is very low,

7
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,670
but we'll get through a lot of the major
stories in the beginning of it.

8
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:40,900
And that's a good start.
And then,

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,320
you know,
assuming that this all goes well then 

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,140
maybe I'll try to do the same thing 
again either in the fall or next year.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,300
So I'm assuming I'm at,
everything is still working out properly

12
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:54,400
next year.
It's a long ways away.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,970
Alright.
So,

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,820
um,
I guess we'll start.

15
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,350
So last week I talked to you about 
aligned in the new testament that was 

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,151
from John and it was a line that was 
designed to parallel the opening of 

17
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:15,781
genesis and it's a really important line
and I thought I would reemphasize it 

18
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,070
because the Bible is a book that's been 
written forward and backwards in time in

19
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:29,281
some sense,
like most books because if you write a 

20
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:29,281
book,
of course when you get to the end,

21
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,160
if you're the writer,
you can adjust the beginning and so on.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,850
So it has this odd,
it has this appearance of linearity,

23
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:35,620
but it really,
it isn't linear.

24
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:39,190
It's like your God in some sense,
standing outside of time.

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,580
That's your book and you can play with 
time anywhere along it.

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,500
And the people who put the book together
or the books together,

27
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,570
uh,
took full advantage of that.

28
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:50,510
And,
and,

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,710
and that makes the story.
It gives the story odd parallels in,

30
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,300
in many,
many places in a very large number of 

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,390
this isn't.
This is one of the major parallels,

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,560
at least from the perspective of the 
Christian interpretation of the Bible,

33
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,620
which of course includes the New 
Testament and so there's this strange 

34
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,831
idea that Christ was the same factor or 
force that God used at the beginning of 

35
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:22,930
time to speak habitable order into 
being,

36
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,180
and that's a very,
very strange idea.

37
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:25,900
You know it,
it,

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,960
it's not.
It's not something that can be just 

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:30,960
easily dismissed as superstition.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,230
Partly because it's so strange.
It's it,

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,250
it,
it doesn't.

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,660
It doesn't even fit the definition of 
like a superstitious belief.

43
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:42,661
It's,
it's a dream like belief in some sense 

44
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:45,421
and what I,
what I see many of the ideas in the 

45
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:46,910
Bible as is,
is these dreamlike ideas that,

46
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,350
that underlie our,
our normative cognition and that 

47
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,680
constitute the ground from which are 
more articulate and articulated and,

48
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,900
and explicit ideas have emerged in this 
one.

49
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,950
So complicated.
This idea is so complicated that it's 

50
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,901
still mostly embedded in dreamlike form,
but it seems to have something to do 

51
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:10,471
with the primacy of consciousness and 
this is one of the biggest issues 

52
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,760
regarding the structure of reality.
As far as I can tell,

53
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:16,210
because everyone from physicists to 
neurobiologists debates this,

54
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:21,211
there's there's the the stumbling block 
for a purely objective view of the world

55
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:27,151
seems to me to be consciousness and 
consciousness has all sorts of strange 

56
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:27,151
properties.

57
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:31,620
For example,
it isn't obvious what constitutes time 

58
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,951
or at least duration in the absence of 
consciousness and it isn't also easy to 

59
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:40,081
understand what constitutes being in the
absence of consciousness because it 

60
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:41,770
seems to be the case.
Well,

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,680
if a movie is running and there's no one
to watch it,

62
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:46,930
I know it sounds like the tree in the 
forest idea,

63
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:47,330
but it's.
It's.

64
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,890
It's not that idea at all.
If if a movie is watching is running and

65
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:55,891
no one's watching it,
in what sense is can you say that 

66
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:59,370
there's even a movie running because the
movie seems to be the experience of the 

67
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,081
movie,
not the objective elements of the movie 

68
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:06,991
and there's something about the world,
at least in so far as we're in it as 

69
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:12,541
human beings,
that is dependent on conscious 

70
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:12,541
experience of the world.
Now,

71
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:17,191
of course,
you can take consciousness out of the 

72
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:17,191
world and say,
well,

73
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,130
if none of us were here,
if there was no such thing as 

74
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,820
consciousness than the cosmos would 
continue running the way it is running,

75
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:26,821
but of course it depends on what exactly
you mean by the cosmos when you make a 

76
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:31,320
statement like that because there's 
something about the subjective 

77
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,920
experience of reality that gives it 
reality,

78
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,250
or at least that's one way of looking at
it and since we're all pretty enamored 

79
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,151
of our own consciousness as although 
they're painful because they define our 

80
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:42,151
being.

81
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:47,100
It's not unreasonable to give 
consciousness a kind of metaphysical 

82
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,650
primacy now and it's deeper than that,
you know,

83
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:51,730
on steeper idea than that.
Because there are physicists and they're

84
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:56,050
not trivial physicists like John Wheeler
who believes that in some sense,

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,080
consciousness plays a constitute of role
in transforming the chaotic potential of

86
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:05,080
being into the actuality of being.
And he actually thinks about it.

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,130
He's not alive anymore,
but he actually thought about it as,

88
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,240
as playing a constitutive role.
You know,

89
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:15,241
and then from the neuro biological 
perspective or from the scientific 

90
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,960
perspective,
it's like consciousness is not something

91
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:21,961
we understand that I don't think we 
understand it at all with something we 

92
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:24,850
can't get a handle on with our 
fundamental materialist philosophy and I

93
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:29,851
don't know why that is.
It's quite frustrating if you're a 

94
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:29,851
scientist,
but it isn't clear to me that we've made

95
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:34,381
any progress whatsoever in understanding
consciousness even though while we've 

96
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:38,881
been trying to understand it for 
hundreds of years and even those 

97
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:39,640
psychologists,
neurobiologists and so forth have really

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
like put a lot of effort into 
understanding consciousness from a 

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,010
scientific perspective in the last 50 
years.

100
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,140
So anyways,
what,

101
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,420
what it's,
it seems to me is the idea that,

102
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,550
that God used the word to,
to extract order out of habitable order,

103
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:57,980
out of chaos

104
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,980
at the beginning of time,
which is roughly the right way of 

105
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,991
thinking about.
It seems to me deeply aligned with the 

106
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,350
idea that what it is that we do as human
beings is his encounter.

107
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:10,310
Something like a formless and potential 
chaos.

108
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,930
I mean,
we're not omniscient obviously,

109
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:16,931
and we can't just do whatever we want,
but we encounter a formless and chaotic 

110
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:21,401
potential.
That's always what we're grappling with 

111
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:24,490
and somehow we use our consciousness to 
give that form and this is how people 

112
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,230
act like if it.
If you look at how they regard 

113
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,080
themselves,
it's how they act because you say things

114
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,160
to people like,
well,

115
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:36,161
you should live up to your potential 
when you make a case that there's 

116
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:39,791
something about a person that's more 
than what is that yet could be if only 

117
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:44,741
they participated in the process 
properly and everyone knows what that 

118
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,490
means and no one acts like a mystery has
been honored.

119
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,490
When you say that and you can see a 
situation in your own life that's full 

120
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,150
of potential.
You are often extremely excited when you

121
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,300
encounter something that's full of 
potential because what you see is 

122
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,170
something that could be you see a future
beckoning for you.

123
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,320
That could be if only you interacted 
with it properly and it activates your 

124
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,191
nervous system right in in a in a very 
basic way and we even understand how 

125
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:10,430
that happens.
To the degree that we understand how the

126
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:14,510
nervous system works because the systems
that mediate positive emotion,

127
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:18,710
which are governed roughly by Dopa,
by the neurochemical,

128
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,640
dopamine and which have their roots way 
down in the ancient hypothalamus,

129
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:25,520
a very,
very archaic and fundamental part of the

130
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:30,521
brain that responds to potential,
which is the possibility of accruing 

131
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,920
something new and valuable.
It responds to potential with active 

132
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,740
movement forward and engagement.

133
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,950
And so we're engaged in the world as 
potential and looks like consciousness 

134
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,520
does that.
And so there's this idea that,

135
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,390
and this is the main idea that I think 
is being put forth in genesis one.

136
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:50,330
It's something like,
and you see this in mythology,

137
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,360
like from,
from what I've been able to gather 

138
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,881
there,
there's always three causal elements 

139
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:00,191
that make up being at the bottom of,
of world mythology and one is the 

140
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:04,870
formless potential that makes up being 
once it's interacted with and that's 

141
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,730
generally given a feminine nature.
And,

142
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,750
and I think that's because it's like the
source from which all things emerge and 

143
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,650
rise.
It's something like that.

144
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,200
It's more complicated than that,
but it's something like that.

145
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,350
And then there's some kind of 
interpretive structure that has to 

146
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,261
grapple with that form potential and 
that's I think that's the sort of thing 

147
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:27,521
that was alluded to by a manual count 
when when he was criticizing the notion 

148
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:29,060
that all of our information comes from 
census data,

149
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:31,100
which would be the pure empirical 
perspective,

150
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:31,310
right?

151
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,310
Because when you encounter the world you
encounter with a cognitive structure 

152
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,931
that already has shape and so it's,
it's already in you this structure and 

153
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:45,610
without that a priority structure,
you wouldn't be able to take the 

154
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,551
formulas potential and give it structure
and I think that's something that it's 

155
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:52,010
akin in some way to the idea of God the 
father and I'll try to develop that idea

156
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:52,880
more.
It's,

157
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:57,881
it's the.
It's the notion that there's something 

158
00:08:57,881 --> 00:08:59,640
in all of us that transcends all of us 
that's deeply structural.

159
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:04,641
That's part of this ancient.
While I would say evolutionary and 

160
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:07,380
cultural process that enables us to 
grapple with the formulas,

161
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:11,160
potential and bring forth reality 
roughly speaking,

162
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,310
and then there's the final element and 
that element seems to be something like 

163
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,030
consciousness itself.
The consciousness that actually inheres 

164
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,630
in the individual,
so it's not only that you have the 

165
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:23,630
structure,
it's the structure,

166
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,030
has the capacity for action in the world
and it's like it's,

167
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,160
it's you're this,
you're this spirit that gives the dead 

168
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,160
structure life.

169
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,090
It's something like that and as far as I
can tell,

170
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,450
that trinitarian notion that 
characterize this Christianity is 

171
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:38,450
something like,
well,

172
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,281
formless potential which has never given
a the status of a deity in Christianity 

173
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:47,601
and then the notion that there's an a 
priori interpretive structure that's a 

174
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:51,240
consequence of,
of our ancient existence as as beings.

175
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:56,241
It goes back as far in time as you can 
go though the notion of a structure and 

176
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:01,551
then the idea of a consciousness that 
that is the is the tool of that 

177
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:06,120
structure and that interacts with the 
world and gives it and gives it reality.

178
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:08,160
And that's the word as far as I can 
tell.

179
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:13,161
And so the notion is is that there is a 
father and that's the structure and 

180
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:16,191
there's a son that's transcendent that 
characterize as consciousness itself and

181
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:19,770
that it's the sun,
the speaking of the sun.

182
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,570
That is the active principle that turns 
chaos into order and God,

183
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:28,560
it's such a sophisticated ideas as far 
as I'm concerned because,

184
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,800
well,
there's something about it that's at 

185
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,031
least phenomenologically accurate 
because you do have an interpretive 

186
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:35,850
structure and you couldn't understand 
anything without it.

187
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:38,550
Your very body is an interpretive 
structure,

188
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,960
right?
It's been crafted over,

189
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,100
let's say 3 billion years of evolution.
Without that,

190
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:49,101
you wouldn't be able to perceive 
anything and it's taken a lot of death 

191
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:52,550
and struggle and tragedy to produce you 
the thing that's capable of encountering

192
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:57,990
this immense chaos that surrounds us and
to transform it into habitable order and

193
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,030
then there's the idea too.
Of course,

194
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:02,880
it's deeply embedded in the first 
chapters of genesis,

195
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:04,710
which is a staggering idea.
You know,

196
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:09,240
and and certainly not one that's likely 
that human beings were made in the image

197
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:14,241
of God.
Both male and female were made in the 

198
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:14,241
image of God.

199
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,000
And that's of course a very difficult 
thing to understand,

200
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,060
partly because the god that's referred 
to in the in those chapters has it kind 

201
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,561
of polytheistic element.
Although it's an element that's moving 

202
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:28,851
rapidly towards a unified monotheism.
But it's not also obvious to me why 

203
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:33,711
people would come up with that concept 
because I don't really think that when 

204
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:34,510
we think about each other,
we immediately think God,

205
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:39,511
like you know,
the notion that every single human 

206
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:43,071
being,
regardless of their peculiarities and 

207
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:45,270
strangeness is and Sins and Crimes and 
all of that has something divine in them

208
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:49,770
that needs to be regarded with respect 
and that plays an integral role,

209
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,850
at least an analogy analogous role in 
the creation of habitable order,

210
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:56,980
out of chaos.
That's a magnificent,

211
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,440
remarkable,
crazy idea.

212
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,740
And yet we developed it and I do firmly 
believe that it sits at the base of our 

213
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,270
legal system.
I think it is the cornerstone of our 

214
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:09,270
legal system.

215
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,050
That's the notion that everyone is equal
before God,

216
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:14,230
which is of course it completely.
That's such a strange idea.

217
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:19,231
It's very difficult to understand how 
anybody could have ever come up with 

218
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:21,580
that idea because the manifold 
differences between people are so,

219
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,700
so obvious and so evident that you could
say the natural way of viewing someone 

220
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:31,801
is or human beings is in this extremely 
hierarchical manner where some people 

221
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:36,121
are contemptible and and and easily 
brushed off as as pointless and 

222
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,340
pathological and and without value 
whatsoever,

223
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,950
and all the power accrues to a certain 
tiny,

224
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,210
no aristocratic minority at the top,
but if you look at the way that the idea

225
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:53,581
of the individual sovereignty developed,
it's clear that it unfolded over 

226
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:57,961
thousands and perhaps 10 thousands of 
years before it became something firmly 

227
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:02,971
fixed in the imagination that each 
individual had something of transcendent

228
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,960
value about them and man,
I tell Ya,

229
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,140
we dispense with that idea at our 
serious peril and so if you're going to 

230
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,731
take that idea seriously then which you 
do because you acted out because 

231
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:15,520
otherwise you wouldn't be law abiding 
citizens,

232
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:15,760
right?

233
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,590
You Act that idea out.
It's,

234
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,850
it's,
it's,

235
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,910
it's firmly shared by everyone who,
who acts in a civilized manner.

236
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,980
The question is,
why in the world do you believe it?

237
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,470
Assuming that you believe what you act 
out,

238
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,860
which I think is a really good way of 
fundamentally defining beliefs,

239
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,890
so,
alright,

240
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,810
so,
so that's the sort of ideas that there's

241
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:42,811
this god of tradition and structure.
That's God the father who uses the sun,

242
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:46,170
which is more of an active force,
uh,

243
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,970
and,
and primarily something that's verbal,

244
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:53,971
which I also think is extremely 
interesting because it's associated not 

245
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:55,900
with thought precisely but with speech.
And I think the reason for that is,

246
00:13:55,901 --> 00:14:00,100
is that there's something to speech 
that's more than mere thought.

247
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,760
And I think part of the reason for that 
is that speeches of public utterance,

248
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,590
and at least in principle speech is 
something that's shaped by the existence

249
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:10,870
of,
of everywhere of everyone else,

250
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,070
at least across time.

251
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,070
Because when you speak you,
your speeches is put forward in the 

252
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,950
world as a causal element.
And it's also subject to criticism and,

253
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,180
and uh,
and cooperation and mutual shaping.

254
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,360
And so there's an idea here to that 
speech is that that the cognitive 

255
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:35,431
processes that bring habitable reality 
out of out of uninhabitable chaos have 

256
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:38,230
this collective and public element,
which,

257
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,280
which is part of the reason by the way,
that I'm an advocate of free speech,

258
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,650
let's say above all because I don't 
think,

259
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,960
although it is the case,
for example,

260
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:51,030
in the Canadian bill of rights,
that every single right has equal value.

261
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,050
That's the theory.
It's an idiotic theory because it's 

262
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,180
absolutely impossible for a large set of
rights to have absolutely equal 

263
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,621
standards stances that cannot happen.
There's no way that that could never 

264
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:02,930
work.
But that is the legal judgment.

265
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:07,931
But I think it's a huge mistake because 
free speech has this while this divine 

266
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:08,930
quality,
let's say,

267
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,170
that you can't escape from because it's 
the thing that manufacturers everything 

268
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:14,170
else.

269
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,520
You know,
it's so.

270
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,530
And I do think that the dream that you 
could think of as encapsulated in the 

271
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:25,931
stories in genesis is the dream by which
human beings dreamed up.

272
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,090
The idea that we would now consider 
consciousness.

273
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:31,550
Because you know,
it took us a long time to figure out the

274
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:35,780
word consciousness.
It's not like it's bloody obvious it who

275
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:40,781
knows how many thousands of years or or 
or who knows what struggles we had to 

276
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:45,941
undertake to abstract out something like
consciousness and how we had to 

277
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:49,841
represent that dramatically say or 
symbolically or in a dreamlike fashion 

278
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:54,821
before we could actually formulate the 
term and and localize that to some 

279
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,480
degree in people.
It's very sophisticated.

280
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,930
So,
so John makes the case that while 

281
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,311
there's,
there's an emanation of God or an 

282
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:07,760
element of God that transcendent 
consciousness.

283
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:11,140
It's something like that that acts 
directly and in,

284
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:16,141
in this sort of living way with the,
with the underlying potential of the 

285
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:16,141
world.

286
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,860
And I think that that's 
phenomenologically accurate.

287
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:21,440
And I do think that that's the way we 
regard our lights.

288
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,140
Because you know,
when you think about it too,

289
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:29,141
we tend to think that what you encounter
when you're looking at the world is the 

290
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:29,780
material world.
But that isn't how you act.

291
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,080
You do act as if you're in a place of 
potential and also in a place of 

292
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,250
potential that you can actually 
transform,

293
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,740
which is also something extraordinarily 
strange,

294
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:44,741
you know,
because we do treat each other as if 

295
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:47,300
we're capable of bringing new forms into
the world in some permanent manner.

296
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Right,
and we treat each other as if we have 

297
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:52,660
free choice and free will and perhaps we
don't,

298
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,700
but it's certainly the case that 
societies that are predicated on the 

299
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,010
idea that we don't don't do very well 
and societies that are predicated on the

300
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:03,410
idea that we do seem to do a lot better.

301
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,470
Plus people tend to get very annoyed at 
you if you treat them like they're 

302
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,300
automatons that lack free will.
There's something that people find very,

303
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,350
I would say constraining slave,
like about that even you know that,

304
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,540
that the demand that you don't have 
actual autonomy and even worse that 

305
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,821
you're not responsible for your choices.
It's an insult to someone to suggest to 

306
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:28,180
them that they're not responsible for 
their choices.

307
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,600
You know,
you,

308
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,350
you usually to do that to someone from a
legal perspective,

309
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,850
you have to argue something like 
diminished capacity,

310
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:39,851
right?
While you're mentally ill or you don't 

311
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:39,851
have the intellectual capacity or,
or,

312
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:44,130
or you were or you were adult by some 
substance or you had a brain injury or 

313
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,830
something and that's why you're not 
responsible for your actions.

314
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,010
Otherwise,
part of the respect that you give to 

315
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,990
another human being is the assumption 
that they're responsible for their 

316
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,640
actions and some of that can be,
well if you do something bad then you're

317
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:57,600
responsible for it.

318
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,780
But part of that too is that if you do 
something good,

319
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,890
you're also responsible for that.
And that also seems necessary because,

320
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,300
I mean,
do you really,

321
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,610
I mean it's got to be more annoying 
than,

322
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,840
than anything else that you could 
imagine to strive virtuously let's say,

323
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:17,841
to produce something of extreme value 
and then to be treated as if that was a 

324
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:19,920
mere deterministic outcome and that 
your,

325
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,530
your actual choices had nothing to do 
with that.

326
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:27,531
I mean,
people find that sort of thing 

327
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:28,020
extraordinarily punishing and so I'm 
willing to,

328
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,010
you know,
I mean,

329
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,130
I know that there are debates about all 
these things and debates about freewill 

330
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,500
in debates about the nature of 
consciousness,

331
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:39,501
but I'm trying to take a clear look at 
how people act and how they want to be 

332
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:43,890
treated and then to trace it back to 
these old ideas to see if there's some,

333
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,370
if there's some metaphysical,
let's say metaphysical connection.

334
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,530
So,
all right,

335
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,960
so here's how the,
here's how the book opens.

336
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,010
In the beginning,
God created the heavens and the earth.

337
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,310
The earth was without form and void and 
darkness was over the face of the deep 

338
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,960
and the spirit of God was hovering over 
the face of the waters.

339
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,220
Now this is a hard,
this is a hard,

340
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,260
uh,
what would you call narrative?

341
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Section two to get a handle on,
because in order to understand it 

342
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,860
properly,
you have to actually look behind it.

343
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:21,861
So there,
there are a lot of pieces of old stories

344
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:27,120
in the old testament that flesh out the 
meaning of these lines.

345
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:30,390
And I can,
I can give you a quick overview of it,

346
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,500
one of the ideas that lurks underneath 
these lines,

347
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,960
although you can't tell because it's an 
English,

348
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,230
you have to look at the original 
languages and of course I don't speak 

349
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,111
the original languages,
so I've had to use secondary sources 

350
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:45,111
too,
too bad for me,

351
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:45,480
but the,
the,

352
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,410
the,
uh,

353
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,830
without form and void and the deep idea 
you see that's associated with this 

354
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,720
notion of endless deep potential.

355
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,990
So for example,
the words that are used to represent 

356
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,490
without form and void or something like,
well one is toe,

357
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,790
I'm going to get this part wrong.
Tohu wa Bohu.

358
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,970
And another one is tail.
And it's important to know this because 

359
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,360
those words are associated with an early
miss earlier Mesopotamian word which is 

360
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,950
titled Matt and Tie that was a dragon 
like creature who represented the salt 

361
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:24,021
water and,
and time out had a husband named app 

362
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,290
suit and time at aps who were sort of 
locked together,

363
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,530
kind of a sexual embrace.
And it was that locking together of 

364
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,310
timeout and APP sue.
And I would say that's potential and 

365
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,920
order.
Something like that or chaos in order.

366
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:39,921
They were locked together and it was 
that union of chaos and order that gave 

367
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:43,581
rise in the old Mesopotamian myth,
which is the Enuma elish to the to the 

368
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:48,280
to being to the old gods first and then 
eventually as as creation progressed to 

369
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,330
human beings themselves.

370
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,080
And so there's this idea lurking 
underneath this,

371
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,140
these initial lines that God is akin to 
that which confronts the unknown and 

372
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:02,590
carves it into pieces and makes the 
world out of its pieces.

373
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,440
And the thing that it confronts is 
something like a while.

374
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:10,441
It's something like a predatory reptiles
or something like a dragon or something 

375
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:13,951
like a serpent.
And I think part of the reason for that 

376
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:13,951
and and this,
this is,

377
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:18,520
this is a very deep and ancient idea,
is that this is where it gets so 

378
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:21,190
complicated to do.
The translation is partly.

379
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,860
That is how human beings created our 
world.

380
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:28,360
Like we went out beyond the confines of 
our safe spaces.

381
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:32,040
Let's say our space,
our safe spaces defined by,

382
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,070
by the tree or defined by the fire.
And we actively voyaged outward to the 

383
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,941
places that we were afraid of and didn't
understand and and Kong and conquered 

384
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:44,670
and encountered things out there like,
like add,

385
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,120
like literally animals like mammoths and
snakes and predators of all sorts.

386
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,570
And it was as a consequence of that 
active,

387
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:57,571
brave engagement with the domain of what
we did not understand the terrifying 

388
00:21:57,571 --> 00:22:01,090
domain of what we did not understand 
that the world in fact was generated.

389
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,170
And that idea lurks deeply inside the 
opening lines of,

390
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,190
of Genesis.
And it's an.

391
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,910
It's a profound idea in my estimation.
And I think.

392
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,420
See,
I think also that the way our brains are

393
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:18,421
structured,
and this is something that I'm going to 

394
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,191
try to develop more today,
is that the ancient circuits that our 

395
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:23,551
ancestors used to deal with the space 
beyond which they had already explored.

396
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:26,720
So that would be home territory.
That.

397
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,740
So that's that unknown territory that's,
that's characterized by promise because 

398
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,060
there are new things out there,
but also by intense danger,

399
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,860
right?
Because we're prey animals,

400
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,590
especially billions of years ago when we
were very young,

401
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,890
we had to go out there and encounter 
things that were terribly dangerous and 

402
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,380
there was a kind of,
let's say,

403
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:49,381
paternal courage that went along with 
that and it was that the spirit of 

404
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:52,630
paternal courage that enabled the 
conquering of the unknown and there's no

405
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:56,220
difference between the conquering of the
unknown and the creation of habits,

406
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,400
habitable order.

407
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,610
And the thing is is that as our 
cognitive faculties have developed to 

408
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,160
the point where we're,
we're,

409
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,350
we're capable of very high levels of 
abstraction.

410
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,860
The underlying biological architecture 
has remained the same.

411
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:13,861
And so I.
I don't think that it's too much to say 

412
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:15,640
at all that the circuits that you,
that engage you,

413
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:20,641
for example,
when you're having an argument about 

414
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:22,561
something fundamental with someone that 
you love and so you're trying to 

415
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:26,311
structure the world around you jointly 
to create a habitable space that you can

416
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:29,890
both exist within your using the same 
circuits,

417
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:35,110
the abstracted version.
You're using the same circuits that are 

418
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,720
archaic ancestors would have used when 
they went out into the unknown itself to

419
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,070
encounter beasts.
And,

420
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,890
and,
and predators and,

421
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,120
and,
and geographical unknowns.

422
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:48,121
It's the same circuit,
it's just that we do it abstractly now 

423
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:51,461
instead of concretely,
but of course it has to be the same 

424
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:51,461
circuit because evolutionary 
evolutionary is,

425
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:54,650
is a very conservative force.
And what else would it be?

426
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,090
And this is also why I think it's so 
easy for us to demonize those people who

427
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,800
are our enemies because

428
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,130
our enemies confront us with what we 
don't want to,

429
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,070
with what we don't want to see.
And they,

430
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:14,110
they ended because of that.
Our first response is to use snake 

431
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,941
circuitry,
snake detection circuitry on them and 

432
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:19,440
that accounts for our capacity almost 
immediate capacity to demonize and,

433
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,070
and,
and there's a reason for that.

434
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:22,660
It's not a trivial thing.
First of all,

435
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,580
it's a very fast response and second of 
all,

436
00:24:24,581 --> 00:24:27,130
it's a response that has worked for a 
very,

437
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:28,900
very,
very long time.

438
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,060
And so,
you know,

439
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:36,061
one of the variance of the hero and I 
would consider a variant of the hero,

440
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,880
like a fragment of the picture of God is
the heroic warrior who slays the enemy.

441
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,540
Right?
And of course,

442
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:48,541
that's not precisely a politically 
correct representation of the hero in 

443
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:52,111
modern times and well then no wonder,
but it's still something that you go 

444
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:52,750
watch and movies all the time and 
admire,

445
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:52,990
right?

446
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,570
It's,
it's like this one of the.

447
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,390
How many plots are their romance and 
adventure.

448
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:03,250
That's about it.
And most of the adventure genre is while

449
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,920
there's some enemy that's lurking in 
some form,

450
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,600
it could be human,
it could be alien,

451
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,060
and someone rises up to go and confront 
it,

452
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,560
maintain order,
you know,

453
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:14,320
it's like there's no getting away from 
that story.

454
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,600
And if you don't have that in your own 
life,

455
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:19,030
then you play a video game where that's 
happening.

456
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:20,650
Or You watch a movie where that's 
happening.

457
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:23,260
Or You read a book where that's 
happening and it captures you.

458
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,310
Even if your atheistic and you're only 
religion is star wars,

459
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:28,390
you know,
and,

460
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,730
and it's still well really,
really right.

461
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,760
It really,
it still captures your imagination and 

462
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,060
you act like someone who's possessed by 
religious fervor.

463
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:40,090
When you line up for three days to be 
the first one into the theater,

464
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:45,091
you know,
and all the while claiming that your 

465
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:45,091
atheistic to the core,
it's like,

466
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,820
okay,
so this,

467
00:25:48,821 --> 00:25:53,821
this without form and void is this 
chaotic and certainly it's a hard thing 

468
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:54,530
to.

469
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,640
It's a hard thing to get a grip on.
You know,

470
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:01,650
what exactly this means.
But I can give you another kind of 

471
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,131
example of how you would experience the 
formless chaos of potential in your own 

472
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:11,161
lives and,
and even how the order that you 

473
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:11,161
currently inhabit can dissolve into 
that.

474
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:14,440
And you know,
in Dante's inferno,

475
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,660
when he outlined the levels of hail,
so Dante was trying to get to the bottom

476
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,820
of what constituted evil really in,
in,

477
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,910
in this representation.
So it's a work of psychology.

478
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:26,320
And he was thinking,
well there,

479
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,510
there are various ways to behave 
reprehensible,

480
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,860
but there is a hierarchy of re 
reprehensible behavior and there's 

481
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
something absolutely the worst at the 
bottom.

482
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,840
And Dante believed that it was be trail.
And I think that's right,

483
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:45,841
because you know,
one of the things that enables our long 

484
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:50,360
term cooperation,
peaceful cooperation between people is 

485
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,360
trust.

486
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,990
And I would also say that trust is the 
fundamental natural resource.

487
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:57,991
So there's been some very good books 
written on the economic utility of 

488
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:57,991
trust,
for example,

489
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:02,151
in societies where the default economic 
presupposition between trading partners 

490
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:07,810
is trust tend to be rich even if they 
don't have any natural resources.

491
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:09,480
And you can see that,
for example,

492
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,600
with what happened with Ebay,
which I think was a kind of miracle 

493
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,271
because of what should have happened 
with Ebay was that you sent me junk and 

494
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:17,610
I sent you a check that bounced.
Right?

495
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:19,860
And that was the end of Ebay,
but.

496
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,630
Right,
right,

497
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,310
exactly.
But that isn't what happened.

498
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:28,311
You're like the default,
the default transaction on Ebay was so 

499
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:31,530
honest that the brokers,
you could hire brokers to begin with.

500
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,510
I can't remember what they were called 
exactly,

501
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:37,380
but you could pay someone a fee so that 
they would guarantee the transaction.

502
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,350
So you know,
you wouldn't send me John Can,

503
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:44,351
I'd actually send you a payment and we 
pay 10 percent for someone to guarantee 

504
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:47,841
that the default trade was so honest 
that those things vanished right away.

505
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,880
And so that meant that all this frozen 
capital,

506
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:55,881
roughly speaking,
which were all the junk that people had 

507
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:58,161
lying around,
that someone else might want instantly 

508
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:00,531
became money and the only reason that 
worked was because people trusted one 

509
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:00,531
another.
And so trust is,

510
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,420
is unbelievably powerful.
Economic Force,

511
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:06,720
maybe the most powerful economic force 
anyways.

512
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,050
If you have a relationship with someone,
it's predicated on trust.

513
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:14,430
And a part of the reason for that is 
that trust is what enables us to look at

514
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,230
each other without running away 
screaming.

515
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,470
And what I mean by that is that if I 
trust you,

516
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,590
then I don't have to take into account 
how complicated you are because you're 

517
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:24,590
horribly complicated to know.

518
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,390
I think chimpanzee full of snakes.
That's what a human being is.

519
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,140
And as long as you'll do what you say 
you'll do,

520
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,470
then I can take you at your word and 
your word simplify as you and you can 

521
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,340
take me at my word and my word simplify 
as you,

522
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,310
and then we can act like we understand 
each other even though we don't.

523
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,840
But then if that trust is betrayed,
then all the snakes come forth very,

524
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:47,600
very rapidly.
And so you,

525
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:53,270
all of you,
I suspect of being betrayed one way or 

526
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,551
another.
And so what happens if you're in a 

527
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:55,551
relationship with someone and you trust 
them,

528
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,950
then you make certain assumptions about 
the past and you make certain 

529
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,011
assumptions about the present and you 
make certain assumptions about the 

530
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:06,591
future and everything stable.
And so you're standing on solid ground 

531
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:08,730
and and the chaos.
It's like you're standing on thin ice.

532
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,780
The chaos is hidden.
The sharp beneath the waves isn't there.

533
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:13,680
You're,
you're safe.

534
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:16,530
You're in the lifeboat.
But then if the person betrays you,

535
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:21,531
like if you're in an intimate 
relationship and the person has an 

536
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:23,991
affair and you find out about it,
then then you think one moment you're 

537
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:23,991
one place,
right?

538
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:28,780
You're aware,
everything is secure because you 

539
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,970
predicated your perception of the world 
on the axiom of trust and the next 

540
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,090
second,
really the next second,

541
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,240
you're in a completely different place 
and not only is that place different 

542
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,601
right now,
the place you were years ago is 

543
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:45,411
different and the place you're going to 
be in the future years hanse is 

544
00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:48,541
different and so all of that certainty,
that strange certainty that you inhabit 

545
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:51,820
can collapse into incredible complexity 
and you say,

546
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:53,050
well,
if someone betrays you,

547
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,800
you think,
well,

548
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,600
okay,
who were you?

549
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,110
Because you aren't who I thought you 
were and I thought I knew you,

550
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,990
but I didn't know you at all and I never
knew you.

551
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,990
And so all the things we did together,
those weren't the things that I thought 

552
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,110
were happening.
Something else was happening and you're 

553
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,631
you or someone else,
and that means I'm someone else because 

554
00:30:12,631 --> 00:30:12,790
I thought I knew what was going on and 
clearly I don't.

555
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:17,791
I'm some sort of blind sucker or the or 
the victim of a psychopath or someone 

556
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:22,201
who is so naive that they can barely 
live and I don't understand anything 

557
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:25,741
about human beings and they don't 
understand anything about myself and I 

558
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,800
have no idea where I am now.
I thought it was at home,

559
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:31,801
but I'm not.
I'm in a house and it's full of 

560
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:34,351
strangers and I don't know what I'm 
going to do tomorrow or next week or 

561
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:38,191
next year.
It's like all of that certainty that 

562
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:40,831
habitable certainty collapses right back
into the potential from witchetty merged

563
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,660
and that's a terrifying thing.

564
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,750
That's a journey to the underworld from 
a mythological perspective and that is 

565
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,920
really something worth knowing because 
you know,

566
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:55,921
journeys to the underworld are 
extraordinarily common in mythological 

567
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:59,281
stories and you know,
like the hobbit going out to find the 

568
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:01,570
smaller the dragon and get the gold is a
journey into the underworld.

569
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,780
Journeys to the underworld happen all 
the time and modern people don't 

570
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,691
understand what the underworld is except
that we've all been there and we go 

571
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:11,230
there all the time and we'd go there 
every time.

572
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,240
The solidity and stability of the world 
that we've erected,

573
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:21,241
at least partly through our speech is 
shattered because while some sort of 

574
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:25,471
snake appears,
that's another way of thinking about it 

575
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:25,760
and it's a really good way of thinking 
about it because you know,

576
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,890
no matter how carefully you construct a 
little habitable area that's around you,

577
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:35,070
there's always something you didn't take
into account and there's always 

578
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,671
something that can pop up its head and 
do you in and make you aware of your 

579
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:41,890
mortality and age you for that matter or
even kill you.

580
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,730
And that's the permanent.
That's the permanent situation of life.

581
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:48,310
Which is part of the reason why I think 
the story of Adam and Eve,

582
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:49,690
for example,
is archetipal.

583
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,260
It's because we do inhabit walled 
gardens,

584
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:58,261
right?
Because a walled garden is half 

585
00:31:58,261 --> 00:31:59,300
structure society and half nature.
That's what a walled garden is.

586
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,770
A walled garden is a place of,
of,

587
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,050
of,
of paradise and warmth and,

588
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,020
and,
and,

589
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,950
and,
and,

590
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,240
and love and,
and,

591
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,760
and sustenance.
But it's also the place where something 

592
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,130
can pop up at any moment and knock you 
out of it.

593
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:20,131
And I think part of the reason that that
story exists at the beginning of this 

594
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:24,211
collection of books is because it 
explains the eternal situation of human 

595
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:25,930
beings.
We're always in that situation.

596
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,020
We're in a walled garden or we bloody 
well hope we are,

597
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,500
but there's always a snake and then it's
even worse because if there is a snake 

598
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,281
where exactly the sort of creatures who 
are going to do nothing but go and 

599
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:39,320
interact with that state,
the second that we can manage it,

600
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,170
you know,
it,

601
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,270
it's,
it's definitely the case that if you 

602
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:45,270
want a human being to muck around with 
something,

603
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,430
the best thing to do is to tell them not
ever to do it,

604
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,220
have anything to do with it,
which is of course something,

605
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:54,221
you know,
if you have teenagers or even children 

606
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:57,940
or,
or if you know anything about yourself 

607
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:57,940
or your partner.

608
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,640
So these stories are trying to express 
what you might describe as an unchanging

609
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,080
transcendent reality.
You know,

610
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:08,420
it's,
it's something like what's common across

611
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,610
all human experience across all the 
time.

612
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,850
And that's what young essentially meant 
by an archetype.

613
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:14,840
And you could say,
well,

614
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:20,230
you know,
we tend to think that what we see with 

615
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,540
our senses is real.
And of course that's true,

616
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:25,541
but what we see with our senses is 
what's real that works at the timeframe 

617
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,080
that we exist in.
Right?

618
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:29,600
And so we see things that we can touch 
and pick up.

619
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:34,160
We see tools essentially that are useful
for our moment to moment activities.

620
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:39,370
We don't see the structures of eternity,
especially not the abstract structures 

621
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,811
of eternity.
We have to imagine those with our 

622
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:43,811
imagination.
Well,

623
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:44,000
and that's partly what these stories are
doing.

624
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:44,750
They're saying,
well,

625
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,140
there's,
there's forms of stability that 

626
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,540
transcend our capacity to observe,
which is hardly surprising.

627
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,130
We know that if we're scientists,
right?

628
00:33:55,131 --> 00:34:00,131
Because we're always abstracting out 
things that we can't immediately 

629
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:02,951
observe,
but there are metaphysical or moral 

630
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:06,011
realities or phenomena,
logical realities that have the same 

631
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,981
nature that you can't see them in your 
life by observing them with your senses.

632
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:14,261
But you can imagine them with your 
imagination and sometimes the things 

633
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:18,071
that you imagine with your imagination 
are more real than the things that you 

634
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:20,120
see numbers that are like that.
For example,

635
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,000
and there's endless examples of that,
and I would say,

636
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:28,001
well,
this is also a good way of thinking 

637
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,461
about fiction because a good work of 
fiction is more real than the stories 

638
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:32,630
from which it was derived.
Otherwise it has no staying power,

639
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:37,631
right?
It's distilled reality even though in 

640
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:37,730
some sense it never happened.
It's like,

641
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,490
well,
it depends on what you mean by happened.

642
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,360
You know,
it's,

643
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:42,010
it's,
it's a,

644
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,070
it's a pattern that repeats in many,
many places with variation.

645
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,280
You extract out the central pattern.
It's,

646
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,820
it's the pattern purely never existed in
any specific form,

647
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:58,180
but the fact that you've pulled a 
pattern out from all those exemplars 

648
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,710
means that you've extracted something 
real and I think the reason that the,

649
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,800
the story of Adam and Eve,
which we'll talk about and quite a bit 

650
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,531
of detail today has net has been immune 
to being forgotten is because it says 

651
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:12,920
things about the nature of the human 
condition that are always true.

652
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,050
I can give you another brief example.
You know,

653
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,140
like people have a lot of guilt.
You know,

654
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:23,210
there's a line of social psychology that
claims that most people feel that 

655
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,980
they're better than other people and 
like I just don't buy that,

656
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,170
that isn't what I've seen in my life and
maybe it's,

657
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I'm a bit biased because I'm a clinical 
psychologist and I see more people who 

658
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,550
are overtly suffering maybe than people 
do in general.

659
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,550
Although I'm not so sure about that 
because you don't have to scratch very 

660
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,221
far beneath the surface of most people's
lives before you find something truly 

661
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:47,511
tragic.
And I don't mean this sort of tragedy 

662
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:47,511
that you whine about.
I mean,

663
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:48,750
you know,
your mother has Alzheimer's or,

664
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:53,751
or your,
your best friend committed suicide or 

665
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:54,720
you have a close relative with cancer.
You have a sick child or you know,

666
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:59,721
there's something wrong with you because
almost everyone has at least one really 

667
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:01,020
terrible thing wrong with them.
And if you don't,

668
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:01,740
hey,
you will.

669
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:05,680
So you know,
so know that,

670
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,010
that so,
so that,

671
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:10,200
that tragic sense of being there with 
people all the time.

672
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,670
And it's also the case that the,
my,

673
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,900
in my experience,
like I rarely meet someone who says,

674
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,680
Hey,
you know,

675
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:22,490
I'm doing everything I possibly can.
I'm a hell of a guy and I can't see how 

676
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,580
I could possibly improve.

677
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,750
You know,
you meet,

678
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,390
you meet someone like that.
You think they're narcissistic,

679
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:28,070
right?
Would endure,

680
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,190
right.
And,

681
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,440
but,
but most people don't feel that way.

682
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:36,441
They feel like they could do a hell of a
lot better than they are and they're 

683
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:39,950
quite acutely aware of their faults and 
they don't feel that are what they 

684
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,970
should be.
And you see what happens in the story of

685
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:45,270
Adam and Eve as well as that.
When people become self conscious,

686
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,170
at least that's how it looks to me.
They get thrown out of paradise and then

687
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:54,171
they're in history.
And history is a place where there's 

688
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,841
pain in childbirth and where you're 
dominated by your mate and where you 

689
00:36:56,841 --> 00:37:00,771
have to toil like mad,
like no other animal because you're 

690
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:03,921
aware of the future.
You have to work and sacrifice the joys 

691
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:04,770
of the present for the future 
constantly.

692
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,190
And you know you're going to die and you
have all that weight on you.

693
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,970
And to me,
again,

694
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:12,090
that's just how can anything be more 
true than not.

695
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,750
That's just as far as I can tell.
That's just how it is for.

696
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,930
Unless you're naive beyond 
comprehension,

697
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,130
there's something about your life that,
that,

698
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,220
that is echoed in,
in that representation and why it is 

699
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,151
that.
I mean we're such strange creatures 

700
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:31,890
because we don't seem to really fit into
being in some sense.

701
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:34,770
And that's also what's expressed in the 
notion of the fall.

702
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:36,390
We,
the existentialist said,

703
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:41,391
well,
people feel like they have a debt that 

704
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:41,391
they have to pay off to existence for 
the,

705
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:46,210
for the crime of there,
for the crime of there being something 

706
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,031
like that.
And maybe it's because we're acutely 

707
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:52,281
aware that we have to offer something of
value to the people around us so that 

708
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:52,490
they can tolerate us.
You know,

709
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,210
well we're,
we're going about our business.

710
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:59,210
But it seems deeper than that.
It's that human beings seem to exist in 

711
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:04,221
a post cataclysmic world.
And that's exactly also what's 

712
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:07,881
represented in genesis.
And it's very interesting because you 

713
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:07,881
know,
there's,

714
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:08,820
in the Adam and Eve story,
there's two,

715
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,510
there's two catastrophes.
Essentially there's the catastrophe that

716
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:17,511
occurs when Adam and eve wake up,
which we'll talk about in detail and 

717
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:18,360
become self conscious and know that 
they're naked,

718
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,790
that and their eyes are open,
right?

719
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:24,770
So that's the terminology that's used.
And to have your eyes open means to have

720
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,960
an increment in consciousness.
Essentially [inaudible] eyes are 

721
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,561
associated with consciousness for human 
beings because we're intensely visual 

722
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,891
animals.
And so the metaphor of having your eyes 

723
00:38:36,891 --> 00:38:38,230
opened means,
is the same as the metaphor of coming to

724
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:43,231
consciousness.
And as soon as Adam and eve come to 

725
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:43,231
consciousness,
they realized they were naked.

726
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:47,370
And you know,
the classic interpretation of that is 

727
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:47,440
that it has something to do with sexual 
sin.

728
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,800
And I don't,
I don't believe that I,

729
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:51,730
I don't believe that that's what it 
means.

730
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,400
All the other elements about that that 
are irrelevant,

731
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,890
it's more of that to realize that you're
naked.

732
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,510
It's like you're,
you know,

733
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,690
if you dream that you're naked on a 
stage in front of people,

734
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,750
that's not a sexual dreams man.
Unless you're some kind of strange 

735
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:06,750
exhibitionist,
right?

736
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,580
It's,
it's you want to cover yourself up and 

737
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,591
get the hell off that stage as fast as 
possible and so to be naked in front of 

738
00:39:13,591 --> 00:39:17,461
a crowd is to have everyone to have the 
judgment of the social world focused on 

739
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:24,510
your self evident inadequacies and that 
makes people self conscious and that 

740
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:30,121
that's a real human state.
It's associated with neuroticism and in 

741
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:31,660
the big five traits model,
but people don't like that at all.

742
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:36,220
They don't like having their fragility 
and vulnerability exposed to the group.

743
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:40,570
It's one of the two major fears of 
people because one is social humiliation

744
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,580
and the other is something like 
mortality and death and like your.

745
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,690
Your typical agoraphobic for example,
gets to have both those fears at the 

746
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,660
same time because she usually is.
She tends to believe she's going to have

747
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:57,661
a very spectacular and exhibition mystic
heart attack in a public place and make 

748
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,430
a terrible fool of herself while she's 
dying.

749
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:05,820
So then that's a good example of the two
archetipal fears that characterize,

750
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,630
characterize human beings.

751
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,560
So.
So to me,

752
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,040
and I said that I tried to approach 
these stories as if I didn't know what 

753
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,071
they were about because that seemed 
right to me because there are mysteries 

754
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:23,551
there.
Everything about them is mysterious and 

755
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:26,430
why we have them is mysterious and what 
the hell you're all doing here is 

756
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:26,800
mysterious,
you know,

757
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:31,801
listening to this lecture and so and 
reading young [inaudible] young Carl 

758
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:33,610
young was very,
very helpful in this because he,

759
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:38,020
he faced these stories with a beginner's
mind and presumed there was something to

760
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:43,021
him that he didn't understand given that
they were at the very bloody bottom of 

761
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:47,071
our civilization in which is 
historically perfectly clear and that 

762
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:51,210
they came out of the midst sub time and 
he wasn't satisfied with the idea of the

763
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,300
Freudian idea that God was just the 
father or the Marxist idea that religion

764
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,590
was the opiate of the masses.
It's like religion was the opiate of the

765
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:04,591
masses.
Then communism was the methamphetamine 

766
00:41:04,591 --> 00:41:05,320
of the masses.
I can tell you that.

767
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,460
So,

768
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,760
so you know,
you've been betrayed by someone and so 

769
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:18,760
you fall into that underworld of,
of,

770
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,270
of doubt about everything.
And it's a serious place to be in that 

771
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,801
underworld a because not only do you not
know where you came from or who you are 

772
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:28,190
or where you're going,
that's bad enough.

773
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,520
So that's the underworld itself,
but there's a subdivision of the 

774
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,191
underworld,
like the worst suburb is I think what 

775
00:41:36,191 --> 00:41:38,270
hell is essentially from a metaphysical 
perspective because you know,

776
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,670
if someone really cuts you off at the 
knees,

777
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:42,800
especially if they do it in a malevolent
way,

778
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,250
and if you're going to be betrayed and 
you really want to be betrayed properly,

779
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:49,220
you want to be betrayed by someone who's
really out to hurt you.

780
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,020
You know,
they just weren't being stupid.

781
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:53,300
They were like,
after you for whatever reason.

782
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,560
And then that's also you plunged into 
that underworld space.

783
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,580
And that's also when you start to nurse 
feelings of resentment and agreement and

784
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:04,070
murder and homicide.
And even worse,

785
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,290
you know,
because if people are betrayed enough,

786
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,320
they start.
They start to obsess about the utility 

787
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,880
of being itself and perhaps go to places
that no one would ever want to go with.

788
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:18,910
They were in their right mind and to and
to develop a nurse fantasies of the 

789
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:23,441
ultimate revenge and that's a horrible 
place to be and that's held as far as I 

790
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:27,701
can tell and that's why hell is always 
been a suburb of the underworld because 

791
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:29,390
if,
if you get plunged into a situation that

792
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:32,000
you don't understand and things are not 
good for you anymore,

793
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,850
it's one step from being completely 
confused.

794
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:40,060
It's only one step from being completely
confused to being completely outraged 

795
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,320
and resentful and then it's only one 
step from there to really looking for 

796
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,921
revenge and that can take you places 
that well that that merely to imagine 

797
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:53,471
properly can be traumatic.
And I've seen that happen with people 

798
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:56,531
many times and I think that anybody who 
uses their imagination on themselves can

799
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,990
see how that happens.
Because I don't imagine there's a single

800
00:42:59,991 --> 00:43:04,991
person in the room that hasn't nursed 
fairly intense fantasies of revenge at 

801
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:10,121
least at one point in their life.
And usually you know for what appeared 

802
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:11,900
to be good reasons.
It's no picnic to get betrayed.

803
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:14,150
That's for sure.
And it can shake your faith in being.

804
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:18,290
But if it shakes it so badly that you 
turned against being itself,

805
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,390
that's certainly no solution,
that's for sure.

806
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:22,460
All it does is make everything that's 
bad,

807
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,290
even worse.
So

808
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,110
okay,
now so and God said,

809
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:34,111
let there be light and there was light 
and God saw that the light was good and 

810
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,080
God separated the light from the 
darkness.

811
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,820
And so that's,
that's another,

812
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,100
that's another fundamental separation,
right?

813
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:40,390
Light and darkness.
Those are,

814
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,120
those are in some sense the two 
fundamental,

815
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,180
two of the fundamental elements of our 
conscious being because of course when 

816
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,940
it's light,
we're awake and conscious because we're 

817
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:51,970
diurnal animals and when it's night,
well then we're asleep.

818
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:53,560
And so our,
our,

819
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,530
our existence is bounded by light and 
darkness.

820
00:43:56,531 --> 00:43:58,480
We're,
we're up and alert when it's light.

821
00:43:58,481 --> 00:44:01,480
And that's partly because we're highly 
visual animals,

822
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:03,100
right?
Unlike most animals,

823
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:08,101
because most animals you smell,
we use vision were very strange that 

824
00:44:08,101 --> 00:44:11,911
way.
And Vision is associated with 

825
00:44:11,911 --> 00:44:14,041
enlightenment and illumination and with 
the breaking of the dawn and with the 

826
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:14,770
coming of the new day and,
and all of that.

827
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:18,070
So and so for,
for light to be created is,

828
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:23,100
is,
is associated in some sense with the 

829
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,501
emergence of conscious being and so 
that's another echo of that notion and 

830
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:29,930
there the,
the particular phrasing of the of the 

831
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,250
story also is important because it's 
that God sad,

832
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:37,251
right?
So that's the use of that word and 

833
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:39,480
that's the active element of the 
structure that gives rise to,

834
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,090
gives order to chaos.
It's something like that.

835
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:47,091
So it's this.
It's like the spirit of the structure 

836
00:44:47,091 --> 00:44:50,180
manifests itself and and produces the 
fundamental divisions of experience.

837
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:55,431
That's what's being presented here.
And God separated the light from the 

838
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:57,510
darkness.
He called the light day and the darkness

839
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:02,511
he called night and again again,
the fact that things are named is also 

840
00:45:02,511 --> 00:45:05,751
very important.
So you see this later without them 

841
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:08,631
because God gives them the job of naming
all the animals and it's sort of like 

842
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:10,230
the animals don't actually exist in some
sense till they're named.

843
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:14,370
And that's,
that's another indication of the authors

844
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:19,371
of the Bible's attempt to come to terms 
with the fact that our cognitive 

845
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:23,721
faculties and our ability to speak have 
something to do with the way that we 

846
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,860
cast chaotic potential into actuality,
right?

847
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:30,861
Because we can't.
We can't really get a grip on something 

848
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:30,870
before we have a name for it,
which is why,

849
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:35,871
for example,
you all have names and everything that 

850
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,270
you encounter has to have a name because
before it has a name,

851
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:39,660
it's just kind of part of the blurry 
background and something like that.

852
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:42,390
And you could say it exists before it 
has a name,

853
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:43,440
but.
And that's true.

854
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:47,040
But it's also true that it doesn't exist
before it has a name.

855
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,110
Because as soon as you give something,
a name,

856
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,280
it's nature changes and you've 
transformed it into something that's not

857
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:58,281
so much mira potential anymore,
but it's at least on its way to being 

858
00:45:58,281 --> 00:45:58,281
actuality.

859
00:45:58,281 --> 00:46:00,660
It's on its way to being a tool.
And so the,

860
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:05,640
the act of naming is repeated 
continually in the first chapters of the

861
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:10,641
Bible.
And the reason for that is this 

862
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:12,150
continued emphasis on the importance of 
consciousness and conscious articulation

863
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:17,360
and speech and speech is really 
something that does separate us in an 

864
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,660
important way from animals,
you know,

865
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:23,661
like we haven't got very far teaching 
animals how to speak the best we've 

866
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,400
managed so far as some parrots,
right?

867
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:31,401
There's gray African parrot,
there was one of them that got up to 

868
00:46:31,401 --> 00:46:34,191
about a four year old level and that's 
mind boggling because like how big is 

869
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,840
the brain of a parrot?
It's like that big and that bloody thing

870
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:41,841
could talk.
And so that shows you how much we know 

871
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:41,900
about brains,
but I know they're small and all that.

872
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,910
But,
and we tried teaching chimpanzees to 

873
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:46,910
talk and they could kind of get 
somewhere with sign language,

874
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,690
especially if you started when they were
young,

875
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:53,691
but they don't have the capacity for 
language like we do and they were never 

876
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:56,100
able to really pass it onto the,
to the next generation,

877
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:59,190
which is obviously a critical element of
really having that ability.

878
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,070
So human beings,
we,

879
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,120
we've,
we've used our linguistic capacity to 

880
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,331
parse up the world in a new way and to 
conceptualize it to the new way and you 

881
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:11,700
know,
you can say that we're just like ants on

882
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:15,130
this little trivial planet out on the 
edge of,

883
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:20,290
of one of 100 million galaxies and that 
what's happening here has no cosmic 

884
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:22,800
significance.
But that's an arbitrary,

885
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,250
that's an arbitrary a proposition,
you know,

886
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:31,251
I mean,
we're very complicated things and 

887
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:33,680
whatever's going on on this planet has 
to do with conscious reality and the 

888
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,161
transformations of consciousness for all
we know might be the most important 

889
00:47:38,161 --> 00:47:42,121
things that happen everywhere.
There's no reason to consider 

890
00:47:42,121 --> 00:47:43,080
consciousness at trivial phenomena.
I mean,

891
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:48,180
it's taken three and a half billion 
years for you to develop the brain that 

892
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,540
you've developed and you and human 
beings are amazing creatures.

893
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:54,541
I mean,
just a casual walk through youtube and 

894
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:54,880
all those crazy kids that climb cranes 
and do that.

895
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,600
What's that?
Yeah.

896
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:57,640
Park who are,
man,

897
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,220
that stuff's unbelievable.
You know?

898
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,540
I mean,
human beings are crazy,

899
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:04,000
crazy animals.
There's almost nothing we can't do.

900
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:08,260
And I'm very loath to assume that the 
transformation of consciousness that are

901
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,670
described in the early,
in the early stories in,

902
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,090
in the biblical accounts are somehow 
cosmically trivial.

903
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:19,750
It doesn't strike me that way and it's 
certainly not self evident.

904
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:23,470
And even if they are cosmically trivial,
whatever that means,

905
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,050
the rocks don't care what you think.
Well,

906
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:29,500
who cares what the rocks think first?
They don't think so.

907
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:34,720
I don't see why that's exactly relevant,
but even if even if it's all the same to

908
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:36,790
the cosmos,
which is something that I doubt,

909
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,580
it's certainly not just all the same to 
you,

910
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:42,070
you know,
because your consciousness has a quality

911
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:43,720
and it matters.
The heidegger,

912
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:45,070
for example,
who's,

913
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:46,270
who's a philosopher,
who,

914
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:51,330
who's writing sort of influenced me post
hoc because I recreated some of the 

915
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:55,150
things that he had talked about in the 
thirties before I knew much about it,

916
00:48:55,151 --> 00:49:00,070
but one of the things that heidegger 
said was that the fundamental element of

917
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,150
human being of human phenomenology was 
care.

918
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,360
You said that that's the basic essence 
of your being is that you care about 

919
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,130
things you know and that that's either 
negatively or positively,

920
00:49:12,131 --> 00:49:17,131
right,
you to not care about something or to 

921
00:49:17,131 --> 00:49:19,441
hate.
It is still to be involved in care and 

922
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:22,411
so even if the cosmos itself is,
is neutral with regards to our 

923
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:27,010
existence,
we're not and we're the only things that

924
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:32,011
we know of that are conscious and so 
while we might as well go with that and 

925
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:32,011
there's no reason.
See,

926
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:36,841
I can't help but think that the constant
attempts by people to trivialize the 

927
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:40,450
nature of their own consciousness has a.
has a dark side.

928
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,150
I'm a psychoanalyst and so I always 
think that way.

929
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:44,080
It's like,
well,

930
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,430
first of all,
if you're,

931
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,580
if you as a being don't matter,
then you don't have to do anything.

932
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:52,000
It's a great justification for total 
lack of responsibility and that,

933
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,120
that really twigged something for me 
because you know,

934
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:57,910
people who are band,
let's say,

935
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,970
or vengeful or angry,
are always looking for a reason why they

936
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:02,770
don't have to be responsible for 
anything.

937
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:07,830
Plus plus it's a lot easier.
And so the notion that consciousness is 

938
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,010
trivial immediately allows you to wander
down that path.

939
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,400
And so I'm skeptical of those claims and
I also think that there's a deep hatred 

940
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,940
of humanity that underlies those claims 
as well.

941
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:18,310
And I read my youtube comments 
sometimes,

942
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:19,720
you know,
and I've always been,

943
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,570
I've always been annoyed that,
you know,

944
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,600
because I've heard like sort of radical 
clueless environmentalist say things 

945
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,210
like planet would be better off without 
people on it,

946
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:32,300
which is something that like,
you just cannot say that,

947
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:35,660
that if you say that and listen to 
yourself,

948
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:40,810
you should like go to a monastery for 
like three years and never say a word 

949
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,890
and have a shower every 10 minutes until
you've learned your lesson properly.

950
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:48,340
You know,
you can't order a more genocidal phrase 

951
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,580
the mat.
And of course you always do it in a 

952
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,280
display of your care for the world.

953
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:52,730
It's like,
well,

954
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:54,410
if we just didn't have any people,
it's like,

955
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:59,411
well,
we'll just line them all up and shoot 

956
00:50:59,411 --> 00:50:59,411
them with machine guns.
No,

957
00:50:59,411 --> 00:51:00,050
it's,
it's really sickening.

958
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:01,410
It's appalling.
It's.

959
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,490
And there's a hatred for humanity that's
at the bottom of it and I mean,

960
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:09,491
you can kind of understand why because 
we're messy and we don't clean up after 

961
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:13,361
ourselves and you know,
we're like raping the rain forests and 

962
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,511
that sort of thing.
But I do have some sympathy for people 

963
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:16,511
because,
you know,

964
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:16,511
we're,
we're,

965
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:19,310
we're hell on mother nature,
but she certainly returns the favor.

966
00:51:19,311 --> 00:51:22,340
So.
And that's a good thing to remember,

967
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:24,200
you know,
a lot of what we're doing is just bloody

968
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:29,000
well trying to exist with a relative 
minimum of pain and we're doing our best

969
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:29,990
to get,
you know,

970
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,570
to get as good at doing that as fast as 
we can.

971
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:37,570
And that's not an easy thing.
There are lots of us and like life is 

972
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,541
bloody complicated.
And the other thing that happens too is 

973
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:43,571
again,
if you scratch beneath the surface of 

974
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:43,571
people,
and this is something that's always,

975
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:44,600
you know,
to me,

976
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,330
it's been a kind of miracle is if you 
talk to someone,

977
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:50,150
they're out doing their job and maybe 
they're doing a good job at it.

978
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:52,280
Like some emergency room nurse,
you know,

979
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,830
God,
there's a job for you or maybe they work

980
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:56,480
in palliative care,
you know,

981
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:59,090
when you talk to them and you find out 
they've got like four,

982
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:04,180
as I said before,
a serious problems in their family and 

983
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,181
maybe their diabetic to boot and yet 
they haul themselves out of bed in the 

984
00:52:07,181 --> 00:52:08,210
morning and go and take care of dying 
people.

985
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:13,211
It's like good God.
People deserve a bit of respect for 

986
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:17,050
struggling forward and not always trying
to make the planet a worst place when 

987
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,140
they're beset on all sides constantly 
by,

988
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:25,141
you know,
what unending series of tragedy you 

989
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,491
think we could have a little bit of 
sympathy for ourselves as a consequence 

990
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:27,491
of that.

991
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:31,780
It's like we're not all like rapacious 
greedy monsters who are bent on just 

992
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,410
devouring everything in our path,
you know,

993
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,600
so a little bit more complicated than 
that.

994
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,000
So.
Alright.

995
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,930
Anyway,
so,

996
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:40,550
so.
Well,

997
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:42,320
so let's go to the next part of this 
here.

998
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,650
All right,
so God said,

999
00:52:45,651 --> 00:52:50,651
let there be an expanse in the midst of 
the waters and let it separate the 

1000
00:52:50,651 --> 00:52:54,131
waters from the waters.
And God made the expanse and separated 

1001
00:52:54,131 --> 00:52:57,671
the waters that were under the expanse 
from the waters that were above the 

1002
00:52:57,671 --> 00:52:59,720
expanse and it was so and God called the
expanse heaven and there was evening and

1003
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:03,620
there was morning the second day.
Well to understand that because what,

1004
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,660
how did,
that doesn't make any sense at all 

1005
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,020
really.
So I think I told you a little bit about

1006
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:10,710
this before.
So the,

1007
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:15,780
the,
the world that's being created in this 

1008
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:15,780
particular account is a phenomenological
world.

1009
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,920
There's a disk of land because if you go
out in the field and look around,

1010
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:20,930
you're on a disk of land.
So that's pretty obvious.

1011
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:25,931
And then there's a dome on top of it is 
more or less held up by the mountains 

1012
00:53:25,931 --> 00:53:28,991
and rain comes.
So there's water above the dome because 

1013
00:53:28,991 --> 00:53:28,991
where else would the rate come from?
And,

1014
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,650
and underneath the ground there's fresh 
water.

1015
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:34,440
You can drill down and find that.
And then around that there's salt water.

1016
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:39,441
And so that's the world.
And it's kind of an empirical world 

1017
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:42,711
because if you're a child and you just 
go out and field and you look at the 

1018
00:53:42,711 --> 00:53:43,080
world,
that's sort of what it would be like.

1019
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,360
And so that's the world that's being 
created.

1020
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:48,480
And so one of the things that is worth 
thinking about,

1021
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,670
this is something Carl young was very 
interested in,

1022
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:57,850
is that these old descriptions are half 
geographical and half empirical,

1023
00:53:57,851 --> 00:54:01,360
so sort of based on observation and half
psychological.

1024
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,550
So one of the things young was 
interested in,

1025
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:05,020
for example,
was astrology,

1026
00:54:05,021 --> 00:54:07,990
but mostly for a psychological reason 
because you know,

1027
00:54:07,991 --> 00:54:10,660
they're obviously there are stars up on 
the dome.

1028
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:16,050
And then when you look at the stars,
you can imagine the shapes of the stars 

1029
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,820
and that helps you orient yourself 
because as soon as you can see shapes in

1030
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:23,821
the stars,
then you can recognize the 

1031
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:23,821
constellations and you can orient 
yourself at night.

1032
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:26,260
But then the constellations become God,
say it in the gods,

1033
00:54:26,261 --> 00:54:30,670
turned into a drama.
And so and the drama comes from within.

1034
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:35,700
It's the projection of imagination.
And so when young was analyzing 

1035
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,230
astrology,
he was a matt analyzing psychology.

1036
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:43,231
Because he saw the astrological 
narrative as the projection of the human

1037
00:54:44,171 --> 00:54:47,530
imagination onto the cosmos and so when 
he was analyzing astrology,

1038
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:52,531
who is analyzing psychology and that the
same thing as the case with these 

1039
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:54,580
stories is that the world they they 
described is only,

1040
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:59,670
it's not the natural world like a 
scientist would describe it because 

1041
00:54:59,670 --> 00:54:59,670
these people weren't scientists.

1042
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,420
They didn't have the technology and the 
tools.

1043
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:06,750
It was,
it was the way they fruit for them it 

1044
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,040
was the world for us,
it's the way they saw the world.

1045
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:14,190
And so we're looking at the way they saw
the world and a lot of that psychology 

1046
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,660
and we share that psychology to a large 
degree with those people.

1047
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:21,930
So in this is psychology,
but it's interesting to know what the 

1048
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,950
geographical substrate is so that you 
can kind of understand the stories.

1049
00:55:24,951 --> 00:55:29,951
And I like this picture because that's,
it's great from a psychological 

1050
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:30,850
perspective.
So very famous picture and you know,

1051
00:55:30,851 --> 00:55:33,490
so basically what you have here is the 
world as we know it.

1052
00:55:33,491 --> 00:55:37,000
And there's the dome with the Sun and 
the moon on it and the stars.

1053
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:39,910
And then if you look outside what you 
know,

1054
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,220
well then you're out into this cosmic 
space,

1055
00:55:42,221 --> 00:55:42,520
right?

1056
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,310
And that's,
those are like the wheels of,

1057
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,260
of the planets and the music of the 
spheres.

1058
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:52,590
That's the ever present explorer who's 
gone beyond the domain that he can 

1059
00:55:52,601 --> 00:55:55,480
understand and is peering out into the 
unknown as such.

1060
00:55:55,481 --> 00:56:00,481
And it's a psychological pictures.
It's like because you do know some 

1061
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:04,741
things and then outside of that there 
are things you don't know and when 

1062
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:07,561
you're feeling brave,
you put a foot or two out where you 

1063
00:56:07,561 --> 00:56:08,770
don't understand like because there's 
frontier everywhere,

1064
00:56:08,771 --> 00:56:10,240
right?
And if you're,

1065
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:15,330
if you're feeling heroic and you want to
do something for the world and you want 

1066
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,480
to expand what you understand,
you poke your head through what you know

1067
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:18,640
when you take a look at the,
at the,

1068
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,670
at whatever structure is out there,
you know,

1069
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,640
he's pretty smart because of them is 
still where it's safe.

1070
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:29,641
And I would say that's a good,
that's a good thing because if you jump 

1071
00:56:29,641 --> 00:56:30,580
right out there,
well then maybe you fall off the edge of

1072
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:31,060
the earth.

1073
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,390
And I wouldn't precisely recommend that.
Especially if you do it accidentally,

1074
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:39,780
and to me this is a recreation of the,
of the Taoist Yin Yang symbol,

1075
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,790
you know,
with the,

1076
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:45,990
with the White Paisley here,
and that's what you know in the dark 

1077
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:49,621
paisley serpents really there,
and the right place to be is right on 

1078
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:53,431
the line between them because you're 
sort of got one foot where you 

1079
00:56:53,431 --> 00:56:55,210
understand that gives you security and 
then you know,

1080
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,010
but it's kind of dull because hey,
you know,

1081
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:59,890
everything that's going on there and 
that isn't what people are like.

1082
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,920
They don't want just security.
Dostoevsky said that in notes from the 

1083
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,470
underground,
a great,

1084
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:07,150
great book,
and he said,

1085
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,350
I love this.
It was his,

1086
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:13,650
an early critic critic,
criticism of the notion of a political 

1087
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:13,650
utopia.
He said,

1088
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:18,481
look,
if you gave people everything they 

1089
00:57:18,481 --> 00:57:20,071
wanted,
they had nothing deep but cake and 

1090
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:24,330
nothing to do,
but sit in warm pools and busy 

1091
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:24,330
themselves with the continuation of the 
species.

1092
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:29,310
That was his,
his lines that the first thing they 

1093
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,180
would do,
well maybe after the first week was like

1094
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,860
goal kind of half insane and smash 
everything up.

1095
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:34,720
Just so that something that they didn't 
expect,

1096
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:39,721
what happened so that they'd have 
something interesting to do and it's so 

1097
00:57:39,721 --> 00:57:39,910
right.
Because you know,

1098
00:57:39,911 --> 00:57:44,911
the,
the utopia notion that if you just had 

1099
00:57:44,911 --> 00:57:45,190
all the material stuff you wanted that 
you'd,

1100
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,020
you'd be,
well,

1101
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,910
what would you be?
What would you do?

1102
00:57:48,911 --> 00:57:52,120
Would you just sit on the couch and 
watch TV?

1103
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:52,640
I mean,
you,

1104
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:53,890
you'd,
you'd be,

1105
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:59,010
I don't know why you'd be cutting 
yourself just for entertainment in no 

1106
00:57:59,010 --> 00:57:59,010
time flat,
you know?

1107
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,490
And that's the sort of thing that people
do.

1108
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:05,491
And so we're not adapted for security 
and Utopia were adapted for a certain 

1109
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:07,930
amount of security because,
you know,

1110
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,980
we are vulnerable,
but mostly we want to have one foot out 

1111
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,100
where we don't know what the hell is 
going on because that's where your alert

1112
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:19,330
and alive and tents and with it and,
and you know,

1113
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:24,420
I think I believe this and I believe 
that actually has something to do with 

1114
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,120
the hemispheric structure of your,
of your,

1115
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:30,150
of the physiology of your brain is 
because the right hemisphere looks 

1116
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,360
roughly adapted to what you don't know.

1117
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,580
And the left hemisphere,
this is a very,

1118
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,920
this is an over simplification,
but a useful one,

1119
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:41,490
is adapted to the world that you do know
and the right place for you to be as 

1120
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:42,480
halfway between them.
Because that,

1121
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:47,490
and you can tell that that's what's so 
cool and this tells you that this is 

1122
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,180
actually reality that's manifesting 
itself.

1123
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:54,181
Do you know that sense of active 
engagement you have in the world when 

1124
00:58:54,181 --> 00:58:55,210
things are working well for you,
you know where you're.

1125
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,370
Where are you should be at the right 
time.

1126
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:02,580
You're alert and on top of things and 
engaged and you don't have much of a 

1127
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,391
sense of time and the sense of the 
tragedy of life sort of recedes and 

1128
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:07,720
that's when you're.
That's when you've got one foot,

1129
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:12,721
when it's where it's secure in one foot 
out in the unknown and your brain 

1130
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:16,711
signals to you that you're in the right 
place by making what you're doing 

1131
00:59:16,711 --> 00:59:16,711
meaningful.

1132
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,320
And that sense of meaning is actually a 
neurophysiological signal,

1133
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:25,321
but you've got forces of the cosmos 
properly balanced in your being at that 

1134
00:59:25,321 --> 00:59:29,801
moment.
And that's why it feels so good and it 

1135
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:29,801
will.
What else could it possibly be?

1136
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:30,820
I mean,
you know,

1137
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:31,360
our,
our,

1138
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,910
our brain is capable of looking beyond 
our vision.

1139
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,840
That's what it's for and that sense of 
engagement.

1140
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:43,841
There's no reason to assume that that's 
anything but a real signal and you can 

1141
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:44,150
reduce it.
You could say,

1142
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:49,151
well,
the problem with being where you know 

1143
00:59:49,151 --> 00:59:52,570
only is that you don't know everything 
and that's going to be a problem in the 

1144
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:56,681
future.
And the problem with being where you 

1145
00:59:56,681 --> 00:59:56,930
know nothing is that's just too much 
man.

1146
00:59:56,931 --> 01:00:01,931
Like you know,
you go into panic mode and because 

1147
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:01,931
anything can happen there and you can't 
handle it,

1148
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,160
so you got to mediate between those two 
things.

1149
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,160
You want to be secure enough so that 
your physiology isn't revving out of 

1150
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:13,001
control and you want to be out there in 
the unknown enough so that you keep 

1151
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:14,600
updating yourself constantly,
constantly,

1152
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:15,520
constantly,
and that's,

1153
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:20,690
that's the place where information flow 
is maximized and you know that because 

1154
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:24,731
that's where you are.
When you're having a really interesting 

1155
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:27,071
conversation with someone or you're 
gripped by a book or you're really into 

1156
01:00:27,071 --> 01:00:29,210
a movie or maybe something that you do 
as a,

1157
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,050
uh,
you know,

1158
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,210
apart from your work or maybe even in 
your work,

1159
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:36,320
you're into it and that's because you 
are in the right place at the right time

1160
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:38,990
in your whole nervous system is 
signaling that to you.

1161
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:42,080
And I would say that's the sort of place
that you should be all the time.

1162
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,900
If of course you can't be because no 
one's perfect,

1163
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:46,190
but it's,
that's,

1164
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:49,130
that's the recreation of paradise on 
earth.

1165
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:52,700
It's something like it because you are 
in the right place at the right time.

1166
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:54,860
When that is happening,
subject to certain,

1167
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:01,120
what would you say?
Restrictions that we can talk about 

1168
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,120
later.
Well that's what this guy is doing and,

1169
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,740
and that's I would say akin to the 
action that God is taking when he's 

1170
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,870
transforming the chaos of potential into
habitable big.

1171
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:14,050
And it's the sort of thing that human 
beings are supposed to act out and God 

1172
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:19,061
said,
let the waters under heaven be gathered 

1173
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:19,061
together into one place and let the dry 
land appear.

1174
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:23,380
And it was so god called the dry land 
earth and the waters that were gathered 

1175
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:28,421
together,
he called Seas and God saw that it was 

1176
01:01:28,421 --> 01:01:28,421
good.
Well,

1177
01:01:28,421 --> 01:01:29,780
that's an interesting thing too,
because you know,

1178
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:34,870
there's this,
there's this play written by a German 

1179
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:35,570
named Gupta.
I can never say that properly.

1180
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:39,020
It's Johan van g o e t h e,
and I can't say it,

1181
01:01:39,021 --> 01:01:44,021
but he wrote this play called Faust and 
he wrote one part of it when he was 

1182
01:01:44,021 --> 01:01:48,851
quite young and then files to when he 
was quite old and he has a character in 

1183
01:01:48,851 --> 01:01:52,391
there,
Mephistopheles and Mephistopheles the 

1184
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:54,731
devil.
And he actually has the devil explain 

1185
01:01:54,731 --> 01:01:55,040
himself twice,
basically using the same words,

1186
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:56,480
which,
which I really like.

1187
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:01,540
It was very profound.
And basically girth is memphis awfully 

1188
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:01,790
says,
you know,

1189
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:05,930
he's the adversary of the word.
That's a good way of putting it,

1190
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,570
um,
because that's how it works out.

1191
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:13,580
Mythologically,
he's the figure behind the snake in the 

1192
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,271
garden of Eden,
which is something we'll talk about 

1193
01:02:16,271 --> 01:02:16,271
more,
but he has a.

1194
01:02:16,271 --> 01:02:19,390
He has a sophisticated philosophy.
He's not just some random maker.

1195
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:24,450
He's got a.
he's got a deep philosophy and his 

1196
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:24,660
philosophy is quite straightforward and 
it's compelling,

1197
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:29,690
it's compelling,
and people are gripped by it quite 

1198
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,571
often,
far more often than they think and his 

1199
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:32,571
philosophy is,
well,

1200
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:32,571
look around at the world.

1201
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:37,570
It's like an I then Karamazov in the 
brothers Karamazov when he's trying to 

1202
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:39,870
disabuse his younger brother of being a 
a,

1203
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,830
a Christian monk.
Mephistopheles says,

1204
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:44,640
well,
look at the world.

1205
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,440
I mean,
all you look around the world,

1206
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:49,050
it's nothing but a blood bath.
It's just suffering everywhere.

1207
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:54,051
Everything eats everything and people 
die terribly and they're cruel to one 

1208
01:02:54,051 --> 01:02:58,311
another and the whole mess is nothing 
but a constant hall of terrible carnage 

1209
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:00,990
in and ruin and,
and,

1210
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:01,840
and,
and,

1211
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:03,210
and,
and rec.

1212
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:08,970
He says it it be better if it was never 
existed at all.

1213
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,940
And that's a very interesting.
That's a very,

1214
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:14,340
very interesting idea.
And I do believe,

1215
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:17,820
and I've seen this in people many times,
that in the depths of despair,

1216
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,550
especially when you've been betrayed,
for example,

1217
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,460
and you wander into the wrong 
subdivision of the underworld,

1218
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:26,760
that's something that comes to mind if 
you have a very sick child,

1219
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:31,761
for example,
or maybe your whole family is suffering 

1220
01:03:31,761 --> 01:03:31,761
as whole families do.

1221
01:03:31,761 --> 01:03:32,730
Sometimes an idea is going to come to 
you.

1222
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:37,731
It's like good God,
who put this message together and is it 

1223
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:38,100
really worth it?
Is it really worth this suffering?

1224
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,750
Suicidal people,
you know,

1225
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:42,510
they say no,
they say no enough of this.

1226
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,280
You know,
and you have to be pushed along way.

1227
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:46,890
Generally speaking before you'll 
actually commit suicide.

1228
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:49,440
You have to be in very,
very desperate straits.

1229
01:03:49,441 --> 01:03:54,441
But your answer under those conditions 
is that being is such that it would be 

1230
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:56,940
better if it had never been.
And that's a very,

1231
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:59,100
I think,
I think it's a very.

1232
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:04,160
It's a terrible philosophy,
I believe because I think what happens 

1233
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,551
if you acted out is that you make the 
very things that lead you to despair far

1234
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:10,410
worse.
And I can't see that.

1235
01:04:10,411 --> 01:04:15,411
If it's reasonable to draw a logical 
conclusion that suffering should justify

1236
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:21,481
as your desire to make being in that the
answer to that can be to produce more 

1237
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:21,600
suffering.

1238
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:26,930
It just doesn't make sense.
And my observation has been that people 

1239
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:30,981
who act out the Memphis too,
feely and philosophy inevitably make 

1240
01:04:30,981 --> 01:04:34,981
suffering far worse and so and then that
raises the specter of well do they 

1241
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:39,270
weren't being just to cease or are they 
just out for bloody revenge at every,

1242
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:44,300
at any cost.
And my conclusion has always been that 

1243
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,860
is that the mask is well being shouldn't
exist because it's too terrible,

1244
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:51,861
but the true motivation is I'm going to 
make everyone suffer as much as I 

1245
01:04:51,861 --> 01:04:52,700
possibly can before I say goodbye to 
this place.

1246
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:58,090
And if you read the writings of people 
like the kids who showed up the 

1247
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:58,440
columbine high school,
they'll tell you exactly that.

1248
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:02,640
That's precisely and exactly what they 
concluded and then acted out.

1249
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:08,060
So anyways.
But in this God says that it was good 

1250
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,751
and I've thought about that a lot is 
like because the question is something 

1251
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:10,751
like,
well,

1252
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:11,430
is it something better than nothing?

1253
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,700
Because that's a really good question,
you know,

1254
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,880
and I,
I thought about two things in 

1255
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:19,960
relationship to that and one is,
one is,

1256
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:23,440
well maybe it depends on how it is that 
you are right,

1257
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:28,470
because it could be that there are ways 
of being in the world that justify the 

1258
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:31,240
world and their ways of being in the 
world that make the world unbearable.

1259
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:36,480
And I believe that the narrative that 
runs through the biblical stories is 

1260
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,350
precisely a dialogue between those two 
types of being.

1261
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,560
And the optimistic part of the story is 
that being requires limitation and 

1262
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:45,970
suffering.
There's no escape from that.

1263
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:51,150
But there are modes of being that allow 
that to be perhaps even more than 

1264
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:55,231
tolerable.
Perhaps there are modes of being that 

1265
01:05:55,231 --> 01:05:56,110
allow that to be good and it's a 
straight and narrow road.

1266
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:58,440
It's a very difficult road to tread.
So,

1267
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,270
so I think,
well,

1268
01:05:59,271 --> 01:06:00,790
that that's possible.

1269
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,430
You know,
I'm not an optimist by nature and,

1270
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,510
but uh,
that's,

1271
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:09,560
that's one of the things that I've 
conceptualized and read about that I 

1272
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,080
actually find plausible because it's 
certainly the case.

1273
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:13,300
Everyone knows this,
that there are ways that you can act and

1274
01:06:13,301 --> 01:06:15,760
make things worse.
Everyone knows that,

1275
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:18,670
and so if that's the case,
there has to be the opposite,

1276
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:23,671
right?
There has to be ways that you could act 

1277
01:06:23,671 --> 01:06:25,841
that make things better and obviously 
you can act in ways that make things 

1278
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:28,870
really way worse and so the question is,
well,

1279
01:06:28,871 --> 01:06:32,560
are there ways that you can act and make
things really much better?

1280
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:36,100
And I think that's the question is can 
we have our cake and eat it too?

1281
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:41,310
Can we have the being that requires 
limitation and suffering and also 

1282
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:45,751
simultaneously transcend that by our 
mode of being and I believe that the 

1283
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:48,160
biblical stories and perhaps not only 
the biblical stories,

1284
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:50,710
but the biblical stories,
are they human?

1285
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:55,710
Imagine one of the human imagination is 
best attempts to address and answer that

1286
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:58,660
question.
That's what the entire story is about.

1287
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:04,020
So the first of it is the catastrophe of
the collapse of self consciousness and 

1288
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,060
the entrance of humanity into history 
and the rest of it is okay,

1289
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:10,150
now we're in history.
Now we know that we're going to die.

1290
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:15,151
We know about our mortality,
we're conscious of our own being is 

1291
01:07:15,151 --> 01:07:18,751
their emotive acting in the world that 
allows that to be justifiable or maybe 

1292
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:23,251
even more that allows that to be 
triumphant and then I would also say 

1293
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:28,080
maybe it's worth finding out.
You know that that's the other thing 

1294
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,951
that's so interesting because you've got
this short time on earth and there's 

1295
01:07:31,951 --> 01:07:35,281
lots of things that are very,
very difficult to contend with and and 

1296
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:38,440
you have the problem of tolerating 
yourself even in all your insufficiency.

1297
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:43,440
And one of the things that seems to me 
to be the case is that if you adopt a 

1298
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,490
sufficiently profound motive being,
if you attempt to do that,

1299
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:50,700
then the mere act of lifting up that 
weight is enough to justify the fact 

1300
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:53,890
that you're insufficient and mortal and,
and,

1301
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,870
and,
and bound by tragedy.

1302
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,960
And I believe that and I believe people 
believe that because if you watch how 

1303
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,461
people act,
they look for people they admire and 

1304
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:05,461
they do admire people,
right?

1305
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,230
It's a natural.
It's a natural phenomena.

1306
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:13,231
You see it starting with children being 
children admire and then they imitate 

1307
01:08:13,231 --> 01:08:17,040
and we looked to people who seem to be 
able to bear the burden being in a 

1308
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,390
heroic manner and there's something 
inside of us that calls to that and that

1309
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:23,390
makes us want to mimic that and to 
follow it.

1310
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,470
And I think that that's.

1311
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,340
I think that that's the deepest and most
profound of instincts.

1312
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:33,341
And I think it's right and even if 
you're not so convinced on the positive 

1313
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:37,211
and you know,
because it's more difficult to be 

1314
01:08:37,211 --> 01:08:39,311
convinced of the positive,
you can certainly be convinced on the 

1315
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:42,311
negative end because there are ways of 
being that are so brutal and so 

1316
01:08:42,311 --> 01:08:46,010
reprehensible that merely to read about 
them is enough to traumatize you.

1317
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:50,450
And I think that if you're a person who 
hasn't lost their soul completely,

1318
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:54,680
you can't help but encounter stories 
like that and shudder away from them.

1319
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:57,860
And you know,
Alexander Solzhenitsyn,

1320
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:02,950
who,
who was the person who did most 

1321
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:06,071
unmasked,
the absolute horrors of communist 

1322
01:09:06,071 --> 01:09:08,330
totalitarianism,
said that he believed that the Nuremberg

1323
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:11,030
judgments were the most important event 
of the 20th century.

1324
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:14,390
And that was the judgment at the end of 
World War II,

1325
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:19,420
that there were certain actions that no 
one was to undertake no matter what 

1326
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,030
their cultural background was because 
they were,

1327
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:25,240
let's say,
crimes against humanity that there was 

1328
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,780
such a thing as universal evil and you 
can debate that,

1329
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:27,480
you know,
and,

1330
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:28,340
and,
and,

1331
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:29,870
and people certainly have.

1332
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:32,090
But the problem is,
is if you debate that,

1333
01:09:32,091 --> 01:09:37,091
then you have to say that there are 
conditions under which the sorts of 

1334
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:37,760
things that happened,
say in the concentration camps,

1335
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:40,470
which would be the gassing of children 
after their torture and,

1336
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:45,710
and they're,
they're forcible removal from their 

1337
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:45,740
parents and all the terrible things that
went along with that,

1338
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,440
that that's just okay.
It's just an opinion.

1339
01:09:48,441 --> 01:09:53,441
It's just something that happened and 
there are circumstances under which 

1340
01:09:53,441 --> 01:09:54,800
that's justifiable if you,
if there's no transcendent,

1341
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,400
good and evil underneath that argument,
it's only a matter of practicality.

1342
01:09:58,730 --> 01:09:59,440
And,
and,

1343
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,230
and,
and it seems to me that that's,

1344
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:05,870
that's not the right conclusion to draw.
That's how it seems to me.

1345
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:09,410
And that's what the units and concluded 
when he looked at the Nuremberg trials.

1346
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,800
So the notion that the notion that it 
was good,

1347
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,170
well even if you don't believe that and 
you know,

1348
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:20,030
because maybe it's not as good as it 
could be,

1349
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:25,210
I would say it's incumbent on you as 
someone who participates in the process 

1350
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:25,490
of,
uh,

1351
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:30,080
furthering creation to act as if it 
couldn't be good at least.

1352
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,810
And to further that with,
with all of your efforts,

1353
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:36,500
partly because what the hell else do you
have to do that could possibly be better

1354
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:41,501
than that,
that could possibly justify your 

1355
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:41,501
existence.
More than that.

1356
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:42,350
And you know perfectly well if you,
if you,

1357
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:45,080
if you have any sense at all,
if you think clearly about it at all,

1358
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:47,690
is that that's what you want to see in 
everyone else.

1359
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:48,680
You know,
it's,

1360
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:53,720
you're,
you're desperate and maybe you're 

1361
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,230
cynical and now and then someone appears
that acts at least momentarily,

1362
01:10:54,231 --> 01:10:59,231
like a light in the darkness and that 
lifts your spirit up and gives you a 

1363
01:10:59,231 --> 01:11:00,350
little bit of hope and maybe helps you 
continue on.

1364
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,960
It's well,
that's obviously a call to being.

1365
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:03,740
It's,
it's a,

1366
01:11:03,741 --> 01:11:06,050
it's a statement from your own soul that
says,

1367
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:07,340
well,
there's something about that.

1368
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:10,430
That's how you should be,
and maybe then,

1369
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:12,110
well,
we get a chance to,

1370
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:16,550
to participate in what is good.
I've thought too,

1371
01:11:16,551 --> 01:11:20,240
you know,
well,

1372
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:23,240
we'll leave that for a little later.
And God said,

1373
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:28,270
let the earth sprout vegetation plants 
yielding seed and fruit trees bearing 

1374
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:30,590
fruit in which is their seed,
each according to its kind on the earth.

1375
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,740
And it was so and the earth brought 
forth vegetation.

1376
01:11:33,741 --> 01:11:38,741
Plants yielding seed according to their 
own kind and trees bearing fruit in 

1377
01:11:38,741 --> 01:11:40,190
which is their seed,
each according to its kind.

1378
01:11:40,191 --> 01:11:45,191
And God saw that it was good.
There was evening and there was morning 

1379
01:11:45,191 --> 01:11:45,191
the third day.

1380
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:48,150
I like that.
That's,

1381
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,140
you see,
it's interesting these old pictures say,

1382
01:11:53,141 --> 01:11:54,580
because if you look,
here you go,

1383
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:59,610
you got this halo around God's had and 
you've got the split again between night

1384
01:12:00,221 --> 01:12:03,490
and darkness and God's right on the 
border between the two.

1385
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,170
And that's the sun,
right?

1386
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:05,650
That's what,
uh,

1387
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,860
that's what a halo is.
A Halo is the sun or the moon.

1388
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:14,070
Sometimes it's like a coin,
you know you have the Queen's head on 

1389
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,250
the coin and that's the queen on the 
moon and it's and it's silver and it's a

1390
01:12:15,251 --> 01:12:20,251
symbol of value because of course the 
queen is sovereign and the moon is the 

1391
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,320
sovereign of the night.
Sky and gold of course is the sudden and

1392
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:26,440
gold is pure because it doesn't mix with
other metals and it shines like the sun,

1393
01:12:26,441 --> 01:12:31,441
so it partakes of the son and God 
partakes of the sun because there's 

1394
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:34,450
something about whatever he represents 
that's associated with consciousness and

1395
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:37,840
illumination and enlightenment.
And it's that force of illumination.

1396
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,730
Enlightenment that's right on the border
between these two sets of phenomena.

1397
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:46,731
And that's.
That's kind of what that picture is 

1398
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:46,731
trying to present.
And so you know,

1399
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:48,490
it's a metaphor.
That's one way of thinking about it,

1400
01:12:48,491 --> 01:12:53,491
but it does again allude to the 
underlying idea that there's something 

1401
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:56,050
about consciousness that's integral to,
to being itself.

1402
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:02,450
And God said,
let there be lights in the expanse of 

1403
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,551
the heavens to separate the date from 
the night and let them be for signs and 

1404
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:04,650
for seasons.
And for days.

1405
01:13:04,651 --> 01:13:05,820
And for years,
I mean,

1406
01:13:05,821 --> 01:13:10,821
that's a,
that's a remarkable bit of a bit of a 

1407
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:13,850
writing there too,
because you just think about how bloody 

1408
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,251
long it took our caveman ancestors to 
look at the night sky and start to 

1409
01:13:16,251 --> 01:13:20,481
figure out that there were repeating 
patterns across years that enabled them 

1410
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:21,060
to mark the seasons.
I mean,

1411
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:23,250
I just can't imagine how they figured 
that out.

1412
01:13:23,251 --> 01:13:27,150
It's that the degree of careful 
observation that it took.

1413
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:32,210
And I mean,
we know people figured that out a long 

1414
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:32,210
time ago because,
uh,

1415
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:32,210
uh,
you know,

1416
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:36,741
those great megalithic monuments,
like stonehenge seemed to be 

1417
01:13:36,741 --> 01:13:40,820
astronomical observatories essentially.
And you'll see the same thing with the 

1418
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:40,820
pyramids.
I mean,

1419
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,110
people were looking at the damn sky 
trying to figure out,

1420
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:44,370
looking at God,
you know,

1421
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:49,380
because that's kind of what you're doing
when you're looking at the night sky 

1422
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:49,980
trying to figure out the regularity to 
order in the universe.

1423
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,290
And that's all compacted into this 
little light,

1424
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:57,291
you know,
and let them be for signs and for 

1425
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:58,020
seasons to be oriented by the stars.
Amazing.

1426
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:03,650
And then let them be lights in the 
expanse of Heavens to give light upon 

1427
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:04,410
the earth,
and it was so and God made the two great

1428
01:14:04,411 --> 01:14:09,411
lights,
the greater light to rule the day and 

1429
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:12,530
the lesser light to rule the night and 
the stars and God set them in the 

1430
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:15,051
expanse of the heavens to give light on 
the earth to rule over the day and over 

1431
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:19,441
the night.
And so there's an idea of sovereignty 

1432
01:14:19,441 --> 01:14:19,441
there too,
right?

1433
01:14:19,441 --> 01:14:19,441
That,
that,

1434
01:14:19,441 --> 01:14:23,210
that there's an analogy between the 
ruler and the and the heavenly bodies 

1435
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,660
that that light up the light up the 
darkness essentially.

1436
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:30,661
And that's a really interesting idea too
because it took us a long time to come 

1437
01:14:30,661 --> 01:14:31,390
to terms with,
as I mentioned last week,

1438
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:36,391
to come to terms with the idea of 
sovereignty itself and to decide what 

1439
01:14:36,391 --> 01:14:37,300
constituted valid power.

1440
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:39,850
And it's not power.
It's not power.

1441
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,580
It's authority and competence and not 
power.

1442
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:47,581
It's not dominance either.
It's more sophisticated than that 

1443
01:14:47,581 --> 01:14:51,031
because the people that you want to rule
aren't people who have power because 

1444
01:14:51,031 --> 01:14:52,960
power just means I can hurt you and you 
can't hurt me back.

1445
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:54,240
That's,
that's not that,

1446
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:59,380
that's not what you need from a ruler,
even though devolves into that from time

1447
01:14:59,501 --> 01:15:02,230
to time.
What you want is the kind of wisdom that

1448
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:05,970
illuminates the darkness and to 
associate the sovereign with the,

1449
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:11,130
with a heavenly kings of the light is a 
perfectly reasonable thing to do from a 

1450
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,520
metaphoric perspective.
That's an ancient,

1451
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,930
ancient idea,
you know,

1452
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:18,931
and another example of how we're 
grounded in a dream and God set them in 

1453
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:23,731
the expanse of heavens to give light on 
the earth to rule over the day and the 

1454
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:24,160
night and to separate the light from the
darkness.

1455
01:15:24,161 --> 01:15:25,630
And God saw that it was good.

1456
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:28,210
Now their emphasis on the fact that it 
was better,

1457
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:30,820
that there was something than nothing.
And you know,

1458
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:35,970
maybe you could,
maybe you could consider that the 

1459
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:36,160
declaration of the cosmos is something 
like,

1460
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:41,310
well,
it's better that there's something than 

1461
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:41,310
nothing and well,
how do you know that?

1462
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,060
And I guess the answer to that is that 
there's something instead of nothing.

1463
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:45,610
And I know that that's not proof,
but,

1464
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,850
but it's still a remarkable fact that it
happens to be the case.

1465
01:15:48,851 --> 01:15:52,900
And no one does know why that is and so 
maybe we should go along with it and see

1466
01:15:52,901 --> 01:15:54,280
what we can do with it,
you know,

1467
01:15:54,281 --> 01:15:58,480
and see how we could make it better 
because we certainly could if we were,

1468
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:02,770
if we were really committed to it and we
shook our resentment and our,

1469
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:08,130
our anger and our hatred and I know 
there's reason for all of that because 

1470
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,550
people do suffer terribly,
but you know,

1471
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:12,820
God only knows what being could be like 
if we all contributed,

1472
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:17,821
it,
contributed to it to the best of our 

1473
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:18,460
ability.
God only knows what we could conquer and

1474
01:16:18,461 --> 01:16:23,461
what sort of magnificent cities we can 
produce and what things we could we 

1475
01:16:23,461 --> 01:16:24,190
could eradicate from,
from,

1476
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,020
from the suffering of the world.

1477
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,600
Thanks.

1478
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:35,750
And there was,
you know,

1479
01:16:35,751 --> 01:16:39,440
there's this guy I read about this,
this is amazing and I don't remember his

1480
01:16:39,441 --> 01:16:40,200
name,
but he,

1481
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,200
he found out about this worm that was 
called the Guinea worm.

1482
01:16:43,201 --> 01:16:48,201
And Guinea worm is a really horrible 
thing and you can look it up if you 

1483
01:16:48,201 --> 01:16:51,161
want.
But I'll tell you a little bit about it 

1484
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:52,601
even though it's very distasteful.
So Guinea worm is a parasite that lives 

1485
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:54,740
in Africa to burrows under your skin and
it's quite long.

1486
01:16:54,741 --> 01:16:58,820
It's about that long and it's about that
wide and so it'll burrow underneath your

1487
01:16:58,821 --> 01:17:00,500
leg and then it's in there,
you know,

1488
01:17:00,501 --> 01:17:02,480
and maybe it posts this little head out 
a whole,

1489
01:17:02,481 --> 01:17:04,460
which is one of its delightful 
tendencies.

1490
01:17:04,461 --> 01:17:06,980
And then if you want to pull it out it 
breaks,

1491
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:12,550
right?
Because obviously otherwise you'd just 

1492
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,550
pull

1493
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,550
it out and it would be dead and so it 
doesn't like that.

1494
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:15,980
So it just breaks off and many,
many people had this horrible disease,

1495
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:18,080
you know,
and did it while you can,

1496
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:23,140
you can't imagine what that would be 
like because you're a part of the one 

1497
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:23,600
percent and you live in North America 
and thank God for that.

1498
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:24,950
But you know,
just a little.

1499
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:26,720
Imagine you don't even want to think 
about it,

1500
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:31,721
let alone habit.
And he went to Africa and wipe the damn 

1501
01:17:31,721 --> 01:17:31,721
thing out.
It's like crow.

1502
01:17:31,721 --> 01:17:31,721
Great.
You know,

1503
01:17:31,721 --> 01:17:34,220
it seems to me the planet,
it's a lot better off without any Guinea

1504
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:39,221
worms on it.
Even though that's like Guinea worm 

1505
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:39,221
genocide talk.
I'm still,

1506
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:40,040
you know,
pretty happy about it.

1507
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,920
And so that was,
that was one guy who thought,

1508
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:44,960
well,
we don't need these things and yeah,

1509
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:45,770
well fair enough.

1510
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:50,290
Yeah.
Well,

1511
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,410
so good for him.
Like,

1512
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:56,411
you know,
I mean he can die thinking that the 

1513
01:17:56,411 --> 01:17:56,411
world's a better place than it was when 
he first popped out and so,

1514
01:17:56,411 --> 01:17:57,720
so good for that.
That's,

1515
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:59,930
I think that's a good.
That's a good aim,

1516
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:04,931
you know,
I think is to think that when you're on 

1517
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:05,390
your deathbed and you can look back and 
think,

1518
01:18:05,391 --> 01:18:08,480
well there's a little less suffering in 
the world from here on out.

1519
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:11,600
Then there would be if I had never 
existed and that's a lot better than the

1520
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:13,610
opposite because it's certainly 
possible.

1521
01:18:13,611 --> 01:18:17,390
Say if your stolen to ensure that there 
is a hell of a lot more suffering in the

1522
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:22,391
world and there would have been if you 
hadn't lived and we perfectly well know 

1523
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:22,850
that people can manage that and that 
many,

1524
01:18:22,851 --> 01:18:27,530
many people try to do nothing but manage
precisely that.

1525
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:32,830
So.
And it's hard for me not to think about 

1526
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:35,081
that as some sort of metaphysical evil 
and I think it's the right way to look 

1527
01:18:35,081 --> 01:18:39,011
at it.
And there was evening and there was 

1528
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:40,661
morning the fourth day.
So you have the sun here and then the 

1529
01:18:43,271 --> 01:18:44,470
moon here as far as I can.

1530
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:51,540
Yeah.

1531
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,530
Actually I think this is the moon over 
here.

1532
01:18:53,531 --> 01:18:53,590
Right?

1533
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,300
But,

1534
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,660
so yeah.
And that's part of the Sistine Chapel,

1535
01:18:58,661 --> 01:18:59,320
which is,
you know,

1536
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,740
an absolutely remarkable.
No part of the reason too,

1537
01:19:02,741 --> 01:19:05,650
in the part of the reason I'm teaching 
about these biblical stories is because,

1538
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:08,320
you know,
I'm thinking because the humanities have

1539
01:19:08,321 --> 01:19:09,850
been decimated so badly.
And,

1540
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,080
and,
and again,

1541
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:14,140
I think that has mostly to do with 
resentment and hatred more than anything

1542
01:19:14,141 --> 01:19:19,141
else,
but I don't really think that you can 

1543
01:19:19,141 --> 01:19:20,911
get a grip on the humanities and what 
they have to offer without knowing the 

1544
01:19:20,911 --> 01:19:24,751
biblical stories because they're the,
they're the dream out of which the 

1545
01:19:24,751 --> 01:19:27,871
humanities emerge.
And so unless you have that background 

1546
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:27,871
knowledge,
that dream,

1547
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:32,820
then there's all sorts of things that 
are utterly profound that don't open 

1548
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:36,331
themselves up to you.
And Dante's inferno would be one of 

1549
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:38,941
those Milton's paradise lost,
which is an absolutely amazing piece of 

1550
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:38,941
work.
I mean,

1551
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:42,310
Milton wrote it because he wanted to 
justify the ways of God to man,

1552
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:44,410
you know,
what an ambition that is.

1553
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:47,140
And I mean he was serious about that.
He took the problem seriously.

1554
01:19:47,141 --> 01:19:49,900
It's like it's the Memphis to feely and 
problem is that,

1555
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:55,110
well,
this is a rough business that we're 

1556
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,110
involved in and you know,
maybe maybe we should just give it up.

1557
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:59,730
I think the world,
the whole world I think was deciding 

1558
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:02,191
that in the 19 eighties when we were 
deciding whether we're going to engage 

1559
01:20:02,191 --> 01:20:03,400
in the ultimate nuclear catastrophe,
you know,

1560
01:20:03,401 --> 01:20:06,160
and we were very,
very close to that a number of times and

1561
01:20:06,161 --> 01:20:10,080
I think it was a decision in some sense 
on the part of humanity that we might as

1562
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:13,560
well keep the whole awful game going 
rather than just demolish it.

1563
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:14,670
But,
um,

1564
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,470
but you know,
Milton,

1565
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:19,410
he wrote paradise lost too.
It's dream again.

1566
01:20:19,411 --> 01:20:24,411
It's a dream.
And trying to explain the nature of 

1567
01:20:24,411 --> 01:20:27,501
being in the nature of evil and you 
can't crack the damn thing without 

1568
01:20:27,501 --> 01:20:27,720
knowing the underlying stories.

1569
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:31,530
And that's really too bad because it's 
utterly profound and the reason you need

1570
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:36,531
profound things as far as I can tell you
need profound knowledge is because life 

1571
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,310
is actually a profound problem for 
everyone.

1572
01:20:38,311 --> 01:20:43,311
I mean you can shelter back and live a 
very conservative existence and look 

1573
01:20:43,311 --> 01:20:45,120
like more power to you.
I understand why you would do that,

1574
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:50,121
but it doesn't stop you from having to 
face the ultimate questions of life 

1575
01:20:50,121 --> 01:20:54,320
right there,
right there in everyone's face and at 

1576
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:54,780
least at some point in your life.
And it would be better if you could.

1577
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:59,870
I think if you could confront them full 
on and end to deal with them properly 

1578
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:01,740
and to be a beacon of strength as a 
consequence of that.

1579
01:21:01,741 --> 01:21:05,430
It's and it's.
And I think that wisdom,

1580
01:21:05,431 --> 01:21:07,440
that's what the humanities are supposed 
to teach.

1581
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:12,441
His wisdom and wisdom is what enables 
you to deal honorably with the tragedy 

1582
01:21:12,441 --> 01:21:12,441
of life.

1583
01:21:12,441 --> 01:21:17,150
And I think you.
I can't see how you could think that 

1584
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:19,821
that was a bad idea because they're 
going to be times when you're in an 

1585
01:21:19,821 --> 01:21:23,091
emergency room and you know,
prone to panic and to and to cry and to 

1586
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:26,901
break down into and to collapse and to 
be of no use to anyone around you and 

1587
01:21:26,901 --> 01:21:30,890
that's not the right way to be.
It's the right way to be in a situation 

1588
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:34,221
like that is too strong and reliable and
I don't think you can do that without 

1589
01:21:34,221 --> 01:21:37,581
being wise and you can't be wise without
putting yourself together without 

1590
01:21:37,581 --> 01:21:41,661
knowing something about where you came 
from and what you're like and that 

1591
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:43,290
that's history and the humanities.
And so this isn't optional.

1592
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,660
It's,
it's more necessary.

1593
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:49,200
The man does not live by bread alone and
that's exactly the issue here.

1594
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,870
So you see these magnificent works,
you know,

1595
01:21:51,871 --> 01:21:54,360
I mean there's a,
there's,

1596
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,600
it's not like Michelangelo thought of 
this literally,

1597
01:21:57,601 --> 01:22:02,601
you know,
he was a genius for God's sake and he's 

1598
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:04,170
trying to get at something and he's 
trying to get at the profundity of human

1599
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:04,650
culture.

1600
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:09,650
I suppose that's why you have this 
patriarchal figure here and that the 

1601
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:13,330
cosmic role,
that consciousness and tradition plays 

1602
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:14,670
in being itself and it's ennobling and 
you know what you think.

1603
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:18,930
People religious or not people,
hundreds of millions of people come from

1604
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:23,931
all over the world to Rome and go 
through this little tiny chapel to look 

1605
01:22:23,931 --> 01:22:27,441
at this.
There's something in it that everyone 

1606
01:22:27,441 --> 01:22:27,441
needs to see.
You know,

1607
01:22:27,441 --> 01:22:28,410
it's not just beauty.
It's more than beauty.

1608
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:33,411
It's,
it's that which feeds the soul and and 

1609
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:36,981
everyone feels that even if they can't 
explain it so and God said,

1610
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:41,100
let the waters swarm with swarms of 
living creatures and let birds fly above

1611
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:42,930
the earth,
across the expanse of the heavens.

1612
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:48,140
So God created the great sea creatures 
and every living creature that moves 

1613
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:51,591
with which the waters swarm according to
their kinds and every winged bird 

1614
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:51,630
according to its kind.

1615
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:54,930
And God saw that it was good and God 
blessed them.

1616
01:22:55,110 --> 01:23:00,110
Saying,
be fruitful and multiply and fill the 

1617
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:00,110
waters in the seas and let birds 
multiply on the earth.

1618
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:02,820
And there was evening and there was 
morning the fifth day.

1619
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:08,450
And God said,
let the earth bring forth living 

1620
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:09,340
creatures according to their kinds 
livestock and creeping beasts,

1621
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:12,190
creeping things and beasts of the earth 
according to their kinds.

1622
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:17,340
And it was so and God made the beast of 
the earth according to their kinds and 

1623
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:20,170
the livestock according to their kinds 
and everything that creeps on the ground

1624
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,240
according to its kind kind,
right?

1625
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:23,350
That's kin,
right?

1626
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:26,470
And to be kind is to treat others as if 
they're your kid.

1627
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:30,100
And so according to its kind and God saw
that it was good.

1628
01:23:30,101 --> 01:23:33,110
That's continually continually,
um,

1629
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:38,250
re presented over and over.
God said that's the thing that calls 

1630
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:38,620
being into existence.

1631
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:43,620
And God said it was good.
And that's the fundamental judgment 

1632
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:43,620
about the nature of reality.
And you know,

1633
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,450
one of the things that happens in the,
in the translation,

1634
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,560
in the movement,
let's say,

1635
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:49,360
from the Old Testament to the New 
Testament,

1636
01:23:49,361 --> 01:23:53,710
is God is obviously blessing creation in
the beginning of this story.

1637
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,010
And then you have old testament God and 
like don't mess around with him,

1638
01:23:57,011 --> 01:23:58,570
right?
Because he'll give you a good smiting if

1639
01:23:58,571 --> 01:24:03,571
you get out of line.
There is no doubt about that and he's 

1640
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:03,571
kind of an arbitrary character and you 
know,

1641
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:04,360
lots of modern people think,
well,

1642
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:06,010
how could you believe in a God like 
that?

1643
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:07,660
And it's like when I read that,
I think,

1644
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:13,020
well,
the Old Testament people that isn't how 

1645
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,931
they thought.
They thought you better look the hell 

1646
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:15,990
out because life is really difficult and
if you step out of line,

1647
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
you're going to get flattened and God 
doesn't care in some sense whether you 

1648
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,000
approve of him.

1649
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,530
It's like,
what the hell does that have to do with 

1650
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:25,530
anything?
Obviously you don't approve.

1651
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:27,310
It's like you better pay attention 
though because otherwise you're going to

1652
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:32,311
be in real trouble and that there's real
wisdom in that niche of thought that it 

1653
01:24:32,311 --> 01:24:36,490
nature really admired the old testament 
as a work of literature because he 

1654
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:37,360
thought that the representation of the 
divine,

1655
01:24:37,361 --> 01:24:42,361
let's say as a representation of,
of the essential nature of being was 

1656
01:24:42,361 --> 01:24:45,280
extraordinarily accurate and it's 
arbitrary and often cruel.

1657
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:50,281
Nature wasn't following a morality that 
human beings could really understand as 

1658
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:56,041
moral,
but he thought that was very realistic 

1659
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:56,650
and I like that interpretation.
But what happens in the New Testament is

1660
01:24:56,651 --> 01:25:01,651
quite interesting because there's an 
insistence all of a sudden in the new 

1661
01:25:01,651 --> 01:25:05,341
testament that you're supposed to act 
towards God as if he's nothing but good,

1662
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,100
and that's such a strange thing because 
you know,

1663
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:13,660
you look at the world and you think are 
really just good a well,

1664
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:18,280
the cancer and the earthquakes is kind 
of hard to fit into that picture and you

1665
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:23,281
know,
the terrible things that happened to 

1666
01:25:23,281 --> 01:25:23,281
children and all of that is very 
difficult to square with the notion of a

1667
01:25:23,281 --> 01:25:24,730
good God obviously.

1668
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:30,720
But then there's the under.
The underlying idea is that if you act 

1669
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:34,540
in that manner,
it makes it more likely to be true.

1670
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:39,750
It's something like that.
And so it's that I would consider that 

1671
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:39,750
in some sense,
inactive,

1672
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:44,340
both courage and faith.
It's like you're going to make the case 

1673
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,130
like God makes at the beginning of the 
Bible.

1674
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:50,370
That being is in fact good.
Now you can't see it because you get to 

1675
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:52,780
see all the things about it that aren't 
so good.

1676
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:56,590
That's not the point.
It's a metaphysical presupposition.

1677
01:25:56,591 --> 01:25:57,520
Something like that.
It's an.

1678
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:02,620
It's a decision to act that way.
I'm going to act as if being as good and

1679
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:03,890
to further that,

1680
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,800
and then the implicit idea is,
well,

1681
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:11,801
there isn't anything.
There isn't any way that you can make 

1682
01:26:11,801 --> 01:26:14,681
things work out better than to do that,
and so there's a current courageous 

1683
01:26:14,681 --> 01:26:17,000
element to it,
which I think has also expressed to some

1684
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:21,620
degree in the idea of Christ's like 
voluntary sacrifice of his own life.

1685
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:26,621
His presupposition was something like,
I'm going to act as if God is good and 

1686
01:26:26,621 --> 01:26:31,391
I'm going to play that out right to the 
end and now that becomes something like 

1687
01:26:31,391 --> 01:26:34,340
a divine pattern and I believe there's 
wisdom in that because again,

1688
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,820
most of the time that I've been 
wrestling with this sort of thing,

1689
01:26:37,821 --> 01:26:39,470
I've always been looking at the 
opposite.

1690
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:44,510
I haven't been studying good.
I've been studying evil because evil is 

1691
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:45,770
easier to believe.
Especially after the 20th century.

1692
01:26:45,771 --> 01:26:50,771
It's like I think you have to be.
You have to be blind not to think about 

1693
01:26:50,771 --> 01:26:55,481
the things that happened in the 20th 
century as evil and and some of the 

1694
01:26:55,481 --> 01:26:57,080
things that happened were so brutally.

1695
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:00,500
It's just absolutely unimaginable and 
well,

1696
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:03,780
unless you imagine it and and it's,
it's,

1697
01:27:03,781 --> 01:27:08,781
it's right there.
It's part of the historical record and 

1698
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:08,781
then I think,
well,

1699
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:10,780
if there's something that that's,
that's that terrible.

1700
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:15,850
It indicates as clearly as anything can 
that there's also something that's its 

1701
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:20,801
opposite and that's whatever it is 
that's the farthest away possible from 

1702
01:27:20,801 --> 01:27:23,390
that outcome.
Now that doesn't mean we can exactly say

1703
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:28,391
what it is because it's easier to grip 
in some sense what it means to torture 

1704
01:27:28,391 --> 01:27:33,311
and break and hurt and not to be able to
conceptualize so clearly how you would 

1705
01:27:33,311 --> 01:27:36,020
have to act if you are acting in the 
exact opposite manner,

1706
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:41,030
but at least it implies that it exists 
and I see that pattern being laid out in

1707
01:27:41,031 --> 01:27:46,031
this dreamlike manner in the new 
testament and it has something to do 

1708
01:27:46,031 --> 01:27:46,031
with it.
Well,

1709
01:27:46,031 --> 01:27:48,530
it has something to do and this is for 
sure with the,

1710
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:51,500
with the voluntary acceptance of 
mortality,

1711
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,840
because of course that's the poisoned 
apple,

1712
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:54,110
right?

1713
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:57,860
The fact that everybody looks forward 
into the future to know that your finite

1714
01:27:57,861 --> 01:28:02,861
and so as everything that you love and 
it's very difficult for that not to 

1715
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:06,101
poison your existence and while there's 
no getting out of it as far as we can 

1716
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:11,261
tell,
but there might be something like 

1717
01:28:11,261 --> 01:28:11,261
switching your attitude to it and you 
could say,

1718
01:28:11,261 --> 01:28:15,101
well,
that's the price you pay for being and 

1719
01:28:15,101 --> 01:28:17,921
they're heroic thing to do is to accept 
that and not even to accept it 

1720
01:28:17,921 --> 01:28:17,960
grudgingly to say,
all right,

1721
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:22,961
I'm going to go along with that.
I'm going to accept that and I'm going 

1722
01:28:22,961 --> 01:28:26,231
to act nonetheless as if being is good 
and then I'm going to see how things 

1723
01:28:26,231 --> 01:28:30,881
turn out.
It's something like that and God saw 

1724
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:31,790
that it was good and so it's an act of 
courage,

1725
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:32,690
right?
There's a,

1726
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:37,730
there's a,
there's an act of courage that's 

1727
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:39,401
associated with that transformation of 
attitude and even with regards to the 

1728
01:28:39,401 --> 01:28:41,270
notion that the world is good.
It's a courageous attitude,

1729
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:46,660
especially given that there's so much 
evidence that makes that conclusion 

1730
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:51,070
difficult to continually draw,
but the alternative seems to me to be 

1731
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:51,560
far worse.

1732
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:58,810
So there's God again with the sun behind
him because he's associated with the 

1733
01:28:58,911 --> 01:29:02,490
solar consciousness and he's creating 
all these strange,

1734
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:05,540
wonderful creatures and,
and you know,

1735
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,440
it's a.
and people say,

1736
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:07,800
well,
you know,

1737
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:11,280
the idea of God as a,
as an old man in the sky,

1738
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:16,281
let's say that's primitive.
It's much more better to think about it 

1739
01:29:16,281 --> 01:29:20,210
as a much more better Jesus anyways.
It's more sophisticated to think,

1740
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:27,230
to think of the divine essence as a 
disembodied spirit or something like 

1741
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:27,230
that.
But you know,

1742
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:31,370
that's not.
So that's not so obvious either because 

1743
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:34,190
as I already pointed out,
there isn't anything that's more 

1744
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:34,200
complicated than a human being.
And,

1745
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:39,030
and so the idea that the divine is 
something that's at least as complicated

1746
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:44,031
as a human beings strikes me as 
something that's actually quite 

1747
01:29:44,031 --> 01:29:44,550
reasonable.
And I know it's a metaphor,

1748
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:49,551
although I don't know to what degree it 
is a metaphor and it's also something 

1749
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:49,551
that's embodied.

1750
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,630
And I really,
that's also a very interesting notion,

1751
01:29:51,631 --> 01:29:54,090
you know,
because it's become increasingly obvious

1752
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:57,840
as we've tried to do such things as 
produce artificial intelligence,

1753
01:29:57,841 --> 01:30:02,841
that it's very difficult to produce an 
intelligence or perhaps a consciousness 

1754
01:30:02,841 --> 01:30:05,210
that isn't the embodied in some manner.
It,

1755
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:07,800
it can't be just,
it can't be just a spirit,

1756
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:12,830
a spirit without form.
And I think that's part of the reason 

1757
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:14,340
too,
why Christianity put so much emphasis at

1758
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:16,410
the end of time on the resurrection of 
the body.

1759
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,120
Because there,
there's,

1760
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,310
there's a,
there's a drive in there too.

1761
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:23,760
He noble to ignoble the idea of the 
body,

1762
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:27,870
not just the spirit,
the consciousness that floats abstractly

1763
01:30:27,871 --> 01:30:32,871
above the body,
but to say that knowing you can't do 

1764
01:30:32,871 --> 01:30:35,781
that,
you can't just shed that part of you 

1765
01:30:35,781 --> 01:30:35,781
that's heavy and materials,
so to speak,

1766
01:30:35,781 --> 01:30:37,530
and leave it behind as if it's of no 
value.

1767
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:39,630
You have to ennoble ennoble that as 
well.

1768
01:30:39,631 --> 01:30:44,631
And that idea is also linked to the note
to the representation of God as as a 

1769
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:50,031
human being and as a wise human being 
and as something that's embodied and so 

1770
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:55,680
for,
at least from the metaphorical 

1771
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:55,680
perspective,
I don't think it's reasonable just to to

1772
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,360
brush your hands across it and say,
well that's,

1773
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,700
that's primitive because I don't think 
it is.

1774
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:03,930
I don't think it's primitive at all.
And then God said,

1775
01:31:03,931 --> 01:31:07,500
let us make man in our image after our 
likeness.

1776
01:31:07,501 --> 01:31:09,450
And it's our.
Because while this is,

1777
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:12,930
this is part of the priestly story,
there's,

1778
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:18,140
as I said,
a number of sources for the old 

1779
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:18,150
testament and in the priestly version,
if I remember correctly,

1780
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:20,400
it's below him.
That may be wrong.

1781
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:25,550
It doesn't matter,
but the precisely it doesn't matter 

1782
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:28,611
because the notion is is that the God 
who's in the background of this story 

1783
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:31,020
has a kind of plurality of being right.

1784
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:35,640
And it looks like the idea of monotheism
arose with great difficulty across time.

1785
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:40,910
Because there are lots of powers.
And the idea that there's a power of 

1786
01:31:41,341 --> 01:31:44,460
powers was something that it wasn't easy
for people to figure out,

1787
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:49,520
you know,
and it because what's what's constant 

1788
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,180
across sources of power or some kind of 
mega power,

1789
01:31:51,181 --> 01:31:54,810
but it's hard to figure out what that is
and that's what's being represented by,

1790
01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:00,260
by the movement,
as far as I can tell from polytheism to 

1791
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:00,260
monotheism.
It's,

1792
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:04,480
it's the first,
the observation that there are powers 

1793
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,410
that determine the destiny of people,
at least in part that you're,

1794
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,470
that you're subject to.
And then the idea that there's something

1795
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:10,990
common across all those powers that you 
can represent,

1796
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:16,020
partly say with the idea of the Sun 
rising in the morning and finding its 

1797
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:19,951
way out of the darkness at night and 
that that's associated with 

1798
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:20,800
consciousness and sovereignty is very,
very see.

1799
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:26,100
One of the things that bothers me about 
simple minded atheism and I would say 

1800
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:31,231
the simple minded atheism is of the sort
that regards these stories as nothing 

1801
01:32:31,231 --> 01:32:32,620
but simple superstitions is that it's 
very,

1802
01:32:32,621 --> 01:32:36,010
very poorly informed because whatever 
these stories are,

1803
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:38,320
they are not merely simple 
superstitions.

1804
01:32:38,321 --> 01:32:43,321
They weren't conjured up by some cabell 
of priests to bamboozle the masses even 

1805
01:32:43,421 --> 01:32:45,730
though they were used for that purposes 
from time to time.

1806
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:46,840
It's.
It's much,

1807
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:51,870
much more complicated than that.
They have a very ancient lineage and 

1808
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:53,290
they're tied together with all sorts of 
other stories and there's.

1809
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:58,380
There's an emergent wisdom in them and 
and I think the right way to view them 

1810
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:02,641
is as the birthplace of sophisticated 
philosophical ideas and so you have to 

1811
01:33:02,641 --> 01:33:04,360
wrestle with these stories.
You can't just,

1812
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:09,760
you and I said already that I'm going to
be as rational as I possibly can in my 

1813
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,471
discussion of these stories and not 
refer to anything metaphysical except 

1814
01:33:13,471 --> 01:33:17,191
when that's absolutely necessary,
even though I don't want to eliminate 

1815
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:20,731
the possibility of a metaphysical 
reality because I think that's 

1816
01:33:20,731 --> 01:33:20,731
premature,
but,

1817
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:25,180
but you have to take the story seriously
if you're going to,

1818
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:26,530
if you're,
if you're going to,

1819
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:28,900
if you're going to approach the problem 
properly,

1820
01:33:28,901 --> 01:33:32,260
you can't just casually dismiss them.
It's not appropriate.

1821
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:35,290
And so,
so let us make man in our image.

1822
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,630
That's a very interesting idea and like 
I said,

1823
01:33:37,631 --> 01:33:42,631
it's not easy to understand how it was 
that human beings came up with the idea 

1824
01:33:42,631 --> 01:33:46,930
that US lowly creatures were so with the
Mesopotamians for example,

1825
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:49,000
and the Greeks were like this to human 
beings,

1826
01:33:49,001 --> 01:33:52,180
weren't God like they were the play 
things of the gods,

1827
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,320
right?
They were.

1828
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:56,530
They were just the gods just tortured us
for their amusement,

1829
01:33:56,531 --> 01:34:01,531
you know,
love and hatred and anger and all those 

1830
01:34:01,531 --> 01:34:01,531
powerful forces.
We were just.

1831
01:34:01,531 --> 01:34:06,450
We were just playing things to the gods.
There wasn't anything particularly 

1832
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:09,391
divine about us.
The notion that that in some sense we 

1833
01:34:09,391 --> 01:34:12,301
partake of the divine is that's a 
staggering idea and you don't want to 

1834
01:34:12,301 --> 01:34:16,680
underestimate the difficulty that there 
was an abstracting that or the utility 

1835
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,580
of that idea for our current mode of 
being,

1836
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:24,390
let them have dominion over the fish of 
the sea and over the birds of the 

1837
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:27,211
heavens and over the livestock and all 
the earth and over every creeping thing 

1838
01:34:27,211 --> 01:34:27,211
that creeps on the earth.

1839
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:33,530
So God created man in his own image,
in the image of God.

1840
01:34:33,531 --> 01:34:35,600
He created him,
male and female.

1841
01:34:35,601 --> 01:34:39,020
He created them.
That's interesting because there is more

1842
01:34:39,021 --> 01:34:41,630
than one creation story in genesis and 
in this story,

1843
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:44,420
males and females are basically created 
at the same time.

1844
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:49,040
Later Eve is extracted out of Adam and 
we'll talk about that,

1845
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:54,041
but not here.
It's the two sexes are generated 

1846
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:55,670
simultaneously and they both carry 
within them the divine stamp,

1847
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:57,980
which is very egalitarian,
very

1848
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,980
appropriate,
and I think unbelievably advanced that 

1849
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:03,410
that's what it looks like to me and God 
blessed them.

1850
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:08,620
Well,
that's a good thing and God said to 

1851
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:11,021
them,
be fruitful and multiply and fill the 

1852
01:35:11,021 --> 01:35:12,821
earth and subdue it and have dominion 
over the fish of the sea and over the 

1853
01:35:12,821 --> 01:35:16,180
birds of the heavens and over every 
living thing that moves on the earth and

1854
01:35:16,181 --> 01:35:21,181
there's God creating Adam and eve and 
they're looking pretty happy about the 

1855
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:21,740
whole thing.

1856
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:28,020
And that's Michelangelo's famous Sistine
Chapel Representation.

1857
01:35:28,021 --> 01:35:29,890
And there's some cool things about this.
I mean,

1858
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:35,080
you've got to wonder is this.
This is an aside and I don't know if 

1859
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:37,830
it's a credible aside,
but it's an interesting aside,

1860
01:35:37,831 --> 01:35:39,420
so that's,
that's a form of credible.

1861
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:41,580
What the Hell is God doing?
In this thing,

1862
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:42,750
no,
I mean,

1863
01:35:42,751 --> 01:35:44,600
what is this exactly?
And,

1864
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:45,870
and so,
so there's,

1865
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:48,570
there's been some interesting answers to
that and this is one of them.

1866
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:52,280
So there was a group of scientists about
20 years ago that,

1867
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:57,320
that were remarked on the precise,
the precise analogy between this 

1868
01:35:58,581 --> 01:36:02,610
structure and the brain bisected down 
the middle.

1869
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:07,730
And of course Michael Angelo was one of 
the first people who did detailed 

1870
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,290
dissections.
And so they felt that,

1871
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:15,400
that Michelangelo had put God inside the
brain for some reason.

1872
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:21,230
And uh,
that seems to me to be associated with 

1873
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:21,230
the notion that there's,
you know,

1874
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:25,431
there's a,
there's an analogy or a metaphorical 

1875
01:36:25,431 --> 01:36:26,640
identity between the notion of whatever 
God is and the structures that give rise

1876
01:36:26,641 --> 01:36:28,490
to consciousness.
And uh,

1877
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,990
I think we really underestimate the 
degree to which consciousness is,

1878
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:37,650
is both same,
miraculous and an not understood.

1879
01:36:37,651 --> 01:36:38,880
I mean,
you know,

1880
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:39,990
you,
you,

1881
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:42,990
you have what appears to be an entirely 
material substrate.

1882
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:48,020
Yep.
Here you are aware and self aware and 

1883
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,260
able to generate the world merely in 
some sense by looking at it.

1884
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:52,470
It really is remarkable and that 
consciousness is dependent on,

1885
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:58,280
on something that wells up from deep 
within that material substrate that we 

1886
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:58,330
don't understand at all.
It's,

1887
01:36:58,331 --> 01:36:59,020
it's really,
uh,

1888
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:01,640
it's crazily remarkable thing.
You know,

1889
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:06,660
when you hear,
you hear a lot about scientific 

1890
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:10,041
reductionism,
but I'll tell you something that's kind 

1891
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:10,041
of interesting and it's a tangent to,
you know,

1892
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:14,031
the guy that discovered Dna,
I think it was Watson and Watson and 

1893
01:37:14,031 --> 01:37:18,291
crick,
but I don't remember who wrote this 

1894
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:18,291
book,
but one of them

1895
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:22,600
I don't remember which one,
he believed the DNA was so complicated 

1896
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,230
that it had to come from space.
He didn't believe it could have possibly

1897
01:37:24,231 --> 01:37:29,231
evolved on earth.
And so like a lot of these people who 

1898
01:37:29,231 --> 01:37:32,531
are used as exemplars of scientific 
reductionism aren't like that at all.

1899
01:37:32,751 --> 01:37:34,280
When you actually read what they had to 
say,

1900
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:34,770
right.
They,

1901
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:37,430
they were very aware of the limits of 
their own knowledge.

1902
01:37:37,431 --> 01:37:41,870
And I mean DNA is something really quite
spectacularly remarkable.

1903
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:44,930
It's an eternal substance.
It's been around for a very long time.

1904
01:37:44,931 --> 01:37:47,510
And the idea that we understand it is a 
very stupid idea.

1905
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:52,070
And I would say that I would say that 
the same thing applies to the brain.

1906
01:37:52,071 --> 01:37:53,360
Like we're,
we're,

1907
01:37:53,361 --> 01:37:56,670
we're scratching away at the surface of,
we don't understand at all.

1908
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,440
And so it's quite interesting.
I think that,

1909
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,200
and maybe Michelangelo had enough gall 
to do that,

1910
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:02,310
it's certainly possible.

1911
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:07,310
I mean,
he had enough goal to do dissections 

1912
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:07,410
when the,
when the cost of that was death,

1913
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:12,440
you know,
he had this rob corpses essentially to 

1914
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:12,440
go and do it.
So he was,

1915
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:13,020
he wasn't,
I would say,

1916
01:38:13,021 --> 01:38:15,690
not particularly politically correct.
So.

1917
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:22,190
So that's kind of interesting.
And there is another representation of 

1918
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:23,190
the same thing.
And that's a funny one.

1919
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:27,000
I had to throw that in.
I don't know how many of you know this,

1920
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:28,020
but there's,
there's,

1921
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,590
there's this joke in the atheistic 
atheist community.

1922
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,540
I think it might've been started by 
Richard Dawkins,

1923
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:38,541
but that might be wrong,
that it was just as reasonable to 

1924
01:38:38,541 --> 01:38:39,570
believe in the flying spaghetti monster 
as it was to believe in God.

1925
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:41,910
That's the flying spaghetti monster by 
the way.

1926
01:38:41,911 --> 01:38:42,780
And,
and,

1927
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:48,250
and so that's,
that's called touched by his noodly 

1928
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:51,320
appendage and anyways,
it's fun.

1929
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:56,350
It's not very sophisticated,
but it is funny so and God blessed them 

1930
01:38:56,350 --> 01:39:00,291
and God said to them,
be fruitful and multiply and fill the 

1931
01:39:00,291 --> 01:39:05,151
earth and subdue it and have dominion 
over the fish of the sea and over the 

1932
01:39:05,151 --> 01:39:06,120
birds of the heavens and over every 
living thing that moves on the earth.

1933
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,890
God said,
behold,

1934
01:39:07,891 --> 01:39:12,891
I have given you every plant yielding 
seed that is on the face of all the 

1935
01:39:12,891 --> 01:39:12,891
earth and every tree with seed in its 
fruit,

1936
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:18,080
you shall have them for food and to 
every beast of the earth and every bird 

1937
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,260
of the heavens and to everything that 
creeps on the earth.

1938
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:22,770
Everything that has the breath of life I
have given every green plant for food.

1939
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:25,830
And it was so and God saw everything he 
had made.

1940
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:30,890
And behold,
it was very good and there was evening 

1941
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:30,890
and there was morning,
the sixth day.

1942
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:33,930
Thus the heavens and the earth were 
finished and all the host of them.

1943
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:39,380
And on the seventh day,
God finished his work that he had done 

1944
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:40,410
and he rested on the seventh day from 
all his work that he had done.

1945
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:43,890
So God blessed the seventh day and made 
it holy because on it,

1946
01:39:43,891 --> 01:39:46,710
God rested from all his work that he had
done in creation.

1947
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,210
And I like that too.
You know,

1948
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:55,160
one of the,
I did a lot of counseling work with 

1949
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,711
people who were coaching work I guess 
with people who were fairly 

1950
01:39:57,711 --> 01:39:59,940
spectacularly successful and they were 
usually workaholics,

1951
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:04,941
you know,
they're the sort of people that were 

1952
01:40:04,941 --> 01:40:04,941
like,
they work 80 hours a week just nonstop.

1953
01:40:04,941 --> 01:40:08,960
That's just what they were like.
And one of the things we're always 

1954
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:08,960
trying to figure out was,
well,

1955
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,741
how much should you work?
Because one answer is you just work til 

1956
01:40:12,741 --> 01:40:12,741
you die,
right?

1957
01:40:12,741 --> 01:40:15,180
I mean you just exhaust yourself and 
while that's not,

1958
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:18,810
that's not a good idea.
And then you have to figure out why that

1959
01:40:18,811 --> 01:40:23,811
isn't a good idea.
It's got to be something like this is 

1960
01:40:23,811 --> 01:40:26,331
that you don't want to do so much work 
that the amount of work you do 

1961
01:40:26,331 --> 01:40:27,690
interferes with the amount of work that 
you could still do,

1962
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:28,860
right?

1963
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:34,100
Because if you work like mad for two 
weeks and then you have to lie in a 

1964
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:36,270
hospital bed for a month,
that obviously isn't very productive,

1965
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:41,271
so you have to figure out how much you 
can work diligently and then how much 

1966
01:40:41,271 --> 01:40:44,030
you have to recuperate so that you can 
get back up and work again.

1967
01:40:44,031 --> 01:40:44,960
And you know,
that's.

1968
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:50,000
People have basically settled on 
something like this and given it the 

1969
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,970
divine imprimatur that that's one way of
thinking about it,

1970
01:40:50,971 --> 01:40:51,960
which is,
well,

1971
01:40:51,961 --> 01:40:55,150
you can toil away for six days and no 
wonder because you have to work,

1972
01:40:55,151 --> 01:41:00,151
but you should rest at least one day out
of seven because otherwise while you 

1973
01:41:00,151 --> 01:41:01,790
don't appreciate life,
that might be part of it.

1974
01:41:01,791 --> 01:41:05,200
And plus I think it's more a matter of 
iterative interability,

1975
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:10,430
you know,
because one of the things that defines 

1976
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:10,430
morality is the capacity to repeat 
something,

1977
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:10,960
right?

1978
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,050
So if something is properly structured 
in a moral manner,

1979
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:17,380
then you can do it over and over and 
over again without any degeneration.

1980
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,540
And so that's kind of like a 
relationship.

1981
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:24,570
If your relationship is negotiated,
you can continue to negotiate it and 

1982
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:25,570
then you can have a relationship that 
lasts for a long time.

1983
01:41:25,571 --> 01:41:28,270
You can do it today and next week and 
next month.

1984
01:41:28,271 --> 01:41:30,850
The next year you could maintain it 
across time,

1985
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:36,120
and this I would say is the wisdom 
that's been associate that's been 

1986
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:38,230
garnered over God only knows what period
of time to say,

1987
01:41:38,231 --> 01:41:43,231
well look,
I mean even God needed to take a break 

1988
01:41:43,231 --> 01:41:45,721
and appreciate what was going on and 
it's not such a bad thing for people to 

1989
01:41:45,721 --> 01:41:49,021
follow that pattern and that's a good 
thing for modern people to know because 

1990
01:41:49,021 --> 01:41:53,101
we seem to be.
Even though you know we're very wealthy 

1991
01:41:53,101 --> 01:41:55,870
by historical standards,
our capacity to relax isn't exactly what

1992
01:41:55,871 --> 01:41:57,910
it could be and I think that's really 
hard on people.

1993
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:05,100
Okay,
so I'm going to go over again the idea 

1994
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:08,881
of the attributes of God.
I talked about that a little bit last 

1995
01:42:08,881 --> 01:42:11,790
week,
but I want to return to it because I 

1996
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:13,711
think it's worth.
It's worth dwelling on a little bit 

1997
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:17,431
because we're trying to figure out what 
it is that people were trying to 

1998
01:42:17,431 --> 01:42:20,941
formulate when they were formulating 
these representations and we've sort of 

1999
01:42:20,941 --> 01:42:24,721
come to the conclusion that there there,
there is an attempt to abstract out the 

2000
01:42:25,841 --> 01:42:30,841
nature of power from specific aspects of
power and there is some attempt to 

2001
01:42:30,841 --> 01:42:35,251
associate that with consciousness as 
that which gives rise to being itself 

2002
01:42:35,251 --> 01:42:40,021
and there's some attempt to associate 
that consciousness with something that 

2003
01:42:40,021 --> 01:42:41,290
has a cosmic quality,
whatever that might mean,

2004
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:46,710
and and it's a statement that it has a 
cosmic quality rather than rather than a

2005
01:42:46,991 --> 01:42:49,570
discovery.
It's a mere statement that there's.

2006
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:54,870
That there's something about 
consciousness that has world generating 

2007
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:57,901
significance and also the implication 
that it's associated with human beings 

2008
01:42:57,901 --> 01:42:58,870
as well.
It's a very.

2009
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,960
It's a very interesting set of 
propositions and I don't believe that 

2010
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,990
there simply refutable it.
It's a perfectly coherent argument even 

2011
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:09,730
though it's primarily made 
metaphorically and so then once again,

2012
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:14,200
I want to build up the,
the framework of associations around the

2013
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:17,530
idea of God.
One of the things that Freud did when he

2014
01:43:17,531 --> 01:43:19,510
was interpreting dreams and it's quite 
useful,

2015
01:43:19,511 --> 01:43:21,790
you know,
so if someone comes to me with a dream,

2016
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:27,240
then I have them tell me the whole dream
and then I get them to repeat it line by

2017
01:43:27,761 --> 01:43:32,761
line and then whenever they say a line 
and it there's an object in it or a 

2018
01:43:33,131 --> 01:43:38,131
person or something like that.
I asked them what that makes them 

2019
01:43:38,131 --> 01:43:40,450
remember or what that thing means to 
them or what comes to mind.

2020
01:43:40,451 --> 01:43:45,451
And that's the associational technique.
And it's predicated on the idea that 

2021
01:43:45,451 --> 01:43:48,730
your memory works by association and you
know that if you're daydreaming,

2022
01:43:48,731 --> 01:43:50,200
you know you go from one thing to 
another,

2023
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:51,980
like a conversation and that

2024
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,790
you can take an idea that's at the 
center of a web of associations.

2025
01:43:55,791 --> 01:44:00,791
And by tracking the associations you can
kind of zero in on what the idea might 

2026
01:44:00,791 --> 01:44:03,890
meet.
And then you expanded that by trying to.

2027
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:09,490
He called it to amplify the dream by 
thinking about about narrative or 

2028
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:13,331
literary or mythological similarities 
that that might be associated with the 

2029
01:44:13,371 --> 01:44:18,371
narrative structure of the dream.
And I think often that can be 

2030
01:44:18,371 --> 01:44:18,371
unbelievably useful,
you know,

2031
01:44:18,371 --> 01:44:21,590
and it's like the dream is an idea 
that's trying to come to birth.

2032
01:44:21,591 --> 01:44:23,120
It's,
it's partly formulated.

2033
01:44:23,121 --> 01:44:25,070
And then if you discuss it and amplify 
it,

2034
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:30,340
it's like you can speed along its 
transformation into a more articulated 

2035
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:34,301
idea.
And the dream is also something that 

2036
01:44:34,301 --> 01:44:37,360
because your brain,
your mind is trying to work with one 

2037
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:40,871
foot in the unknown,
it's trying to formulate what's out 

2038
01:44:40,871 --> 01:44:41,420
there in the unknown and to make it 
concrete.

2039
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:43,850
But it doesn't do that in one fell 
swoop.

2040
01:44:43,851 --> 01:44:48,110
It doesn't just take potential and turn 
it into two articulated ideas.

2041
01:44:48,111 --> 01:44:51,050
It has to dream up what's out there 
first projects,

2042
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:54,420
it's imagination out there to get a 
handle on what it might be.

2043
01:44:54,421 --> 01:44:59,421
And then that's presented in the dream.
And if you analyze the dream you can 

2044
01:44:59,421 --> 01:45:02,741
make it more articulate.
And so that's what we're going to do 

2045
01:45:02,741 --> 01:45:06,311
with the attributes of God to,
to build up the representational 

2046
01:45:06,311 --> 01:45:06,311
structure a little bit.
So.

2047
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:09,980
So the hypothesis is that God is an 
abstracted ideal,

2048
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:15,190
formulated in large part to dissociate 
the ideal from any particular 

2049
01:45:15,190 --> 01:45:19,481
incarnation or man or ruler.
And the underlying idea there too is 

2050
01:45:19,481 --> 01:45:23,981
that when the ruler becomes the ideal,
the state turns into the biblical Egypt 

2051
01:45:23,981 --> 01:45:26,360
and the biblical Egypt is a tyranny.
And so there's a very,

2052
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:30,290
very solid idea in the old testament 
that I think took people.

2053
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:34,130
God only knows how long to figure out 
that if you transformed,

2054
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:39,790
if you confuse the notion of sovereign 
sovereignty with the current sovereign,

2055
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:46,270
then your culture immediately 
degenerated into totalitarian state and 

2056
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:48,770
turned to stone and that was deadly than
you were slaves.

2057
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:50,790
And then the thing was going to collapse
as well.

2058
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:55,760
Like no matter how big and grandiose,
as soon as the ruler became the concrete

2059
01:45:55,761 --> 01:45:59,450
incarnation of the ideal,
there was no distinction between the man

2060
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:03,380
and the divine notion of the ideal.
Then the society was doomed.

2061
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:07,760
And I think that that's a less.
I think that's why I think that's true.

2062
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:09,230
It's just,
it's simple as that.

2063
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:14,000
And I think we saw more than enough 
evidence of that in the 20th century and

2064
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:16,340
we're certainly seeing the same thing 
repeating itself now,

2065
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,620
when the ruler becomes the ideal of the 
state,

2066
01:46:18,621 --> 01:46:23,621
turns into the biblical Egypt and the 
biblical Egypt as the architectural 

2067
01:46:23,621 --> 01:46:24,490
tyranny.
So what is God like?

2068
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:26,810
Well,
from the Christian perspective,

2069
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:34,620
there's three elements.
One is seems to have something to do 

2070
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:35,050
with tradition.
And so that's God the father.

2071
01:46:35,051 --> 01:46:37,810
And that's partly the embodiment I would
say,

2072
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:40,450
of of the human being.
And that's an ancient,

2073
01:46:40,451 --> 01:46:45,451
ancient thing.
And it's also partly the embodiment of 

2074
01:46:45,451 --> 01:46:47,380
the tradition of human beings,
which is also a very ancient thing.

2075
01:46:47,381 --> 01:46:49,380
And that's the structure.
As I said,

2076
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:54,770
it's the structure that consciousness 
emerges from that enables us to grapple 

2077
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:56,850
with the unknown as such.
And then there's,

2078
01:46:57,330 --> 01:47:00,160
there's the intermediary between that 
and,

2079
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:03,360
and Christ say that's the Holy Spirit,
that's that bird.

2080
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:06,480
And that's the spirit in a more abstract
sense.

2081
01:47:06,481 --> 01:47:11,481
And I,
I would say that's probably as close as 

2082
01:47:11,481 --> 01:47:12,420
Christianity ever got to the notion of 
consciousness as such,

2083
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:14,400
you know,
disembodied consciousness,

2084
01:47:14,401 --> 01:47:19,401
something like that.
And then there's the notion of the 

2085
01:47:19,401 --> 01:47:20,340
suffering individual and,
and that's,

2086
01:47:20,730 --> 01:47:25,730
that's a very complicated idea and it's 
something like in order for.

2087
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:29,070
So there's this idea,
an old idea,

2088
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:34,071
and I believe this was originally a 
Jewish idea that something with the 

2089
01:47:34,071 --> 01:47:34,710
attributes of God,
omniscience,

2090
01:47:34,711 --> 01:47:38,190
omnipresence and omnipotence lacks 
something.

2091
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:43,700
So it's like a Zen Koan.
It's a really interesting idea because 

2092
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:46,420
well,
what in the world can something like 

2093
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,841
that lack and the idea is limitation.
So something that's everything lacks 

2094
01:47:48,511 --> 01:47:53,511
limitation and bounce that idea.
Like when I first encountered that just 

2095
01:47:53,511 --> 01:47:54,590
blew me away.
I thought it was such a,

2096
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:59,630
such a brilliant,
brilliant realization that there are 

2097
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:02,901
advantages to not being able to do 
things because partly because it gives 

2098
01:48:02,901 --> 01:48:04,340
you something to do.
I suppose that's,

2099
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:05,640
that's a big part of it,
right?

2100
01:48:05,641 --> 01:48:07,860
Is If you,
if you had everything you wanted to have

2101
01:48:07,950 --> 01:48:12,160
at every moment at your fingertips,
well that,

2102
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,220
that's there's,
there's nothing,

2103
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:16,410
there's no story.
It's funny,

2104
01:48:16,411 --> 01:48:17,880
you know,
because that happened to superman,

2105
01:48:17,881 --> 01:48:22,881
you know,
the cartoon character by the 19 

2106
01:48:22,881 --> 01:48:25,431
eighties,
he could juggle planets and you could 

2107
01:48:25,431 --> 01:48:25,431
bounce like hydrogen bombs off them.

2108
01:48:25,431 --> 01:48:26,430
And be fine,
it's like everyone got bored because,

2109
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:28,260
well,
what were you going to do to superman?

2110
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,400
It's like you have a hydrogen bomb.
Adamant,

2111
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:33,600
he just brushes it off and like combs 
his hair and that's the end of that.

2112
01:48:33,601 --> 01:48:38,601
And the whole cartoon series basically 
died because he didn't have any flaws.

2113
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:44,480
There's no story without the limitation.
And I think that's an absolutely 

2114
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:47,370
remarkable idea.
And so part of the notion of Christ,

2115
01:48:47,371 --> 01:48:50,700
and this is something that I've puzzled 
over for a long time and I learned a lot

2116
01:48:50,701 --> 01:48:55,701
of this from youngest,
that there's idea in Christianity that 

2117
01:48:55,701 --> 01:48:55,701
there's consciousness as such,
which,

2118
01:48:55,930 --> 01:49:00,930
which in some senses eternal.
It stretches from the beginning of the 

2119
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:02,040
time to the end of time,
but it's this abstract notion,

2120
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:07,280
but it lacks a certain kind of reality 
because it's not instantiated somewhere 

2121
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:09,420
not.
It's not instantiated in a specific time

2122
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:13,360
and place in history.
And so the idea of the sun,

2123
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:18,800
the third part of the trinity or one of 
the three parts of the trinity is the 

2124
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,281
notion that tradition and consciousness 
as such also has to be embedded in 

2125
01:49:23,491 --> 01:49:25,230
history in a particular time.

2126
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:30,230
And place,
and so there's the archetypical 

2127
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:31,410
embededness and that would be the 
incarnation and that's the perfect man,

2128
01:49:31,411 --> 01:49:36,411
right?
Who accepts his mortality and that acts 

2129
01:49:36,411 --> 01:49:36,411
in a virtuous manner,
but it's an uh,

2130
01:49:36,411 --> 01:49:36,440
it's,
it's,

2131
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:36,980
it's,
uh,

2132
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:39,840
it's the archetypal story of every 
individual as well.

2133
01:49:39,841 --> 01:49:44,841
And you know,
there's a very strong strain in 

2134
01:49:44,841 --> 01:49:47,001
Christianity.
I would say this is more pronounced in 

2135
01:49:47,001 --> 01:49:47,001
Orthodox Christianity,
that the,

2136
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:52,020
that the purpose of that,
the proper path of life is to take the 

2137
01:49:53,861 --> 01:49:55,180
tradition,
let's say,

2138
01:49:55,181 --> 01:49:58,750
and the spirit that's associated with 
consciousness as such,

2139
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:03,010
and to act it out in your life,
in your own personal life,

2140
01:50:03,011 --> 01:50:08,011
in a manner that's analogous to the 
manner in which Christ acted out in his 

2141
01:50:08,011 --> 01:50:12,121
life.
And what that means in part is the 

2142
01:50:12,121 --> 01:50:14,350
acceptance of the tragic preconditions 
of existence.

2143
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:19,060
And so that's partly betrayal,
betrayal by friends and by family and by

2144
01:50:19,061 --> 01:50:19,690
the state.

2145
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:24,870
And it's partly punishment for sins that
you did not commit to as well as the 

2146
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:27,070
ones you did commit.
And sometimes that's just a relief,

2147
01:50:27,071 --> 01:50:30,130
but you know,
the arbitrary nature of justice and also

2148
01:50:30,131 --> 01:50:33,630
the fact affinity dude.
And the notion is,

2149
01:50:33,631 --> 01:50:35,710
is that your duty,
let's say,

2150
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:40,770
and the way to set things right in the 
cosmos is to accept that as a necessary 

2151
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:43,870
precondition for being and to act 
virtuously despite that.

2152
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:49,140
And that's a very,
very powerful idea as far as I'm 

2153
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:49,140
concerned.
And I'm also,

2154
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:53,610
you know,
the world's a weird place and I've seen 

2155
01:50:53,610 --> 01:50:55,831
some very strange things in my life.
And one of the things that I've seen is 

2156
01:50:55,831 --> 01:50:55,831
that,
you know,

2157
01:50:55,831 --> 01:50:57,610
I've dealt with some people who were 
very,

2158
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,460
let's say that they weren't on a good 
path,

2159
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:05,580
let's put it that way.
And one of the things that was really 

2160
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:05,580
interesting about being around people 
like that,

2161
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:08,710
it was almost like they were surrounded 
by a gravitational field of sorts.

2162
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:10,600
I'm speaking metaphorically,
obviously,

2163
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:15,870
and their worldview is so warped and 
twisted that if you came within contact 

2164
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:20,731
of them,
you all of a sudden started to play a 

2165
01:51:20,731 --> 01:51:21,310
part in their drama.
And it was almost inevitable.

2166
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:26,311
They would maneuver and manipulate and 
interpret in a way that made you into 

2167
01:51:26,311 --> 01:51:29,350
the villain in their story.
No matter what it was that you wanted to

2168
01:51:29,351 --> 01:51:34,351
do.
And unless you've encountered something 

2169
01:51:34,351 --> 01:51:34,351
like that,
and many of you probably have you,

2170
01:51:34,351 --> 01:51:36,400
you don't know how powerful a pole that 
is.

2171
01:51:36,401 --> 01:51:40,180
And so it's certainly possible that 
someone can act in like,

2172
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:45,240
like a,
like a gravitational object and ben 

2173
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:46,120
things around them to fit their 
narrative.

2174
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:50,230
They're unhappy and tragic narrative.
But I've seen the opposite too,

2175
01:51:50,231 --> 01:51:52,420
you know,
were people who were,

2176
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:57,430
were aiming upward with the best of 
their ability and because of that they 

2177
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:58,150
had a positive effect on the people 
around them and,

2178
01:51:58,330 --> 01:51:58,940
and that,
that,

2179
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:02,710
that and that ordered things around them
in profound ways.

2180
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:07,710
And I think it's an open question.
The degree to which the cosmos would 

2181
01:52:08,081 --> 01:52:13,081
order itself around you properly if you 
got yourself together as much as you 

2182
01:52:13,751 --> 01:52:15,760
could get yourself together.
And I,

2183
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:19,360
I mean we know that things can go very,
very badly wrong if you,

2184
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:22,510
if you do things very badly wrong,
there's no doubt about that.

2185
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:27,840
But the converse is also true.
If you start to sort yourself out 

2186
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,410
properly and then you have a beneficial 
effect on your family being,

2187
01:52:29,411 --> 01:52:34,411
first of all,
that's going to echo down the 

2188
01:52:34,411 --> 01:52:36,450
generations.
But it also spreads out into the 

2189
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:36,450
community and we are networked together.
You know,

2190
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:38,620
we're not,
we're not associated linearly,

2191
01:52:38,621 --> 01:52:41,950
we all affect each other.
And so it's an open question.

2192
01:52:41,951 --> 01:52:45,070
The degree to which acting out the 
notion of,

2193
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:50,500
of the notion that being is good and the
notion that you can accept its 

2194
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:51,620
limitations and that you should still 
strive for virtue.

2195
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:53,000
It's.
It's an open question.

2196
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:58,001
How profound effect that would have on 
the structure of reality if you really 

2197
01:52:58,001 --> 01:53:01,451
chose to act it out.
And I've seen things as I said in my 

2198
01:53:01,451 --> 01:53:04,871
life that indicate that I do believe 
there's a metaphysical element to life 

2199
01:53:04,871 --> 01:53:05,840
as well as the rational,
practical element.

2200
01:53:05,841 --> 01:53:10,841
And I think there are times when those 
two things come together and I've seen 

2201
01:53:10,841 --> 01:53:14,000
that happen and so I don't think we know
the limits of virtue.

2202
01:53:14,001 --> 01:53:17,600
I don't think we know what true virtue 
could bring about if we,

2203
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:20,060
if we aimed at it carefully and 
practically.

2204
01:53:20,061 --> 01:53:25,061
And so the notion that there is 
something divine about the individual 

2205
01:53:25,061 --> 01:53:27,230
who accepts the conditions of existence 
and still strives for the good.

2206
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:33,340
I think that that's an idea that's very 
much worth paying attention to and I 

2207
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:37,571
think the fact that people have 
considered that idea for at least 2000 

2208
01:53:37,571 --> 01:53:39,870
years quite seriously is also an 
indication that there's,

2209
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:43,790
there's at least something to be thought
about with in relationship to that.

2210
01:53:43,791 --> 01:53:45,950
So that's kind of the trinitarian idea.

2211
01:53:49,330 --> 01:53:51,830
Same idea there.
And do you see this is.

2212
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:56,290
It's interesting too because you have.
Here you have God the father essentially

2213
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,010
who's who's coming out of this strange.
You see this isn't the sky.

2214
01:54:00,011 --> 01:54:02,350
Exactly,
and you see this very often in these old

2215
01:54:02,351 --> 01:54:04,630
pictures.
It's not exactly the sky.

2216
01:54:04,631 --> 01:54:06,420
Whatever the heaven was that,
that,

2217
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:07,780
that,
that people believed in.

2218
01:54:07,781 --> 01:54:12,781
It's something that's.
It's like the sky opens and there's a 

2219
01:54:12,781 --> 01:54:12,880
dimension beyond the sky.
It's something like that,

2220
01:54:12,881 --> 01:54:17,881
and I wanted to show you this too,
just to show you that this isn't only a 

2221
01:54:17,881 --> 01:54:20,110
western conception know when it has 
something to do with mystical experience

2222
01:54:20,111 --> 01:54:23,740
because there is a bar to satisfy.
It kind of looks like he has a hat,

2223
01:54:24,010 --> 01:54:29,010
but that's not a hat.
That's a whole bunch of bodhisattvas 

2224
01:54:29,010 --> 01:54:31,920
going back to we turn it right and this 
hole in the sky here is like a whole 

2225
01:54:32,171 --> 01:54:34,840
into time and these things are recurring
across time.

2226
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:39,250
It's the eternal recurrence of this,
of this redemptive archetype and the sky

2227
01:54:39,251 --> 01:54:43,090
opens up and you can see that thing 
recurring and recurring and recurring.

2228
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:44,530
Same ideas.
Basically.

2229
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:49,680
That's the Blue Buddha whose a healing,
who is the healing entity sitting in a 

2230
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:53,911
Mandela,
which is like a representation of 

2231
01:54:53,911 --> 01:54:56,071
paradise and it's the same idea.
It's like reality opens up and reveals 

2232
01:54:56,071 --> 01:54:57,930
this image of perfection.
And so it's a.

2233
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,700
well,
it's a universal conception and,

2234
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:04,560
and while I think it's a representation 
of the,

2235
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:09,720
the,
the possibility of the metaphysical and 

2236
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:10,300
the physical coming together in some 
sort of,

2237
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:13,330
in some sort of communication.
It's something like that.

2238
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:18,380
Anyways,
and I mean you have to remember that 

2239
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:20,791
there's absolutely no doubt that people 
have metaphysical and religious 

2240
01:55:20,791 --> 01:55:22,420
experiences.
That's an absolute fact.

2241
01:55:22,421 --> 01:55:25,270
You can induce them chemically.
You can reduce them electrochemically.

2242
01:55:25,570 --> 01:55:29,890
Lots of people who have epilepsy have a 
epileptic pro dramas that are associated

2243
01:55:29,891 --> 01:55:31,090
with divine enlightenment.

2244
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:33,880
So does the Esky for example,
he had,

2245
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:38,910
he had epilepsy and that was really,
I think one of the things that made him 

2246
01:55:38,910 --> 01:55:41,941
a great author because Dostoevsky would 
have this feeling that he was going to 

2247
01:55:41,941 --> 01:55:46,381
have an epileptic seizure and he said 
that the feeling for him was that the 

2248
01:55:46,381 --> 01:55:50,061
world was opening up and he was becoming
more and more and more enlightened and 

2249
01:55:50,061 --> 01:55:52,050
he was just on the verge of grasping the
essence of existence.

2250
01:55:52,051 --> 01:55:55,080
And then he'd have an epileptic seizure 
for the subjective feeling.

2251
01:55:55,081 --> 01:55:59,250
Was that that much knowledge was just 
too much for him to bear.

2252
01:55:59,460 --> 01:55:59,850
Well,
you know,

2253
01:55:59,851 --> 01:56:02,340
you can say,
well that was a neurological abnormality

2254
01:56:02,341 --> 01:56:03,690
and fine,
you know,

2255
01:56:03,691 --> 01:56:05,340
but God,
he was Dostoevsky,

2256
01:56:05,341 --> 01:56:07,560
you know,
and so you can't just brush that off.

2257
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:08,670
So

2258
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:12,140
yeah.
Well,

2259
01:56:12,141 --> 01:56:14,400
so that's the trinitarian idea.
Fundamentally.

2260
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:16,700
And this,
this notion here is the notion that,

2261
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:20,750
well the crosses crosses a funny thing 
because the cross marks the center,

2262
01:56:20,751 --> 01:56:23,390
you know,
and it's an x and the x is the center of

2263
01:56:23,391 --> 01:56:28,391
the world,
like the x that the cathedral is and 

2264
01:56:28,391 --> 01:56:28,391
it's the center of the world is where 
you are.

2265
01:56:28,391 --> 01:56:30,650
Because as a consciousness,
you're the center of the world.

2266
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:34,490
That center of the world is a place of 
betrayal and suffering and limitation.

2267
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,130
That's that's exactly what it is,
and the question is,

2268
01:56:37,131 --> 01:56:42,131
well,
given that and given the fact that you 

2269
01:56:42,131 --> 01:56:44,531
know it,
what the hell are you supposed to do 

2270
01:56:44,531 --> 01:56:44,531
about it and what that represents?
I believe that's Goya.

2271
01:56:44,531 --> 01:56:49,301
What that representation implies is that
you're supposed to voluntarily accept 

2272
01:56:49,551 --> 01:56:52,280
that and then move forward on

2273
01:56:57,910 --> 01:57:02,910
well in good faith and with courage.
That's the notion and that you're 

2274
01:57:02,910 --> 01:57:05,881
supported.
You're supported by your tradition and 

2275
01:57:05,881 --> 01:57:08,371
that's why you need your tradition too.
That's why you need to be embedded in 

2276
01:57:08,371 --> 01:57:09,280
your tradition because without that,
without the support,

2277
01:57:09,310 --> 01:57:14,290
let's say of your father and I mean that
both practically and metaphysically,

2278
01:57:14,291 --> 01:57:19,291
without that behind you,
without the knowledge of you as both a 

2279
01:57:19,291 --> 01:57:22,141
biological and a cultural creature,
without that depth of knowledge you 

2280
01:57:22,141 --> 01:57:26,221
can't hate,
you don't have the courage to do it 

2281
01:57:26,221 --> 01:57:26,221
because you don't know what you are,
what you could be,

2282
01:57:26,221 --> 01:57:28,660
and so without that,
because you're a historical creature,

2283
01:57:28,661 --> 01:57:31,840
you know what students ask me sometimes.
Why study history?

2284
01:57:31,841 --> 01:57:32,260
It's like,
well,

2285
01:57:32,261 --> 01:57:37,261
because history is about you.
That's why it's like history tells you 

2286
01:57:37,261 --> 01:57:41,461
who you are.
You can't tell who you are because you 

2287
01:57:41,461 --> 01:57:41,461
only live a little while.

2288
01:57:41,461 --> 01:57:44,880
How the hell can you figure out who you 
are so you need all this collected 

2289
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:48,301
wisdom and all this dream like 
information and all this mythology and 

2290
01:57:48,301 --> 01:57:52,471
all this narrative to inform you about 
what you are beyond what you see of 

2291
01:57:52,631 --> 01:57:57,631
yourself and you know you're pummeled 
down and people picked on you and 

2292
01:57:57,631 --> 01:58:00,780
there's 50 things about you that are 
horrible and you know you've got a self 

2293
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:03,871
esteem problem.
You're sort of hunched over and you've 

2294
01:58:03,871 --> 01:58:03,871
got all these problems.
You know,

2295
01:58:03,871 --> 01:58:06,520
and so it's not easy to see.
Let's say the divinity that lurks behind

2296
01:58:06,521 --> 01:58:11,521
that and unless you're aware of the 
heroic stories of the past and the 

2297
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:12,940
metaphysics of consciousness,
let's say.

2298
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:18,120
I don't think that you can have the 
courage to regard yourself as the sort 

2299
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:21,451
of creature that could stand up 
underneath that intense existential 

2300
01:58:21,451 --> 01:58:23,650
burden and move forward in encouraging 
grace.

2301
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:28,950
And of course that's part of the reason 
that I'm talking about these biblical 

2302
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:29,530
stories.
And it's 9:30,

2303
01:58:29,531 --> 01:58:31,030
so we're going to have to stop.

2304
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:37,780
Thank.

2305
01:58:49,490 --> 01:58:54,490
Okay.
So we're going to stop exactly at 10 

2306
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:56,270
tonight because that,
that's the deal with the theater people.

2307
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:57,680
And so,
um,

2308
01:58:57,681 --> 01:59:01,640
besides I'll be out of anything 
intelligent to say by that point,

2309
01:59:01,641 --> 01:59:03,110
certainly so.
Well,

2310
01:59:03,111 --> 01:59:05,330
at least we got through one story.
So that was good.

2311
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:07,360
So

2312
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:16,790
let's give everyone like to,
you know,

2313
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:21,570
just a few seconds to settle down and 
everyone who wants to leave can leave.

2314
01:59:23,570 --> 01:59:25,110
So thank you for all,
all for coming.

2315
01:59:25,111 --> 01:59:27,050
By the way,
I'm constantly amazed that,

2316
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:27,930
that,
you know,

2317
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:30,600
everybody comes and listens to this 
because you know,

2318
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:33,620
it's just,
well,

2319
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,910
it's strange,
let's put it that way.

2320
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,250
So,
so far it's been fun though,

2321
01:59:38,251 --> 01:59:39,750
so that's good.
Okay,

2322
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:40,410
let's go.

2323
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:43,900
I opened that works.
Hi Dr Peterson.

2324
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:48,850
I was raised Catholic and any time there
was a bit of a,

2325
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:51,220
an inherent contradiction,
let's call it,

2326
01:59:51,221 --> 01:59:54,430
in the document to the Bible,
it will be referred to as a mystery.

2327
01:59:54,431 --> 01:59:56,740
And there's one mystery I've always kind
of wondered about,

2328
01:59:56,741 --> 02:00:00,100
and it's very important to genesis,
how do you,

2329
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:05,380
how do you deal with a perfect God or 
the conception of a perfect God,

2330
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:09,310
who by nature isn't capable of an 
imperfect design,

2331
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:13,480
are incapable of a perfect design?
So what I mean by that is many religions

2332
02:00:13,481 --> 02:00:14,560
present,
for example,

2333
02:00:14,561 --> 02:00:18,790
good and evil as separate deities that 
preexisted simultaneously.

2334
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:20,620
What's interesting though,
Christianity,

2335
02:00:20,621 --> 02:00:25,621
is that Lucifer,
the embodiment of evil in the Christian 

2336
02:00:25,621 --> 02:00:29,071
religion is an outgrowth of God and is 
sometimes the Milton for example,

2337
02:00:29,111 --> 02:00:33,940
presents him as a rebel against his 
interpretation of God's tyranny.

2338
02:00:34,030 --> 02:00:35,380
Right?
Another example,

2339
02:00:35,381 --> 02:00:35,820
you know,
we,

2340
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,270
we,
we didn't touch on,

2341
02:00:37,271 --> 02:00:38,740
um,
even today,

2342
02:00:38,741 --> 02:00:42,160
but in paradise supposedly perfect 
garden,

2343
02:00:42,161 --> 02:00:47,161
a perfect design is infiltrated again by
that evil outgrowth of a so called 

2344
02:00:47,951 --> 02:00:50,980
perfect God.
So from a psychological perspective,

2345
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:55,060
do you think there is a significance to 
this presentation of perfection,

2346
02:00:55,061 --> 02:01:00,061
yet the contradictory flaws that are 
sort of naturally part of that 

2347
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:02,110
perfection.

2348
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,040
Hold on,
quote,

2349
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:05,620
Kol.
So good.

2350
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:06,820
That's a good simple question.

2351
02:01:09,650 --> 02:01:11,660
We're starting to see you.

2352
02:01:12,690 --> 02:01:14,940
He was Kinda Manichaean in his approach 
and he,

2353
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:19,970
he,
he tended towards thinking that evil in 

2354
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:19,970
some sense was a separate entity.
You know,

2355
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:24,951
when I thought about that for a long 
time because there's a potency about 

2356
02:01:24,951 --> 02:01:26,210
evil that just can't be brushed away and
not.

2357
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:27,990
I mean,
I mean this most practically,

2358
02:01:27,991 --> 02:01:32,991
as I've said,
I went in for people in my clinical 

2359
02:01:32,991 --> 02:01:32,991
practice,
I've,

2360
02:01:32,991 --> 02:01:36,770
I've dealt with many people who are 
touched by malevolence and there's no 

2361
02:01:36,770 --> 02:01:36,770
other way of,
of,

2362
02:01:36,770 --> 02:01:40,240
of stating it properly and this happens 
a lot to people who have posttraumatic 

2363
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:44,260
stress disorder,
like they encountered someone that 

2364
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:44,870
wanted to hurt them for the sake of 
hurting them.

2365
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:46,820
You know,
it wasn't some misunderstanding.

2366
02:01:46,821 --> 02:01:48,770
You can forget about that.
It wasn't that at all.

2367
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:54,100
And so to,
to deny the reality of evil in some 

2368
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:57,941
sense I think is the ultimate naivety.
Even though it's a word that you won't 

2369
02:01:57,941 --> 02:01:58,190
hear used,
for example,

2370
02:01:58,191 --> 02:01:59,770
very often in universities anymore.

2371
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,230
But I just,
that just,

2372
02:02:01,370 --> 02:02:03,580
I just can't understand that at all.
But.

2373
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:09,430
But I thought about that lot and so I'm 
gonna kind of answer that question by 

2374
02:02:09,530 --> 02:02:14,530
hitting it scatter shot.
The first thing is that there's an idea,

2375
02:02:15,861 --> 02:02:18,920
and this happens in Milton,
is that comes across in Milton,

2376
02:02:18,921 --> 02:02:23,890
that distance from God is hell right?
That,

2377
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:26,990
that hell doesn't actually have any.
I know it's ambivalent in Milton,

2378
02:02:26,991 --> 02:02:31,991
but,
but the fundamental claim seems to be 

2379
02:02:31,991 --> 02:02:31,991
that the farther you get from God,
the more it's hell.

2380
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:34,310
And then there's another idea that 
Milton,

2381
02:02:34,311 --> 02:02:35,780
Satan,
who's Lucifer,

2382
02:02:35,781 --> 02:02:36,800
the bringer of light,
right?

2383
02:02:36,801 --> 02:02:39,140
He's God's highest angel,
God most wrong.

2384
02:02:39,141 --> 02:02:41,810
And I kind of think about him as the 
spirit of rationality,

2385
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:47,260
of intelligence.
It's not because I'm not an admirer of 

2386
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:47,260
intelligence because hooray for 
intelligence.

2387
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:51,320
But one of the things that that Milton 
seemed to cotton onto before the rise of

2388
02:02:51,321 --> 02:02:56,321
modern totalitarian states was that 
intellect has the capacity to fall in 

2389
02:02:57,021 --> 02:03:00,860
love with its own creations and to 
elevate them to the highest place,

2390
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:03,260
which is basically a totalitarian claim.

2391
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:08,530
It's like what I know is everything that
needs to be known and if it was only 

2392
02:03:08,530 --> 02:03:12,221
manifest in the world,
the world would become a utopia and I 

2393
02:03:12,221 --> 02:03:12,470
also think that's.
We'll talk about this next week.

2394
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:15,710
I also think that that's the core idea 
behind the tower of Babel.

2395
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:21,160
Remember the tower of Babel is raised by
human being so that the pinnacle will 

2396
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:24,341
hit heaven and so it's the idea that we 
can build a structure that makes the 

2397
02:03:24,341 --> 02:03:27,290
transcendent unnecessary.
And so okay,

2398
02:03:27,291 --> 02:03:29,690
so there's those two things.
Then there's,

2399
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:32,420
there's an idea of freewill that's 
associated with it too,

2400
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:36,380
and it seems to me that in order for 
there to be good there has to be evil.

2401
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:41,090
And so I think the answer is something 
like this,

2402
02:03:41,091 --> 02:03:46,091
is that in order for there to be being 
there has to be limitation in order for 

2403
02:03:46,311 --> 02:03:47,330
their good to be good.

2404
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:52,330
There has to be the possibility of evil.
I think the right path is to exist such 

2405
02:03:53,721 --> 02:03:55,760
that the possibility of evil remains 
open,

2406
02:03:55,761 --> 02:03:59,870
but that you choose the good and I don't
think that evil per se is built into the

2407
02:03:59,871 --> 02:04:02,750
structure of the world.
I do think that that's human.

2408
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:06,170
I think that evil is human and I think 
it's understandable.

2409
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:11,470
I did a lecture that's online about the 
distinction between evil and tragedy and

2410
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:17,290
tragedy seems to be built into the 
structure of the world and perhaps you 

2411
02:04:17,290 --> 02:04:17,290
can blame God for that.
I mean,

2412
02:04:17,290 --> 02:04:19,430
it doesn't seem to me that it's your 
fault that the earthquakes for example,

2413
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:24,700
but,
but it is not obvious to me either that 

2414
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:25,100
it's tragedy that takes the spirit out 
of people.

2415
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:28,250
I think that human beings are actually 
equipped to deal with tragedy,

2416
02:04:28,251 --> 02:04:31,820
but we're not equipped to deal with 
malevolence that destroys people.

2417
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:37,450
And so I think that I think that 
metaphysically speaking,

2418
02:04:38,641 --> 02:04:43,641
the world is structured so that people 
have a choice between good and evil and 

2419
02:04:43,681 --> 02:04:48,681
that.
So then the next question is why do we 

2420
02:04:48,681 --> 02:04:51,000
have a choice and that that's where my 
knowledge runs out.

2421
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:54,140
I don't.
I don't like the alchemists,

2422
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:59,150
for example,
speculated that the Orthodox Christians 

2423
02:04:59,150 --> 02:05:02,390
also follow this line of reasoning is 
that human beings in some sense are 

2424
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:06,621
furthering creation by our actions and 
our choices and I think there's 

2425
02:05:06,621 --> 02:05:11,001
something to that.
It's like it's like creation is 

2426
02:05:11,001 --> 02:05:11,820
unfinished in some sense and that we're 
participating in,

2427
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:15,060
in moving it in whatever direction it is
that we want to move it,

2428
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:20,300
and part of that is that we have 
freewill and part of that is that we 

2429
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:22,350
have the choice between good and evil 
and that's also was all associated with,

2430
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:27,740
with the significance,
maybe the cosmic significance of our 

2431
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:30,951
lives and I blood that strikes me as 
plausible and I think the weight of 

2432
02:05:31,411 --> 02:05:35,130
responsibility that people feel 
existentially as an indication of that.

2433
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:38,880
So that's about the best I could do with
that.

2434
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:39,210
So,

2435
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:40,890
and it seems the way you're describing 
it,

2436
02:05:40,891 --> 02:05:45,891
it's built into at least the text that 
you presented because one of the other 

2437
02:05:45,891 --> 02:05:48,870
things I had noticed was God 
consistently describes creation is good,

2438
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:49,800
right?
Creates light,

2439
02:05:49,801 --> 02:05:50,880
it's good,
he creates dark.

2440
02:05:50,881 --> 02:05:55,881
It's good after he creates things,
he announces that he creates man and 

2441
02:05:56,460 --> 02:06:00,030
woman announces that they have dominion 
over those things and can use them,

2442
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:01,980
and it might be something lost in 
translation,

2443
02:06:01,981 --> 02:06:06,420
but that is described as very good.
As soon as that dominion is brought into

2444
02:06:06,421 --> 02:06:11,421
existence,
you might speak to that notion of 

2445
02:06:11,421 --> 02:06:11,421
furthering.
Well,

2446
02:06:11,421 --> 02:06:13,020
here's something interesting too,
and we'll develop this a lot,

2447
02:06:13,021 --> 02:06:18,021
is that you see when Adam and eve eat 
the fruit and the snake gives him the 

2448
02:06:18,021 --> 02:06:22,821
fruit,
the first thing that happens is their 

2449
02:06:22,821 --> 02:06:22,821
eyes are opened.
To me.

2450
02:06:22,821 --> 02:06:23,660
That means that while they've woken up,
right,

2451
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:28,980
they've,
there's been an increment in their 

2452
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:30,831
consciousness and the next thing that 
happens is that they recognize that 

2453
02:06:30,831 --> 02:06:30,831
they're naked.
Okay?

2454
02:06:30,831 --> 02:06:35,231
And to recognize that you're naked is to
recognize that you're vulnerable and 

2455
02:06:35,231 --> 02:06:38,811
human beings are strange creatures 
because most animals are like this and 

2456
02:06:38,811 --> 02:06:38,811
they're protected,
but not us.

2457
02:06:38,811 --> 02:06:42,570
Like our most vulnerable parts are 
displayed for Harman,

2458
02:06:42,571 --> 02:06:44,100
for everyone to observe,
right?

2459
02:06:44,101 --> 02:06:49,101
So we've got that sort of bipedal 
selfconsciousness built into us,

2460
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:54,440
but what's really interesting is that 
when Adam and eve realized that they're 

2461
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:57,231
naked,
it's the same moment that they know the 

2462
02:06:57,231 --> 02:06:58,170
difference between good and evil and 
that God,

2463
02:06:58,171 --> 02:06:59,220
that just,
that just,

2464
02:06:59,610 --> 02:07:01,590
I just ground away on that for years.

2465
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:02,760
Trust if they can.
What the hell is,

2466
02:07:02,761 --> 02:07:07,761
is what's going on here?
What's the relationship between 

2467
02:07:07,761 --> 02:07:08,250
consciousness,
knowledge of nakedness and the knowledge

2468
02:07:08,251 --> 02:07:09,480
of good and evil.
And then I think,

2469
02:07:09,481 --> 02:07:11,580
I think I figured it out,
I think,

2470
02:07:11,610 --> 02:07:16,610
I think it was that you see when you 
know that you're vulnerable and they 

2471
02:07:16,610 --> 02:07:18,570
also develop knowledge of death,
right?

2472
02:07:18,571 --> 02:07:23,571
So there's deep knowledge of 
vulnerability and they get embarrassed 

2473
02:07:23,571 --> 02:07:23,571
about that.
They cover themselves up,

2474
02:07:23,571 --> 02:07:23,880
right?
So that's culture.

2475
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:27,690
So it's a very profound shock for them 
to recognize that they're naked.

2476
02:07:27,691 --> 02:07:32,691
It even makes Adam hide from God.
Then they developed the knowledge of 

2477
02:07:32,691 --> 02:07:32,691
good and evil.
Well,

2478
02:07:32,691 --> 02:07:36,861
I think it's because you see human 
beings have this peculiar capacity that 

2479
02:07:36,861 --> 02:07:37,780
no other creature has,
which is,

2480
02:07:37,870 --> 02:07:41,740
I know how I can be hurt because I'm 
aware of my own limitations.

2481
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:45,430
Painfully aware and now because I know 
how I can be heard,

2482
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:50,550
I know how you can be hurt and I can 
take advantage of that and that's I 

2483
02:07:50,550 --> 02:07:51,640
think how evil enters the world.

2484
02:07:51,850 --> 02:07:56,850
That's what it looks like to me.
It's like I've got this expansion of 

2485
02:07:56,850 --> 02:07:56,850
knowledge.
It says in genesis that that,

2486
02:07:56,870 --> 02:08:01,870
that,
that gives people another attribute of 

2487
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:04,231
divinity.
Knowing the difference between good and 

2488
02:08:04,231 --> 02:08:06,061
evil as it has nothing to do with 
animals and it has nothing to do with 

2489
02:08:06,061 --> 02:08:06,730
Adam and eve prior to having their eyes 
opened,

2490
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:12,000
but that the cosmos switches when that 
self consciousness manifests itself and 

2491
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,290
that's when the possibility of evil 
enters the world.

2492
02:08:14,380 --> 02:08:19,380
It's something like that and that's also
echoed by the intimate relationship 

2493
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:21,520
between the snake in the garden of Eden 
and Satan,

2494
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:26,550
which is we go into because that's what.
That's a very strange associations like 

2495
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:30,961
the snake all also becomes the adversary
of bea and I think that's all jumped 

2496
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:34,420
very quickly into that,
but I think that's because you know,

2497
02:08:34,430 --> 02:08:39,430
there's the snake that bites you in the 
jungle and then there's the snake that 

2498
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:39,490
lives in your enemy.

2499
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:42,310
And then there's the snake that lives in
your family,

2500
02:08:42,311 --> 02:08:47,311
if you've,
if you've banished the enemy to the 

2501
02:08:47,311 --> 02:08:48,280
Netherlands,
and then there's the snake that lives in

2502
02:08:48,281 --> 02:08:53,281
you.
If you remove yourself from your family 

2503
02:08:53,281 --> 02:08:53,710
and that snake that's in you,
right?

2504
02:08:53,711 --> 02:08:54,550
That's,
that's a,

2505
02:08:54,551 --> 02:08:59,551
that's a psychological phenomena that's 
equivalent to transcendent evil itself.

2506
02:08:59,801 --> 02:09:01,780
The thing that inhabits every single 
person.

2507
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:04,720
That's why there's that association 
between the snake and Satan.

2508
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:06,850
And that's why I think that people have 
this.

2509
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:12,420
It's associated with our knowledge of 
vulnerability that gives us this 

2510
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:14,080
constant capacity for,
for evil being.

2511
02:09:14,081 --> 02:09:16,990
Imagine if you're a medieval torture,
you know what I mean?

2512
02:09:16,991 --> 02:09:18,880
People don't generally imagine that sort
of thing,

2513
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:24,040
but,
but people were medieval torturers and 

2514
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:25,630
they were very good at what they did and
the only way that you can be a torturers

2515
02:09:25,631 --> 02:09:28,210
to know what would hurt you,
right?

2516
02:09:28,210 --> 02:09:29,970
And so you exploit your own 
vulnerability,

2517
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:34,971
exploit the knowledge of your own 
vulnerability to bring pain into the 

2518
02:09:34,971 --> 02:09:38,311
world.
And I don't think that you can lay that 

2519
02:09:38,311 --> 02:09:40,981
precisely at God's feet.
Now people have been arguing about that 

2520
02:09:41,081 --> 02:09:42,220
for a very long time.
But,

2521
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:43,690
but my,
my question,

2522
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:45,580
the question for me that arose from that
is,

2523
02:09:45,581 --> 02:09:46,300
all right,
fine,

2524
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:48,940
like tragedy.
You can lay that at God's feet.

2525
02:09:49,210 --> 02:09:54,210
Well,
if we didn't bring additional evil into 

2526
02:09:54,210 --> 02:09:57,751
the world,
could we tolerate the tragedy of being 

2527
02:09:57,751 --> 02:09:59,590
without becoming corrupt?
And I think generally the answer to that

2528
02:09:59,591 --> 02:10:04,591
is yes,
because I've seen people react quite 

2529
02:10:04,591 --> 02:10:05,080
heroically to the arbitrary burdens of 
their life,

2530
02:10:05,350 --> 02:10:06,580
but malevolence man,
that,

2531
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:09,940
that lays the low,
it lays the low and it seems to be to be

2532
02:10:09,941 --> 02:10:13,060
nothing but a destructive force.
And I do believe as well,

2533
02:10:13,061 --> 02:10:14,980
and I think you see this indicate 
enabled story,

2534
02:10:14,981 --> 02:10:19,981
that the root of malevolence is the 
desire for revenge against God for the 

2535
02:10:19,981 --> 02:10:21,490
creation itself.
And I,

2536
02:10:21,491 --> 02:10:26,491
I mean I've read terrible things written
by terrible people trying to get to the 

2537
02:10:26,491 --> 02:10:30,451
bottom of things.
And I mentioned the columbine killers 

2538
02:10:30,451 --> 02:10:30,451
for example,
and it's clear.

2539
02:10:30,451 --> 02:10:30,820
All you have to do is go read what they 
wrote.

2540
02:10:31,150 --> 02:10:33,070
What they were doing was taking revenge 
against.

2541
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:38,860
They knew that it wasn't unconscious,
that they'd been dwelling on this for 

2542
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:43,900
months plotting the revenge and it was 
revenge against being itself for the 

2543
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,200
crime of being so.

2544
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:51,600
Thank you.
Hi,

2545
02:10:54,130 --> 02:10:54,410
Dr.

2546
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:59,230
you'd said when God saw that it was 
good,

2547
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:03,370
you read that as potentially well might 
be better than nothing.

2548
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:08,140
And the story in genesis,
it's bracketed by days,

2549
02:11:08,141 --> 02:11:10,090
which aren't necessarily literal days 
yom,

2550
02:11:10,091 --> 02:11:14,920
the original word,
but it's also bracketed by and he saw it

2551
02:11:14,921 --> 02:11:16,030
was good,
you know,

2552
02:11:16,031 --> 02:11:17,620
at the end of the day.
So my question is,

2553
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:23,820
is there something more profoundly 
happening there between this profundity 

2554
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:27,841
of speaking into existence?
The way to start is to this observation,

2555
02:11:29,021 --> 02:11:34,021
the seeing that it's good and are we,
is God modeling consciousness is a 

2556
02:11:34,021 --> 02:11:37,090
little more there for us to do,
to grapple with.

2557
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:38,650
Okay,
so.

2558
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:41,440
So go more for us to grapple with.
In what way?

2559
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:47,410
In the sense that we have this amazing,
this insight of speaking things forth,

2560
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:55,570
but you'd also commented on 
consciousness as until something's 

2561
02:11:55,570 --> 02:11:56,700
observed during until,
until it's seen.

2562
02:11:57,350 --> 02:12:01,700
So when God sees that that creation was 
good,

2563
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:03,000
is there.

2564
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:08,000
There's kind of this bracketing between 
the bringing forth through the sport 

2565
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,130
when you know,
through the word through Jesus.

2566
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:09,650
Okay.
Okay.

2567
02:12:09,651 --> 02:12:11,030
That's good.
I see what you mean.

2568
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:11,750
Okay.
Well,

2569
02:12:11,751 --> 02:12:14,480
I think.
I think what that is is that I think,

2570
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:20,200
okay,
so it's perfectly reasonable from an 

2571
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:24,100
architectural and psychological 
perspective to consider the idea of the 

2572
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:28,520
word equivalent to the spoken truth 
being Christ makes that claim in the New

2573
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:29,630
Testament,
but he's the truth.

2574
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:31,340
Right?
And embodied.

2575
02:12:31,850 --> 02:12:36,850
And so then you can logically,
you can derive from that the idea that 

2576
02:12:36,850 --> 02:12:38,600
if things are spoken into being through 
truth,

2577
02:12:38,601 --> 02:12:40,700
then they're good.
And so yeah,

2578
02:12:40,701 --> 02:12:44,060
I think that that association exists and
I think that that's.

2579
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:49,510
Well,
I also think that that's in some sense 

2580
02:12:49,510 --> 02:12:52,001
the deepest claim of faith.
I believe that because I think that I 

2581
02:12:52,001 --> 02:12:53,900
think you have to make a decision in 
your life as far as I can tell,

2582
02:12:53,901 --> 02:12:58,901
and I think kierkegaard knew this more 
clearly than anyone else I've ever read 

2583
02:12:58,901 --> 02:13:02,820
in is if being is good,
then an honest relationship with being 

2584
02:13:05,761 --> 02:13:09,420
also has to be good and then if you have
an honest relationship with being,

2585
02:13:09,421 --> 02:13:14,421
then you're going to speak the truth and
then I think what you have to decide is 

2586
02:13:14,421 --> 02:13:16,830
that speaking,
if you speak the truth,

2587
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:21,860
then what happens is good regardless of 
what happens and that that's that.

2588
02:13:22,410 --> 02:13:27,410
That's the rub of faith and I think 
that's something that kierkegaard 

2589
02:13:27,410 --> 02:13:27,410
wrestled with,
you know,

2590
02:13:27,410 --> 02:13:27,410
and that,
I mean,

2591
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,040
I'm trying to think if I

2592
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,680
can provide an example about,
about that.

2593
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:38,280
It didn't need an easily and quickly.
Well,

2594
02:13:38,281 --> 02:13:43,281
I guess it's partly because it's partly 
because you can live your life two ways.

2595
02:13:43,771 --> 02:13:44,700
You can,
you can,

2596
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:49,790
you can use your language to manipulate.
You can use your language as a tool to 

2597
02:13:49,790 --> 02:13:53,541
get what you want,
but the problem with that is that that 

2598
02:13:53,541 --> 02:13:56,241
assumes that you know what you want and 
that you're right and that's a problem 

2599
02:13:56,241 --> 02:13:59,010
because there's lots of things you don't
know and if you get what you want,

2600
02:13:59,011 --> 02:14:04,011
you may find a that you didn't really 
want it and be that you're not the 

2601
02:14:04,011 --> 02:14:05,310
person that started the journey towards 
that.

2602
02:14:05,490 --> 02:14:10,490
That happens a lot to people,
especially when they use their language 

2603
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:11,520
in a manipulative way,
and so the alternative seems to be,

2604
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:14,310
and I think this is one of the lessons,
for example,

2605
02:14:14,311 --> 02:14:19,311
it's laid out in the movie Pinocchio,
which happens to be a kind of 

2606
02:14:19,311 --> 02:14:22,041
archetypical favorite of mine.
Is that part of the act of faith,

2607
02:14:22,590 --> 02:14:27,590
let's say,
and then I wouldn't say Christian faith 

2608
02:14:27,590 --> 02:14:27,990
necessarily.
I would say faith and being itself is is

2609
02:14:27,991 --> 02:14:31,020
the decision,
the decision that God is good.

2610
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:36,470
The decision is there's no better way to
bring better being into being then to 

2611
02:14:37,321 --> 02:14:39,780
speak the truth,
and I do think that's echoed.

2612
02:14:39,781 --> 02:14:44,781
I think that's a very wise observation.
I think that's echoed in that first 

2613
02:14:44,781 --> 02:14:44,781
story,
first of all,

2614
02:14:44,781 --> 02:14:47,310
they active speech and second,
the observation that the consequence was

2615
02:14:47,311 --> 02:14:48,630
good.
So yeah,

2616
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:49,290
thank you.

2617
02:14:55,600 --> 02:15:00,600
Good morning.
Citizens Peterson first have a bunch of 

2618
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:04,831
questions and the one that had them 
answered immediately like you have a 

2619
02:15:05,350 --> 02:15:10,350
post on quora in which you encourage all
children to incur skateboarding 

2620
02:15:10,350 --> 02:15:15,331
injuries,
but also stated in this post you wrote 

2621
02:15:16,091 --> 02:15:21,091
that,
do not try to rescue someone who does 

2622
02:15:21,091 --> 02:15:23,941
not want to be rescued and be very 
careful about rescuing someone who does.

2623
02:15:24,790 --> 02:15:29,790
And can you reconcile this with what you
stated about transcendent morality and 

2624
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:31,440
the heroic impulse that I guess men are 
supposed to be

2625
02:15:31,450 --> 02:15:32,890
born with.
Okay.

2626
02:15:32,891 --> 02:15:33,700
Okay.
Okay.

2627
02:15:33,701 --> 02:15:34,690
So,
um,

2628
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,870
well the skate,
the skateboarding question is I wrote,

2629
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:42,250
I have a book coming out in 2018 called 
12 rules for life,

2630
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:45,340
an antidote to chaos.
And one of the chapters in there is from

2631
02:15:45,341 --> 02:15:50,341
that cora posting and it's called don't 
bother their children when they're 

2632
02:15:50,341 --> 02:15:53,731
skateboarding.
And it's sort of associated with what I 

2633
02:15:53,731 --> 02:15:53,731
had said earlier about Parker for 
example,

2634
02:15:53,731 --> 02:15:53,830
is that,
you know,

2635
02:15:53,831 --> 02:15:58,831
kids need to go out and push themselves 
against danger because that's what life 

2636
02:15:59,561 --> 02:16:01,510
is,
is pushing yourself against danger and,

2637
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:06,460
and when you see kids doing things that 
are dangerous but spectacular,

2638
02:16:06,461 --> 02:16:11,461
then you kind of have a moral obligation
to back the hell off and let them 

2639
02:16:11,461 --> 02:16:14,650
experiment with their own mortality 
because you can't keep them safe.

2640
02:16:14,651 --> 02:16:17,500
The best thing you can do is make them 
able and courageous.

2641
02:16:17,501 --> 02:16:22,501
And,
and I would say that that's a more 

2642
02:16:22,501 --> 02:16:24,241
difficult lesson generally speaking for 
mothers to learn then for fathers to 

2643
02:16:24,241 --> 02:16:24,241
learn.

2644
02:16:24,241 --> 02:16:25,240
And that was Freud's fundamental 
observation,

2645
02:16:25,241 --> 02:16:27,130
but it's,
it's absolutely crucial.

2646
02:16:27,610 --> 02:16:30,010
And so I've seen do,
I mean,

2647
02:16:30,011 --> 02:16:35,011
you know,
you can obviously be a full on a 

2648
02:16:35,011 --> 02:16:35,011
skateboard,
although the distinction between being a

2649
02:16:35,011 --> 02:16:38,380
fall and developing yourself as not as 
clear as people might like to imagine.

2650
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,580
And when kids are out there with no 
helmet and doing dangerous things,

2651
02:16:42,581 --> 02:16:45,100
it's like there's a part of me that of 
course is very worried about it.

2652
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:50,101
But there's another part of me that 
admires it very much because they're 

2653
02:16:50,101 --> 02:16:52,450
practicing what they need to practice in
order to cope with the world.

2654
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:53,530
Okay.
So there's that.

2655
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:56,470
Now the other one was rescuing people.
Yeah.

2656
02:16:57,310 --> 02:16:59,840
Well,
I got this partly from Carl Rogers.

2657
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:05,480
[inaudible] rogers was,
he's a clinician of very famous 

2658
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:05,480
clinician and and he,
he was,

2659
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:06,850
he was a Christian missionary to begin 
with,

2660
02:17:06,851 --> 02:17:11,851
but he didn't end up that way,
but he was very interested in the 

2661
02:17:11,851 --> 02:17:13,390
utility of listening as a,
as a means of redemption.

2662
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:15,460
Essentially.
Listening by the way,

2663
02:17:15,461 --> 02:17:18,790
is if you have someone that you know 
that has a problem,

2664
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:24,090
the best thing you can often do is 
listen to them if they're actually 

2665
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:27,301
trying to communicate because people 
configure themselves through speech and 

2666
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:31,270
most people can't think.
And I don't mean that in a mean way.

2667
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:36,480
I mean the way they think is by talking 
and they can't talk unless they have 

2668
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:37,930
someone to talk to.
And it's partly because they're bouncing

2669
02:17:37,931 --> 02:17:42,931
the idea off them and seeing if it makes
sense and seeing how the person 

2670
02:17:42,931 --> 02:17:43,210
responds.
So listening is a great thing,

2671
02:17:43,510 --> 02:17:48,510
but Rogers was also interested in the,
in the preconditions for having a 

2672
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:52,681
redemptive relationship and that could 
be a therapeutic relationship or an 

2673
02:17:52,681 --> 02:17:55,951
intimate relationship and one of the 
things he claimed was that unless the 

2674
02:17:55,951 --> 02:17:58,050
person was aiming upward,
there was nothing you could do about it.

2675
02:17:58,230 --> 02:18:01,690
That and that seemed to be associated 
with this idea of that initial choice,

2676
02:18:01,691 --> 02:18:06,070
say between good and evil.
So once someone comes to therapy,

2677
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:09,040
they've already done something,
they've already said,

2678
02:18:09,041 --> 02:18:12,340
I have a problem,
conceivably I could fix it and I need to

2679
02:18:12,341 --> 02:18:17,341
do something about it.
And then so half the work is already 

2680
02:18:17,341 --> 02:18:17,770
done by the time they show up because 
they've already said,

2681
02:18:17,771 --> 02:18:22,771
well,
things aren't as good as they could be 

2682
02:18:22,771 --> 02:18:22,771
and I could do something about it.
The question is,

2683
02:18:22,771 --> 02:18:25,600
can you do anything about someone who 
isn't at that state?

2684
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:29,200
And my observation,
and this is Roger's observation as well,

2685
02:18:29,201 --> 02:18:33,100
is that you can't.
I think you can serve by example,

2686
02:18:33,340 --> 02:18:38,340
but until the person has decided on 
their own that they're wrong.

2687
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:44,320
That's why they're suffering.
And if there's something wrong about 

2688
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:44,320
what they're doing and that they want to
fix it,

2689
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:48,331
I don't,
I think that even trying to hammer 

2690
02:18:48,331 --> 02:18:48,331
against that often makes it worse.

2691
02:18:48,331 --> 02:18:49,250
So,
and I know that soul Schnitzel,

2692
02:18:49,330 --> 02:18:52,540
when he was talking about the communist 
ideologues,

2693
02:18:52,541 --> 02:18:57,541
the really hardcore communist ideologues
that were eaten up by the Gulag 

2694
02:18:57,541 --> 02:18:57,541
archipelago system,
you know,

2695
02:18:57,541 --> 02:18:59,770
sort of devoured by their own.
He saw the same thing,

2696
02:18:59,771 --> 02:19:04,771
was that until they were willing to 
admit that something was wrong with the 

2697
02:19:04,771 --> 02:19:06,970
manner in which they had construed the 
world,

2698
02:19:06,971 --> 02:19:08,920
that it had resulted in their own 
device,

2699
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,110
that there was actually no way of 
communicating with them.

2700
02:19:11,350 --> 02:19:13,210
They're in kind of an authoritarian 
bubble.

2701
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:14,940
And so,
so I,

2702
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:20,300
I don't think that.
So even if you orient yourself as an 

2703
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:25,620
archetypal hero,
there's no way you can get through that 

2704
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:25,620
barrier.
Well,

2705
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:27,150
I think that that's part of the issue of
freewill.

2706
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:30,680
I think that I do not think that people 
can learn unless they admit that they're

2707
02:19:30,681 --> 02:19:32,570
wrong.
There was this,

2708
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:37,520
there's this play the cocktail hour by 
tsl.

2709
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:42,520
Yet,
here's this woman in the play and she 

2710
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:44,381
comes up to a psychiatrist and she says,
just in the course of casual 

2711
02:19:44,381 --> 02:19:44,381
conversation,
she says,

2712
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:46,580
I really hope there's something wrong 
with me,

2713
02:19:46,730 --> 02:19:49,250
and of course the psychiatrist is a bit 
taken aback by that.

2714
02:19:49,251 --> 02:19:49,700
And he says,
well,

2715
02:19:49,701 --> 02:19:51,250
why in the world would you hope such a 
thing?

2716
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:53,420
And she says something like,
well,

2717
02:19:53,421 --> 02:19:54,710
like I'm suffering,
man.

2718
02:19:54,711 --> 02:19:57,110
Things are not good for me.
I'm having a dreadful time of it.

2719
02:19:57,111 --> 02:19:59,810
And as far as I can tell,
there's only two possibilities.

2720
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:05,020
Either the world in its essence is 
conspiring against me and I'm doomed 

2721
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:06,530
because what am I going to do about the 
world?

2722
02:20:06,531 --> 02:20:10,880
Like it's just built into the structure 
of reality or I'm doing something wrong.

2723
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:14,330
So I'm really hoping that I'm doing 
something wrong because if I am,

2724
02:20:14,331 --> 02:20:16,770
then maybe I could fix it and I'd 
stopped suffering and it's.

2725
02:20:16,910 --> 02:20:20,000
It's something like that and see.
It's also,

2726
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:23,810
I think that if your life isn't what it 
could be and you're suffering,

2727
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:29,380
then it seems to me that that should be 
sufficient evidence that you don't know 

2728
02:20:29,380 --> 02:20:32,921
enough,
and if that isn't sufficient evidence 

2729
02:20:32,921 --> 02:20:36,071
that you don't know enough,
then I don't know how anyone else can 

2730
02:20:36,071 --> 02:20:37,730
provide you without evidence and so I'm 
going to leave it at that.

2731
02:20:37,750 --> 02:20:42,750
This is psychological rescue,
not like rescuing someone who's 

2732
02:20:42,750 --> 02:20:42,750
drowning,
for example.

2733
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:48,040
Yes,
you can rescue people when they're 

2734
02:20:48,040 --> 02:20:48,040
drowning even if they don't want you.
Perfect.

2735
02:20:49,930 --> 02:20:51,470
I'll tell you something about that 
though.

2736
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:55,310
Something interesting about that and 
that's relevant is that you know,

2737
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:58,370
I don't know how many of you know how 
you rescue someone who's drowning.

2738
02:20:59,330 --> 02:21:01,100
You do it like this,
right?

2739
02:21:01,101 --> 02:21:04,400
You come to them like this and you push 
them away with your foot.

2740
02:21:04,401 --> 02:21:09,401
If there.
I'm telling you that's what you do if 

2741
02:21:09,401 --> 02:21:09,401
you're a lifeguard because if they're 
panicking and they grabbed you,

2742
02:21:09,401 --> 02:21:14,111
you both drowned and that's stupid 
because then you both drowned and that's

2743
02:21:14,271 --> 02:21:17,330
a really good way.
That's a really good metaphor for trying

2744
02:21:17,331 --> 02:21:22,331
to help someone too.
It's like when people are in real 

2745
02:21:22,331 --> 02:21:22,331
trouble,
you know,

2746
02:21:22,331 --> 02:21:25,841
some of it's,
they're confused and some of it is that 

2747
02:21:25,841 --> 02:21:28,391
their life has collapsed around them and
there's some malevolence there and 

2748
02:21:28,391 --> 02:21:31,031
there's some desire for vengeance and is
just like one dangerous mess and if 

2749
02:21:31,031 --> 02:21:34,931
you're gonna wait in there unprepared,
the probability that they're going to 

2750
02:21:34,931 --> 02:21:36,890
take you down compared to you elevating 
them is very,

2751
02:21:36,891 --> 02:21:37,580
very high.

2752
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:42,860
You know,
because you don't even know what your 

2753
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:44,381
damn psychological stability rests on.
You might be saying just because you're 

2754
02:21:44,381 --> 02:21:48,521
lucky and surrounded by saying people.
That doesn't mean that you have the 

2755
02:21:48,521 --> 02:21:52,421
psychological wherewithal to really post
someone up from the depths of the 

2756
02:21:52,421 --> 02:21:56,651
underworld,
especially if they've also got one foot 

2757
02:21:56,651 --> 02:21:57,740
inhale so you should bloody well be 
careful about doing that kind of thing.

2758
02:21:57,741 --> 02:21:59,870
It's,
it's Hubris to attempt it.

2759
02:21:59,871 --> 02:22:04,871
And I would,
I would definitely caution people very 

2760
02:22:04,871 --> 02:22:05,960
carefully about trying to rescue someone
who doesn't want to be rescued.

2761
02:22:05,961 --> 02:22:10,961
It's,
it's very dangerous activity and it can 

2762
02:22:10,961 --> 02:22:10,961
easily be counter productive.

2763
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:11,860
Okay.
So about,

2764
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:13,820
since 2006,
I've been trying to figure out like,

2765
02:22:13,850 --> 02:22:16,240
extract the Meta the way you've put it,
of um,

2766
02:22:16,370 --> 02:22:19,190
social justice warriors,
and I think I found it actually,

2767
02:22:19,191 --> 02:22:24,191
um,
they seem to have this behavior where 

2768
02:22:24,191 --> 02:22:24,191
they just,
they nebulize every standard we have.

2769
02:22:24,191 --> 02:22:24,620
So they take a standard,
you have that handful of criteria.

2770
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:26,490
You say what something is,
is how it is,

2771
02:22:26,491 --> 02:22:31,491
like that's a podium,
but it has these criteria within that 

2772
02:22:31,491 --> 02:22:32,790
place they take,
um,

2773
02:22:32,791 --> 02:22:37,791
they do something on nebulization where 
they take something of what and they 

2774
02:22:37,791 --> 02:22:38,430
dissolve the criteria such that there is
no way to say how it is.

2775
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:40,920
So you see this now with gender where 
someone will say their agenda,

2776
02:22:40,921 --> 02:22:44,220
but there's no way to get logically from
how they can be that gender,

2777
02:22:44,221 --> 02:22:45,810
like how you can be an attack 
helicopter,

2778
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:47,310
a male or a woman or something like 
that.

2779
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:50,490
Um,
but the thing that came from this,

2780
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:53,070
and I figured this out when I found 
about you when I learned about you,

2781
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:58,200
is that nebulization appears to be the 
exact opposite process of individuation.

2782
02:22:58,870 --> 02:23:03,870
Philosophic.
It's the philosophical version of 

2783
02:23:03,870 --> 02:23:05,721
intuit,
individuation that rests on three 

2784
02:23:05,721 --> 02:23:06,330
premises are three core axioms,
which is I exist,

2785
02:23:06,331 --> 02:23:09,540
which is an axiom that exist in like in 
the objective that you exist here,

2786
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:15,080
and then I am,
which is a reiteration of reincarnation 

2787
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:18,051
of I exist,
which is basically you have to say I'm 

2788
02:23:18,051 --> 02:23:18,840
right about having existed or also just 
falls apart.

2789
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:20,730
And then you have asked which is the 
question,

2790
02:23:20,731 --> 02:23:21,330
begged from that.
Well,

2791
02:23:21,331 --> 02:23:24,630
if you exist and you're right as what 
you're talking about,

2792
02:23:24,631 --> 02:23:27,570
God being the metaphor of God in Genesis
being the,

2793
02:23:27,571 --> 02:23:32,571
uh,
a metaphor for the creation of 

2794
02:23:32,571 --> 02:23:34,551
consciousness.
And it appears that individuation 

2795
02:23:34,551 --> 02:23:34,551
actually fits that triad.

2796
02:23:34,551 --> 02:23:35,730
Because if you take ads,
for example,

2797
02:23:36,130 --> 02:23:36,860
at the,
as is a,

2798
02:23:36,861 --> 02:23:41,861
it's the predictive aspect.
When you try to take the subjective and 

2799
02:23:41,861 --> 02:23:41,861
make it objective.
So you have an idea,

2800
02:23:41,861 --> 02:23:45,681
you test it in reality.
And time is the ultimate arbiter that 

2801
02:23:45,681 --> 02:23:48,741
determines these things.
And it changes your understanding of 

2802
02:23:48,741 --> 02:23:48,741
reality.
It gets,

2803
02:23:48,741 --> 02:23:48,741
it lets you know God,
it lets you know the objective.

2804
02:23:49,050 --> 02:23:51,300
And then from that point,
there's the subjective which is supposed

2805
02:23:51,301 --> 02:23:54,120
to be formed from objective reality,
but because you've changed that,

2806
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:56,640
you know have to sacrifice your old self
the old way.

2807
02:23:56,641 --> 02:23:59,190
You saw Jordan Peterson of 10 years ago,
it was not who he is now.

2808
02:23:59,670 --> 02:24:02,490
So it gets sacrificed and at the same 
time you can point back to that guy that

2809
02:24:02,491 --> 02:24:04,110
Jordan Peterson and say,
well,

2810
02:24:04,111 --> 02:24:06,870
that guy was wrong,
and that's the scapegoating of the sun.

2811
02:24:07,650 --> 02:24:12,650
So the subjective aspect,
the I am right as the son and the Holy 

2812
02:24:12,650 --> 02:24:15,500
Spirit,
which is supposed to lead you to God is 

2813
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:15,500
the ass.
And they don't understand that

2814
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:16,960
the relationship between that in the 
first part,

2815
02:24:16,961 --> 02:24:19,120
the okay,
so can,

2816
02:24:19,150 --> 02:24:24,010
can you just clarify that the social 
justice aspect and the nebulization

2817
02:24:24,100 --> 02:24:25,960
oh,
the social justice is the exact opposite

2818
02:24:25,961 --> 02:24:28,360
process of individuation.
That's all it is.

2819
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:31,120
And it actually occurs it as if you're 
at and you're thinking,

2820
02:24:31,121 --> 02:24:31,810
well,
what am I?

2821
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:34,680
You either apply individuation.
You try to apply criteria.

2822
02:24:34,681 --> 02:24:37,870
You had to find out what you are in 
reality or refuse that paradigm and say,

2823
02:24:37,871 --> 02:24:38,710
well look,
I am.

2824
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:43,920
I'm always going to be right,
I'm completely self righteous and you 

2825
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:46,741
stop at that subjective aspect where 
everything becomes subjective and you 

2826
02:24:46,741 --> 02:24:46,741
ultimately become relativistic and 
nihilistic.

2827
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:50,890
So I'm asking have you considered that 
the genesis tail and the,

2828
02:24:50,910 --> 02:24:55,910
the um,
the creation myth and God is actually 

2829
02:24:55,910 --> 02:25:00,001
the,
is the process of individuation and the 

2830
02:25:00,001 --> 02:25:00,001
trinity is actually those three core 
premises.

2831
02:25:00,001 --> 02:25:02,580
The three axioms that come from that.
K,

2832
02:25:02,590 --> 02:25:06,730
I haven't considered that.
I mean I know that

2833
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:11,570
[inaudible] draw drew a parallel between
the idea of the passion for,

2834
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:16,600
for example,
and the development of human 

2835
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:16,600
individuality.
And so there's,

2836
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:21,130
that idea was,
is lurking inside the union notion of 

2837
02:25:21,130 --> 02:25:22,940
individuation because it has to do with 
voluntary confrontation,

2838
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:25,060
mortality and also with evil,
right?

2839
02:25:25,061 --> 02:25:30,061
As,
as two of the key elements of genuine 

2840
02:25:30,061 --> 02:25:32,820
self realization.
I haven't considered the metaphorical 

2841
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:36,610
pathway that you just described.
So I can't comment on that.

2842
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:41,670
I'd have to think about that.
But I could say that one of the things 

2843
02:25:41,670 --> 02:25:44,560
that does disturb me about the 
ideological battle that's going on right

2844
02:25:44,561 --> 02:25:45,310
now,
and,

2845
02:25:45,430 --> 02:25:47,350
and I think this is a very deep part of 
it,

2846
02:25:47,351 --> 02:25:50,370
and this is the part that's a battle 
against the logos in,

2847
02:25:50,371 --> 02:25:51,040
in,
in Dera,

2848
02:25:51,041 --> 02:25:52,300
does old terms,
right?

2849
02:25:52,301 --> 02:25:56,290
The fellow egocentric West needs to be 
taken down to its essence,

2850
02:25:56,291 --> 02:25:59,620
is the refusal to engage in precise 
language.

2851
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:01,750
And I see that in part,
for example,

2852
02:26:02,380 --> 02:26:05,800
manifested in the refusal of the people 
who are criticizing.

2853
02:26:05,801 --> 02:26:10,801
Do we ever engage in any debate?
They don't believe in debate and they 

2854
02:26:10,801 --> 02:26:10,930
don't believe in the,
in the,

2855
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:12,220
in the,
let's say,

2856
02:26:12,221 --> 02:26:17,221
the redemptive power of dialogue,
because mostly what they believe in his 

2857
02:26:17,221 --> 02:26:20,731
power.
So there's a nebulization in that 

2858
02:26:20,731 --> 02:26:23,311
manner.
There's this tendency to hide behind 

2859
02:26:23,311 --> 02:26:25,981
what's vague and foglight instead of 
making things sharp and clear and 

2860
02:26:25,981 --> 02:26:26,980
crystal clean.
And I do think that that's.

2861
02:26:27,130 --> 02:26:32,130
Well,
that's part of the degeneration of a 

2862
02:26:32,130 --> 02:26:33,840
civilization as far as I'm concerned.
So do you haven't considered that then 

2863
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:34,480
would you please?

2864
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:38,510
I'll do my best.
I'll do my best.

2865
02:26:41,210 --> 02:26:46,210
Thank you.

2866
02:26:50,330 --> 02:26:51,210
Okay.
So one,

2867
02:26:51,230 --> 02:26:56,230
this is it.
One more question and then I'll make it 

2868
02:26:56,230 --> 02:26:56,230
quick.
Okay,

2869
02:26:56,230 --> 02:26:56,230
thanks.
Hi,

2870
02:26:56,230 --> 02:26:57,590
Dr Peterson.
My question is,

2871
02:26:58,460 --> 02:27:03,460
I know you stated in the last lecture 
that the importance for setting aims in 

2872
02:27:04,821 --> 02:27:09,821
life and to kind of have goals,
goals to work towards.

2873
02:27:10,341 --> 02:27:11,780
Right?
So my question was,

2874
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:14,030
where do you,
where do you,

2875
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:17,660
how do you do that if you don't know 
where you want to go because that's kind

2876
02:27:17,661 --> 02:27:21,500
of where I got stuck on your future 
authoring program because.

2877
02:27:22,030 --> 02:27:23,470
Okay,
that's a good question.

2878
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:25,460
That's a really good question.
Um,

2879
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:33,310
I think it's echoed to some degree in,
in the structure of the biblical stories

2880
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:38,640
and in this manner.
So there's this notion in the Old 

2881
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:41,230
Testament that morality is following a 
sequence of prohibitions.

2882
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:46,590
There's a bunch of bad things you 
shouldn't do and then basically you're 

2883
02:27:46,590 --> 02:27:46,590
good enough and,
and,

2884
02:27:46,590 --> 02:27:51,020
and I think there's wisdom in that.
I think that's kind of where children 

2885
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:51,020
start,
right?

2886
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:51,020
You,
you,

2887
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:52,180
I mean,
I love children and all that,

2888
02:27:52,181 --> 02:27:57,181
but they're there.
They're crazy little creatures and they 

2889
02:27:57,181 --> 02:27:59,120
need to be civilized.
And partly what you do is you,

2890
02:27:59,230 --> 02:28:04,230
you lay prohibitions on them and mostly 
what you're trying to do is lay 

2891
02:28:04,230 --> 02:28:07,630
prohibitions on them for the behaviors 
that if they manifested,

2892
02:28:07,631 --> 02:28:12,631
would make their life miserable.
So I have another chapter in this book 

2893
02:28:12,631 --> 02:28:16,021
that I'm writing called don't let your 
children do anything that makes you 

2894
02:28:16,021 --> 02:28:16,021
dislike them.

2895
02:28:16,021 --> 02:28:20,310
And the idea there is that your,
your job as a parent is to help your 

2896
02:28:20,310 --> 02:28:25,291
children become sort of four year olds 
that adults genuinely smile out when 

2897
02:28:25,291 --> 02:28:30,221
they come into a room because that makes
the entire social environment both 

2898
02:28:30,221 --> 02:28:34,031
truthful and welcoming.
And so your job is to make them 

2899
02:28:34,031 --> 02:28:38,020
desirable.
Social beings and lot of that is 

2900
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:38,020
prohibition.
Okay?

2901
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:41,570
There's this ethical transformation and 
it happens to some degree in the,

2902
02:28:41,571 --> 02:28:46,571
in the tradition of the prophetic 
tradition where there is a spirit that 

2903
02:28:46,571 --> 02:28:48,110
seems in some sense to rise above the 
law,

2904
02:28:48,111 --> 02:28:53,111
but there's a real transformation 
between the old testament and the new 

2905
02:28:53,111 --> 02:28:54,410
testament.
The Old Testament is prohibition and the

2906
02:28:54,410 --> 02:28:55,280
New Testament is,
well,

2907
02:28:55,281 --> 02:29:00,281
here's the good things you do once 
you're more than merely prohibiting 

2908
02:29:00,281 --> 02:29:02,660
yourself from,
from impulsive sin.

2909
02:29:02,661 --> 02:29:07,250
Let's say there's a positive good to be 
accomplished while you might say,

2910
02:29:07,251 --> 02:29:09,050
well,
I don't know what the positive good is.

2911
02:29:09,230 --> 02:29:10,250
Fair enough,
man.

2912
02:29:10,670 --> 02:29:13,760
So,
so this is why this thing that I've said

2913
02:29:13,761 --> 02:29:15,800
to people,
it's become this crazy Internet meme,

2914
02:29:15,801 --> 02:29:20,801
but that's to clean up your room and 
which is a lot better and more useful 

2915
02:29:20,811 --> 02:29:22,460
than people think.
It's a lot harder to.

2916
02:29:22,461 --> 02:29:24,680
But the thing,
the first thing you do,

2917
02:29:24,681 --> 02:29:29,681
I think,
and I learned this in part from 

2918
02:29:29,681 --> 02:29:31,151
Solzhenitsyn when he was trying to iron 
out his soul when he was in the Gulag 

2919
02:29:31,151 --> 02:29:31,190
because he was trying to figure out how 
we got there,

2920
02:29:31,490 --> 02:29:34,250
how he contributed to how we got there.
You know,

2921
02:29:34,251 --> 02:29:36,880
not Stalin and Hitler even though they 
were kind of to blame,

2922
02:29:36,890 --> 02:29:41,890
you know,
but it wasn't much he could do about 

2923
02:29:41,890 --> 02:29:41,890
that.
I think what you have to do,

2924
02:29:41,890 --> 02:29:45,941
and this is part of humility,
is you have to look around you within 

2925
02:29:45,941 --> 02:29:49,841
your sphere of influence,
like the direct sphere of influence and 

2926
02:29:49,841 --> 02:29:53,240
fix the things that announced themselves
as in need of repair.

2927
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:58,480
And those are often small things you 
know and they can be like your room,

2928
02:29:58,850 --> 02:30:03,850
put it in order because the thing is it 
isn't exactly so important that your 

2929
02:30:03,850 --> 02:30:04,340
room is in order,
although it is.

2930
02:30:04,670 --> 02:30:09,670
What's important is that you learn how 
to distinguish between chaos and order 

2931
02:30:09,670 --> 02:30:12,140
and to be able to act in a manner that 
produces order.

2932
02:30:12,290 --> 02:30:17,290
And in most households there's 100 
things that could be done to just make 

2933
02:30:17,290 --> 02:30:21,311
it less hideous and horrible.
And so practicing that is a real useful 

2934
02:30:21,531 --> 02:30:23,330
form of meditation.
And it's also,

2935
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:26,660
it's also,
I think it's a divine act because you're

2936
02:30:26,661 --> 02:30:30,530
taking chaos and you know,
if you pay attention even to a room,

2937
02:30:30,531 --> 02:30:32,120
it's so interesting.
And I learned because I've,

2938
02:30:32,170 --> 02:30:35,150
I've renovated many places now and tried
to make them beautiful.

2939
02:30:35,151 --> 02:30:40,151
And one of the things that I've really 
learned is that even if you own a 

2940
02:30:40,151 --> 02:30:43,541
structure,
unless you investigated all the nooks 

2941
02:30:43,541 --> 02:30:47,231
and crannies and cleaned them up and put
your own imprint on them and made them 

2942
02:30:47,231 --> 02:30:48,290
years,
they're not yours.

2943
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:51,530
The mere fact of physical ownership 
doesn't make them yours.

2944
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:56,560
You have to establish a dynamic 
relationship with the objects before 

2945
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:58,580
they're actually years and I think you 
can.

2946
02:30:58,610 --> 02:31:01,460
You can do something as simple as just 
sit on your bed and think,

2947
02:31:01,461 --> 02:31:06,461
okay,
there's probably like five things I 

2948
02:31:06,461 --> 02:31:08,891
could do today so that tomorrow morning 
is slightly better than this morning was

2949
02:31:08,931 --> 02:31:13,931
at least,
or at least I'm not falling behind and 

2950
02:31:13,931 --> 02:31:14,270
those will usually be like having needed
toad in the morning.

2951
02:31:14,271 --> 02:31:15,830
Right.
It's like it's not going to be something

2952
02:31:15,831 --> 02:31:20,831
you want to do.
There'll be things you're trying to 

2953
02:31:20,831 --> 02:31:20,831
avoid.
There are snakes essentially,

2954
02:31:20,831 --> 02:31:22,770
but if you ask yourself like you're 
asking someone,

2955
02:31:22,771 --> 02:31:26,040
which I think is a form of prayer,
if you ask yourself,

2956
02:31:26,041 --> 02:31:27,570
instead of telling yourself,
you know,

2957
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:32,840
what is it that I could do to set things
more right today that I would actually 

2958
02:31:33,751 --> 02:31:34,530
do?

2959
02:31:34,620 --> 02:31:37,140
It's usually some small thing because 
you're not disciplined,

2960
02:31:37,141 --> 02:31:42,141
you know?
Then you can go do it and then you put 

2961
02:31:42,141 --> 02:31:45,270
the world together a little more when 
you do that and that spreads out,

2962
02:31:45,690 --> 02:31:50,690
but you also put your.
You also construct yourself into 

2963
02:31:50,690 --> 02:31:53,940
something that's better able to call 
order forth from chaos,

2964
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:59,120
and that makes you just incrementally 
stronger and then the next day you can 

2965
02:31:59,251 --> 02:32:04,251
maybe take on a slightly larger task and
like you get the benefit of compound 

2966
02:32:04,251 --> 02:32:05,070
interest.
If you do that,

2967
02:32:05,071 --> 02:32:10,071
it's a tremendously powerful technique 
and they think if you do that at some 

2968
02:32:10,071 --> 02:32:14,361
point,
instead of just having to fix things up 

2969
02:32:14,361 --> 02:32:17,870
that are not good,
you'll start to get a glimmer of the 

2970
02:32:17,870 --> 02:32:18,100
positive things that you could do.
You know,

2971
02:32:19,410 --> 02:32:24,410
the positive things that you could do 
that would actually constitute a vision 

2972
02:32:24,410 --> 02:32:25,230
and that that's what I would recommend.
Thank you.

2973
02:32:27,170 --> 02:32:32,170
Good night.
Thanks.
