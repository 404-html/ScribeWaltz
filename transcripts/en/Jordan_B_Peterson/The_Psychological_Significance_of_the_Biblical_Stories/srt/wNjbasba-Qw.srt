1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,280
So I'm going to launch right into it.
I like this story as well.

2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,810
This is the story of Noah and the flood 
and then the tower of Babel,

3
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,230
which I think are juxtaposed very 
interestingly.

4
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,310
The Tower of Babel is one of those 
stories like cain enabled.

5
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:33,860
It's only a few lines long.
It's like a fragment in some sense,

6
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:37,340
although the story of noise quite a well
developed narrative,

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,800
um,
but like the other stories that we've 

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,581
covered,
it is relevant at multiple levels of 

9
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:49,901
analysis simultaneously.
And so what I'm going to do to begin 

10
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:53,720
with is to start with some background 
information,

11
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:58,721
so some psychological background 
information so that the story makes 

12
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:01,310
sense.
And the first thing that I'd like to,

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,790
I'd like to make a case for is that the 
you bringing to bear on the world and a 

14
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:13,691
priority of perceptual structure.
And that's really an embodied structure 

15
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:18,311
and it's a consequence of the three and 
a half billion years that you've spent 

16
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,500
putting your body together,
which is a tremendous amount of time and

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,320
not only your body but your mind of 
course,

18
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:26,330
because your mind is part of your body.

19
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,680
And very much embedded within it,
you know,

20
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:28,950
you,
you,

21
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,990
you tend to think that you have your 
brain in your head and it's sort of 

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,070
floating separate from the rest of your 
body,

23
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:39,071
but it's not really true.
You're tremendous massive system of 

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,100
neurons running through your entire 
body,

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,520
autonomic neurons in the autonomic 
nervous system than there are on the 

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,490
central nervous system.
So that's a lot of neurons.

27
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,890
And then your central nervous system,
of course,

28
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:56,891
enables you to exercise voluntary 
control over your musculature and also 

29
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:59,810
to receive information from it.
Your brain is really distributed through

30
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:04,811
your body.
One of the things you may not know is 

31
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:05,920
that people who are paraplegic can walk.
If you,

32
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:10,921
if you suspend them above a treadmill,
their legs will walk by themselves with 

33
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:14,381
no voluntary control.
So your spine is capable of quite 

34
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:14,390
complex activity.
In fact,

35
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:17,240
when you walk,
mostly it's a controlled fall and mostly

36
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,410
your spine is doing it.

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,680
And so.
So anyways,

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,920
the point of all that is that you don't 
have a blank slate consciousness that's 

39
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:33,011
interpreting a world that manifests 
itself as segregated objects in some 

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,690
straight forward.
Since you have a built in interpretive 

41
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,131
system that's extraordinarily deeply 
embedded and invisible because you might

42
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:45,530
think about it as the implicit structure
of your unconscious.

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,540
It's what it's what gives rise to your 
conscious experience and and it presents

44
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:55,541
you with the world that that's one way 
of thinking about attending a good way 

45
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,270
of thinking about it,
the psychoanalytic way of thinking about

46
00:02:56,271 --> 00:03:00,160
it as well as the neuroscientific way of
thinking

47
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
about it because one of the things 
that's pretty interesting about modern 

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,160
neuroscientists,
especially the top rate ones,

49
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,880
and those are usually the ones that are 
working on emotions.

50
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:11,881
As far as I've been able to tell our are
often quite enamored of the 

51
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:17,491
psychoanalyst Jaak.
Panksepp was a good example of that 

52
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:20,311
because they came to understand that the
psychoanalysts insistence on underlying 

53
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:27,061
unconscious personified motivations was 
actually an accurate reflection of how 

54
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:31,381
the brain worked.
And so to think of yourself as a loose 

55
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:34,171
collection of autonomous spirits,
it's governed by some overarching 

56
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,690
identity.
Is is is a reasonable way of thinking 

57
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,360
about it.
The question is,

58
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:45,361
or a question that arises from that is 
what is the nature of this a priority 

59
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:50,340
structure that you use to interpret the 
world and I think the clearest answer to

60
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:57,211
that is that it's a story.
Then you live inside the story and 

61
00:03:57,211 --> 00:04:01,030
that's very,
very interesting to me because I believe

62
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,480
I have a couple of videos that laid this
out.

63
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:09,140
I believe that Darwinian 
presuppositions,

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,030
or at least as fundamental as Newtonian 
presuppositions.

65
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,620
I actually think they're more 
fundamental and that the fact that we've

66
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:23,621
evolved story like structures through 
which to interpret the world indicates 

67
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:28,961
to me that there's something deeply true
about story like structures where their 

68
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:33,731
true,
at least in so far as the fact that 

69
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,230
we've developed them means that here we 
are living and that it's taken three and

70
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:38,060
a half billion years to develop them.
They're,

71
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,090
they're highly functional and so we 
don't have much better definition of 

72
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,950
truth and highly functional.
You know that that's about as good as it

73
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,951
gets.
Partly because we're limited creatures 

74
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:53,861
and we don't have omniscience knowledge,
and so the best we can do with our 

75
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,290
knowledge,
generally speaking,

76
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,710
is to note its functionality and improve
it.

77
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:02,711
When it fails to work properly.
I think the scientific method actually 

78
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:06,251
does that and so the fact that we've 
evolved a story like structure through 

79
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,880
which to interpret the world.

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,120
That's pretty damn interesting.
It says something fundamental about 

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,701
stories and it's.
It's strange in the same way that the 

82
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:19,181
fact that we have hemispheric 
specialization for the known and the 

83
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:22,751
unknown or for chaos and order order and
chaos or respectively also says 

84
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:25,670
something fundamental about the nature 
of the world.

85
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:30,671
If you assume that you know,
we've evolved to reflect the structure 

86
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:34,271
of the world broadly speaking,
and that's obviously not just the 

87
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:36,170
physical structure,
the atoms and the molecules,

88
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:41,171
but all of the pattern manifestations of
the physical molecules as they build 

89
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:44,240
structures of increasing complexity 
across time.

90
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,840
That would include human interactions 
and all of and political interactions,

91
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,450
economic act interactions,
familiar interactions.

92
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,890
All of those things that are a very 
important part of our reality,

93
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,960
but perhaps in some sense not as 
fundamental,

94
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,950
the physical attributes that the 
physicists concentrate on.

95
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,370
So we live in stories and so I want to 
talk to you a little bit about stories 

96
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:12,431
and about their structure because when 
you understand a little bit about the 

97
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:15,920
structure of stories than a whole array 
of things about mythology,

98
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:20,921
all of a sudden make overwhelming sense 
and it's so useful because what you see 

99
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:25,991
is that many of the things that are 
standard occurrences in your life,

100
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,960
everyone's life that are portrayed 
universally and mythology and it's very 

101
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,460
helpful because first of all,
Dee Dee isolates you.

102
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,820
One of the things you learn as a 
clinical psychologist contra the anti 

103
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,420
psychiatry lists,
let's say,

104
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,440
is that diagnosis is often a relief to 
people.

105
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,530
You know there's a problem with being 
diagnosed because then you might be 

106
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,050
labeled and then the label can follow 
you for the rest of your life.

107
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:59,051
And once you're labeled as something,
then strange things happen around you 

108
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:03,701
that is often reinforced that label.
Maybe you start acting it out more or 

109
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:05,810
are you adopted as an identity,
but there's a flip side of that,

110
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:10,811
which is that the last thing that you 
ever want to hear when you go see a 

111
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:13,040
physician or psychologist is,
you know,

112
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,560
I've never seen a case like yours 
before,

113
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,530
right?
That is not a relief man,

114
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:23,531
because if the message is I've never 
heard anything like what you're telling 

115
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:26,750
me,
the outcome is either going to be not so

116
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:29,390
good for you or you're not going to get 
listened to it all,

117
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:29,630
right?

118
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,590
Because you're such an anomaly that 
you're,

119
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,810
you're actually in your existence is 
annoying to the integrated knowledge 

120
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,691
structure of the medical professional 
that you are attempting to receive 

121
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:40,691
advice from.
Well,

122
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:42,350
it's definitely the case because they,
you know,

123
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,540
if you can be put in a box,
then the box tells the doctor what to do

124
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,910
with you and that's actually a relief to
the doctor,

125
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,830
but also a relief to you,
right?

126
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,960
Because you want to know.
So you come and you say,

127
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:56,510
look,
I can't go out of my house much anymore.

128
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,060
I'm afraid on elevators.
Um,

129
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,120
I have heart palpitations and I 
sometimes they end up in the emergency 

130
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,271
room.
Increasingly my interactions in the 

131
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,200
world are restricted.
I find myself staying at home afraid I'm

132
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:12,230
going to die of a heart attack.
And the psychologist says,

133
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,780
well,
you have agora phobia,

134
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,120
and it's like lots of people have that 
and here's usually how it develops and 

135
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,790
here's the treatment course and you 
know,

136
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,980
we can probably do something about that.
And it's like,

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
well,
you're not going to die of a heart 

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
attack now probably that's a real 
relief.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,200
You're not crazy in a completely unique 
way and you're crazy in a way that might

140
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,280
be treatable,
you know,

141
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:34,590
and it's.
So,

142
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:37,730
it's such a relief because people come 
in there with a pile of snakes,

143
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,110
have indeterminant magnitude and they 
walk out with one manageable snake and 

144
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,120
it's still a snake.
But you know,

145
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,480
one manageable snake beats a hydra.
Right?

146
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,820
So,
all right,

147
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,200
so,
so back,

148
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,150
back to stories.
So

149
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,530
the stories that we tell and that we 
live in are fundamentally ways that we 

150
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:16,241
deal with the complexity of the world.
And the fundamental problem with the 

151
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:20,561
world as far as I can tell,
is that not only is it complex beyond 

152
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:25,931
your comprehension,
but the complexity shifts in 

153
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:29,021
unpredictable ways.
So that's the Darwinian conundrum 

154
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:33,941
actually that's wide darwinism seems to 
be a practical necessity with regards to

155
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:39,821
the continuation of life because because
of the complexity changes unpredictably,

156
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,520
you can't necessarily tell what's going 
to work in the future.

157
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,880
And so the Darwinian process solves that
by generating quasi random variations 

158
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:53,990
and letting,
whichever one by happenstance happens to

159
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:55,730
work in that environment,
survive.

160
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,150
Now it's not random precisely because 
the underlying structure is conserved.

161
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,230
It's very rare that a child would be 
born with an extra arm or something like

162
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,690
that.
And like the skeletal structure that you

163
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:13,370
inhabit is shared by animals going way,
way back.

164
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:16,700
In evolutionary history,
there's a lot of conservation and in the

165
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:21,701
evolutionary process,
but so there's variation within 

166
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:21,701
conservation,
like music.

167
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:23,630
It's a good,
it's a good way of thinking about it.

168
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,280
So

169
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,460
the,

170
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,020
the stories that we tell have exactly 
the same structure.

171
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:34,000
They have this,

172
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,160
this core element with variations and 
so,

173
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,860
alright,
I'll turn to the stories.

174
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,140
And so the first problem,
as I mentioned,

175
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:48,141
is a complexity problem.
Things are just too complicated to get a

176
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:53,211
handle on and that actually has serious 
consequences because what happens to 

177
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,310
everyone eventually is that their lives 
become so complicated that they die.

178
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,600
So and that and that and many terrible 
things can happen to you on the way to 

179
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,520
dying as well that are complex 
complexity related,

180
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,550
right?
You can develop a serious illness that 

181
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,550
you can't get a handle on.
You can hit a,

182
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,450
uh,
what would you call an impasse in your 

183
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,210
relationship that you cannot get past 
and see?

184
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:17,910
No way out of that happens to people 
quite frequently.

185
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,980
People who are suicidal,
for example,

186
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:24,981
they often feel like they've been backed
into a corner that know that they have 

187
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:24,981
no options.

188
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:27,240
They have no good options,
no matter which way they turn.

189
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,630
There's something terrible to face and 
they can't see any way out of it.

190
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,230
And sometimes that's more true than 
you'd like to think because we also tend

191
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,870
to like to think that people's problems 
are primarily psychological,

192
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:44,871
but they're not that.
That's one thing you learned quite 

193
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,210
rapidly as a clinician is that most of 
the time people don't come to you 

194
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,171
because they have mental illness.
They come to you because they have a 

195
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:52,830
complexity management problem.
Their lives have got out of hand on them

196
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,660
and they don't know how to get them back
under control,

197
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,290
and so all sorts of things can do that.
And then of course that can make you 

198
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:01,960
anxious or depressed to can trigger all 
sorts of illnesses,

199
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:06,961
but the fundamental problem is still 
that things have got beyond you and that

200
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:11,200
actually has a psychophysiological cost 
that isn't merely psychological.

201
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,000
You have a limited amount of capacity 
from from,

202
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,960
from,
from a resource perspective,

203
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,050
to deal with the emergent complexity.
You just.

204
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,750
There's just not enough of you.
You just,

205
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,530
you'll,
you'll exhaust your psychophysiological 

206
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,020
resources.
If you get into a situation that's too 

207
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,140
complex,
well that's what this.

208
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,210
That's what the idea of chaos 
represents.

209
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:38,380
It represents that underlying complexity
that can manifest itself at any time and

210
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:40,030
it can manifest itself.
For example,

211
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:45,031
if you're.
If you wake up in the morning and you 

212
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,571
know you'll feel an ache of some sort 
and perhaps it's nothing and you ignore 

213
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:49,780
it,
but it gets worse and you ended up going

214
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:53,200
to the hospital and you find out perhaps
for example,

215
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:58,201
that you have pancreatic cancer and 
you're going to live for six months and 

216
00:12:58,201 --> 00:12:58,650
that's the end of that,
and so it's,

217
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,970
it's,
it's,

218
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,640
it's at that moment that you break 
through the thin ice that everyone walks

219
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:08,641
on and you see what's underneath and 
what's underneath is the ineradicable 

220
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:12,820
complexity of life and that's chaos and 
that's now.

221
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,420
It's taken people a long,
long time to get a grip on this 

222
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,580
conceptuals.
What would you call it?

223
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:26,581
Conceptual Schema.
And the and human beings have done it 

224
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:31,831
mostly with image and story before 
they've been able to do it in any 

225
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:34,921
articulated manner.
And so there are a set of images that 

226
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:38,830
represent this underlying chaos and one 
of them is the dragon of chaos that,

227
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:42,310
that precisely that.
And that's the dragon that the hero goes

228
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:44,440
out to confront.
That's the symbol of the unknown.

229
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:48,080
It's the thing that lurks underneath.
It's the thing that also guards treasure

230
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:53,081
because in the unknown,
there's possibility also the water that 

231
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,290
was there that we talked about in the 
Mesopotamian creation myth,

232
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,480
the water that's there at the beginning,
um,

233
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,450
both assault and the fresh water is 
often assemble of pre cosmogony chaos.

234
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,360
Often people have dreams.
For example,

235
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,500
some of you,
you've had this dream,

236
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:11,290
I suspect you'll dream that you're in a 
house that you know,

237
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:16,291
well,
now all of a sudden you discover a new 

238
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:16,990
room or a set of new rooms or maybe a 
set of rooms in the basement,

239
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:18,460
and often the rooms are,
are,

240
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,100
are not well organized and they're full 
of water.

241
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,370
Those are very common things.
And what that means is that you've 

242
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,790
broken through the constraints of your 
conscious self understanding to a new 

243
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:34,180
domain of,
of possibility,

244
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,880
but a new domain that needs a tremendous
amount of work.

245
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:37,420
It says,
well,

246
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:40,210
here's a new part of you,
but it's not well developed.

247
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,160
There's,
there's,

248
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,420
it's flooded.
It's flooded with chaos.

249
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:45,370
Essentially,
and it's water,

250
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:50,371
I think partly because chaos is not only
what you fall into when you're not 

251
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:55,531
expecting it,
but it's also the unknown that you 

252
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:58,061
confront forthrightly and generate new 
things out of and water is a symbol of 

253
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:01,901
life,
especially in the desert and of course 

254
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,851
water.
Life is dependent on water and so 

255
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:06,760
water's a natural symbol to utilize when
you're talking about something that's 

256
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:12,941
life giving,
but also potentially deadly because a 

257
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:12,941
little bit of water,
well that's a drink,

258
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:13,190
but a lot of water.

259
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,810
That's a ship wreck.
Right?

260
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:17,810
And so and those are the.
Those are the extremes.

261
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,260
Now.
There are accounts that are sort of 

262
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,491
subtexts in genesis and elsewhere in the
Old Testament of God conquering a great 

263
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,530
monster,
Leviathan or or a a,

264
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,540
a moth that has these sort of serpent 
tile elements and making the world as a 

265
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:46,241
consequence of that conflict.
So there's this idea that the world 

266
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:48,140
creating force,
which we've talked about as the logos,

267
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,440
is the thing that continually confronts 
chaos and that one way of thinking about

268
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:58,841
chaos is as a predatory reptilian 
monster and often one that lives in the 

269
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:03,581
depths or perhaps underwater,
and part of that I think is because we 

270
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:06,020
actually use our Predator detection 
circuit to do this sort of pre cognitive

271
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:11,021
processing.
And so the notion fundamentally is 

272
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:14,350
anything that threatens you 
instantaneously is something that your 

273
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:14,840
Predator detection circuit should be 
working with.

274
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,990
It's fast,
it's fast,

275
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:21,020
it's low resolution,
it doesn't have a lot of ideas,

276
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,120
but it's really,
really fast.

277
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:28,121
And that also accounts for capability 
and tendency to very rapidly treat.

278
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:33,791
People who are upset are conceptual 
structures as enemies of the predatory 

279
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:41,231
variety.
We can fall into that in no time flat 

280
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:42,410
because it's.
It's the archetype.

281
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,560
Here's something comes along to knock 
you for a loop.

282
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,040
It's a shark.
It's something that lurks under the 

283
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,040
water.
It's something that'll pull you down.

284
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,401
It's an enemy and and you should get 
prepared and that's a reasonable 

285
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:57,650
defensive strategy even though it also 
has its dangers.

286
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:02,651
And can sometimes be wrong.
So the landscape within which we have to

287
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:11,261
erect our stories is fundamentally one 
of an overarching chaos and chaos that 

288
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:15,710
exceeds our capacity to comprehend in,
in any sense,

289
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,450
individually,
familial,

290
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:18,680
socially,
economically.

291
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,010
We're always threatened by the collapse 
of the structures that we inhabit 

292
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,170
constantly.

293
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,720
We have to work well.
It's like you own a house,

294
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:29,150
you know,
how much time do you spend maintaining a

295
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:30,860
house?
Well,

296
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,360
a lot.
And why is that?

297
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:36,920
Is because the house falls apart because
you're stupid and the house falls apart.

298
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,320
Well because you do repair is wrong or 
you ignore things.

299
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:44,321
Right?
And I'm saying this actually for 

300
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,571
technical reasons,
the house falls apart because you're 

301
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:46,571
incompetent,
but even if you're competent,

302
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:47,570
the house falls apart,
right?

303
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:52,571
It's just entropy.
And so things have a proclivity to fall 

304
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,550
apart on their own.
So you just have to run like mad just to

305
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,830
keep them doing what they're supposed to
be doing.

306
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,340
And then of course that is complicated 
by your own willful blindness and 

307
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,911
inadequacy as a repair person and 
refusal to attend and all those other 

308
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:04,911
things.
So.

309
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,590
So that's a very classic idea which 
we'll return to.

310
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,340
One of the ideas that that Mircea 
Eliana,

311
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,440
a famous historian of religions,
extracted from a very large corpus of 

312
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:23,421
flood myths,
was the idea that the earth is 

313
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:26,610
periodically flooded for two reasons.
One is things fall apart,

314
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,500
just entropy,
straight entropy.

315
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:33,501
It's,
I don't remember which law of 

316
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:34,971
thermodynamics that is,
but it's one of the big laws of 

317
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:38,061
thermodynamics.
So it's since it's one of the top three 

318
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:39,540
and things fall apart of their own 
accord and that's one of the things that

319
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:44,541
we have to contend with.
And then the rate at which things fall 

320
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,910
apart is sped by the sins of men.
That's the other idea.

321
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:51,120
And you know that everyone knows that 
because you know,

322
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,210
you know your car breaks down in the 
highway and you think,

323
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:55,440
God,
that's so inconvenient.

324
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:56,070
And then you,
you know,

325
00:18:56,071 --> 00:19:01,071
you shake your fist at the sky and then 
there's part of you in the back of your 

326
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:01,071
mind that goes,
God,

327
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:03,780
you know,
I knew that rattled that I wasn't paying

328
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,510
attention to actually signified 
something.

329
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,720
You know,
and I,

330
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,920
I knew I should have paid attention to 
it and I didn't,

331
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:13,460
and now I'm in the situation that I'm in
now and you know,

332
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,340
I know I bet you this happens to people 
two or three times a week,

333
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:20,310
is they do something stupid that they 
know they shouldn't have done,

334
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:25,311
that they told themselves not to do mere
seconds before and they know the voice 

335
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:26,730
says,
don't do that.

336
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,330
Yeah,
yeah,

337
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,660
you do it.
You can get nailed for it exactly the 

338
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,151
way that you knew you would get nailed 
for it and then you're hurt doubly 

339
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:38,871
because not only did it fall apart,
but you're the idiot that made it fall 

340
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:39,840
apart,
knowing full well that was going to fall

341
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:43,800
apart and ignoring it.
And so that's the idea behind the notion

342
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:46,620
that there are two reasons that things 
fall apart.

343
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,370
Thermodynamic entropy and the proclivity
of people not to attend to things they 

344
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:56,250
know they should attend to and partly we
do that because if,

345
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,430
if a problem emerges,
it always announces itself.

346
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,460
Unless it's a really,
really tiny problem and you're 

347
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:04,460
approaching it voluntarily,
voluntarily,

348
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,691
it always announces itself with negative
emotion and that's part of the Predator 

349
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:13,491
detection circuited.
It announces itself in frustration or 

350
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:16,170
disappointment or emotional pain or 
grief or the paramount one,

351
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,010
anxiety and and no wonder because it's a
problem,

352
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:25,011
right?
And the logical one of the logical 

353
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:25,011
responses is to sort of freeze in the 
face of the problem,

354
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:28,080
but of course if it's a problem that has
to be addressed and solved,

355
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,760
freezing it and turning away from it is 
not a good solution because since things

356
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:36,900
tend to fall apart on their own accord,
if you just leave the thing alone,

357
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:39,570
that's problem Madec.
It's just going to get worse,

358
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:44,571
not better.
Which is one of the things that's very 

359
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:44,571
annoying about life.
So for example,

360
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:48,800
you know,
if you get a warning message from the 

361
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,470
Tax Department,
the probability that ignoring that will 

362
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,620
make it go away is zero,
right?

363
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,900
What'll happen instead is that the more 
you ignore it,

364
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:58,420
the larger it will grow.
And if you ignore it long enough,

365
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,000
then it will turn into something large 
enough to eat.

366
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:05,830
You and that will be the end of you.
I read in Harper's magazine at one point

367
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,860
that people would rather be mugged than 
audited,

368
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,280
and so I believe that because the 
mugging man that's over a couple of 

369
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,280
minutes of sheer terror,
lost your wallet,

370
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:20,440
the way you walk the audit,
that's like,

371
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,980
that's like a semi fatal disease.
So that's chaos now.

372
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:30,880
It's the idea here too is that that's 
the chaos.

373
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,510
That's the psychological ideas that 
that's also the chaos that whatever is 

374
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,801
being represented in genesis as the 
spirit of God extracts order out of at 

375
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:45,421
the beginning of time and it's also that
which we're constantly contending with 

376
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:49,810
as we struggle in the same manner to 
construct and maintain habitable world.

377
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,720
So it's brilliant.
It's brilliant.

378
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:57,770
You know,
when I first put together the 

379
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,881
relationship between what Iliana called 
the pre cosmogony chaos and the Predator

380
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,850
predatory landscape that surrounded our 
ancestors and the manner in which we're 

381
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,870
structured neurologically to respond to 
all of that.

382
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:12,871
I thought it was.
It was like an an amazing epiphany 

383
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:16,000
because it's self evidently the case 
that the world is too complicated for us

384
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:21,001
to deal with and that's one of the 
problems that we face on an ongoing 

385
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:21,340
basis and then the question is,
well,

386
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,890
what do you do about that?
And if you ignore it,

387
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:28,891
it gets worse,
so ignoring it doesn't work and so we 

388
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:29,200
know what doesn't work and so if 
ignoring it doesn't work,

389
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:33,580
then attending to it might work and then
I found out with the Egyptians,

390
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:36,600
for example,
that horace was the god of attention.

391
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,820
In the same thing happened among the 
Mesopotamians with Marduk and his ring 

392
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:41,820
of eyes.

393
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,050
It's like what's the way to forestall 
the catastrophe of things falling apart 

394
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:51,841
in the answer that is by attending to 
the voluntarily attending to them and 

395
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:55,411
that slot very nicely into the hero 
mythology that promotes the idea that if

396
00:22:55,661 --> 00:23:00,130
there's a dragon in the whereabouts in,
in the near,

397
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,160
in the,
in the,

398
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,260
in the neighborhood.
Let's say that hiding in the basement 

399
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,811
just makes it grow larger.
It's time to go out and confront the 

400
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:11,710
damn thing and the general stories are 
as well.

401
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,570
You might get killed because it's a 
dragon,

402
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:18,571
but it's only might as opposed to 
definitely will get killed if it happens

403
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:22,990
to attack you at three in the morning at
home when you're hung over and it's been

404
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:25,530
a bad day and you don't have your,
you know,

405
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,850
are your sword and your shield at the 
ready,

406
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,480
which is generally what happens to 
people who avoid things,

407
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,090
so it's not something that should be 
recommended.

408
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,270
You're screwed both ways.
That's one of the things that's so nice 

409
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,361
about being deeply pessimistic.
It's so freeing because one of the 

410
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:44,110
things,
well,

411
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,230
it's very frequent.
It's such a relief and it is really a 

412
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,920
useful habit to develop is sometimes no 
matter what you do,

413
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:56,921
you're in trouble and that's a relief 
because then you can stop scrabbling 

414
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:58,130
around for the way out.
There's no way out man.

415
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,440
It's like you can pick murder,
wretched death,

416
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,990
a or slightly less wretched death be 
something like that,

417
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
but.
And I know that's a terrible way of 

418
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,721
looking at things,
but it is extraordinarily useful to 

419
00:24:13,721 --> 00:24:17,141
understand that many times you get your 
choice boils down to picking the least 

420
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:22,691
bad option and if that's all you can do,
if that's how life is revealing itself 

421
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:23,510
to you,
it's like,

422
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,620
well,
more power to you,

423
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,020
the least bad option.
That's the best you can do.

424
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,440
And and it's good enough,
especially compared to the alternative 

425
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,840
which is the most bad option.
So all right now.

426
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,350
So the fundamental reality of things is 
complexity beyond comprehension.

427
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,450
And then the question is,
well,

428
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:49,451
how is it that you manage that?
And partly you manage that and this is 

429
00:24:49,451 --> 00:24:51,080
where the PA,
the image of the patriarchal order comes

430
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:55,640
in in the positive manner.
I might point out because in the absence

431
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:59,300
of patriarchal structure,
for lack of a better lexicon,

432
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,510
there's nothing but chaos and I wouldn't
recommend chaos because it's it.

433
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,790
There's a lot of it and there isn't that
much of you.

434
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,180
And if you think you can handle it 
without an a priori structure and 

435
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,340
without a sociological structures 
surrounding you,

436
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,070
then you don't know anything at all 
about human beings.

437
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,410
Because one of the things I've noticed 
for example,

438
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:23,411
is that it's,
it's unbelievable the degree to which 

439
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:27,050
our sanity depends on our functioning,
sociological structure.

440
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,030
And here's why.
Well,

441
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:34,031
first of all,
you kind of need to know what to do 

442
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:34,031
every day.

443
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:34,490
You have to have a routine because 
you're an animal,

444
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,740
you know,
and you know if you have a dog or a cat,

445
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,770
dogs are really good example of this.
Dogs like routine,

446
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,890
they like to be walked the number of 
times a day that they're supposed to be 

447
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,200
walked and they get quite sick very 
rapidly.

448
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:49,370
If you don't,
if you don't routinize their days,

449
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,400
children are exactly the same way.
Now you can overdo it,

450
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,630
right?
But still,

451
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:58,631
you know,
you need to know proximately when you 

452
00:25:58,631 --> 00:25:58,640
should get up to be approximately the 
same everyday.

453
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,470
You need to know approximately.
You're going,

454
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:05,471
when you're going to eat,
you need to know what you're going to 

455
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:05,471
eat.
You need to know who you're going to eat

456
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:06,020
with,
you need to know where to buy your food.

457
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:09,710
It's like 80 percent of your life,
70 percent of your life.

458
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,450
Something like that consists of those 
things that you do every single day that

459
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:19,451
you repeat,
and those are often the things that 

460
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:19,940
people think about as the trivial 
elements of their life,

461
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:24,941
but one of the things I would like to 
point out to you if you do the 

462
00:26:24,941 --> 00:26:26,750
mathematics I,
I did this with a client of mine who was

463
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:31,400
having a hard time putting his child to 
bet they were having a fight every night

464
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,800
and I knew by that time the studies 
indicate that most parents only spend 20

465
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:39,650
minutes per day of one on one time with 
their child.

466
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,040
Now the reason for that is that people 
are busy.

467
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,680
It's actually not that easy to Parse out
20 minutes of one on one time.

468
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,050
It's a lot bloody more time than you 
think,

469
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,970
but that's all.
There is.

470
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,840
Twenty minutes he's spending like 40 
minutes a day fighting with this kid,

471
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:59,400
trying to get the kid to go to bed and 
that's not very entertaining,

472
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:00,030
you know,
you think,

473
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:02,850
well it's just having a scrap with a kid
about going to bed,

474
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:03,090
but it's.

475
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,430
No,
no,

476
00:27:03,431 --> 00:27:03,840
no,
no,

477
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,910
no.
If it happens every day,

478
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,340
it's a catastrophe.
So you do the math,

479
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,490
so it will say five hours a week for the
sake of argument,

480
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:14,550
just to keep it simple.
It's 20 hours a month.

481
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:19,530
It's 240 hours a year.
That 60 slash 40 hour work weeks.

482
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,780
So that guy was basically spending a 
month and a half of work weeks doing 

483
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,990
absolutely nothing but having a wretched
time fighting with his son,

484
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:30,870
trying to get them to go to bed.
Horrible.

485
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Right.
That's just way too much time to spend 

486
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,421
doing something like that.
If you want to actually have a positive 

487
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:38,760
relationship with someone because it's 
just too.

488
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,950
It's just too punishing him so well.
So you need structure,

489
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,920
you need predictability and you need 
more of it than you think.

490
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,990
Just to keep you sane.
Now,

491
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,320
if you're lucky and maybe a bit odd,
you can deviate five percent from the 

492
00:27:55,141 --> 00:28:00,141
norm or 10 percent from the norm or 
something like that carefully and 

493
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:04,011
cautiously,
as long as the rest of you is all well 

494
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:06,861
ordered in informative manner,
you might be able to get away with that 

495
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:09,921
and you might be able to sustain that 
across time and people might be able to 

496
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,041
tolerate you if you do it or maybe 
you'll get really lucky and you happen 

497
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,461
to be creative but reasonably well put 
together and people will actually be 

498
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,480
happy that there's something 
idiosyncratic and unique about you.

499
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,930
But even under those circumstances,
mostly what you want is to have a 

500
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,750
routine.
It's disciplined.

501
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,240
It's predictable and bloody well stick 
to it.

502
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:31,620
You're going to be way healthier and 
happier and Saner if you do that.

503
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:36,621
And then the other thing that you need,
because this is one of the things the 

504
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:40,401
psychoanalysts got wrong,
I think is that they overestimated the 

505
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:42,540
degree to which sanity was a consequence
of internal,

506
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,540
of being properly structured internally.
You know,

507
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,090
because from the psychoanalytic point of
view,

508
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:53,091
you're sort of an ego and that ego is 
inside you and of course it rests on an 

509
00:28:53,091 --> 00:28:56,901
unconscious structure,
but the purpose of psychoanalytic 

510
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,630
analysis is to sort out that unconscious
structure and the ego on top of it and 

511
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,460
to make you a fully functioning and 
autonomous individual,

512
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,880
but there's a problem with that because 
the reason that you're saying as a fully

513
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:14,181
functional and antonymous human being 
isn't because you've organized your 

514
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:15,180
psyche even though that's important.

515
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,600
The reason that you're saying,
if you're aware,

516
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,690
if you have a well organized unconscious
and ego is because other people can 

517
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,790
tolerate having you around for 
reasonably extensive periods of time and

518
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:31,791
we'll cuff you across the back of the 
head every time you do something so 

519
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:33,780
stupid that people will dislike you 
permanently if you continue,

520
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,020
and so what people are doing to each 
other all the time,

521
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,200
just nonstop is broadcasting.
Sanity signals back and forth,

522
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:45,280
right?
It's like you smile at people if they're

523
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,090
well,
if they're not,

524
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:51,091
not only behaving property,
but behaving in a way that you would 

525
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:52,090
like to see them continue to behave,
you frown at them.

526
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,290
If they're not,
you ignore them.

527
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,550
If they're not,
you shun them.

528
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:57,040
You,
you roll your eyes out them you manifest

529
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,900
to discuss face.
You don't listen to them.

530
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:01,270
You interrupt them.
You won't cooperate with them.

531
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:06,270
You won't compete with them.
It's like you're blasting signals and 

532
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,740
other people about how to regulate their
behavior so frequently.

533
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Well,
it just makes up all of your social 

534
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,421
interaction and that's why we face each 
other and we have emotional displays on 

535
00:30:15,421 --> 00:30:17,680
her face and we're looking at each 
other's eyes and we know exactly.

536
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,040
We know as much as we can about what's 
going on with each other given that we 

537
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,460
don't have immediate access to the 
contents of their consciousness,

538
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:29,461
and so partly what you're doing with 
your routine is establishing yourself as

539
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:31,270
a credible,
reliable,

540
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:36,300
trustworthy,
potentially interesting human being who 

541
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,601
isn't going to do anything too erratic 
at any moment and everyone else is 

542
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:41,980
around there tapping you into shape.
Making sure that that's exactly what you

543
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:45,550
are and that's how you stay sane and so 
what happens to people too,

544
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:50,551
if they don't have a routine and they 
get isolated as they start to drift and 

545
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:55,201
they drift badly because the world is 
too complicated for you to keep it 

546
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:58,330
organized all by yourself,
you just cannot do it.

547
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,540
So a lot of our.
So we outsource the problem of sanity 

548
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,520
and it's very intelligent that we 
outsourced the problem of sanity because

549
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,510
sanity is an impossibly complex problem 
and so the way that we manage the 

550
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,790
incredibly complex problem is we have a 
very large number of brains working 

551
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,200
simultaneously on the problem all the 
time.

552
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,070
It's like a stock market for sanity and 
it's partly I,

553
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:29,130
I use that.
I use that definition with purpose 

554
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,940
because the stock market does the same 
kind of impossible thing,

555
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:35,941
right?
Because it tries to price things which 

556
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:35,941
is impossible.
There is to how many things are there,

557
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,040
like a billion.
How in the world do you decide what the 

558
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,440
price is?
You can decide what the price is.

559
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,280
That's why you have a stock market as 
well.

560
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:45,450
In a free market,
I mean for,

561
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:50,451
for consumer goods is everyone's voting 
on what the price of everything is all 

562
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,520
the time and that's the way we figure it
out because it's actually.

563
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,820
It's technically impossible.
That's partly why the stock market 

564
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,370
explodes now and then and there's 
bubbles and all that sort of thing.

565
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,640
But anyways,
the point is things are chaotic.

566
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,790
In Alice in Wonderland,
when Alice goes down the rabbit hole,

567
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,920
that's the underworld,
right?

568
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,850
So now she's gone into the substructure 
of being and she meets the Red Queen.

569
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,650
The Red Queen is Mother Nature and 
mother nature is running around yelling 

570
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,390
off with their heads off with their 
heads,

571
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,230
which is of course what Mother Nature 
Does and she tells Ellis in my kingdom,

572
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:31,540
you have to run as fast as you can just 
to stay in the same place.

573
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,580
And that's exactly right,
and that's a description of it.

574
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,570
In fact,
evolutionary biologists,

575
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,560
psychologists have picked up on that 
phrase,

576
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:44,561
they call it the red queen problem,
and the Red Queen problem is 

577
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:49,390
everything's after you all the time and 
you're not smart enough to do anything 

578
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,181
about it or enough about it,
and so that's a permanent existential 

579
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:52,181
problem.

580
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,380
So how do you deal with that?
He's got a biological structure,

581
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,100
so your embodiment is part of the 
solution to the problem and then you're 

582
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,360
enculturated and because you're 
enculturated,

583
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,910
we're taught a lot of things that you 
need to know,

584
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:09,911
but mostly what you're taught is how to 
communicate with other people in an 

585
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:13,111
acceptable manner.
And then once you can communicate with 

586
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:16,751
people in an acceptable manner,
then you can outsource your problems 

587
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:16,910
constantly.
But you're doing constantly.

588
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:21,140
And so we're in this continual dynamic 
exchange of problem solving.

589
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,140
So if you're a socialized person,
that's what you get access to.

590
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,420
And that's something to know if you're 
going to have kids,

591
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,430
and I mentioned this,
I think in a previous lecture,

592
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,270
the per.
The purpose of being a parent for very 

593
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,151
young children is to make your children 
exceptionally socially desirable.

594
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:40,880
By the age of four,
because if you can do that,

595
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,900
there are set because everyone wants 
them around and as soon as everybody 

596
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,360
wants them around,
they want to play with them,

597
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,520
they want to cooperate when they want to
compete with them.

598
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,520
It's like the door is open,
the doors open and they stay sane 

599
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,701
because they've got all sorts of people 
who actually like them that are helping 

600
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:00,851
them out.
And so that's your goal is to make them 

601
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:01,440
as socially acceptable as you possibly 
can,

602
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:03,470
have socially desirable as you possibly 
can.

603
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,840
And that doesn't mean you render them 
obedient without spirit.

604
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,380
Right?
That's,

605
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:14,381
that's a tyrants motive of enforcing 
social acceptability is like never do 

606
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,660
anything wrong.
Well that's not any way to.

607
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,980
I mean that's a good piece of advice,
you know,

608
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:23,420
like,
but it's missing the other half which is

609
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:25,370
do a bunch of things that are right.
So that,

610
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,230
so that people are thrilled to have you 
around and do and encourage that.

611
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:34,010
That's what you want to do as a parent 
as well as inculcating the order.

612
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,050
And so,
you know,

613
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,100
and in this little diagram I indicated 
that there is God the father with his 

614
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,290
son behind him and he's ruling over this
walled city,

615
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,320
so he's like the met has spirit of the 
walled city.

616
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,420
It's very,
very nice,

617
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,030
very nice image,
brilliant image.

618
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:53,630
So it's the collective spirit of the 
city.

619
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:58,631
That's another way of thinking about it 
or the collective spirit of the city 

620
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:01,510
across time or the collective spirit of 
the force that built and maintained the 

621
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:06,581
city across time even better and that's 
associated with the sun because it's,

622
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:07,360
uh,
it's,

623
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,380
it's,
it's associated with enlightenment and 

624
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,560
illumination and all of those things 
that we associate with higher 

625
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,230
consciousness and vision.
So brilliant image.

626
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,720
And then I overlaid this,
you know,

627
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:22,721
now of course the patriarchal aspect of 
existence can become tyrannical.

628
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:30,030
Does that have quite regularly.
It's one of the existential dangers of 

629
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,170
human civilization is that civilization 
is a medication for chaos,

630
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,440
but it can spin out of control in and of
itself and become its own sort of 

631
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,071
problem,
which is like a hyper order problem 

632
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:43,071
generally,
which then produces a chaos problem.

633
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,490
So every solution carries within it 
certain problems,

634
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:52,491
right?
Because no solution is perfect and so 

635
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:54,531
you have to keep things in balance,
but it's one of the reasons that I'm 

636
00:35:54,531 --> 00:35:57,501
really a,
let's call it irritated about the 

637
00:35:57,501 --> 00:36:02,031
postmodernists because they keep 
yammering about the patriarchy and it's 

638
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:06,771
very,
very annoying because because it's self 

639
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:08,580
evident that social structures are 
tyrannical.

640
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,570
It's like that's not news folks,
that's obvious,

641
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,700
but that's not all they are and it's.
It's the.

642
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,740
It's the reduction of the entire complex
solution,

643
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:26,130
let's say to a unit dimensional problem.
It's just tight tyranny.

644
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:27,210
It's like,
no,

645
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:32,211
actually it's not just tyranny.
If you spend six months somewhere that 

646
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:33,600
was just tyranny,
you'd know the difference very,

647
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:38,601
very rapidly,
and that doesn't mean that everyone 

648
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:41,930
doesn't give up a pound or two or 10 or 
20 of flesh to participate.

649
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,870
Even in a society that's as free as a 
Western society is,

650
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,490
we all get crushed and molded by the 
tyrannical force of social convention,

651
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,330
but at least in principle,
the benefit is worth the cost and then 

652
00:36:56,431 --> 00:37:01,431
it's also up to you to make sure that 
you don't sacrifice more to the group 

653
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:05,300
than you should and you can start to 
tell if you're sacrificing more to the 

654
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,800
group than you should because you start 
to become resentful of other people.

655
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:13,130
That's part of that.
That's part of this psychological 

656
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,690
mechanism that's informing you of that.
So it's up to you to fight against the,

657
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,180
you know,
the overarching pressure for conformity 

658
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,060
to retain your individual logos,
let's say.

659
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:26,390
But that's sort of your problem.
It's like the group wants you to behave 

660
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,640
now.
If you could behave and be creatively 

661
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:31,640
productive,
so much the better,

662
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,781
but that's pretty damn rare.
So the group generally tends to settle 

663
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:38,340
just for behave and there's a tyrannical
element of that.

664
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:41,100
But what the hell is the alternative?
It's,

665
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,160
you know,
our society is based on consensus and 

666
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,140
the consensus is based on the sacrifice 
of a certain sacrifice of individuality.

667
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Even though individualities absolutely 
necessary as a revitalizing force for 

668
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,790
the society,
it's a very tight touched,

669
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,420
tough,
tough thing to manage property.

670
00:37:57,421 --> 00:38:02,421
So anyways,
you have the your physiological 

671
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:07,191
structure as your first line of ordering
in relationship to chaos because your 

672
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:09,630
body presents you with the world in a 
certain way.

673
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:14,810
And then the second line of defense is 
something like this sociological 

674
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,260
structure that you inhabit and we could 
call those the competency hierarchies or

675
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:19,830
something like that and thank God for 
them because you know,

676
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,980
maybe you're going to be able to 
specialize in one or two things in your 

677
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,681
life or five things,
but there's 300 things you need to know 

678
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:27,720
and if it's just you,
you know,

679
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:32,721
you'll be doing your genius level 
mathematics while your bath tub is 

680
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:34,110
leaking all over your,
over your bathroom floor.

681
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,700
And that's not so good.
So you can call a plumber and hooray for

682
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:37,360
that.
So,

683
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,270
you know,
we tend to cooperate to keep chaos under

684
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:43,930
control and we tend to cooperate to keep
order under control.

685
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,350
And that's the political dialogue,
right?

686
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:53,190
We maintain the culture to keep chaos 
under control and we balanced the 

687
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:58,351
culture owed properly to keep the 
culture under control and that way we 

688
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:02,761
get to live reasonably peacefully,
reasonably productively for a reasonable

689
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:07,891
amount of time,
and that's the best that we can do and 

690
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:10,891
we should have some gratitude when 
that's working because the default 

691
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:15,360
condition of things is that not only do 
they not work very well,

692
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:19,540
they work worse and worse over time all 
by themselves,

693
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,320
so anytime anything is working,
you should just be amazed by it.

694
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,010
All right,
so what is the frame look like?

695
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:28,690
Well,
I think it looks something like this,

696
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:31,660
and this is as far as I can tell,
this is the bare bones.

697
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,550
This is the bare bones of a variety of 
things.

698
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:37,210
It's a bare bone story.
It's a verbal and conceptual framework.

699
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,320
It's a bare bone dazzle to,
to speak in Heideggerian terms.

700
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:43,720
It's like it's the bare bones world that
you live in.

701
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:47,110
You're always in one of these worlds.
There's no getting out of them.

702
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,680
You can move from one to another,
but you're always in a world like this 

703
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,861
and so this is the world that you're in.
You're somewhere because you have to be 

704
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:58,690
somewhere.
Now you might not know where that is,

705
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,810
which means that the somewhere that you 
are is chaotic,

706
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:07,110
in which case you need to go over your 
past in great detail and figure out 

707
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,150
where you are.

708
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:12,150
It's like you're lost right to your,
your last and the problem with being 

709
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,451
last is when you're lost.
You don't know where to go and the 

710
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:18,361
problem with not knowing where to go is 
there's a million places that you could 

711
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:20,830
go and a million places is too many 
places for you to go without dying,

712
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,790
so being lost is not good,
so you need to know where you are.

713
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:30,010
One of the things that we built online,
my partners and I is this program called

714
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:35,011
past authoring that helps people lay out
the narrative of their past to identify,

715
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,370
to break their life down into six 
stages,

716
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:44,371
epochs.
We called them and then to identify the 

717
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:46,420
emotionally significant moments in each 
park and to write them out.

718
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,760
What happened negatively,
what happened positively,

719
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,880
what the consequences were,
what you derive from it,

720
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:53,560
perhaps what you could have done 
differently,

721
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:58,561
perhaps what you learned from it,
all of that so that you can narrow in 

722
00:40:58,561 --> 00:41:02,580
zero in on determining precisely where 
it is that you are right now and people 

723
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:08,851
are often loath to do that because they 
actually don't want to know because 

724
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:11,461
they'd rather be spread out in as sort 
of half blind manner in the fog hoping 

725
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:17,110
that the place that they're at is better
than it really is,

726
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,960
and deluding themselves by remaining 
vague.

727
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Then to figure out,
I'm right here right now with these 

728
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,661
specific problems,
but it's actually better to do that 

729
00:41:27,661 --> 00:41:30,610
because if you have a set of specific 
problems and you've really narrowed them

730
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:35,611
down and really specified them,
then you probably start fixing them and 

731
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:38,480
you can start fixing them and Mike Micro
ways,

732
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,540
bit by bit,
but there's no way you can do that 

733
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:43,790
without knowing where you are.
It's impossible and you can kind of tell

734
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,940
if you don't know where you are.
It's quite straightforward.

735
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,960
If you are haunted by reveries of the 
past for events that are older than 

736
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:57,410
approximately 18 months,
if they continue to come up in your mind

737
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:59,390
over and over and your dreams over and 
over,

738
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,660
you haven't extracted the world out from
your past experiences.

739
00:42:05,661 --> 00:42:10,280
That potential is still trapped in the 
past and to confront the potential means

740
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:15,281
to confront the dragon of the past,
and of course that's terrifying and 

741
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:15,980
seriously be terrifying.

742
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,980
So for example,
maybe you're vague and ill formed and 

743
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,310
ill defined because you were abused very
badly when you were a child,

744
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:23,780
four years old,
something like that,

745
00:42:23,781 --> 00:42:27,080
and maybe you were abused by a family 
member because that's generally who does

746
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,780
the abusing,
and so that just makes it worse.

747
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:33,920
And then what that means is that you've 
got a implicit.

748
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,160
You've had an implicit encounter with 
malevolent evil that no,

749
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,360
you've had to direct encounter with 
malevolent evil,

750
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:45,710
but you have an implicit hypothesis of 
malevolent evil that's plaguing you.

751
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,170
It's still there.
It's trapped in the memories,

752
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:48,970
right?
It's,

753
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,040
it's trapped in the representational 
structure and as an adult you're now 

754
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,671
faced with the necessity of articulating
that fully before you have any chance 

755
00:42:57,671 --> 00:42:59,360
whatsoever of freeing yourself from it,
and so that's no joke.

756
00:42:59,361 --> 00:43:01,220
Lots of times people have to go into the
past.

757
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:03,810
That's what the psychoanalysts do and 
say,

758
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:08,830
look,
here's something came along and just 

759
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:09,770
bloody well knocked me over and it isn't
even that I repressed it,

760
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,060
which,
which I think was,

761
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,040
well,
we won't talk about Freud's errors 

762
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,040
because freud was a genius,
so we'll just leave him alone,

763
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,320
but,
but sometimes it's not repression.

764
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:23,320
It's just the terrible things happen to 
people at such a young age that there 

765
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,820
isn't a bloody chance in hell of that.
They can figure out why they happened or

766
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:29,720
what to do with them or what they mean,
and then you can carry that with you and

767
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:33,410
you carry it with you.
It's like fear your,

768
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,460
your body encounters the world in stages
and it happens very rapidly.

769
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,110
Well,
it can extend over years,

770
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,060
but the initial stages happen very 
rapidly.

771
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:46,061
So for example,
if you're walking down the road and you 

772
00:43:46,061 --> 00:43:46,280
hear a large noise,
a loud noise behind you,

773
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,360
he'll go like this.
That's a Predator defense response by 

774
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,510
the way you crouched down and that's to 
stop something from jumping on your back

775
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:56,320
and getting at your neck too easily.
That's like few million,

776
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,380
a few hundred milliseconds.
It's really faster,

777
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,400
even faster than that.
And it better be because something like 

778
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:03,400
a snake,
but we'll say,

779
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,060
can nail you just right now so you 
better be fast.

780
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,330
But it's low resolution.
It's like dangerous snake,

781
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:10,870
something like that or danger,
predatory cap.

782
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,920
It's that faxed and then you can unravel
that and categorize it.

783
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,510
But that takes time.
You do that with emotion and then you do

784
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:25,511
it with cognition.
And you can do that with longterm 

785
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:25,511
thinking,
you know,

786
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:27,140
because maybe you've encountered someone
specifically malevolent and predatory at

787
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:30,320
work and it happens to people a lot 
who's operating as a,

788
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,520
as a destructive bully and who seems to 
have no positive function whatsoever.

789
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,970
And his only living that out.
And then you know,

790
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,470
you don't know what to do about it.
So you're,

791
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,500
you're in prey mode.
I don't mean this kind of mode,

792
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:49,501
although that would help too,
but I mean you're acting like a prey 

793
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,120
animal and then you have this terribly 
complex thing to decompose,

794
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,190
which is what the hell is up with this 
person?

795
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:58,730
Why are they making my life miserable?
What is it about B that allows them to 

796
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,751
make my life miserable?
That's a nasty little road to walk down 

797
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:06,410
and you're stuck with having to.
You're stuck with having to decompose 

798
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:06,410
it.
Maybe you can't.

799
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:10,830
Maybe formulating and explicit 
philosophy of good and evil to deal with

800
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:15,831
something malevolent in your environment
actually just happens to be beyond you.

801
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:21,890
And that could easily be.
It's certainly the case for people who 

802
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:21,900
are young and it's the case for plenty 
of adults as well.

803
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:26,901
It's no simple thing to matt to manage.
It's something too that often soldiers 

804
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:31,401
who have posttraumatic stress disorder 
have to do because they've encountered 

805
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:34,820
terrible things.
They've either done them or ran into 

806
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,101
them and they need to update their moral
model of the world or if they end up in 

807
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:41,961
something close to closely approximating
hell anyway.

808
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,200
So you need to know where you are.
That's this.

809
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,910
What is,
where are you?

810
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,270
So you're navigating your navigator.
You're a sailor on an ocean,

811
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:51,900
man.
That's what.

812
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:53,730
That's what you are.
You're a mobile creature.

813
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:56,250
You're going from point a to point b all
the time.

814
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,850
You're not sitting there glued to a rock
like some brainless,

815
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,530
you know,
sea creature.

816
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:03,570
There's a funny little creature called a
hydra.

817
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,080
Very simple little creature in his 
juvenile stage.

818
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:11,220
It has a brain because it swims around.
But then when it turns into an adult,

819
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,000
it latches itself to Iraq and promptly 
digests it's brain.

820
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,370
Because if you're just sitting on a rock
and you're not moving,

821
00:46:17,371 --> 00:46:18,360
you don't need a brain.
So.

822
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:19,770
But that's not our issue,
right?

823
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:21,720
We're,
we're zipping around in the world and so

824
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:24,390
we're navigating agents.
And so to navigate,

825
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,790
there's two things you need to know.

826
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,280
And the first is,
where the hell are you?

827
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,350
Exactly,
precisely right.

828
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:36,410
Razor sharp.
What's good about you and what's bad 

829
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:36,410
about you?
By your own,

830
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:37,890
by your own reckoning.
You don't have to.

831
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,890
You can ask other people,
but this is a game you play yourself.

832
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,660
It's like as far as I'm concerned,
I'm taking star,

833
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,760
what is it that's okay about being what 
needs some work and you've got to watch 

834
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,690
to not be too self critical when you're 
doing that too because that can just be 

835
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:53,690
another kind of flaw and then the next 
is,

836
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:54,840
okay,
well where are you going?

837
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,020
What's your destination?
Well,

838
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,050
and that's what the frame is.
Now you know you could do that in a very

839
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:06,051
sophisticated way and you do that by 
thinking consciously about who it is 

840
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:09,330
that you are in an articulated manner 
and where you want to go and why and how

841
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:11,640
you're going to get there and people 
hardly ever do that.

842
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,670
That is,
that's come as such an absolute shock to

843
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:19,671
me as an educator.
I just because one of the other programs

844
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,690
I use this in my classes or what did the
other programs in this suite of programs

845
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:29,691
is called the future authoring program 
and I started developing my maps of 

846
00:47:29,691 --> 00:47:33,651
meaning class,
which is where some of this materials 

847
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:33,651
from andI got students to write about 
their past.

848
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:33,760
It's like,
okay,

849
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:35,740
we're.
We're talking about stories,

850
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:37,960
so let's tell your story.
Who are you,

851
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:42,961
how'd you get here,
and what are you now that usually helps 

852
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:45,130
people put things to rest.
Although it's quite stressful.

853
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:46,030
Well,
you're doing it.

854
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:51,040
Stress goes up when you're doing it and 
maybe you feel miserable for a couple of

855
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,020
weeks and then stress goes down and it 
stays down.

856
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:58,050
So that's.
And that's also why people don't do it 

857
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:58,050
because who the hell wants to have their
stress go up?

858
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,100
But if it's temporary,
it's a sacrifice.

859
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,140
So then the next issue is,
well,

860
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:03,730
where are you going?
And one of the things that,

861
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,050
and this I just still,
I cannot understand you.

862
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,930
Students that had been in education 
system for 15 years,

863
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,940
14 years,
high end students,

864
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:16,120
most of them not once in their whole 
bloody life.

865
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,660
Did anyone ever get them to sit down for
like a day and say,

866
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:22,990
all right,
justify your existence.

867
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,530
Like seriously.
It's like here you are in university,

868
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:31,531
you're taking a bunch of courses,
you've got some sort of vague career 

869
00:48:31,531 --> 00:48:34,861
plan.
It's like defend the damn thing a bit 

870
00:48:34,861 --> 00:48:35,860
since you're going to go live it and 
everything.

871
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,080
You're staking everything on it.
It's like,

872
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:43,230
what's your damn plan and why are you so
convinced that it's not the plan of a 

873
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,840
babbling fool because if you haven't 
thought about identity is and if you 

874
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,500
really want to go out there and live 
that out,

875
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,800
you know,
one of the things Carl Jung said was 

876
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:55,900
that you were in a story whether you 
know it or not,

877
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,010
and then he made two nice comments about
that.

878
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:06,030
If it's someone else's story,
you're probably going to get a bit part 

879
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,380
and it might not be the one you want and
if it's a story that you don't know,

880
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:13,381
it might be one with a really bad ending
or maybe it's just bad period with a 

881
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:17,611
worse ending.
And if you don't know what the story 

882
00:49:17,611 --> 00:49:18,400
that you're living out is,
maybe that's the one you know.

883
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:21,280
Maybe you got that from your mother.
You got it from your grandmother.

884
00:49:21,281 --> 00:49:24,940
You got it from your aunt or God only 
knows where you picked it up because you

885
00:49:24,941 --> 00:49:27,550
pick up things like mad because that's 
what human beings are like,

886
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:31,510
so maybe you're living a malevolent 
tragedy unconsciously,

887
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,420
and then one thing you might ask 
yourself is,

888
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,700
well,
how wretched and miserable is your life?

889
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,980
Let's add few title to that.
How wretched,

890
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:41,080
miserable and futile is your life?

891
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,870
And you might say,
well yeah,

892
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,340
70 percent on each count.
It's like,

893
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,520
then you're probably unconsciously 
living out a malevolent tragedy and 

894
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,050
maybe that's not for the best.
Oh,

895
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:54,850
it's either that or the whole universe 
hates you,

896
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,310
right?
Or 70 percent hates you,

897
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,780
you know,
so.

898
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,040
So anyways,
you know,

899
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:05,041
we got students to start writing in 
detail about not what they wanted.

900
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:12,150
It's not a career thing because that's 
the closest people usually get is they 

901
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,610
have a career plan.
It's like,

902
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:13,060
no,
no,

903
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:14,520
it's not a career plan.
That's,

904
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,840
that's peripheral important.
But peripheral,

905
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,280
it's like,
all right,

906
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,690
you got three years,
man,

907
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:24,990
you're going to live them anyways.
Devote those three years to setting the 

908
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:29,401
world around you so that it's the best 
it can possibly for you as if you were 

909
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:33,320
taking care of yourself as if you cared 
for yourself.

910
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,330
Well.
What would that look like?

911
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,310
You know,
let's say just for the sake of argument,

912
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,920
if you figured out where you were that 
you could have,

913
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:42,950
what would be best for you?
Well,

914
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,570
what is that?
I bet you never asked.

915
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:53,470
People don't ask and so life comes out 
them like random snakes and they sort of

916
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:59,231
fend them off and life goes by and 
things don't work out the way people 

917
00:50:59,231 --> 00:51:03,611
expected them to,
but a huge part of that is they didn't 

918
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:07,361
know where they were because they 
wouldn't look or didn't know that they 

919
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:07,361
should look.
Ignorance,

920
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:09,620
willful blindness,
right to great catastrophes,

921
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:13,160
and they never figured out where they 
wanted to go or why.

922
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:19,150
Now there's a problem with figuring out 
where you want to go and the problem is 

923
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,941
is that you make your conditions for 
failure clear to yourself and people 

924
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:25,250
don't like that.
So if you keep yourself in the fog,

925
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,860
then you can't tell when you screwed up.

926
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,320
Now that isn't so good because you're 
still screwing up.

927
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:33,620
You're just to blind self blind to 
notice.

928
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,250
Although in in,
in the short term that's less painful.

929
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:40,610
If you make your criteria for success 
are razor sharp,

930
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:45,611
then you know every time you screw up,
but that's great because then you could 

931
00:51:45,611 --> 00:51:48,330
fix it.
You could either repair the,

932
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,720
the,
the behavioral inadequacy or that 

933
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,800
conceptual inadequacy that you're using 
as a tool in that situation.

934
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:59,980
Or maybe you could adjust your damn plan
either way you can fix it and so,

935
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,920
okay,
so you're living in one of these bloody 

936
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,501
things and you might as well it seems to
me you might as well make it the best 

937
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:11,150
one you could live in because you don't 
have anything better to do.

938
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,210
Now,
if you don't do that,

939
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:19,211
if you don't do it consciously,
and this is what the psychoanalyst 

940
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:22,021
pointed out,
is that you have innumerable quasi 

941
00:52:22,021 --> 00:52:26,470
autonomous subsystems that make you up,
that will generate stories impulsively,

942
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,510
and you'll just act them out.

943
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,960
And you know that because you watch 
yourself over two weeks and you think,

944
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:34,880
Jesus,
I did a lot of stupid things in the last

945
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:36,890
two weeks and you think,
why?

946
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:40,580
And it's because you're a random here,
collection of somewhat random,

947
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:45,560
quasi autonomous personality units and 
lacking a leader.

948
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,810
They're just going to fire off whenever 
they want.

949
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:48,890
You know,
first you're hungry,

950
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:53,891
then you're thirsty.
Then you want to go to bed with your 

951
00:52:53,891 --> 00:52:53,891
wife,
you know,

952
00:52:53,891 --> 00:52:54,200
then you want to sleep in and you want 
to tell your boss off.

953
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:56,720
Then you want to curse at the guy that 
cuts you off in traffic.

954
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:59,180
It's like you're kind of like a two year
old,

955
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,510
you know,
just it's one emotional frame after 

956
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:08,231
another vying for dominance.
There's no overarching hierarchy and 

957
00:53:08,231 --> 00:53:10,880
there's no king at the top.
And so,

958
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:15,881
you know,
we already talked about pyramids of 

959
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:17,891
competence in what's supposed to be at 
the top is you want to bring all those 

960
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:19,280
things together.
We understand this neurologically.

961
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:20,990
I'll show you some of that in a little 
bit.

962
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:23,190
We understand this neurologically how,
how,

963
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,040
how,
how this maps some sense right?

964
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,040
Onto the neural structure of your being.
You want to put something in control and

965
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:37,310
the thing that you should put in control
is the bloody thing that pays attention 

966
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:37,310
and learns,
right?

967
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,380
Everything else in the hierarchy should 
be subordinate to the thing that pays 

968
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,880
attention and learns and you could 
think,

969
00:53:44,881 --> 00:53:45,420
well,
that's.

970
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,420
That's the message of the idea of logos.
That's for sure,

971
00:53:48,421 --> 00:53:52,650
because logos is partly attention and 
partly communication and you learn a lot

972
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:54,510
by communicating with others.
Okay,

973
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:58,770
so you need to know where you are.
Just like your gps,

974
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:03,771
which has both.
The closest thing we have to an 

975
00:54:03,771 --> 00:54:04,120
intelligent cybernetic system.
Those gps is in your cars.

976
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,630
Those bloody things are pretty smart 
because they can.

977
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,610
They knew where you are,
they know where you're going,

978
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:11,250
and if you go off course,
they recalculate you're route.

979
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:13,090
It's like those things are damn near 
alive.

980
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:18,110
That's so close to intelligence.
It's and you can tell that because they 

981
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:19,620
act intelligent,
that they solve problems continually.

982
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,980
So you need,
and this is a cybernetic model by the 

983
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,831
way,
and cybernetic models where the models 

984
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:27,831
on which the GPS systems were based so 
it's not accidental.

985
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:33,050
So you need to know where you are and 
you need to know where you're going and 

986
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:34,710
then the next thing you need to know is 
how it is that you're going to act,

987
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:40,190
move your body,
how you're going to propel yourself 

988
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,610
through time and space to transform this
into that.

989
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,260
And so,
okay.

990
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:48,261
And then we can,
we can make that a little bit more 

991
00:54:48,261 --> 00:54:48,420
complex because it's a bit too simple.
So we'll do this.

992
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,420
So it isn't exactly that.
You live in one of these,

993
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:56,730
it's that you live in a nested hierarchy
of these and you could think of this as 

994
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,020
your own internal patriarchy.

995
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:03,020
That's a good way of thinking about it.
And maybe it could be a tyrant or maybe 

996
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,910
it could be something that gives you 
security and functional autonomy.

997
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:08,790
And hopefully that's the one you go for.
But it's a battle,

998
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:13,820
you know,
because a little bit of tyranny exists 

999
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,081
in everyone and so well.
So at the very highest level of 

1000
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:21,720
analysis,
so that would be the overarching story.

1001
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,240
Maybe you think I'd like to be a good 
person or a successful person,

1002
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,920
famous person.
I think goods probably be better because

1003
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:33,921
you can come up with the definition of 
good if you want as long as it doesn't 

1004
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:36,951
annoy other people too badly because 
they'll just get in your way and that 

1005
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:40,020
will be helpful.
So you have to negotiate it.

1006
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:45,650
But let's say you're a good person and 
sort of the story at the top of the 

1007
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:49,620
hierarchy and then you could depo 
decompose that into your primary roles.

1008
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:54,650
Maybe you're a good parent,
maybe you're a good employer or maybe 

1009
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:55,350
you're a good employee.
Maybe you're a good sibling.

1010
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,730
Maybe you're a good child,
you know,

1011
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:58,740
those are major roles that you have in 
your life.

1012
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:02,220
And so you'd say that what good person 
is,

1013
00:56:02,221 --> 00:56:05,310
is what's good about you across all 
those roles.

1014
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:06,270
So it's,
it's a,

1015
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,420
it's a higher order abstraction from 
something more concrete.

1016
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:11,420
And then you can take the,
you know,

1017
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:12,680
the,
the role,

1018
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:15,150
good parent.
And you can say,

1019
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:20,300
well,
what is it that constitutes a good 

1020
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:20,300
parent?
And you might say,

1021
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:20,300
well,
a good parent,

1022
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:24,410
this isn't exhaustive,
obviously a good parent has a good job 

1023
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:24,410
and,
and takes

1024
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,920
care of his or her family.
And then he might say,

1025
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:29,740
well what does it mean to take care of 
your family?

1026
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:31,150
And then you might say,
well,

1027
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,710
you know,
you,

1028
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,270
you can cook the odd meal,
not too odd.

1029
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:38,800
Hopefully you can cook the meal and you 
can play with play with the baby.

1030
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,290
And then you might say,
well how do you play with a baby?

1031
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,640
And then he might say,
well,

1032
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,790
you play peekaboo with the baby or you 
tickle the baby.

1033
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:47,260
Okay,
well then what's a cool,

1034
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:51,730
there's a cool shift there because this 
is all articulated and conceptual,

1035
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:53,440
right?
Right down to this level.

1036
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:58,441
And then all of a sudden it's your body 
because how do you play peekaboo with a 

1037
00:56:58,441 --> 00:56:58,870
baby?
You don't like have a chat about how you

1038
00:56:58,871 --> 00:57:00,470
play peekaboo with a baby,
right?

1039
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:05,490
You go like this.
It was quite sudden you can even do it 

1040
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,490
with older people.

1041
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,950
They even smile about it,
right?

1042
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:10,390
It's dad's gone and the babies all 
shocked to death about that.

1043
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:11,680
Where'd he go?
Oh look,

1044
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:12,890
he's back.
You know,

1045
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:16,360
it's the baby is playing with the 
reliability of the world,

1046
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:19,100
so it's real intense game for a baby.
It's like,

1047
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,540
it's like we're now.
Dad's gone and oh look.

1048
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:23,920
He showed up again.
Oh no,

1049
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:28,921
he's gone.
And then dad smiling to indicate that 

1050
00:57:28,921 --> 00:57:32,131
those brief flashes into nonexistence 
aren't existentially terrifying beyond 

1051
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:33,790
capacity.
Right?

1052
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:38,791
And so,
but the point is is that if you're 

1053
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:38,791
playing peekaboo with the baby,
you're not thinking anymore.

1054
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,840
It's not in the realm of articulation or
abstraction.

1055
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:43,120
It's actually something that you're 
doing with your body.

1056
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:48,121
And so to me,
this is a nice multistage solution to 

1057
00:57:48,121 --> 00:57:50,170
the mind body problem because what 
happens is the highest,

1058
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:54,040
the higher order of obstruction,
it's articulated and conceptual,

1059
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:58,870
but if you decompose it sufficiently,
you end up with an actual action.

1060
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:02,170
And the action involves the movement of 
musculature.

1061
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,680
It's not something conceptual.
And one of the things that's really cool

1062
00:58:05,681 --> 00:58:09,970
about this hierarchy is that it has 
educational lessons.

1063
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:14,971
So one of the things you want to do if 
you're trying to teach someone 

1064
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:15,310
something,
even yourself is you want to,

1065
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:20,790
you want to specify the thing that needs
to be doing at the highest resolution 

1066
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:24,040
possible level.
So I'll give you just a brief example.

1067
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:26,890
So let's say I may have read maybe 
repeating this,

1068
00:58:26,891 --> 00:58:31,891
but it doesn't matter.
Say you've got a three year old kid and 

1069
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:31,891
they're in their room is chaos,
right?

1070
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:35,010
There's monsters are going to be coming 
out under the bed in no time flat unless

1071
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,260
that thing room get some order in it.
And so you,

1072
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,910
you tell the kid,
clean up the room,

1073
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,250
you know it's a mess and you leave and 
you come back.

1074
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,050
And the kid's like throwing legos 
everywhere.

1075
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:49,051
It's,
they're not cleaning up and then you 

1076
00:58:49,051 --> 00:58:50,110
think that's a bad kid.
But I had some bad theory because you're

1077
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:55,111
going right from here to here.
If you want to have a good fight with 

1078
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:56,530
someone and destroy them,
then that's what you do.

1079
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:58,870
You don't bother with the subtleties 
down here.

1080
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:01,240
You just go right from the right for the
juggler.

1081
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,340
It's like you're a bad,
stupid kid.

1082
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:05,620
You've always been that way.
You're hopeless.

1083
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:07,570
There's not a chance of teaching you 
anything.

1084
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:08,770
Right?
And we can.

1085
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,900
That way you can nail the past,
the present,

1086
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:12,550
and the future,
all of the same insults.

1087
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,500
You've always been a terrible person.
You're,

1088
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,640
there's no teaching you and your future 
is going to be exactly the same way.

1089
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:23,970
Then the only thing that person can do 
if you do that to the missile hit you 

1090
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:23,970
because that's,
that's it.

1091
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:26,570
There's no,
there's no coming back from that.

1092
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:31,571
You boxed them completely.
And so if you want to have a really 

1093
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:32,780
unproductive argument,
you go right for this past,

1094
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:34,820
present and future that you're not a 
good person.

1095
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:39,821
Demolish their entire conceptual 
structure and expose them completely 

1096
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:41,480
naked to chaos.
It's like great,

1097
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:46,481
you won the argument.
It's not a good thing to do to your 

1098
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:46,580
longterm partner,
let's say,

1099
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:49,670
unless you want them terrified out of 
their skull and,

1100
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,510
uh,
characterized and their attitude towards

1101
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:56,630
you characterized by nonstop extreme 
resentment,

1102
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,790
it's probably not going to do your love 
life.

1103
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:00,980
A hell of a lot of good,
for example.

1104
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,250
So with the three year old,
maybe what you do is you say you,

1105
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:09,270
you,
you pick the level of analysis at which 

1106
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:09,270
they're actually functioning and you 
say,

1107
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,210
and this is something you can do if you 
pay attention to a kid,

1108
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:14,060
and lots of people won't pay attention 
to children because they're terrified of

1109
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:14,210
them.

1110
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:19,570
They're terrified that they'll do 
something wrong with them and or the 

1111
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:20,210
that the kid won't like them or some 
damn thing.

1112
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:25,211
It's like all you have to do to get a 
kid to like you is pay attention to the 

1113
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:28,931
kid for like two seconds and the kid 
will instantly like you because 

1114
01:00:28,931 --> 01:00:30,650
attention is so.
It's such a.

1115
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:34,040
it's,
it's the ultimate currency for children,

1116
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:34,450
right?
They,

1117
01:00:34,451 --> 01:00:36,710
they,
they need adult attention because adults

1118
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,900
know way more than kids and so they love
attention.

1119
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,460
All you have to do is pay attention to 
them.

1120
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:44,450
They will like you instantly.
So can you tell the kid,

1121
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,180
you see that teddy bear?
The kid goes,

1122
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:52,181
yes.
Then you've established that the child 

1123
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,731
has mastered the art of perceiving a 
teddy bear because they can say yes.

1124
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:56,210
It's,
it's complicated thing,

1125
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:58,250
man.
It's like a six month old isn't going to

1126
01:00:58,251 --> 01:00:59,000
do that.

1127
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:02,180
Three month old has got the whole teddy 
bear identification.

1128
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:03,770
Sub Routine.
Automatized.

1129
01:01:03,771 --> 01:01:05,720
So teddy bear.
Yes.

1130
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,730
Can you pick it up?
Yes.

1131
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:09,770
Pat.
Pat,

1132
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:10,880
pat.
Good work.

1133
01:01:10,881 --> 01:01:13,250
Do you see the hole on that shelf?
Yes.

1134
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,190
Can you put the teddy bear in that 
whole?

1135
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:17,720
Yes.
Go over.

1136
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:18,710
Do that.
Pat.

1137
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:19,460
Pat,
pat.

1138
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,960
Great.
Okay.

1139
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:23,960
Now we'll do thing number two,
thing number three.

1140
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,080
So you're building up the micro routines
of cleaning up the room from the bottom 

1141
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,951
up right here.
You're building it into their body 

1142
01:01:32,951 --> 01:01:34,070
because you're starting with the things 
they've already automatized and building

1143
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:39,071
upwards towards abstraction.
And so once the kid has all the micro 

1144
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:40,880
routines down and maybe there's A.
I don't know how many micro routines are

1145
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:43,010
there to clean up your room.
200,

1146
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:47,810
like a lot but not an infinite number.
So you teach them all the micro routines

1147
01:01:47,811 --> 01:01:51,680
and then you can say run sat of micro 
routines,

1148
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:54,320
which means clean up room and then they 
can do it.

1149
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,180
They know what it means.
So.

1150
01:01:56,210 --> 01:02:00,200
But you do the building from the bottom 
up and lots of times when you're arguing

1151
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:02,720
with someone that you live with and 
hypothetically love,

1152
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:06,350
although those two things are hard to 
get together in the same relationship.

1153
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:11,740
Um,
what you want to do is assume is assume 

1154
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:14,720
stupidity before you assume total,
total malevolence.

1155
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:15,440
That's,
that's,

1156
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:17,810
that's a good rule of thumb for 
establishing peace.

1157
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,830
So maybe if your won't do something,
well maybe it's,

1158
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:27,040
there's something going on up here,
but you might want to assume to begin 

1159
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,231
with,
they actually just don't know how to do 

1160
01:02:30,231 --> 01:02:32,151
it and you need to decompose it.
So maybe there's a way you want to be 

1161
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:35,301
greeted when you come home because 
you're going to come home everyday 

1162
01:02:35,301 --> 01:02:38,330
probably.
And maybe that's a five minute 

1163
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:39,180
interaction or a 10 minute interaction.
So that's an hour a week or four hours a

1164
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:44,181
month or 50 hours a year or one solid 
work week of coming home interactions.

1165
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:50,150
Right?
All you have to do is get 50 

1166
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,150
interactions like that.
Right?

1167
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,720
And you've got your relationships sorted
out.

1168
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,630
If that's something that's really worth 
thinking about because that's it.

1169
01:02:54,631 --> 01:02:56,490
There's,
you just don't have that much time,

1170
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:58,500
right,
to get the meals sorted out.

1171
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:03,501
That's about five hours a day,
get your sleeping time arrangements 

1172
01:03:03,501 --> 01:03:07,521
sorted out,
get the fundamental interactions that 

1173
01:03:07,521 --> 01:03:07,521
you repeat with your partner,
uh,

1174
01:03:07,521 --> 01:03:11,640
worked out voluntarily and negotiated 
you're going to cover 80 percent of your

1175
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:16,641
life that way,
and then it can just run as a routine 

1176
01:03:16,641 --> 01:03:17,490
and that's really helpful.
And if you don't do that consciously,

1177
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:22,491
especially because our roles have 
fragmented in most of the traditional 

1178
01:03:22,491 --> 01:03:25,491
roles of disappeared.
And so nobody knows who the hell is 

1179
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:25,491
supposed to do what in the kitchen for 
example.

1180
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:29,880
So nobody does anything except bitch and
fight and make wretched meals or,

1181
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,570
or by or by a fast food or some 
something like that.

1182
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,750
So you know,
the,

1183
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:39,770
the alternative to that catastrophic 
failure or continual resentment and 

1184
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:42,930
fighting is to rebuild the structures 
from the bottom up,

1185
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:45,580
using consensus in negotiation.
And,

1186
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:50,850
and you can do that so that you can 
think of that as the patriarchal 

1187
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:51,090
structure.
That's a good one.

1188
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:56,150
And I mean,
it's partly psychological because these 

1189
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,281
are things you do as a person,
but it's also partly political and 

1190
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:01,350
economic and sociological because while 
you're doing each of these things,

1191
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,080
you're also doing them in a way that 
socially,

1192
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:08,280
hopefully not just socially acceptable 
but actually socially desirable.

1193
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:11,530
And so that's,
that's the decomposition.

1194
01:04:11,531 --> 01:04:16,531
And the reason that this keeps chaos at 
bay is because it isn't because of your 

1195
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:20,280
belief systems keep chaos at bay.
It's not that abstract.

1196
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:22,710
It's that if you do things right,
do these things right,

1197
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:25,380
then terrible things happened to you 
with less frequency.

1198
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,680
And that's not cycle.
Like it's partly psychological because 

1199
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,050
maybe you don't fight as much.
Maybe you're not as anxious as much.

1200
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:33,870
Maybe you're not as depressed,
but a lot of it's just practical.

1201
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:35,160
If you just,
if you,

1202
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,710
you know,
if your kid doesn't leave his skateboard

1203
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:41,550
on the stairs,
then you don't break your neck as often.

1204
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:46,790
And that's not just psychological,
that's actually a good thing not to 

1205
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:49,701
break your neck so often.
And so this structure isn't merely 

1206
01:04:49,701 --> 01:04:51,750
something that keeps things at bay 
psychologically.

1207
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:54,210
Okay?
So here's a,

1208
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:59,630
here's another look at a hierarchy of,
of narrative,

1209
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:07,390
the structure that keeps chaos at bay 
and this is maybe the hierarchy that I 

1210
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:10,380
engage in when I'm writing and I'm doing
all these things at the same time.

1211
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,820
Now that's what's cool.
You know,

1212
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:15,240
like when I ask students what are you 
doing when you write an essay?

1213
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,860
It's like,
well that's hard question,

1214
01:05:17,861 --> 01:05:21,540
right?
It's like while you're fasted,

1215
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:24,100
important question,
that's the first thing you should do.

1216
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:29,101
If you're writing an essay,
then you're paying attention to the 

1217
01:05:29,101 --> 01:05:31,381
words and the phrases and the sentences 
and the sentence relationship between 

1218
01:05:31,381 --> 01:05:35,941
the sentences within the paragraphs and 
the paragraph relationships to one 

1219
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:39,020
another within the essay and then they 
say relevance to the class and the class

1220
01:05:39,021 --> 01:05:44,021
has relevance to your life and like the 
essay bleeds out across your entire 

1221
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:47,320
life.
And so if I'm writing something,

1222
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:52,570
well obviously at the most highest 
resolution level of analysis,

1223
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:57,571
I'm actually moving my fingers on the 
keyboard and moving my eyes back and 

1224
01:05:57,571 --> 01:05:59,680
forth on the screen.
That's where the mind meets the body.

1225
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:05,130
But then I'm trying to formulate a 
sentence and so I tried to think up a 

1226
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:08,671
good sentence that's,
that's nailing what I am trying to 

1227
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:10,480
formulate and then I tried to pick it 
apart and I do that a bunch of ways.

1228
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,480
I take the sentence and I put it on 
another page and then I write like 10 

1229
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,900
different variants of the sentence and 
see if I can get a better variant.

1230
01:06:16,901 --> 01:06:20,590
And then I try to think of ways that 
it's a stupid sentence to see if I can,

1231
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:26,010
you know,
put a pry bar underneath it and loosen 

1232
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:26,010
it up.
And if I can't do anything,

1233
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:31,230
if I can't manage that and I keep the 
sentence that I've got and then I do 

1234
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:34,201
that with 10 sentences in a paragraph 
and I make sure the sentences are all 

1235
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:37,861
arranged properly in the paragraph the 
same way by rewriting a bunch of 

1236
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:41,491
different variants of it and trying to 
get the word right and the phrase right 

1237
01:06:41,491 --> 01:06:42,040
and the sentence right.
And the sentence order right.

1238
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,810
And the paragraph order.
Right.

1239
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:48,280
And I can tell what it's right enough 
because I can't make it any better.

1240
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,670
That doesn't mean it's right,
it just means I can't improve it.

1241
01:06:51,671 --> 01:06:56,671
And so I get to the point where if I'm 
writing a paragraph and I write a 

1242
01:06:56,671 --> 01:07:00,181
variant and I can't tell if their 
variant is any better and it might be 

1243
01:07:00,181 --> 01:07:03,301
worse than I'm done,
I've hit the limit of my intellectual 

1244
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:04,300
capacity and it's time to move on.
But then,

1245
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:07,930
but it isn't like the essay that I'm 
writing,

1246
01:07:07,931 --> 01:07:12,931
let's say has a boundary.
It's tightly drawn around the essay 

1247
01:07:12,931 --> 01:07:14,320
because there's a reason I'm writing the
day I'm an essay and that would be.

1248
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:17,560
Well I'm trying to.
I'm trying to write a whole manuscript.

1249
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:20,260
Hopefully I'm trying to address an 
important problem because why would I be

1250
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:23,560
doing it otherwise?
I mean that'd be kind of pointless.

1251
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:28,240
And maybe that's part of my role as a 
scientist and that's a subset of my role

1252
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:29,050
as a professor.

1253
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:32,290
And then that's a subset of my role as a
productive citizen.

1254
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:37,291
And then that's a subset of my role of 
someone who confronts the unknown.

1255
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:42,960
See?
And that's why the logos is the thing 

1256
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,221
that's at the top of the hierarchy.
That's how the hierarchy should be 

1257
01:07:47,221 --> 01:07:50,281
structured is that everything else 
should be see because you have a 

1258
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:50,290
structure and you think,
well,

1259
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,030
what should the structure be subordinate
to,

1260
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:56,110
and then the answer should be something 
like the structure should be subordinate

1261
01:07:56,111 --> 01:08:01,111
to the process that generates the 
structure or the structure should be 

1262
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:03,310
subordinate to the process that 
generates and maintains the structure.

1263
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:08,790
Well obviously how could it be any other
way unless the structures perfect when 

1264
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:12,130
in which case you dispense with the 
thing that generates it and improves it,

1265
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,990
but then you're a totalitarian.
It's like,

1266
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:15,290
Hey,
we got the answer.

1267
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:16,070
It's like,
no,

1268
01:08:16,071 --> 01:08:16,640
you don't.

1269
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,610
People are still suffering and they're 
still dying.

1270
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,540
You don't have the damn answer,
and so maybe you have an answer.

1271
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:28,541
That means that there isn't quite as 
much suffering and dying as there could 

1272
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:31,841
be,
but there's plenty of road to be 

1273
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,481
traveled yet and so that all makes 
perfect sense that all of this should 

1274
01:08:34,821 --> 01:08:38,810
be,
should be nested within this highest.

1275
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:44,110
I think of it sort of as the highest 
order of moral striving and then that 

1276
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:47,300
also gives you a moral hierarchy.
That's the most important thing.

1277
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:52,630
You do that with artists speech.
You do that with attention and honest 

1278
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:55,961
speech.
That's how you do that and you don't 

1279
01:08:55,961 --> 01:08:59,171
sacrifice that to any of this because if
you do then then you're hurting your 

1280
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:04,931
soul.
It's there's the idea in the new 

1281
01:09:04,931 --> 01:09:07,121
testament that the sin against the Holy 
Ghost is the one sin that can't be 

1282
01:09:07,121 --> 01:09:07,121
forgiven.

1283
01:09:07,121 --> 01:09:09,020
No one knows what the hell that means.
Maybe it doesn't mean anything,

1284
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:14,320
but I think this is what it means is 
that because this process generates all 

1285
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:19,700
this,
if you violate that process,

1286
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:24,701
then there's no hope for you because 
that's the process by which you improve 

1287
01:09:24,701 --> 01:09:26,900
yourself and everyone else to everything
else.

1288
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:29,060
So if you decide you're not going to 
engage in that,

1289
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:30,020
it's like,
well,

1290
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:35,080
there's no fixing that because you've 
blown apart your relationship with the 

1291
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,101
thing that does the fixing and so okay,
and so that's how you keep chaos at bay.

1292
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,460
And so part of that is structural,
right?

1293
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:46,610
Because you know how to do these things 
more or less,

1294
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:49,250
it's part of your skill set.
If you happened to be a writer,

1295
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,900
you could build one of these for a 
plumber.

1296
01:09:50,901 --> 01:09:52,640
It doesn't.
Doesn't make any difference really.

1297
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,490
Although the outside things should be 
the same,

1298
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:59,960
which is I think partly why in the Judeo
Christian tradition,

1299
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:05,340
there's the assumption that people are 
fundamentally equal before God and what 

1300
01:10:05,571 --> 01:10:07,610
that means is that,
well,

1301
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:12,670
they should be a nested everyone 
regardless of their particularities,

1302
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,960
particularities as individuals.

1303
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:20,350
Their highest order function is that 
they do it in whatever manner they can 

1304
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:24,611
manage and that's an extraordinarily 
valuable or maybe the most 

1305
01:10:24,611 --> 01:10:27,530
extraordinarily valuable sociological,
political and economic function,

1306
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:32,710
and so that's why people are valuable.
It's like we have this faculty to 

1307
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:37,151
continually generate improvements to the
structure that we jointly inhabit.

1308
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:40,520
Great.
That gives us.

1309
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,490
It's so cool because that gives us a 
fundamental unity.

1310
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:48,790
We've got the highest order of of 
analysis with with the room for as much 

1311
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:51,560
diversity as you can possibly manage.
Right?

1312
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:55,640
Because it actually turns out that the 
more the substructures differ,

1313
01:10:55,641 --> 01:11:00,641
the better.
Because then you know you can be doing 

1314
01:11:00,641 --> 01:11:02,531
something different than me.
Now that would be good because if we're 

1315
01:11:02,531 --> 01:11:02,570
doing the same thing,
then it's just duplication of labor.

1316
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:07,571
If we could agree on the higher order 
principle and then specialize at the 

1317
01:11:07,571 --> 01:11:11,501
lower order levels,
it's like that's you get to have your 

1318
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:12,740
cake and eat it too,
and that doesn't happen very often.

1319
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:16,680
So,
so and so.

1320
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:19,710
Then another rule of thumb is if you're 
trying to solve a problem,

1321
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:23,790
solve it at this level,
highest resolution level possible before

1322
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:28,350
you dare move up,
dare move up the hierarchy because the,

1323
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,480
as you move up the abstraction 
hierarchy,

1324
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:35,481
the probability that you'll make a 
catastrophic error while attempting to 

1325
01:11:35,481 --> 01:11:38,010
fix the problem radically increases 
because abstraction is very,

1326
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:40,560
very powerful.
And so you want to be very careful.

1327
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,840
I mean we saw that when you know,
when the,

1328
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,540
when the,
when the mortgage market crashed,

1329
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:50,541
the reason it crashed was because of 
strange use of derivatives and 

1330
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:53,781
derivatives are like higher order 
abstractions in the financial world and 

1331
01:11:53,781 --> 01:11:57,470
derivatives give you tremendous 
financial leverage and power with huge 

1332
01:11:57,811 --> 01:12:00,690
risk.
And so the upside is massive.

1333
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,120
Absolutely massive because you can 
multiply your earnings,

1334
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:08,420
but the downside is complete bloody 
catastrophe and so part of what I would 

1335
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:11,820
say an intelligent,
conservative ethos is,

1336
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:15,980
is solve the problem at the highest 
level of resolution,

1337
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,010
highest level,
local,

1338
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,750
most local level of resolution.

1339
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,860
It's safer and it's more likely to 
actually produce a solution.

1340
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:24,780
Okay,
now,

1341
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:30,320
so now you're in your plan.
Now we've simplified it again just to 

1342
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,020
one little map,
right?

1343
01:12:31,021 --> 01:12:32,760
But all those other things are nested in
there.

1344
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:38,360
And so what happens to you as you stroll
merrily on your way through life?

1345
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:43,431
Well,
what happens is that as you're moving 

1346
01:12:43,431 --> 01:12:45,351
from point a to point b,
you encounter things and people think 

1347
01:12:45,351 --> 01:12:48,390
that what they encounter are objects,
but that's not the case.

1348
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,710
First of all,
most of the things that you encounter,

1349
01:12:50,711 --> 01:12:53,460
many of the things are actually other 
people and they're not objects.

1350
01:12:53,461 --> 01:12:58,110
They're too damn complex.
And even apart from the social world,

1351
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,420
the things that you encounter aren't 
objects.

1352
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:03,270
They seem to be something more like 
tools or obstacles.

1353
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:06,930
And I don't mean that we see objects and
turn them into tools or obstacles.

1354
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:11,930
I mean that we see tools and obstacles 
because what happens is that when new 

1355
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:15,830
array yourself towards a goal,
then the world transforms itself into 

1356
01:13:17,371 --> 01:13:20,310
things that get in the way of that goal 
and things that three things,

1357
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:22,490
things that get in the way of the goal,
things.

1358
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:27,530
Those are things you don't like.
Things that facilitate your movement 

1359
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,891
towards the goal.
Those are things that you like and 

1360
01:13:30,891 --> 01:13:33,710
irrelevant things and mostly you want 
irrelevant things because there's just 

1361
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:37,551
too damn many things,
so the category of irrelevant is when 

1362
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:38,440
you really like.
So most of the things,

1363
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,860
most of everything is irrelevant.
If you have a good plan,

1364
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:46,160
a few things are good because they move 
you forward and some other things are 

1365
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,280
not so good.
You want to go around the not so good 

1366
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:49,280
things.
If you can manage them,

1367
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,790
unless you'd like to run head forth into
like brick walls,

1368
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:53,520
which is not particularly so learning 
experience,

1369
01:13:53,521 --> 01:13:55,110
but I wouldn't repeat it too many times.

1370
01:13:55,830 --> 01:14:00,830
You want,
you want the world to array itself as a 

1371
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:01,320
set of.
We could say tools.

1372
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:06,350
Now what happens is that you have this 
perceptual system that's mediated by 

1373
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:10,311
dopamine.
It's the same system that cocaine 

1374
01:14:10,311 --> 01:14:10,890
activates or methamphetamine or the 
drugs that people really like to,

1375
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:16,590
and it's the dopaminergic system that 
responds with positive emotion to 

1376
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:20,941
indications that you've encountered 
something that will facilitate your 

1377
01:14:20,941 --> 01:14:23,791
movement towards a goal,
and that's really important to know 

1378
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:26,320
because people tend to think that 
they're happy because they achieve goals

1379
01:14:26,321 --> 01:14:29,890
and that's not true what's true,
because as soon as you achieve a goal,

1380
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:32,050
then you have a problem which is what's 
the next goal,

1381
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:37,200
and that's actually a big problem.
You encounter that as soon as you 

1382
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:37,200
graduate from university for example.
That's right.

1383
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:42,210
I made this joke before they graduation 
day yours like king of the university 

1384
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:45,640
hierarchy,
undergraduate hierarchy day after you're

1385
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:48,130
unemployed,
potential starbucks employee.

1386
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,600
Right?
So it's like.

1387
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,900
So obviously the,
the,

1388
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,820
the,
the accomplishment per se as a source of

1389
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:59,821
reward is,
is problematic because when you 

1390
01:14:59,821 --> 01:14:59,821
accomplish,
you run the,

1391
01:14:59,821 --> 01:15:03,220
the frame to its end and then you have 
the problem of needing a new frame.

1392
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:08,520
So that's a problem.
But if what you're encountering instead 

1393
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,130
are things that will move you along your
way,

1394
01:15:09,131 --> 01:15:09,790
it's like,
hey,

1395
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:14,791
that's great and that's where you get 
your positive motivation and so that's 

1396
01:15:14,791 --> 01:15:15,880
really thinking.
That's so much we're thinking about.

1397
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:21,120
You can think about that for a year and 
that wouldn't even be enough to think 

1398
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,971
about it because here's what it means.
It means in some sense that the 

1399
01:15:23,971 --> 01:15:25,090
Buddhists are right with their claim 
about Maya M,

1400
01:15:25,091 --> 01:15:30,091
a y a,
which means that people live in an 

1401
01:15:30,091 --> 01:15:30,580
illusion and what they mean by that is 
while you have goal,

1402
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:35,970
whatever your goal is,
and that goal gives relevance to the 

1403
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:39,751
world and you could change the relevance
of the world and the snap just by 

1404
01:15:39,751 --> 01:15:41,590
changing your goal,
you can do that.

1405
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,640
And so then you think,
well,

1406
01:15:42,641 --> 01:15:44,890
it's sort of an illusion because you can
just change it.

1407
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,920
Now.
You don't want to push that line of 

1408
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,781
argumentation too far because even if 
the specific point can be changed,

1409
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,890
the fact that you're in one of these 
frames cannot be changed.

1410
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,740
And so you have to be in a frame.
Although you get to pick the frame.

1411
01:15:59,741 --> 01:16:04,741
So there's still an absolute there,
which is that you have to be in a frame 

1412
01:16:04,741 --> 01:16:05,350
and that is not a trivial absolute.
It's a very.

1413
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,630
It's a very major absolute.
So then you think,

1414
01:16:07,631 --> 01:16:10,360
okay,
all of your positive emotion is going to

1415
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:12,940
be experienced in relationship to the 
goal.

1416
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:18,540
Well then we think,
well you could use some positive 

1417
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:18,540
emotion.
It's a good thing.

1418
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:22,740
Positive emotion inhibits anxiety and 
disappointment and frustration and pain.

1419
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:27,640
It does all that.
Technically it does that.

1420
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,300
That's why a football player with broken
thumb who wants to score a touchdown can

1421
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:33,910
go out there and you know,
play the football game,

1422
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,490
even though it's a kind of an arbitrary 
goal,

1423
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:37,060
right?
It's like,

1424
01:16:37,061 --> 01:16:42,061
really you're going to go out there and 
risk your hand to fire a pigskin through

1425
01:16:42,971 --> 01:16:44,920
some,
some polls.

1426
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:50,250
So like,
well you can say the same sort of 

1427
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:50,620
cynical thing about most of the things 
that people do,

1428
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:55,650
but you can't say the cynical thing 
about the fact that they have to do 

1429
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:56,440
things.
So you have a,

1430
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,510
you have a point,
you have your aim,

1431
01:16:58,511 --> 01:17:03,511
you have your ambition,
and then that's what turns the world 

1432
01:17:03,511 --> 01:17:04,900
into a potentially positive place.
And here's the kicker.

1433
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:08,170
This is so cool.
The higher they aim,

1434
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,750
the more of the positive emotion.
So that's,

1435
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:13,730
that's you think,
well why should I bother?

1436
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:17,390
Why should I bother doing something 
lofty and difficult?

1437
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,760
It's like because it's worth it.

1438
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:27,010
That's why.
Because the alternative is stupid 

1439
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:27,530
suffering because really,
really,

1440
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:32,531
because what happens is like you don't 
need a framework in order to suffer.

1441
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:38,870
You can just lay there day after day and
suffer,

1442
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:40,220
right?
That's easy.

1443
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:44,540
So that's the default condition.
If you don't have a lofty ambition,

1444
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:49,900
then you suffer miserably.
And the reason for that is life is 

1445
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:50,210
really complex,
short,

1446
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,690
finite,
full of suffering and beyond you.

1447
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:56,630
And so you can just lay there and think 
about that and it's horrible.

1448
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:59,510
And so that's not helpful.
It's just not useful.

1449
01:17:59,511 --> 01:18:00,200
And so,
you know,

1450
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,960
people often say life is meaningless.
It's like,

1451
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:03,830
no,
it's not.

1452
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,050
That's wrong.
Because it was meaningless.

1453
01:18:06,051 --> 01:18:07,910
That'd be easy.
You could just sit there and do nothing.

1454
01:18:07,911 --> 01:18:08,960
And it wouldn't matter,
right?

1455
01:18:08,961 --> 01:18:13,961
It'd be like you were lobotomized.
Sheep is just irrelevant.

1456
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:18,200
But that isn't what happens when people 
say that life has no meaning.

1457
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,520
That isn't what they mean.
What they mean is I'm suffering stupidly

1458
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:25,220
and intensely and I don't know what to 
do about it.

1459
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,410
Well,
the suffering is meaningful.

1460
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:29,240
It's just dark,
the kind of meaning you want.

1461
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:33,140
So how do you get out of that?
You adopt you,

1462
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:37,460
you,
you note the baseline of suffering,

1463
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:39,020
which is very,
very,

1464
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:40,040
very,
very high.

1465
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,170
And then you say to yourself,
okay,

1466
01:18:42,171 --> 01:18:44,150
I need to do something that justifies 
that.

1467
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,770
And that's not so easy because it's the 
baseline for suffering is high.

1468
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,810
If you're going to make something of 
yourself,

1469
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:55,870
let's say,
so that it's worthwhile to exist in the 

1470
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:56,330
world,
then you have to do.

1471
01:18:56,390 --> 01:19:01,390
You have to aim at something that's so 
well structured that you can say,

1472
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,350
yeah,
earthquakes,

1473
01:19:03,351 --> 01:19:05,870
cancer,
death of my family,

1474
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:09,050
dissolution of my goals,
ultimate futility of life,

1475
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:10,970
and the heat,
death of the universe.

1476
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,980
Hey,
it doesn't matter.

1477
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:15,470
It's worth it.
All right,

1478
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,600
so now here's an here's another 
complicating factor.

1479
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:24,740
So I said,
well,

1480
01:19:24,741 --> 01:19:29,741
there's three things that you can run 
into when you're going about your your 

1481
01:19:29,741 --> 01:19:34,720
goal.
Now I would say if you're going to form 

1482
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,270
a goal,
if you're going to form a plan,

1483
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:40,700
look about three to five years out in 
the future because beyond that you get 

1484
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:44,951
something called commentorial explosion 
and it means that there's so many 

1485
01:19:45,951 --> 01:19:50,951
variables that you just can't predict.
So there's not that much point looking 

1486
01:19:50,951 --> 01:19:52,580
out 20 years because like what the hell 
do you know what's going to happen in 20

1487
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:53,630
years?
Nothing.

1488
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,000
Three years.
Maybe you've got,

1489
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,520
maybe you can chart a course to three 
years,

1490
01:19:58,521 --> 01:19:59,720
five years,
something like that.

1491
01:19:59,721 --> 01:20:04,721
So that's not a bad segment of time too 
to consider and then consider what your 

1492
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,200
life would have to be like in order for 
it to be worthwhile for you.

1493
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:15,380
Knowing also what you're going to be 
like if it isn't worthwhile for you and 

1494
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,940
what you're going to be like if it isn't
worthwhile for you is cane.

1495
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,930
That's what you're like.
Because that's what that story's about.

1496
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:26,370
Because Abel is the guy who has a goal 
in this making the proper sacrifices and

1497
01:20:26,371 --> 01:20:29,550
Cain is the person for whom by his own 
faults,

1498
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:32,130
at least in part,
things aren't working out for.

1499
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:37,131
And so the default for not doing this is
something like building resentment,

1500
01:20:37,621 --> 01:20:41,010
bitterness with an underlying,
what would you call it,

1501
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:45,330
flavor enhancer of murderous resentment,
something like that,

1502
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:50,420
which you will act out in the world 
which people act out in the world all 

1503
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,230
the time.
And it's no wonder because without this,

1504
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:57,290
without something lofty pulling you 
along than the baseline is stupid 

1505
01:20:57,961 --> 01:20:59,130
suffering.
And you know,

1506
01:20:59,131 --> 01:21:04,131
if you take an animal,
a dog and you just change it in the 

1507
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:04,131
backyard,
you know when you put a collar on it,

1508
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:04,131
there's too tight.

1509
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:07,710
So it chafes all the time and it can't 
even bark and you know,

1510
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:11,010
there's just dirt around it.
It's too God damn hot out in the sun and

1511
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:13,070
maybe you don't give it enough water,
you know,

1512
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,880
it's not going to be very happy dog.
It's basic condition is misery.

1513
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,180
Well the same applies to people.
So.

1514
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:27,300
All right,
so you're on your way to see you 

1515
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,040
remember the survey.
You've all probably watched Pinocchio or

1516
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:34,041
know about it.
One of the things that happens that's 

1517
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:36,050
really cool in Pinocchio is that when 
Joe Decides that he wants his puppet to 

1518
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:41,421
be a genuine autonomous being,
he wishes upon a star.

1519
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:47,510
It's a very strange thing,
but everybody just swallows it because 

1520
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,971
we don't notice when we're swallowing 
things that are that are completely 

1521
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:53,841
preposterous.
You know it's this animated puppeteer 

1522
01:21:53,841 --> 01:21:56,760
wishes on a star that is puppet is going
to become real,

1523
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:57,990
and everybody nodded their head and 
goes,

1524
01:21:57,991 --> 01:21:59,130
oh yeah,
that makes sense.

1525
01:21:59,280 --> 01:21:59,790
It's like,
no,

1526
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:02,160
it doesn't.
It doesn't make any sense at all,

1527
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:07,161
but it doesn't matter.
It doesn't make the sort of sense that 

1528
01:22:07,161 --> 01:22:09,711
we normally associate with sense.
It makes it kind of medicines and 

1529
01:22:09,711 --> 01:22:12,861
everybody understands it.
So this is what your pedal is doing is 

1530
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,070
he's elevating his eyes above the 
horizon.

1531
01:22:14,071 --> 01:22:17,280
So out of the realm of the worldly,
let's say,

1532
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:20,460
to the transcendent and the transcendent
will say,

1533
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:25,610
for all intents and purposes,
you can see the transcendent spread 

1534
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:25,610
above you in,
in,

1535
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:25,610
in,
in,

1536
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:28,190
in the heaven that arches over us.
It's,

1537
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:33,250
it's close enough for our purposes,
and there's a star there and it started 

1538
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:34,800
something that's eternal,
that shines in the darkness.

1539
01:22:34,801 --> 01:22:37,800
And so Japan makes an agreement with the
transcendent.

1540
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:38,400
He says,
look,

1541
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:42,270
I'm willing to do whatever it takes that
my creation becomes autonomous.

1542
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:46,410
While that's exactly the situation that 
you want to set up for yourself is like,

1543
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:51,411
okay,
you got to figure out what star you're 

1544
01:22:51,411 --> 01:22:53,970
going to orient yourself by and you have
to ask yourself like no one's ever asked

1545
01:22:53,971 --> 01:22:54,090
you.

1546
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:59,090
Okay,
if you had the choice to make your life 

1547
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:01,020
worth living,
what's your price?

1548
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,200
What do you need?
Just find out.

1549
01:23:04,201 --> 01:23:05,860
First of all,
you ask,

1550
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:08,380
you'll tell yourself like you'll be 
afraid because he thought,

1551
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,700
I'll never get that.
It's like,

1552
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:11,290
well,
lower your sights a little bit.

1553
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:16,291
Then you know,
don't ask for a 80 foot super yacht in 

1554
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,050
like six months.
That just means you're stupid.

1555
01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:19,900
It doesn't mean you're not.
First of all,

1556
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:21,550
it's not going to make you happy 
anyways.

1557
01:23:21,551 --> 01:23:22,510
You know,
it's just not.

1558
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,180
It's not.
It's not wise.

1559
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:30,240
You're asking,
you're supposed to be asking yourself 

1560
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:30,240
this question like you're someone you 
care about.

1561
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:34,680
So you imagine you're talking to some 12
year old kid that you kind of like 

1562
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,440
think,
I wouldn't be so bad if this 12 year old

1563
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:38,780
kid at a decent life.
So Youtube,

1564
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,970
it's like,
it wouldn't be so bad.

1565
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
The universe wouldn't mind if you had a 
decent life if there was little less 

1566
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:45,370
suffering on your part,
specially if you didn't,

1567
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,770
you know,
foisted off on other people.

1568
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,920
If there's a little less suffering on 
your part and you made things a little 

1569
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:53,620
better everywhere you went,
it's like the universe would probably be

1570
01:23:53,621 --> 01:23:55,300
okay with that.
So you could.

1571
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:58,030
I think you could get away with it if 
you're a sort of quiet about it.

1572
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,420
And so now ask yourself,
okay,

1573
01:24:01,421 --> 01:24:05,500
so then once you've established your 
target and you know where you are,

1574
01:24:05,501 --> 01:24:09,100
then you know what's good for you 
because that moves you along.

1575
01:24:09,101 --> 01:24:12,250
And that happens at a perceptual level,
you don't have to think about it anymore

1576
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:15,250
and the experimental literature and now 
it's already quite clear.

1577
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:20,251
So for example,
if I specify that podium as the target 

1578
01:24:20,251 --> 01:24:21,920
for my action,
you know,

1579
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:27,060
then I'm happy when I'm walking towards 
it because there it is in everything 

1580
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:27,060
cooperating really nicely.

1581
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:31,180
Then if I specify going to the exit sign
that you guys can't see,

1582
01:24:31,181 --> 01:24:32,870
that's that,
that,

1583
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,040
that this is an obstacle in the front 
of.

1584
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,950
Then as soon as I specify that,
then that's an annoying obstacle.

1585
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,140
And that's pre-cognitive.
It's happens immediately.

1586
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:46,300
It happens instantaneously.
And so it really is the case that you,

1587
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,610
you,
you're,

1588
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:51,460
you're being manifests itself inside 
these frames.

1589
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:54,250
And so what's so cool about that is you 
can change the frame.

1590
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:57,610
It doesn't mean you can like juggle 
planets or anything like that,

1591
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,090
but it does give you quite a scope of,
of,

1592
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:06,210
of,
of what untrammeled action within the 

1593
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:09,571
world.
And if the frame isn't working out then 

1594
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,371
you can tweak it.
Or sometimes you have to make a major 

1595
01:25:11,371 --> 01:25:11,371
adjustment in it,
whatever.

1596
01:25:11,371 --> 01:25:13,150
You don't have to stick to the damn 
thing like it's the ideology that you're

1597
01:25:13,151 --> 01:25:14,320
going to die for.

1598
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,080
It's attended of plan,
it's a work in progress and it's,

1599
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:19,480
and that's with the future authoring 
program.

1600
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:24,481
One of the things I recommend for people
is that they should do it badly because 

1601
01:25:24,481 --> 01:25:25,150
you're not going to get it right 
anyways,

1602
01:25:25,151 --> 01:25:29,860
but a reasonable plan is way better than
no plan.

1603
01:25:29,861 --> 01:25:32,980
Plus a reasonable plan is a plan that 
has built into it.

1604
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:37,720
The processes that will enable the plan 
to get better as you implement it,

1605
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:41,410
so you just start with a reasonable plan
so you don't have to worry about whether

1606
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:43,750
it's correct,
it's not correct,

1607
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,060
doesn't matter.
It's better than nothing.

1608
01:25:46,061 --> 01:25:47,380
That's the issue.
So okay,

1609
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:52,381
so you've got the world parsed up into 
things that are making or making you 

1610
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:57,151
happy when you look at them,
things that get in the way that produce 

1611
01:25:57,151 --> 01:26:01,321
negative emotion and then a whole host 
of irrelevant things because almost 

1612
01:26:01,321 --> 01:26:03,830
everything is irrelevant and that's 
where all the chaos is hiding.

1613
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:08,300
The chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant
and so,

1614
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:13,600
and that's very interesting observation 
because since the chaos is virtually 

1615
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:13,600
infinite,
it's a real questions.

1616
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,890
Where the hell do you put it while you 
put it in,

1617
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:20,891
what you ignore and you can ignore it as
long as it isn't actively interfering 

1618
01:26:20,891 --> 01:26:22,190
with your movement forward,
you can assume that it's,

1619
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:27,170
that it doesn't matter that it doesn't 
matter that it doesn't matter.

1620
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,190
Same thing.

1621
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,440
All right?
So here's the kicker.

1622
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:36,441
There's one more class of things that 
you can run into along the way and this 

1623
01:26:37,141 --> 01:26:39,990
is where the chaos breaks through.
So let's say

1624
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:51,240
you're moving from point a to point b 
and something that you don't expect 

1625
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:56,580
occurs and it gets in the way.
So let's say that you're living with 

1626
01:26:58,121 --> 01:27:03,121
someone and maybe you kind of like them.
You're not married so you don't like 

1627
01:27:03,121 --> 01:27:03,760
them that much because otherwise you'd 
ask them to marry you.

1628
01:27:03,761 --> 01:27:05,890
But anyways.
Um,

1629
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:11,090
and so a quarter view is looking for 
something better and three quarters view

1630
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:13,000
is half satisfied,
something like that.

1631
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:17,650
And then a person because we're 
ambivalent about such things.

1632
01:27:17,651 --> 01:27:22,651
And then the person you discover or the 
person announces that they've been 

1633
01:27:22,651 --> 01:27:23,350
having an affair.
Okay.

1634
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:26,500
So then how are you supposed to respond 
emotionally to that?

1635
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:31,860
Well,
the part of you that wasn't all that 

1636
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:31,860
committed to the relationship is kind of
exhilarated by that.

1637
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:34,510
And then the three quarters of you 
that's half satisfied is hurt and,

1638
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:39,810
and you're going to exploit that part 
for sure in the ensuing discussions and 

1639
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:39,810
not mention the,
oh,

1640
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:42,130
that's kind of exciting that you've 
betrayed me that way.

1641
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:44,320
So,
so,

1642
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,170
but the point is,
is that you,

1643
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:52,500
that's a whole.
Now what's happened is a whole has you 

1644
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,070
have this structure that you're walking 
on ice,

1645
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:59,100
like the thin ice that you're skating on
and now there's a hole in it and the 

1646
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,460
whole,
we don't even know how deep the hole is,

1647
01:28:00,461 --> 01:28:03,370
but you know there's a hole there and so
now you're anxious about it.

1648
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:08,390
Oh,
they'll maybe also a little bit excited 

1649
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:08,390
because God only knows what's down 
there,

1650
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:11,940
but,
but you don't know what to do with that 

1651
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,970
whole because it could spread very badly
on you.

1652
01:28:12,971 --> 01:28:17,971
It could be that you know the whole 
relationship was a facade and that all 

1653
01:28:18,401 --> 01:28:20,620
your relationships have been facades,
facades,

1654
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:25,800
and that the reason that is is because 
you're so damn shallow that it's 

1655
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,591
impossible for you to have a 
relationship that isn't just a facade 

1656
01:28:28,591 --> 01:28:32,100
and that's partly because you don't pay 
any attention to other people and it's 

1657
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:32,170
also partly because you're malevolent 
and selfish,

1658
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:37,500
so that's a nasty thing to discover or 
maybe that's the sort of person that 

1659
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,710
you're attracting,
which would make sense actually,

1660
01:28:38,711 --> 01:28:41,320
if that's the sort of person that you 
are and so,

1661
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:46,000
so there are certain things that you can
encounter that basically unglue you,

1662
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:51,360
and what happens is that those moments 
of being unglued travel up that entire 

1663
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,630
hierarchy of presuppositions.

1664
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:58,070
It's like because the one of the logical
conclusions to being betrayed in a 

1665
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:00,550
relationship is that you are,
that you're truly a bad person.

1666
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:05,960
Now another equally logical conclusion 
is that the person that you're with is 

1667
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:11,991
really a bad person,
and another logical conclusion is all 

1668
01:29:11,991 --> 01:29:12,960
people are truly bad people.
You know,

1669
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:15,290
I mean in,
in,

1670
01:29:15,291 --> 01:29:16,460
in macro ways,
at,

1671
01:29:16,461 --> 01:29:18,180
in microwaves.
You can't trust anyone.

1672
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:19,860
You can't trust women.
You can't trust men.

1673
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:22,050
You can't trust human beings.
You can't trust yourself.

1674
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:25,380
The whole place is a catastrophe.
It's a nightmare.

1675
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,830
Well,
then you can fall through into chaos.

1676
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,450
Now the way your body responds to that,
when some,

1677
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:34,110
or maybe you know you're supposed to be 
getting a promotion at work,

1678
01:29:34,111 --> 01:29:39,111
that's good.
You're all chipper about the promotion 

1679
01:29:39,111 --> 01:29:39,780
at work and you,
you walk into your boss's office because

1680
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:43,530
he or she wants to see you and they say,
well,

1681
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:46,950
you know,
we've reviewed your performance over the

1682
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:51,950
last few years and your performance has 
been somewhere between mediocre and 

1683
01:29:53,441 --> 01:29:56,760
decent and we're downsizing and see you 
later.

1684
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,590
That's not a raise or a promotion,
that's for sure.

1685
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:05,790
That's a whole that you fall into and 
the question is,

1686
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,050
well,
what do you make of that?

1687
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,390
Right?
How do you frame that?

1688
01:30:09,391 --> 01:30:13,230
How do you take that emergent chaos and 
make habitable order out of?

1689
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:16,560
You don't know.
Is the whole capitalist system rotten to

1690
01:30:16,561 --> 01:30:17,760
the core?
I mean,

1691
01:30:17,761 --> 01:30:20,520
that's a convenient explanation under 
those circumstances.

1692
01:30:20,521 --> 01:30:25,521
That's for sure.
Where you're working for a psychopathic 

1693
01:30:25,521 --> 01:30:28,221
son of a bitch,
did you make the wrong choice in 

1694
01:30:28,221 --> 01:30:31,401
university and was that your father's 
fault because you never did what you 

1695
01:30:31,401 --> 01:30:34,581
wanted or was it your fault for not 
standing up to them or is it a dying 

1696
01:30:34,581 --> 01:30:38,660
industry or is maybe there's a wake up 
call that you should go do something 

1697
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:41,601
else that you've been waiting to do you 
know that you've actually wanted to do 

1698
01:30:41,601 --> 01:30:45,021
your whole life and that's why you're 
doing such a miserable job at your 

1699
01:30:45,021 --> 01:30:48,471
current occupation because you're bitter
and resentful about the fact that you 

1700
01:30:48,471 --> 01:30:48,471
never did what you want.

1701
01:30:48,471 --> 01:30:53,030
You don't know.
It's all of those things at once and 

1702
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:56,061
that's very stressful because all of 
those things at once is too many things 

1703
01:30:56,061 --> 01:30:59,220
and that's the reemergence of chaos.
That's the flood.

1704
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:02,490
That's the return to the beginning of 
the cosmos.

1705
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:04,170
That's another way that it's been 
represented.

1706
01:31:04,171 --> 01:31:09,171
Ms Dot biologically.
Instead you voyage all the way back to 

1707
01:31:09,171 --> 01:31:12,021
the beginning of the cosmos when there's
nothing but undifferentiated chaos and 

1708
01:31:12,021 --> 01:31:15,750
that's what you're confronting and maybe
it's too much for you and often it is.

1709
01:31:15,751 --> 01:31:20,751
I mean that that can really,
that can be traumatizing and it can hurt

1710
01:31:20,941 --> 01:31:25,941
your brain,
you know it's just too much for you to 

1711
01:31:25,941 --> 01:31:25,941
bear,
but it doesn't matter.

1712
01:31:25,941 --> 01:31:27,420
You're stuck with it,
and so how do you respond to that?

1713
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:32,450
Well,
some of it is catastrophic negative 

1714
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:35,001
emotion.
You freeze and that's protective and 

1715
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:35,001
maybe you don't even want to move.

1716
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:39,020
You don't want to bloody well get out of
bed for a week and that's because your 

1717
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:42,621
body is reacting as if the bedroom floor
is covered with snakes and the best 

1718
01:31:42,621 --> 01:31:44,310
thing for you to do is just not move,
just freeze.

1719
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:49,380
Not a pleasant situation to be in 
because it's your hyperaroused very,

1720
01:31:49,381 --> 01:31:54,381
very physiologically demanding and 
there's zero about it that's productive 

1721
01:31:54,381 --> 01:31:56,190
except maybe the snakes won't see you,
but they've already seen you,

1722
01:31:56,191 --> 01:32:01,191
so that isn't helping very well.
So you've got all this undifferentiated 

1723
01:32:01,191 --> 01:32:01,191
native,
negative emotion,

1724
01:32:01,191 --> 01:32:02,140
anxiety,
fear,

1725
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,010
hurt,
anger,

1726
01:32:03,011 --> 01:32:03,910
guilt,
shame,

1727
01:32:03,911 --> 01:32:07,000
emotional pain,
the whole plethora of catastrophes.

1728
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:10,720
And then maybe on the other side lurking
down there is,

1729
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,730
thank God I'm done with that job.
I just bloody well hated.

1730
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:18,780
I dragged myself off to work every day 
and there's a little part of my soul 

1731
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:23,611
that so goddamn happy.
I finally got fired that I can hardly 

1732
01:32:23,611 --> 01:32:23,611
stand it.

1733
01:32:23,611 --> 01:32:27,780
You know,
maybe you don't even admit that to 

1734
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:27,780
yourself because.
Well,

1735
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:29,050
that would mean that all that time you 
spent at the job was just sunk costs.

1736
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:31,670
You're diluting yourself the whole time.
I.

1737
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,760
It is an interesting thing to consider 
those sometimes if you're in the 

1738
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,560
unpleasant circumstance of having to 
fire someone,

1739
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:44,180
you know,
sometimes firing someone is the best 

1740
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:46,381
thing that can happen to them,
which doesn't mean that you should go 

1741
01:32:46,381 --> 01:32:49,171
out and like enjoy it.
Although I have met very disagreeable 

1742
01:32:49,171 --> 01:32:54,031
people who actually enjoyed firing 
people and I'll tell you a story about 

1743
01:32:54,031 --> 01:32:54,670
that at some point because it's quite 
interesting,

1744
01:32:54,671 --> 01:32:59,671
but you know,
sometimes if someone's just limping 

1745
01:32:59,671 --> 01:33:02,311
along in their job and doing it as 
miserably in wretchedly as they possibly

1746
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,220
can,
imagine,

1747
01:33:03,221 --> 01:33:05,800
the best thing you can do to them for 
the ms dot say,

1748
01:33:05,801 --> 01:33:09,700
you know,
you're failing at this and,

1749
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:14,970
and that doesn't necessarily mean that 
you would have to be failing at 

1750
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:15,400
absolutely everything else.
In the entire world,

1751
01:33:15,401 --> 01:33:19,780
so maybe you should just accept the dam 
failure and go off and try something new

1752
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:23,470
and I mean that's terrifying for people 
and I know they hate it and all that,

1753
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:25,650
but,

1754
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:28,540
but sometimes it's better than the 
alternative,

1755
01:33:28,541 --> 01:33:30,970
which is just slow,
torturous death.

1756
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:31,870
So

1757
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:40,300
here's a funny way of looking at it.
So let's say you fall right into that 

1758
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:44,180
hole that's underneath any everything 
and you've hit an anomaly that you don't

1759
01:33:44,181 --> 01:33:44,990
understand.
You say,

1760
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,140
what's that anomaly made out of?
Exactly.

1761
01:33:48,141 --> 01:33:49,970
I know that's a strange way of thinking 
about it,

1762
01:33:49,971 --> 01:33:51,500
you know,
because it's not.

1763
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,860
Well you could say we'll just go along 
with that.

1764
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:57,380
It's a metaphor.
What's that anomaly made out at?

1765
01:33:57,410 --> 01:34:00,260
Well here's a way of thinking about it.
It's made out of spirit and matter.

1766
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:04,070
And here's why.
This is something I learned in part from

1767
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:06,710
Piaget said,
well,

1768
01:34:06,711 --> 01:34:11,711
it's made out of matter because of 
course that's the world matter and the 

1769
01:34:11,711 --> 01:34:15,731
world is also what matters.
And so that's kind of a nice duality 

1770
01:34:15,731 --> 01:34:17,840
there,
but it's made out of spirit because when

1771
01:34:17,841 --> 01:34:20,420
you encounter something anomalous and go
down the rabbit hole,

1772
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:23,450
when you go into the underworld that's 
underneath everything that you've relied

1773
01:34:23,451 --> 01:34:25,910
on,
you learn things down there.

1774
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:30,910
So what's down there is information and 
that now it's moved maybe way more 

1775
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:32,510
information than you want,
but it is information.

1776
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:36,620
It's information and what can you.
What can you do with the information?

1777
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,740
You can inform yourself with the 
information,

1778
01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:44,770
right?
You can put yourself information with 

1779
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:47,450
the information that's helpful too.
And so and you think,

1780
01:34:47,451 --> 01:34:49,490
well you,
you're a psyche.

1781
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:54,520
Maybe you're not a spirit.
It depends on whether you're a 

1782
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,191
materialist or not,
but at least we can say that you're a 

1783
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:57,191
psyche.
The question is,

1784
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:59,330
what's your psyche made of all?
It's obviously got a material substrate,

1785
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:02,420
but the the matter happens to be a raid 
in,

1786
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:05,990
in a particular order and that's an 
information order.

1787
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:11,350
And so when you fall into the underworld
that's underneath everything and you 

1788
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:13,820
encountered that latent information than
what you can do is enhance your psyche.

1789
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:18,821
You can grow your spirit because what 
you do is you take the new information 

1790
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:19,850
and you incorporate it.

1791
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:22,480
That's like eating the apple that that 
Adam and eve ate.

1792
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:27,500
You incorporate that and that makes more
of you and that's not a metaphorical or 

1793
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,290
metaphysical proposition.
It's not to say nothing other than well,

1794
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:33,050
that's what happens when children learn 
to think of what happens.

1795
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:38,260
Charles three has a pretty low 
resolution representations of the world 

1796
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:41,770
and is a fairly low resolution human 
being.

1797
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:46,880
God all the constituent elements there 
but isn't differentiated in any 

1798
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,080
tremendous manner.
That's all still to come in the future,

1799
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,720
and so what does the child do?
Explore,

1800
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:53,930
what are they?
Explore things they don't understand.

1801
01:35:53,931 --> 01:35:58,931
That's where the information is because 
you already understand what you 

1802
01:35:58,931 --> 01:35:58,931
understand.
There's no information there.

1803
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:01,190
You go were there where you don't 
understand.

1804
01:36:01,191 --> 01:36:03,800
That's where the information is,
and out of that information,

1805
01:36:03,801 --> 01:36:08,801
you generate a higher resolution world 
and you generate a higher resolution 

1806
01:36:08,801 --> 01:36:12,941
self and so out of the combat with the 
underlying dragon of chaos,

1807
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:16,700
you generate spirit and matter and 
that's what you do when you go down into

1808
01:36:16,701 --> 01:36:17,450
the underworld.

1809
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,130
So if it doesn't kill you or if it 
doesn't make you wish you were dead,

1810
01:36:22,131 --> 01:36:27,131
which it probably will,
but there's a bunch of you that has to 

1811
01:36:27,131 --> 01:36:29,951
die down there anyways.
So maybe that's not such a bad thing 

1812
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:30,800
because if you had this relationship 
that ended in betrayal,

1813
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:33,440
then there's something that's not 
exactly right.

1814
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:35,090
Right?
There's something that went.

1815
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:38,600
And the reason I'm saying that think,
well that's kind of moralistic.

1816
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:43,690
It's like,
actually I don't mind being moralistic 

1817
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:43,690
in case you haven't noticed,
but.

1818
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:48,270
But that's not.
It's not a fair comment because you're 

1819
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:50,801
playing this stupid game.
It's like you live with someone in 

1820
01:36:50,801 --> 01:36:52,190
fidelity.
That's the game,

1821
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:57,280
right?
You decided the rules with the game 

1822
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,040
comes to morality.
The morality are the rules of the game.

1823
01:36:58,370 --> 01:37:01,220
Well then the thing collapses into 
infidelity.

1824
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:02,630
It's like,
well,

1825
01:37:02,631 --> 01:37:04,760
you played the game wrong,
or it was the wrong game.

1826
01:37:04,761 --> 01:37:07,220
One of those to you.
It's one of those two.

1827
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:10,880
You pick the damn game and having picked
the game,

1828
01:37:10,881 --> 01:37:12,470
you can't all of a sudden say,
well no,

1829
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,880
those aren't the rules.
It's like,

1830
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:14,780
yeah,
yeah.

1831
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:19,990
If you pick the game,
you picked the rules and if you fail at 

1832
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:21,410
complying with the rule,
then you fail.

1833
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,340
Now you could say,
well,

1834
01:37:22,341 --> 01:37:23,600
I can pick a different game.
It's like,

1835
01:37:23,601 --> 01:37:27,290
I don't care how you solve the problem.
You're still stuck with the problem.

1836
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,480
It's a moral problem fundamentally,

1837
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:35,570
and it might take some major league 
retooling to to fix it.

1838
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:41,910
So you're at point a trying to get to 
point b.

1839
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:44,790
that's not working out.
You hit an anomaly,

1840
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:48,090
you're not getting to point B,
that's for sure.

1841
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,990
Your medical school student,
you're right,

1842
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,610
your m cats,
which is this test.

1843
01:37:53,611 --> 01:37:55,200
You have to right to go to medical 
school,

1844
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:58,290
you get 25th percentile.
I don't know who you are,

1845
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:02,160
but you're not a premed student and 
maybe you never were right?

1846
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:05,610
And that's the rub man,
and so who the hell are you?

1847
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:10,700
You don't know,
collapsed down here into this 

1848
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:12,360
motivational conflict,
this place of motivational and emotional

1849
01:38:12,361 --> 01:38:15,420
uncertainty and tremendous information,
right?

1850
01:38:15,421 --> 01:38:18,600
It's a place of transformation.
It's the phoenix that burns.

1851
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:20,910
It's the burning part of the phoenix 
that Burns.

1852
01:38:20,911 --> 01:38:22,920
It's.
It's the journey to the underworld.

1853
01:38:22,921 --> 01:38:27,921
It's the journey to hell.
It can really be a journey to hell 

1854
01:38:27,921 --> 01:38:30,681
because you may find out that the reason
that you're partner b trade you or that 

1855
01:38:30,681 --> 01:38:35,211
you didn't get your damn promotion is 
because there's seriously something 

1856
01:38:35,211 --> 01:38:36,840
wrong with you and you know it and I 
don't just mean that you don't know what

1857
01:38:36,841 --> 01:38:37,320
you're doing.

1858
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:42,530
I mean that there is 25 percent of you 
that has seriously aiming at things not 

1859
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:45,780
being good and so you fall into the 
underworld and you find out that,

1860
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,840
Oh God,
I just got exactly what I was aiming 

1861
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,831
for.
Or I got exactly what the worst part of 

1862
01:38:54,831 --> 01:38:58,011
me was aiming for and that worst part,
that's something to clean up and that's 

1863
01:38:58,011 --> 01:38:58,890
not going to be easy because it's got a 
toxin.

1864
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:01,680
Me like something,
something ferocious,

1865
01:39:01,681 --> 01:39:06,240
something seriously ferocious and I've 
been toying with it for a very long time

1866
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:09,300
and maybe I can't even detach it 
anymore.

1867
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,840
And so that's not so fun.
And you see people like that in 

1868
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:17,361
psychotherapy very frequently or you see
them wandering around on the streets 

1869
01:39:17,361 --> 01:39:21,300
like absolute catastrophic former shells
of themselves.

1870
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:26,760
You know,
because they've hit the underworld and 

1871
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:26,760
they ended up in hell and there's no 
getting out of it,

1872
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:30,980
and so those are the people you tend to 
give a wide berth to when you walk down 

1873
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:32,430
the street.
So there you are down in the underworld,

1874
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,590
right back where the latest information 
exists in just too much of it.

1875
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:40,740
And that's this.
It's the same thing.

1876
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:44,940
It's the same thing and that's why they 
Adam and Eve stories archetipal,

1877
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:49,320
right?
Because we're always ingesting something

1878
01:39:49,321 --> 01:39:54,321
new that knocks us into a new state of 
self consciousness and it's always a 

1879
01:39:54,781 --> 01:39:55,980
catastrophic

1880
01:39:56,890 --> 01:40:00,070
demolition of our current,
of our previous paradise.

1881
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:05,100
Insufficient as that paradise was,
something comes along to destroy it and 

1882
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,140
knocks the slots out of our life.
And that's a voyage to the underworld,

1883
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:13,500
out of the walled garden,
into chaos.

1884
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:23,040
And so what is all of that?
Well,

1885
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:25,390
there's lots of ways of construing it.
It's a,

1886
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:30,450
it's a frame transformation.
There is a walled city.

1887
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:33,270
It's got a hole in it because all walled
cities have holes in them,

1888
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:38,271
right?
Because everything's imperfect and 

1889
01:40:38,271 --> 01:40:39,891
that's where the chaos comes up.
And then maybe you go out there like a 

1890
01:40:39,891 --> 01:40:42,180
hero to fight the chaos and to 
reestablish the frame,

1891
01:40:42,181 --> 01:40:47,181
that's what you're supposed to do and 
maybe you free some information while 

1892
01:40:47,181 --> 01:40:50,721
you're doing that or maybe you establish
a relationship and so that's the

1893
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,680
frame damage,
chaos,

1894
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:01,180
voluntary confrontation,
reconstitution of the world,

1895
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,300
and that's the,
that's human existence.

1896
01:41:04,301 --> 01:41:09,301
And hopefully it's not just linear,
it's it's stepwise,

1897
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:15,180
right?
Is that the you that emerges as a 

1898
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:19,501
consequence of your latest catastrophe 
is everything that you were before plus 

1899
01:41:19,501 --> 01:41:24,061
something more and that actually 
constitutes what you might describe as 

1900
01:41:24,061 --> 01:41:25,780
measurable progress.
Right?

1901
01:41:25,781 --> 01:41:30,781
And that's another argument against 
moral relativism because if you can do 

1902
01:41:30,781 --> 01:41:33,700
everything that you could do before and 
you can do some more things,

1903
01:41:33,730 --> 01:41:37,210
we could just define that as better.
It's not a bad definition.

1904
01:41:37,211 --> 01:41:39,580
And then we have an APP.
It's like what you're trying to do is to

1905
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:45,610
differentiate the world and 
differentiate yourself.

1906
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:48,160
And every time you undergo one of these 
revolutions,

1907
01:41:48,161 --> 01:41:50,080
then hopefully both of those things 
happen.

1908
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:52,480
And then there's a moral to that story 
too,

1909
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:56,170
which is do it voluntarily and maybe do 
it.

1910
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,660
Don't wait for it to happen.
Catastrophic.

1911
01:42:00,661 --> 01:42:05,661
Really keep your eyes open and when 
something goes a little bit wrong that 

1912
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:08,110
you could fix,
fix it.

1913
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,780
Don't say no,
that doesn't matter.

1914
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:13,870
Maybe it does matter.
Maybe it is matter.

1915
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:16,780
Maybe it's exactly the matter out of 
which you should be built.

1916
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:21,900
Maybe it's the matter of which the world
should be built and if part of you is 

1917
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:25,951
telling you it matters.
What it means is that that part is 

1918
01:42:25,951 --> 01:42:30,280
telling you that there's something there
that you need to engage with.

1919
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:32,350
That's what it means for something to 
matter.

1920
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:37,500
I really get out of the kicker.
I can't go out of the word matter 

1921
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:37,500
because it's got these two weird 
meetings,

1922
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:41,911
right?
There's the matter that everything is 

1923
01:42:41,911 --> 01:42:43,621
made out of that materialists think.
Everything is made out of and that's 

1924
01:42:43,621 --> 01:42:46,240
just dead matter and then there's the 
matter that life is made out of which is

1925
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:51,480
what matters and now and then you're 
moving through life and something 

1926
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:51,480
matters.

1927
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:55,240
It's calling to you and that's the 
unrevealed world trying to reveal itself

1928
01:42:55,241 --> 01:42:59,530
to you and all you have to do is allow 
it to reveal itself to you,

1929
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:04,710
and then maybe what happens is that a 
minor share shift in shape is all that 

1930
01:43:04,991 --> 01:43:07,750
has to happen to you.
You don't have to burn right down to the

1931
01:43:07,751 --> 01:43:10,480
bloody egg and and hatch out.
You know,

1932
01:43:10,481 --> 01:43:15,481
as a newborn,
maybe you can just repair a little bit 

1933
01:43:15,481 --> 01:43:18,721
of something that's gone wrong with you 
and so you can undergo a sequence of 

1934
01:43:18,721 --> 01:43:22,261
continual micro deaths instead of 
waiting for the bloody catastrophe that 

1935
01:43:22,261 --> 01:43:23,800
might send you so far down that you'll 
never recover.

1936
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:29,220
And now you have to do is it tend to 
what matters and your whole nervous 

1937
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,940
system is doing this for you.
You've got a goal.

1938
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:33,070
Something happens.
It matters.

1939
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:34,600
So what are you supposed to do with 
that?

1940
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:36,580
You're supposed to.
You're supposed to fix it.

1941
01:43:36,581 --> 01:43:40,270
You're supposed to engage with it.
That's why it's calling out to you as if

1942
01:43:40,271 --> 01:43:45,271
it matters.
It's saying there's an indeterminant 

1943
01:43:45,271 --> 01:43:48,451
part of the world here that wants to 
manifest itself into fully articulated 

1944
01:43:48,451 --> 01:43:50,800
being and it's calling to you to do 
that.

1945
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:51,980
And if you ignore

1946
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,710
it,
then it accumulates and accumulates,

1947
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:59,711
it turns into the dragon of chaos.
And then it waits until you're not at 

1948
01:43:59,711 --> 01:44:01,160
your best,
and then it eats you.

1949
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:05,690
And that's the alternative.
So that seems like a bad plan unless you

1950
01:44:05,691 --> 01:44:08,210
like being lunchmeat.
So.

1951
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:15,380
So that's a long introduction to noah.

1952
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:23,520
Thank you.

1953
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:26,320
You need it,
you know,

1954
01:44:26,321 --> 01:44:28,360
because he can understand the story 
otherwise.

1955
01:44:28,361 --> 01:44:32,500
And so because that's what the story's 
about.

1956
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:35,590
And now we can go through the story 
relatively rapidly,

1957
01:44:35,591 --> 01:44:37,750
although it doesn't look like we'll go 
through all of it tonight.

1958
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:44,250
Okay?
So we'll start with the next section of 

1959
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:46,201
Genesis.
And this is immediately after Cain and 

1960
01:44:46,201 --> 01:44:47,350
Abel and there's a short story to begin 
with just to fragment.

1961
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:52,980
I called it giants of the earth and it 
came to pass when men began to multiply 

1962
01:44:53,651 --> 01:44:58,651
on the face of the earth.
So this is after Cain and Abel that and 

1963
01:44:58,651 --> 01:45:02,131
daughters were born unto them that the 
sons of God saw the daughters of men,

1964
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:06,580
that they were fair and took them wives 
of all which they chose,

1965
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:14,140
and the Lord said,
my spirit shall not always strive with 

1966
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:17,231
man for that he is also flesh.
Yet his days will be 120 years.

1967
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:21,040
There were giants in the earth in those 
days.

1968
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:26,041
And also after that,
when the sons of God came in unto the 

1969
01:45:26,041 --> 01:45:26,140
daughters of men and they bare children 
to them,

1970
01:45:26,410 --> 01:45:29,860
the same became mighty men were tour of 
old men of renown.

1971
01:45:30,910 --> 01:45:35,910
Now there's been all sorts of attempts 
to interpret those few rather jumbled 

1972
01:45:35,910 --> 01:45:39,551
blinds.
But I see it as a reflection of a 

1973
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:42,220
classic development of hero mythology,
which is,

1974
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:44,680
and this is sort of nostalgia for the 
past.

1975
01:45:44,890 --> 01:45:49,890
One of the things Mircea Eliana pointed 
out was that what happens to human 

1976
01:45:52,031 --> 01:45:55,240
memory in preliterate cultures because 
nothing is written down,

1977
01:45:55,241 --> 01:45:59,230
is that what needs to revert,
preserve gets amalgamated.

1978
01:45:59,231 --> 01:46:03,190
And so imagine that you have a culture 
that's based on fishing would say so you

1979
01:46:03,191 --> 01:46:08,191
have to be a good fisherman know,
and a human beings who use simple tools 

1980
01:46:08,711 --> 01:46:13,711
to fish are unbelievably good fishermen.
They know every bloody thing you can 

1981
01:46:13,711 --> 01:46:14,920
possibly imagine about fish because 
otherwise they die.

1982
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:19,920
So it's really important that they learn
everything about fish and maybe they'd 

1983
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,220
been fishing for like 13,000
years or something like that.

1984
01:46:21,221 --> 01:46:22,990
So there's a lot of accumulated 
knowledge.

1985
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:24,670
And so then the question is,
well,

1986
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:29,790
who taught mankind how to fish?
And the answer is fragments of 

1987
01:46:30,371 --> 01:46:33,100
individuals across history.
But that's,

1988
01:46:33,101 --> 01:46:33,630
you know,
you're not gonna.

1989
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:38,650
Remember the damn fragments.
You put them all together into the 

1990
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:41,761
amalgam of the heroic fishermen.
You know the guy who established the 

1991
01:46:41,761 --> 01:46:44,230
pattern for proper fishing,
whatever that pattern happens to be,

1992
01:46:44,410 --> 01:46:49,410
one of the patterns might be,
don't take all the damn fish because 

1993
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:49,650
there won't be any further next year.
Something that.

1994
01:46:49,651 --> 01:46:49,860
But

1995
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:55,050
all those fragments of discovery get 
amalgamated into heroes of the past.

1996
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:57,210
And then what you do if you're a 
fisherman,

1997
01:46:57,211 --> 01:46:59,820
is you act out the heroic fishermen of 
the past,

1998
01:46:59,821 --> 01:47:04,821
and so the idea that there were men of 
renown are heroes in the past is just a 

1999
01:47:05,281 --> 01:47:08,040
fragmentary,
what would you call?

2000
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:13,170
It's just a fragment of that sequence of
ideas that back in the past there were 

2001
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:18,300
mighty human beings who established the 
proper patterns of being and they were 

2002
01:47:19,081 --> 01:47:23,760
the sons of God who took the daughters 
of men to wife.

2003
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:25,080
Now,
and it's interesting too,

2004
01:47:25,081 --> 01:47:30,081
because we do know that the more 
competent men are disproportionately 

2005
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:35,751
likely to leave offspring,
so it's a perfectly reasonable way of 

2006
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:42,210
formulating the circumstance onto the 
flood.

2007
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:44,680
This is from merchant Yada,
who,

2008
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,980
who wrote a book called a history of 
religious ideas,

2009
01:47:46,981 --> 01:47:49,860
which I strongly recommended.
It's a three volume set.

2010
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:52,260
It's quite readable and it's brilliant.
It's brilliant.

2011
01:47:52,261 --> 01:47:57,261
I really like it,
and this is what materiality Adis had to

2012
01:47:58,231 --> 01:48:03,231
say about flood myths,
as has been well known since the 

2013
01:48:03,231 --> 01:48:06,231
compilations made by our Andre Age user 
and Jg Fraser who wrote the golden 

2014
01:48:06,231 --> 01:48:11,031
bough.
The Deluge myth of flood mid is almost 

2015
01:48:11,031 --> 01:48:12,720
universally disseminated.
It is documented on all the continents,

2016
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:17,930
although very rarely in Africa,
particularly in the desert for an 

2017
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:21,300
unsurprisingly,
although and on various cultural levels,

2018
01:48:21,301 --> 01:48:26,301
a certain number of variants seemed to 
be the result of dissemination rather 

2019
01:48:26,301 --> 01:48:29,100
than spontaneous regeneration,
let's say first for Mesopotamia,

2020
01:48:29,101 --> 01:48:34,101
and then from India.
It is equally possible that one or 

2021
01:48:34,101 --> 01:48:36,240
several dilute catastrophes gave rise to
fabulous narratives,

2022
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:40,530
but it would be risky to explain so 
widespread myth by phenomena of which no

2023
01:48:40,531 --> 01:48:43,280
geological traces has been found.
Well,

2024
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:44,760
Elliot,
who wrote this quite awhile ago,

2025
01:48:44,761 --> 01:48:47,010
I think he wrote that book perhaps in 
the eighties,

2026
01:48:47,011 --> 01:48:48,720
maybe in the seventies,
but since then,

2027
01:48:48,721 --> 01:48:50,670
there actually has been quite a bit of 
evidence.

2028
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I'm advanced in various circles for the 
existence of catastrophic floods that 

2029
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,921
occurred within the relative memory of 
human relative human civilization 

2030
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:01,980
memory,
let's say.

2031
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:03,900
So the West Coast Indians,
for example,

2032
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:06,960
I suppose that's the wrong word,
the west coast.

2033
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,730
I don't know what to say that I know,
uh,

2034
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:11,790
uh,
uh,

2035
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:16,820
Kwakwaka'Wakw carver who told me a flood
story and they have a story that's 

2036
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:21,741
almost identical to the story of Noah,
except of course it involves giant 

2037
01:49:21,741 --> 01:49:21,741
canoes,
but it's,

2038
01:49:21,741 --> 01:49:25,530
it's the same story they release,
if I remember correctly,

2039
01:49:25,531 --> 01:49:28,740
a raisin,
but noaa releases a raven first and then

2040
01:49:28,741 --> 01:49:33,741
a dove once,
once the flood comes to an end and it 

2041
01:49:33,741 --> 01:49:34,320
has a tower of Babel issue to the same 
story.

2042
01:49:34,321 --> 01:49:37,170
So the canoes are all put together.
It's not one giant canoe.

2043
01:49:37,171 --> 01:49:42,171
It's a bunch of canoes altogether.
They write out the flood and then the 

2044
01:49:42,171 --> 01:49:43,170
canoes separate in and go all over the 
world.

2045
01:49:43,171 --> 01:49:45,030
And that's why there are people all over
the world.

2046
01:49:45,031 --> 01:49:47,950
So anyways,
the story is very disseminated.

2047
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:53,550
But you know,
there were floods in North America not 

2048
01:49:53,550 --> 01:49:53,680
that long ago.
So there were floods.

2049
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:56,890
You can look up the missoula floods 
15,000

2050
01:49:56,891 --> 01:49:58,270
to 13,000
years ago.

2051
01:49:58,271 --> 01:50:03,271
And the core people have probably been 
on the west coast for something like 13 

2052
01:50:03,271 --> 01:50:03,310
to 14,000
years.

2053
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:04,490
So,
and you know,

2054
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,550
you can,
you can maintain an oral tradition for a

2055
01:50:06,551 --> 01:50:07,780
very,
very long time,

2056
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:11,680
you think no,
but traditional societies don't change.

2057
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:16,800
That's why they're traditional and so 
they have the same stories over 

2058
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:16,800
generations.
They,

2059
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,140
they remember the same stories.
So when the missoula floods,

2060
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:24,700
which were a consequence of melting 
glacial ice discharged up,

2061
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:28,570
they figured there were 55,055
of them between 15,000

2062
01:50:28,571 --> 01:50:29,830
and 13,000
years ago,

2063
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:33,610
discharged volumes up to 15 times the 
volume of the Amazon River.

2064
01:50:33,611 --> 01:50:38,020
So these are major league floods and 
then a sears at all,

2065
01:50:38,021 --> 01:50:43,021
published a paper in 2008 called climate
change and post glacial human disperses 

2066
01:50:43,021 --> 01:50:47,611
in Southeast Asia claiming that there 
were multiple floods particularly 

2067
01:50:47,611 --> 01:50:49,930
affecting Southeast Asia between 15,000
and 7,000

2068
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:50,950
years ago.

2069
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:54,370
So there might elliot,
it might be a bit wrong about the notion

2070
01:50:54,371 --> 01:50:57,250
that there were no geological traces of 
such,

2071
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:59,710
such catastrophic flooding.
But anyways,

2072
01:50:59,711 --> 01:51:04,711
it doesn't matter because we're still 
looking at this from a psychological 

2073
01:51:04,711 --> 01:51:07,501
perspective and that's fine.
The majority of the flood myth Siemens 

2074
01:51:07,501 --> 01:51:08,800
some sense to form part of the cosmic 
rhythm.

2075
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:14,130
The old world people by a fallen 
humanity is submerged under the waters 

2076
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:20,730
and sometime later a new world emerges 
from the aquatic chaos in large number 

2077
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:25,051
of variants that flood is the result of 
the sins or ritual faults of human 

2078
01:51:25,051 --> 01:51:29,341
beings.
Sometimes it's results simply from the 

2079
01:51:29,341 --> 01:51:29,800
wish of a divine being to put an end to 
mankind.

2080
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:34,480
The chief causes lie at once in the sins
of men and the decrepitude of the world.

2081
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:39,780
It's a brilliant analysis partly because
it puts it.

2082
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:45,510
It draws this lovely parallel between 
which are mentioned a bit earlier 

2083
01:51:45,510 --> 01:51:48,220
between the fact that things go wrong 
all by themselves,

2084
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:51,640
but that you can speed that along by not
paying any attention.

2085
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,320
You know,
so if you're in a relationship,

2086
01:51:53,650 --> 01:51:58,650
you know,
relationship takes an awful lot of 

2087
01:51:58,650 --> 01:51:59,170
maintenance and you knew what it means 
needs to be maintained because you start

2088
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:02,530
developing some distance from the person
that you have the relationship with.

2089
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:07,740
And then that starts to become tinged 
with a little bit of dislike and 

2090
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:11,251
hopefully not contempt,
but a little bit of dislike and maybe 

2091
01:52:11,251 --> 01:52:11,251
some,
some,

2092
01:52:11,251 --> 01:52:13,480
some emotional distance.
And you feel that and you think,

2093
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:15,490
well,
it's hard tell what you think,

2094
01:52:15,491 --> 01:52:19,360
but you feel that anyways,
you know that that's emerged and so then

2095
01:52:19,361 --> 01:52:24,361
you have a chance at at that point to 
repair whatever's gone wrong.

2096
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:28,630
And that would require some retooling on
both of your parts.

2097
01:52:28,631 --> 01:52:30,760
Maybe one more,
one person more than the other,

2098
01:52:30,761 --> 01:52:35,761
but whatever.
We would require a serious discussion 

2099
01:52:35,761 --> 01:52:35,761
like,
look,

2100
01:52:35,761 --> 01:52:39,180
I've noticed that this has been 
happening and maybe it's you and maybe 

2101
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:41,500
it's me and we should probably figure it
out because if it was you,

2102
01:52:41,501 --> 01:52:44,020
that'd be convenient and everything.
But if it was me,

2103
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:45,710
then I'd like to fix it because

2104
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,980
then it would be fixed.
And so that's why you listen to your 

2105
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:53,351
partner because they might tell you that
there's something stupid about you that 

2106
01:52:53,351 --> 01:52:53,450
you don't know.
And then if you could fix that,

2107
01:52:53,451 --> 01:52:55,490
then you wouldn't have to be stupid in 
that way anymore.

2108
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:57,890
And it's actually one of the real 
useful.

2109
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:03,400
It's one of the genuinely useful 
features of having a partner because do 

2110
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:07,180
you really want to be stupid?
And then continue to repeat your 

2111
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:07,180
mistakes ad Nauseum for the rest of your
life.

2112
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:12,280
I know it's more convenient to do that 
than to have a knock down drag out 

2113
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:15,770
argument about just exactly why you're 
stupid and how you could fix it,

2114
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:18,350
but still it's better to have the 
argument.

2115
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:25,740
So the chief causes lie at once in the 
sins of man in the decrepitude of the 

2116
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:29,581
world and the sins there are generally 
either acts of commission where people 

2117
01:53:30,041 --> 01:53:35,041
do things that they know to be wrong or 
they failed to do things that they know 

2118
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:36,760
would be right.
It doesn't really matter.

2119
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,820
The sins of commission are usually 
judged more harshly,

2120
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:42,250
say within the Judeo Christian 
tradition.

2121
01:53:42,251 --> 01:53:47,251
But I think there might be a bit of an 
error in that because sins of omission 

2122
01:53:47,251 --> 01:53:48,820
can be a real catastrophe.
And so here's a flawed idea.

2123
01:53:48,821 --> 01:53:51,280
You tell me what you think about this.
So you know,

2124
01:53:51,281 --> 01:53:55,900
so there's this idea that a judgmental 
being will flood you out if you continue

2125
01:53:55,901 --> 01:53:58,970
on your way word ways.
And that seems like a little bit,

2126
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,970
you know,
it's one of the examples of,

2127
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:04,330
of Jehovah being a little on the harsh 
side in the Old Testament,

2128
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:09,360
not something that modern people really 
a prove of so much because we like our 

2129
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:12,400
gods sort of domesticated,
let's put it that way.

2130
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,910
And unfortunately that isn't how it 
tends to work.

2131
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:21,090
But I've often thought about the 
reaction in North America to the 

2132
01:54:21,641 --> 01:54:26,641
hurricane in,
in New Orleans because there's two ways 

2133
01:54:28,371 --> 01:54:29,360
of reading that,
right?

2134
01:54:29,361 --> 01:54:30,890
One is mother nature

2135
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:37,010
has a little fit and sends a hurricane 
into New Orleans and wipes everyone out.

2136
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:40,370
And isn't that a catastrophe?
And isn't that an example of.

2137
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:45,820
Isn't that example of our fragility and 
the force in the face of,

2138
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:50,590
of natural power.
But there's another way of reading it.

2139
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:55,600
Maybe this is unfair,
but it'll do for the purposes of 

2140
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:55,600
illustration.
It's like,

2141
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:55,780
you know,
the Dutch build dikes,

2142
01:54:55,781 --> 01:55:00,781
right to keep the ocean back and they're
actually pretty effective at that 

2143
01:55:00,781 --> 01:55:01,150
because their country's mostly 
underwater.

2144
01:55:01,151 --> 01:55:02,970
And it turns out that if you go to 
Holland,

2145
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:06,790
it's actually not underwater.
And so they're dikes are working.

2146
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:11,791
And so the Dutch were very organized 
people and they better be because their 

2147
01:55:11,791 --> 01:55:12,990
country is supposed to be underwater,
right?

2148
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,030
So you better be organized if your 
country is supposed to be underwater.

2149
01:55:16,630 --> 01:55:19,510
And so they are very organized and they 
have a rule for their dykes,

2150
01:55:19,511 --> 01:55:24,511
which is they try to estimate the worst 
possible oceanic storm that will come in

2151
01:55:25,961 --> 01:55:30,961
10,000
years and made sure that the dikes will 

2152
01:55:30,961 --> 01:55:30,961
withstand that.

2153
01:55:30,961 --> 01:55:35,880
Well from my reading,
the Army Corps of Engineers in New 

2154
01:55:36,370 --> 01:55:41,370
Orleans build the dikes for a storm 
every hundred years and that's not so 

2155
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:44,790
good because we live about eight years,
let's say.

2156
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:48,270
So that means the probability that one 
of those storms is going come up and buy

2157
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:53,450
in a lifespan is pretty damn high.
And then so that perhaps wasn't the 

2158
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:59,031
wisest of planning,
especially because some of New Orleans 

2159
01:55:59,031 --> 01:56:00,240
is actually supposed to be underwater.
And then worse.

2160
01:56:00,241 --> 01:56:02,400
You know,
Mississippi is a state that's quite well

2161
01:56:02,401 --> 01:56:07,401
known for its corruption.
And so you might also say that a 

2162
01:56:07,401 --> 01:56:09,690
tremendous amount of the money and time 
and resources that could have and should

2163
01:56:09,691 --> 01:56:14,691
have and was planned to go towards 
fixing the problem didn't eat,

2164
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:19,830
and so the hurricane came along and Oh 
my God wasn't in a natural disaster.

2165
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:25,040
And the question is,
what bloody well makes you so sure that 

2166
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:26,190
it was a natural disaster,
right?

2167
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:31,190
Because if the infrastructure would have
been maintained and built to the 

2168
01:56:31,190 --> 01:56:35,211
specifications that were certainly 
technically possible and would have 

2169
01:56:35,211 --> 01:56:38,691
actually been less expensive in the long
run to build and everyone knew it and 

2170
01:56:39,271 --> 01:56:41,100
the hurricane came along and wiped build
the city,

2171
01:56:41,101 --> 01:56:42,990
why do you think that's a natural 
disaster?

2172
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:47,730
To me that's an.
That's a natural example.

2173
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:52,230
If you think about it from a 
metaphorical perspective of a judgmental

2174
01:56:52,231 --> 01:56:57,231
God deciding to use a flood to teach a 
moral lesson,

2175
01:56:58,950 --> 01:56:59,610
and you might say,
well,

2176
01:56:59,611 --> 01:57:02,010
that's pretty harsh.
What about all those floods survivors?

2177
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:03,090
I care.
Well,

2178
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:08,330
the whole flood thing was kind of harsh 
and so pointing out that there were 

2179
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:11,961
steps that could have been taken and and
also that I doubt in the aftermath have 

2180
01:57:12,811 --> 01:57:17,811
been taken even though everyone knows 
now exactly what had happened is

2181
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:23,350
you might consider the diagnosis,
but it's irrelevant because what I,

2182
01:57:23,470 --> 01:57:28,470
what I'm really trying to tell you is 
how the mythological stories would line 

2183
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:31,981
up on this because you can tell a story 
about mother nature manifesting her kick

2184
01:57:32,770 --> 01:57:37,770
catastrophe and potential for tragedy or
you can tell another story of an 

2185
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:41,701
absolute failure of the human social 
structure and the human individual level

2186
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:49,050
because of the corruption to address a 
problem that everyone knew was there and

2187
01:57:49,510 --> 01:57:54,510
so that's a good example of how things,
how the flood comes when you're not 

2188
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:56,080
behaving properly.
You know,

2189
01:57:56,100 --> 01:58:01,100
in.
One of the things that's quite 

2190
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:02,311
interesting about the old testament and 
the people who wrote it is that they 

2191
01:58:02,311 --> 01:58:04,180
always assume that if the flood comes,
that meant you weren't prepared.

2192
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:06,000
If that's the rule,
right?

2193
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:10,120
That it's like the a priori axiom.
I think he got flooded out,

2194
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:11,470
hey,
you weren't prepared enough.

2195
01:58:11,690 --> 01:58:14,200
How can you tell what you got flooded 
out,

2196
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:15,760
right?
That's the evidence,

2197
01:58:15,761 --> 01:58:16,390
and you might say,
well,

2198
01:58:16,391 --> 01:58:19,540
that's not very fair.
It's fair isn't the point.

2199
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:23,170
The point is do you want to get flooded 
out again or not?

2200
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:24,760
Because fair would be,
well,

2201
01:58:24,761 --> 01:58:29,761
you better figure out why you got 
flooded out and fix it so it doesn't 

2202
01:58:29,761 --> 01:58:33,121
happen again,
and that's the moral thing to do when 

2203
01:58:33,121 --> 01:58:34,810
when you're thinking about morality as 
walking the path,

2204
01:58:34,811 --> 01:58:39,811
it's most appropriate to get to the 
destination that you think would be the 

2205
01:58:39,811 --> 01:58:39,910
best possible destination

2206
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:47,510
by the mere fact that it exists.
That is it lives in producers.

2207
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:50,980
The cosmos gradually deteriorates.
It ends by falling into decay.

2208
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:54,130
That is the reason why it has to be 
recreated.

2209
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:59,340
In other words,
the flood realizes on the macrocosmic 

2210
01:58:59,340 --> 01:58:59,890
scale,
what is symbolically affected during the

2211
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:01,810
new year festival,
the end of the world,

2212
01:59:01,811 --> 01:59:05,980
and the end of a sinful humanity in 
order to make a new creation possible.

2213
01:59:06,770 --> 01:59:07,750
Well,
that's an interesting.

2214
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:10,420
There's a lot of information packed into
those few lines.

2215
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:10,990
Delete,
edit,

2216
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,130
wrote,
because he also,

2217
01:59:13,110 --> 01:59:17,410
at the at at in the Mesopotamian 
rituals,

2218
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,970
the Mesopotamians would act out

2219
01:59:23,630 --> 01:59:27,980
the collapse of the kingdom into chaos 
essentially after new year's festival.

2220
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:33,220
It's kind of what you do when you make 
resolutions because like it's a 

2221
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:35,060
degenerate,
what you'd say is our proclivity to make

2222
01:59:35,061 --> 01:59:37,550
new year's resolutions,
sort of a degenerate ritual,

2223
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:39,930
and I don't mean that it's bad.
I mean that it,

2224
01:59:39,931 --> 01:59:40,460
it,
it,

2225
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:43,220
it's the remnants of something much 
grander.

2226
01:59:43,970 --> 01:59:45,740
So the idea was,
well,

2227
01:59:45,741 --> 01:59:48,650
the Mesopotamians would take their 
emperor outside the city,

2228
01:59:48,651 --> 01:59:53,651
the walled city and once a year and they
would make them kneel and they take off 

2229
01:59:53,651 --> 01:59:56,420
all his king close and then they'd whack
them with a glove,

2230
01:59:56,450 --> 01:59:58,640
if I remember correctly,
the priest would do that and then they'd

2231
01:59:58,641 --> 02:00:02,900
make them recount all the ways that he 
wasn't being a good emperor that year.

2232
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,000
He wasn't being a good Marduk because 
that was who he was supposed to be on 

2233
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:08,000
earth.
And that's the guy with eyes all the way

2234
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,140
around his head speaks magic words that 
transforms chaos into order.

2235
02:00:12,290 --> 02:00:15,230
That's what dampers supposed to do.
And so the question would be,

2236
02:00:15,231 --> 02:00:16,370
okay,
your emperor,

2237
02:00:16,410 --> 02:00:21,410
it's like,
have a little humility here because 

2238
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:22,250
you're not God incarnate.
He probably made some mistakes.

2239
02:00:22,370 --> 02:00:27,370
Can you think of any ways in the last 
year that you didn't take every 

2240
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:31,630
advantage of every opportunity you 
possibly could have to take some spare 

2241
02:00:31,630 --> 02:00:33,530
chaos and transform it into a habit of 
habitable order?

2242
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:35,180
That's a good thing to think about.
Well,

2243
02:00:35,181 --> 02:00:37,730
that's what you're thinking about when 
you make a new year's resolution,

2244
02:00:37,731 --> 02:00:39,290
even though you don't know it.
It's like,

2245
02:00:39,291 --> 02:00:44,291
well,
could you be a better person in the 

2246
02:00:44,291 --> 02:00:48,160
upcoming year as well?
You can imagine the flood

2247
02:00:52,850 --> 02:00:57,620
and then you can set yourself straight 
and then you can prepare for it.

2248
02:00:57,621 --> 02:00:59,810
And that means maybe you can stave it 
off,

2249
02:00:59,811 --> 02:01:03,230
but it also means that maybe even if you
don't stave it off,

2250
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:08,530
you could ride it out.
And that's actually the story of Noah 

2251
02:01:08,530 --> 02:01:12,460
because what happens with Noah is that 
he can see that things are not good and 

2252
02:01:13,461 --> 02:01:17,930
that there's a flood coming and God is 
maybe letting him know.

2253
02:01:18,110 --> 02:01:20,600
And it says in the story that Noah 
walked with God,

2254
02:01:20,601 --> 02:01:25,601
remembering that's what Adam did before 
he got all self conscious about the 

2255
02:01:25,601 --> 02:01:25,601
whole thing.
He walked with God.

2256
02:01:25,601 --> 02:01:29,980
We'll talk about that more next time,
but what that would mean maybe is 

2257
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:33,011
because Noah was straight and he put 
himself together and his familial 

2258
02:01:33,321 --> 02:01:38,321
relationships were good because it also 
says that that his antenna were working 

2259
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:40,070
and he could see little farther into

2260
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,370
the future than someone whose vision was
completely obscured by,

2261
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:48,670
by fog and chaos.
And he could tell that things were not 

2262
02:01:48,771 --> 02:01:53,180
going to go well.
And so he prepared for it and because he

2263
02:01:53,181 --> 02:01:57,920
prepared for it well then things that 
actually went pretty well for Noah,

2264
02:01:58,220 --> 02:02:03,220
even though the flood came.
And so that's an interesting thing 

2265
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:06,191
because that's an.
That's an indeterminant issue in human 

2266
02:02:06,191 --> 02:02:10,661
existence.
How big a hurricane would it take to 

2267
02:02:10,661 --> 02:02:10,840
wipe out New Orleans if everyone was 
prepared?

2268
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:12,140
Well,
the,

2269
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:15,020
you're not going to wipe out the Dutch.
I mean that's going to be a tough one,

2270
02:02:15,021 --> 02:02:20,021
man.
You're going to have to conjure up a 

2271
02:02:20,021 --> 02:02:20,021
pretty damn big storm to take out their 
dykes.

2272
02:02:20,021 --> 02:02:24,820
Well,
how thoroughly defendant could New 

2273
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:28,930
Orleans be if nobody in the municipal 
municipal and state governments was 

2274
02:02:28,930 --> 02:02:31,100
corrupt?
Well,

2275
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:36,190
end of the hurricane problem because 
that's something that we could clearly 

2276
02:02:36,190 --> 02:02:36,190
deal with.

2277
02:02:36,190 --> 02:02:39,280
We know how to do it and the same 
applies in your own life is that there 

2278
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,000
are floods come and you can bloody well 
be sure of that.

2279
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:45,290
That's absolutely 100 percent certain.
Some of them are going to be personal,

2280
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:50,291
some of them are going to be familial,
some of them are going to be social and 

2281
02:02:50,291 --> 02:02:50,570
political and economic.
It's like,

2282
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:53,090
are they going to be catastrophes for 
you?

2283
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:56,450
Or going to ride them out.
Are you going to prepare?

2284
02:02:56,700 --> 02:02:57,890
Well,
the first issue might be,

2285
02:02:57,891 --> 02:03:02,891
well,
do you have your act together well 

2286
02:03:02,891 --> 02:03:04,481
enough to see them coming with enough 
advanced warning so that you can take 

2287
02:03:04,481 --> 02:03:05,930
proper measures.
Maybe just decide step it,

2288
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:08,510
maybe just don't go where the flood is 
going to be.

2289
02:03:08,511 --> 02:03:11,300
That's a simple thing,
but maybe you don't have that luxury.

2290
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:14,630
Right?
And so it is going to be a catastrophe.

2291
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:17,150
Maybe someone in your family is gonna 
get really,

2292
02:03:17,151 --> 02:03:19,310
really sick.
Right?

2293
02:03:19,311 --> 02:03:23,390
And maybe maybe there's just a tiny 
pathway through that,

2294
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:26,900
that everything doesn't fall apart.
It doesn't end in divorce,

2295
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,450
it doesn't end in death,
it doesn't end in sorrow,

2296
02:03:29,451 --> 02:03:34,451
doesn't end in catastrophe,
but the margin of error is slim down to 

2297
02:03:34,451 --> 02:03:38,021
virtually zero in every imperfection 
that you bring to that situation is 

2298
02:03:38,021 --> 02:03:42,791
going to increase the probability that 
that tragedy is going to turn it into 

2299
02:03:42,791 --> 02:03:44,420
something indistinguishable from hell.
And that's coming.

2300
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:47,720
It's coming your way.
Absolutely certainly.

2301
02:03:48,290 --> 02:03:49,550
And so then you might think,
well,

2302
02:03:49,551 --> 02:03:54,551
since it's coming your way,
maybe the best thing to do is to put 

2303
02:03:54,551 --> 02:03:57,551
yourself together so that when it comes,
it can be the least amount of awful 

2304
02:03:57,551 --> 02:03:59,900
possible.
So I'll close with this story.

2305
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:05,620
This was a very affecting story for me.
My mother in law had frontal temporal 

2306
02:04:08,721 --> 02:04:10,610
dementia and she developed it quite 
young.

2307
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:13,250
She was about 55,
something like that.

2308
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:16,790
And her husband,
who is very extroverted,

2309
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:19,760
man about town guy,
I grew up in a small town,

2310
02:04:19,761 --> 02:04:22,730
everybody knew him.
He was charismatic,

2311
02:04:23,150 --> 02:04:26,960
drank too much charismatic,
good businessmen.

2312
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:30,200
Quite a remarkable person,
a real character,

2313
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:34,040
but not exactly a family man.
Even though he,

2314
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:36,800
he,
he provided for his family very,

2315
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:38,010
but when

2316
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:40,710
his wife got sick,
he really took care of her man.

2317
02:04:40,990 --> 02:04:43,800
He was something to see because that's 
no joke.

2318
02:04:44,070 --> 02:04:49,070
Dealing with someone who has Alzheimer's
for all intents and purposes because 

2319
02:04:49,070 --> 02:04:52,050
they get taken away from you piece by 
piece and that is not pretty.

2320
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:54,630
And then it's also hard,
right?

2321
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:57,750
Not only is it catastrophic,
but it's hard and Jesus,

2322
02:04:57,751 --> 02:05:02,751
he just stepped into that like perfectly
and it was way less awful than it could 

2323
02:05:05,191 --> 02:05:08,190
have been way.
It was just a tragedy.

2324
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:13,610
It wasn't hell.
And then I was there when she died and 

2325
02:05:14,970 --> 02:05:19,320
my wife's family are actually pretty 
good at dealing with death.

2326
02:05:19,350 --> 02:05:24,350
As it turns out,
my wife's sister is a palliative care 

2327
02:05:24,350 --> 02:05:26,130
nurse and you have to be a pretty tough 
cookie to be a palliative care nurse,

2328
02:05:26,131 --> 02:05:28,500
but you can do it,
which is pretty interesting because that

2329
02:05:28,501 --> 02:05:33,501
means that you can go make relationships
with people at the last stages of their 

2330
02:05:33,501 --> 02:05:37,350
life that are genuine relationships and 
people just die on you nonstop.

2331
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:38,820
And yet,
you know,

2332
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:44,720
she's a competent,
alive,

2333
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:46,800
alert,
fun person.

2334
02:05:46,910 --> 02:05:51,910
So like two thumbs up for her man,
that's someone you can rely on and in 

2335
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:55,930
tragedy and her other sister is a 
pharmacist and my wife has volunteered 

2336
02:05:57,631 --> 02:06:02,631
in palliative care wards and is also 
very good at taking care of people who 

2337
02:06:02,631 --> 02:06:05,751
are genuinely not in good health.
And so we were there when my mother in 

2338
02:06:07,021 --> 02:06:12,021
law died.
And of course you can imagine here's a,

2339
02:06:12,211 --> 02:06:17,211
here's a deathbed situation for you.
Your mother in law is dying and 

2340
02:06:17,211 --> 02:06:20,160
everyone's at each other's throats.
So like you think that's uncommon.

2341
02:06:20,161 --> 02:06:25,161
Then your eyes aren't open because it's 
plenty bloody comment and then it's not 

2342
02:06:25,161 --> 02:06:25,860
just a tragedy,
it's hell.

2343
02:06:26,190 --> 02:06:30,150
And like maybe you can stand the tragedy
but you can't stand the hell.

2344
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:35,600
And in this situation that isn't what 
happened is everybody pulled together 

2345
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:39,620
and what happened was while she died,
but what was so interesting was the 

2346
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:44,451
family,
he actually came together more tightly 

2347
02:06:44,451 --> 02:06:44,451
as a consequences.

2348
02:06:44,451 --> 02:06:45,600
So although there is something taken 
away,

2349
02:06:45,601 --> 02:06:49,080
on the one hand there was something 
gained on the other that wasn't trivial.

2350
02:06:49,081 --> 02:06:52,350
And I'm not trying to be optimistic and 
you know,

2351
02:06:52,351 --> 02:06:54,930
isn't the universe a wonderful place 
about all this,

2352
02:06:54,931 --> 02:06:57,870
like someone died and in an ugly way and
it and it,

2353
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:00,660
and it was harsh,
but God,

2354
02:07:00,661 --> 02:07:02,490
it was a hell of a lot better than it 
could have been.

2355
02:07:02,491 --> 02:07:04,530
And maybe it was good enough.
That's the thing,

2356
02:07:04,531 --> 02:07:09,531
you know as that,
this is something that I constantly 

2357
02:07:09,531 --> 02:07:11,991
wonder,
is that if people did what they could to

2358
02:07:12,121 --> 02:07:17,121
speak the truth and pay attention,
then maybe the tragedy that's part of 

2359
02:07:17,971 --> 02:07:22,971
life wouldn't have to deteriorate into 
the unbearable hell that doesn't have to

2360
02:07:23,641 --> 02:07:26,610
be part of life.
And maybe we could actually tolerate the

2361
02:07:26,611 --> 02:07:31,611
tragedy or maybe we could even rise 
above it and maybe we could even 

2362
02:07:31,611 --> 02:07:31,611
mitigate it,
you know,

2363
02:07:31,611 --> 02:07:33,060
because we can,
we do that sort of thing all the time.

2364
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:35,160
And so it's always an open question

2365
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:41,010
in the Iliad and put it very well.
Are the floods the consequence of the 

2366
02:07:41,471 --> 02:07:46,471
fact that things fall apart?
Or are the floods that consequence of 

2367
02:07:46,471 --> 02:07:50,191
the fact that people make mistakes that 
they know they shouldn't make and make 

2368
02:07:51,790 --> 02:07:53,770
anyways they sin?
Right?

2369
02:07:53,771 --> 02:07:55,360
And that's to miss the mark,
right?

2370
02:07:55,361 --> 02:07:57,070
Because that's an archery term to sit 
in.

2371
02:07:57,071 --> 02:07:59,980
That means maybe they don't even specify
the damn target,

2372
02:08:00,010 --> 02:08:05,010
which is really,
you're not going to hit it unless you 

2373
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:06,670
specified or having specified.
They just say,

2374
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:08,560
Oh,
to hell with it.

2375
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:13,800
It's not that important.
It's like you gotta be careful when you 

2376
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:16,801
say something like to hell with it.
It's not that important because one of 

2377
02:08:16,801 --> 02:08:18,700
the things that might happen to you if 
you say to hell with it,

2378
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:24,240
it's not that important,
is that you might actually end up in 

2379
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:26,851
hell for a pretty prolonged period of 
time or maybe for the remainder of your 

2380
02:08:27,911 --> 02:08:29,110
miserable existence.

2381
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:32,950
Because it's certainly the case that 
people do exist there and I've seen them

2382
02:08:32,951 --> 02:08:35,770
exists there and once you're there,
it's no trick.

2383
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:38,080
It's no simple matter to get the hell 
out.

2384
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:42,670
And so it might matter that the things 
that matter get addressed.

2385
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,510
It might matter that you do what you can
to walk with God.

2386
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:49,690
Like I said,
we'll talk more about that next time and

2387
02:08:49,691 --> 02:08:54,691
it might be that that is how you build 
an Ark and are protected from the flood 

2388
02:08:54,691 --> 02:08:58,510
even if the damn thing comes.
And the thing is,

2389
02:08:58,511 --> 02:09:00,970
it will,
and this is a funny thing too,

2390
02:09:00,971 --> 02:09:05,971
that I've noticed about our education 
system and the way we teach students and

2391
02:09:06,731 --> 02:09:10,150
their trigger warnings and all of that 
absolute rubbish.

2392
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:15,570
I think in most of my lectures I'd have 
to have a trigger warning every 15 

2393
02:09:15,570 --> 02:09:17,330
seconds.
So I was like,

2394
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:19,150
tell my students when they're young,
it's like,

2395
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:20,740
look,
don't fool yourself.

2396
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:24,940
You know you're going to develop a 
serious illness.

2397
02:09:25,330 --> 02:09:30,330
At least one,
maybe two or three and one of them is 

2398
02:09:30,330 --> 02:09:30,730
likely to be chronic and if it isn't 
you,

2399
02:09:30,731 --> 02:09:33,100
it's going to be someone you love.
It's going to be your husband,

2400
02:09:33,101 --> 02:09:36,520
it's going to be your parent,
it's going to be your kids that's coming

2401
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:42,180
and so as a lot of death and pain and so
like just exactly what sort of person 

2402
02:09:43,001 --> 02:09:46,330
are you going to be when that shows up 
and that's the right question.

2403
02:09:46,690 --> 02:09:49,720
It isn't how are you going to be happy 
in your life?

2404
02:09:49,860 --> 02:09:51,250
It's like,
good luck with that.

2405
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:54,340
It's a stupid ambition anyways,
as far as I'm concerned because it's too

2406
02:09:54,341 --> 02:09:56,080
shallow,
you know happiness.

2407
02:09:56,081 --> 02:10:01,081
You're lucky that comes,
comes and goes like the sun coming out 

2408
02:10:01,081 --> 02:10:01,450
from behind the cloud.
If you're happy,

2409
02:10:01,451 --> 02:10:02,980
man,
more power to you.

2410
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:04,750
Enjoy it,
enjoy it.

2411
02:10:04,751 --> 02:10:07,660
It's a.
it's a gift from the cosmos to be happy,

2412
02:10:08,050 --> 02:10:09,900
but at pursuit.
No,

2413
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:13,240
no.
The pursuit is when the dam flood comes,

2414
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:19,200
you want to be the person who built arc 
and that's what the story of Noah is 

2415
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:21,640
about and the thing is the flood is 
always coming.

2416
02:10:21,870 --> 02:10:25,510
That's another thing that's worth 
commenting on with regards to this story

2417
02:10:25,511 --> 02:10:30,511
is you know,
there's an apocalyptic element to the 

2418
02:10:30,511 --> 02:10:30,511
Judeo Christian tradition.

2419
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:37,140
There's an idea that the end of the 
world is always at hand and that you 

2420
02:10:37,611 --> 02:10:42,611
should prepare to be judged.
And the thing about that is it's true 

2421
02:10:42,611 --> 02:10:46,720
and the reason that's true is because 
the end of your world is at hand and it 

2422
02:10:47,601 --> 02:10:52,601
will certainly come and when it comes 
you will be judged because it will be up

2423
02:10:53,601 --> 02:10:56,990
to you to figure out what to do with the
fact that your world just collapsed.

2424
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:02,210
And that'll be a moral problem of 
ultimate severity because it'll push you

2425
02:11:02,211 --> 02:11:07,211
right to your limits and you'll find out
exactly where your unaddressed 

2426
02:11:07,211 --> 02:11:10,580
weaknesses lie because that's what 
happens in a crisis.

2427
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:15,880
And so the reason that that's an 
archetypal reality and it looks 

2428
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:16,550
underneath the entire Judaeo Christian 
structure,

2429
02:11:16,551 --> 02:11:18,470
the apocalypse,
the impending apocalypse,

2430
02:11:18,471 --> 02:11:23,471
is because we always live in apocalyptic
times and your world is always in small 

2431
02:11:24,291 --> 02:11:27,950
ways and large ways coming to an end.
And so what do you do?

2432
02:11:28,490 --> 02:11:33,020
You prepare for it,
you prepare for your world to come to an

2433
02:11:33,021 --> 02:11:36,560
end and then maybe when the end comes,
you get another world.

2434
02:11:36,770 --> 02:11:41,770
That'd be a good deal.
So we're ready for this next week.

2435
02:11:48,010 --> 02:11:53,010
Thank you.

2436
02:11:55,470 --> 02:12:00,470
My question was regarding the online 
university you plan to create and the 

2437
02:12:00,470 --> 02:12:01,610
plans you have for that.
My uh,

2438
02:12:01,710 --> 02:12:03,480
we've spoke briefly last week and I want
to ask you,

2439
02:12:03,481 --> 02:12:06,180
how can a student such as myself get 
involved with this process?

2440
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:11,390
Yeah.
Well,

2441
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:16,090
an online university that's perhaps a 
grandiose ambition,

2442
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:18,410
right?
But one of the things that,

2443
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:21,140
so here's my,
here's my rationale.

2444
02:12:23,230 --> 02:12:28,230
You know,
lots of things have dramatically 

2445
02:12:28,230 --> 02:12:29,290
transformed in the last 20 years and 
whole swaths of

2446
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:36,100
enterprise has been wiped out and that's
happening in a more and more rapid rate 

2447
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:39,410
as our technology progresses right now,
newspapers are in the process of dying.

2448
02:12:39,580 --> 02:12:42,020
I actually think they're in the process 
of committing suicide,

2449
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:47,080
but they're in the process of dying and 
that's going to happen very rapidly.

2450
02:12:47,841 --> 02:12:52,841
I think the globe and Mail lost 10 
percent of its readership in the last 

2451
02:12:52,841 --> 02:12:52,841
three months,
something like that.

2452
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:57,970
And so what happens is that new 
technologies come along to supplant the 

2453
02:12:58,671 --> 02:13:03,671
old technologies.
And I've watched a number of businesses 

2454
02:13:03,671 --> 02:13:03,770
fail,
some large businesses.

2455
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:09,880
I knew some people who worked at digital
equipment corporation when it was 

2456
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:12,671
failing and I've had some inside track 
into failing businesses and I see when 

2457
02:13:12,671 --> 02:13:17,111
they start to fail,
they tend to failure process tends to 

2458
02:13:17,111 --> 02:13:19,991
tip and then accelerate.
It can happen unbelievably quickly and 

2459
02:13:19,991 --> 02:13:23,291
this is what it looks to me.
This is how it looks to me in 

2460
02:13:23,291 --> 02:13:25,020
relationship to the universities,
especially in the US,

2461
02:13:25,070 --> 02:13:27,920
although not only,
especially in humanities,

2462
02:13:27,950 --> 02:13:28,880
although not only

2463
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,070
so number

2464
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:37,070
one,
so I've recorded three years of my 

2465
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:43,500
personality lecture say,
so let's have three years of lectures on

2466
02:13:43,501 --> 02:13:46,860
Freud now.
What I should do with those,

2467
02:13:46,861 --> 02:13:51,861
I think his Eq,
edit them into one really good lecture 

2468
02:13:51,861 --> 02:13:54,891
on Freud and then stop giving that 
lecture because why would I give that 

2469
02:13:54,891 --> 02:13:55,560
lecture again because I've already given
it an edited.

2470
02:13:55,580 --> 02:13:58,230
It's in good shape,
and if it's a really good lecture,

2471
02:13:58,231 --> 02:14:00,300
then why does someone else have to give 
the lecture?

2472
02:14:00,301 --> 02:14:05,301
Why does 300 other people have to give a
lecture on Freud and you know what I 

2473
02:14:05,301 --> 02:14:08,871
mean?
What's going to happen is there's gonna 

2474
02:14:08,871 --> 02:14:10,401
be some really good lectures on subjects
and that's all that people are going to 

2475
02:14:10,401 --> 02:14:14,991
need or want because the Internet tends 
to move things towards winner take all 

2476
02:14:14,991 --> 02:14:19,971
very,
very rapidly and so it seems to me that 

2477
02:14:19,971 --> 02:14:24,530
we're already at a point technologically
where we could identify 100 things that 

2478
02:14:24,601 --> 02:14:29,601
people really need to know and do a 
sequence of lectures on those things 

2479
02:14:29,601 --> 02:14:32,940
that were outstanding and then they can 
be updated and attitude,

2480
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:36,270
but then it's like it's a done game and 
it's free.

2481
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:41,930
So I know it started thinking about this
last year when I noticed that my 

2482
02:14:41,930 --> 02:14:44,370
psychology lectures had a million views 
and that was last April and I thought,

2483
02:14:44,371 --> 02:14:45,900
that's amazing.
A million views.

2484
02:14:45,930 --> 02:14:47,280
It's like,
what the hell that's,

2485
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:50,270
I don't know what to make of that.
That's not the best set.

2486
02:14:50,310 --> 02:14:52,740
That's the kind of best selling book 
that you never right,

2487
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:54,810
because no one ever writes a bestselling
book,

2488
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:57,780
so a million views.
That's something to pay attention to and

2489
02:14:57,781 --> 02:15:01,920
now it's way more than that,
but there's videos and podcasts and that

2490
02:15:01,921 --> 02:15:06,921
means that people can listen when 
they're doing other things too and so 

2491
02:15:06,921 --> 02:15:08,010
that's really cool and maybe people can 
listen better than they can read.

2492
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:11,820
That's a real possibility because we've 
only been reneged silently for about,

2493
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:17,270
well,
most of like most of humanity for less 

2494
02:15:17,270 --> 02:15:19,200
than a hundred years and virtually no 
one could read silently 500 years ago,

2495
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:24,500
so really new skill and so maybe we're 
better at listening and so all of a 

2496
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:28,641
sudden there's the possibility of 
disseminating high quality educational 

2497
02:15:28,641 --> 02:15:29,880
material,
highly produced,

2498
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:35,250
highly vetted to millions of people for 
nothing.

2499
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:38,070
Well,
how are you going to compete with that?

2500
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:43,130
Then?
Then it's worse because the humanities 

2501
02:15:43,130 --> 02:15:44,880
which have become completely 
degenerated,

2502
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:46,260
almost completed,
degenerate,

2503
02:15:46,261 --> 02:15:51,261
in my estimation,
have abandoned their valuable 

2504
02:15:51,261 --> 02:15:52,350
intellectual property,
which is the collective wisdom,

2505
02:15:52,620 --> 02:15:56,190
at least for the west of of Western 
civilization just sitting there.

2506
02:15:56,250 --> 02:16:01,250
Someone might as well steal it back and 
then there's the student loan debt cycle

2507
02:16:01,831 --> 02:16:04,470
in the United States,
if that's pronounced properly,

2508
02:16:04,471 --> 02:16:07,310
tobacco,
tobacco,

2509
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:12,370
okay.
Obviously I've read that word more than 

2510
02:16:12,370 --> 02:16:12,660
set it and so you know,
and so,

2511
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:18,080
you know,
I had a guy write me today and he asked 

2512
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:18,080
if he should go to a private college for
$22,000

2513
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:23,061
a year to produce produce to pursue an 
undergraduate in psychology so that he 

2514
02:16:23,101 --> 02:16:26,640
could he get into clinical graduate 
school or go to another university,

2515
02:16:26,641 --> 02:16:31,641
the State University for far less.
I told him to go the state university 

2516
02:16:31,641 --> 02:16:32,530
because it's the wise economic decision,
but you know,

2517
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:35,890
it doesn't seem to me that it's 
reasonable at all to load people up when

2518
02:16:35,891 --> 02:16:39,850
they're 22 with $100,000
of student debt that they cannot declare

2519
02:16:39,851 --> 02:16:44,851
bankruptcy for its indentured servitude 
and there and to load up people when 

2520
02:16:45,761 --> 02:16:48,430
they're 22 or 23 with debt of that 
magnitude.

2521
02:16:48,430 --> 02:16:53,430
It's like,
well how the hell are they going to be 

2522
02:16:53,430 --> 02:16:55,171
entrepreneurs?
How are you going to take a risk with 

2523
02:16:55,171 --> 02:16:55,270
$100,000
debt load and who's going to marry you?

2524
02:16:56,010 --> 02:16:57,440
Well really Jesus,
you know,

2525
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:59,470
because another story I heard recently 
was,

2526
02:16:59,471 --> 02:17:04,090
well I just got married to my partner.
She brought into the marriage $120,000

2527
02:17:04,091 --> 02:17:05,200
in student debt.
It's like,

2528
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:08,050
oh my God.
It's like it's crippling man.

2529
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:13,260
Like once you're.
Once you're making a substantial amount 

2530
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:13,260
of money,
if you're fortunate,

2531
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:15,520
maybe you're in your forties,
you could handle a debt load like that,

2532
02:17:15,521 --> 02:17:17,500
but in your twenties it's just 
crippling.

2533
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:22,920
So you know the tuition fees of rat have
ratcheted up like mad in the last 30 

2534
02:17:23,681 --> 02:17:24,250
years.
The unit,

2535
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:27,490
the colleges and universities have 
become unbelievably administratively,

2536
02:17:27,491 --> 02:17:31,120
top heavy.
They're regulated to death by the,

2537
02:17:31,150 --> 02:17:36,150
by the legislative system.
So there's ethics committees which are 

2538
02:17:36,150 --> 02:17:36,550
so counterproductive that it's just 
unbelievable.

2539
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:41,820
There's this entire whole whole new 
monstrous hyper accommodation movement 

2540
02:17:42,510 --> 02:17:45,260
that that's that borders on.
Well,

2541
02:17:45,330 --> 02:17:47,020
I'll make a video about that soon 
enough.

2542
02:17:47,021 --> 02:17:50,650
That's absolutely pathological and 
there's this whole postmodern,

2543
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:55,760
neo Marxist idea.
See that's going on in the universities 

2544
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:55,760
and so like,
well,

2545
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:59,491
how many mistakes does an institute plus
students aren't being taught how to 

2546
02:17:59,491 --> 02:18:00,970
speak.
They're not being taught how to debate.

2547
02:18:01,090 --> 02:18:05,080
They're not being taught how to write 
and they don't read difficult things.

2548
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:07,840
They read French intellectual 
postmodernists,

2549
02:18:07,841 --> 02:18:12,841
right,
and they probably don't read those 

2550
02:18:12,841 --> 02:18:12,841
either.
They read secondarily derive.

2551
02:18:12,841 --> 02:18:17,550
They Skim secondarily derived papers 
about French intellectual postmarks.

2552
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:23,420
This postmodern is from the 19 seventies
and the standards have been lowered 

2553
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:26,680
because there's too many people pursuing
higher education and so I think,

2554
02:18:26,681 --> 02:18:31,681
okay,
there's eight dimensions of success and 

2555
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:34,810
on every single dimension there's 
failure.

2556
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:40,620
The system's done the end.
So the vision would be why not provide 

2557
02:18:40,991 --> 02:18:45,991
everybody in the world with high quality
education in the humanities for like one

2558
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:46,720
50th.

2559
02:18:46,730 --> 02:18:49,750
The cost you can charge for 
accreditation.

2560
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:51,460
That's a whole separate issue,
right?

2561
02:18:51,461 --> 02:18:54,580
Accreditation,
but the but the resources,

2562
02:18:54,581 --> 02:18:56,380
it's like why not make them available to
everyone?

2563
02:18:57,610 --> 02:19:02,610
So that's the plan.
I mean I don't know if I can do it or 

2564
02:19:02,610 --> 02:19:05,251
not,
but it's partly what I'm doing with his 

2565
02:19:05,251 --> 02:19:07,231
biblical lecture series.
It's sort of putting my toe in the 

2566
02:19:07,231 --> 02:19:10,171
water,
but I have a plan and I have some good 

2567
02:19:10,171 --> 02:19:13,861
programmers who are willing to help and 
there's lots of people out there that 

2568
02:19:13,861 --> 02:19:13,861
would help.
God.

2569
02:19:13,861 --> 02:19:17,170
I'm being flooded with offers of help.
I'd love to take people up on the 

2570
02:19:17,170 --> 02:19:18,310
offers,
but it's not that easy to get someone to

2571
02:19:18,311 --> 02:19:19,460
help you do something,
you know,

2572
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:23,280
so that'd be the plan.
It's like,

2573
02:19:23,290 --> 02:19:28,290
so what would the plan be?
Give people a high quality education in 

2574
02:19:28,290 --> 02:19:31,990
the classic humanities,
teach them how to speak and write a 

2575
02:19:31,990 --> 02:19:35,251
credit them for one 10th the current 
cost and do it with millions of people 

2576
02:19:35,251 --> 02:19:40,121
instead of tens of thousands of asking 
what plans do you have for the 

2577
02:19:40,121 --> 02:19:44,171
accreditation side where people can show
something for what the time they spend 

2578
02:19:44,171 --> 02:19:44,171
watching?

2579
02:19:44,171 --> 02:19:47,680
Well,
one of the things that I would do for 

2580
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:47,720
example,
is imagine that you were in a course and

2581
02:19:47,721 --> 02:19:52,721
so you have taken exam.
Let's say it's a multiple choice exam 

2582
02:19:52,721 --> 02:19:53,810
just for the sake of argument because 
they're simpler.

2583
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:57,530
The writing issue is a separate problem.
Well,

2584
02:19:57,531 --> 02:20:02,531
so one of the things that you would do 
if you enrolled in the courses generate 

2585
02:20:02,531 --> 02:20:04,940
multiple choice questions.
That'd be one of your assignments.

2586
02:20:05,420 --> 02:20:07,850
Here's a lecture,
generate 10 multiple choice questions.

2587
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:11,300
Now you've got a thousand people 
generating 10 multiple choice questions.

2588
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:16,600
Well then you can do.
There are statistical procedures that 

2589
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:19,121
help you figure out what valid multiple 
choice questions are.

2590
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:22,310
You could have people vote on them for 
that matter if we put them on a website,

2591
02:20:22,370 --> 02:20:25,250
assignment number two,
here's 100 multiple choice questions.

2592
02:20:25,460 --> 02:20:30,460
Pick the 10 that you think are most 
representative of the knowledge that 

2593
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:30,470
you've acquired.

2594
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:35,800
Get 100 people to do that so you get 
crowdsource the test construction and 

2595
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:40,091
then you could keep making the test 
better and better as well because you 

2596
02:20:40,091 --> 02:20:42,851
could build that.
I'd like to build the system so that it 

2597
02:20:42,851 --> 02:20:44,891
was self improving with a minimum of 
administrative interference and so then 

2598
02:20:46,011 --> 02:20:48,620
what would happen is that as you got 
accredited,

2599
02:20:48,621 --> 02:20:51,410
so you start reading exams and maybe 
write more and more of them.

2600
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:56,680
Then you'd start to by voting power with
regards to the content of the courses 

2601
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:58,760
and maybe even the right to produce 
courses to put them up online.

2602
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:00,580
So something like that.
But our,

2603
02:21:00,581 --> 02:21:05,581
our strategy would be to build.
We want to build a system that's 

2604
02:21:05,581 --> 02:21:08,150
basically autonomous and self improving 
right from the beginning.

2605
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:12,560
So minimum of administrative overhead,
extremely low cost,

2606
02:21:13,010 --> 02:21:18,010
widespread availability,
crowdsourced and its structure and an 

2607
02:21:18,621 --> 02:21:21,830
autonomous self improving.
I think we can do that.

2608
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:26,480
I don't know if I can do it,
but I think we have the technology to do

2609
02:21:26,481 --> 02:21:27,800
that.
And then you think,

2610
02:21:27,801 --> 02:21:29,810
well,
so here's the plan,

2611
02:21:29,811 --> 02:21:30,450
you know,
because you're,

2612
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:32,360
I'm always thinking of the point,
point b,

2613
02:21:32,490 --> 02:21:34,880
what's a good thing to do with life?
While the good,

2614
02:21:34,910 --> 02:21:39,910
good thing to do with your life is the 
most difficult God damned thing you can 

2615
02:21:39,910 --> 02:21:40,340
think of that would do the most possible
good.

2616
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:43,760
That'll get you up in the morning.
And so because you think,

2617
02:21:43,761 --> 02:21:45,530
why should I get up in the morning?
So like,

2618
02:21:45,531 --> 02:21:46,550
well,
you know,

2619
02:21:46,610 --> 02:21:49,070
I've got $50 million people to educate.
Hey,

2620
02:21:49,071 --> 02:21:51,560
that'll do it.
Really,

2621
02:21:51,561 --> 02:21:56,561
you know that,
that battle that'll overcome a lot of 

2622
02:21:56,561 --> 02:21:57,980
anx,
that sort of thinking so well.

2623
02:21:57,981 --> 02:22:02,981
So it seems to me that,
it seems to me that it's inevitable now 

2624
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:07,310
whether or not I can do it,
that's a whole different story,

2625
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:10,370
but I can certainly start it and I'm 
going to start it.

2626
02:22:10,370 --> 02:22:11,800
My partner,
my business partner,

2627
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:15,440
the guy who helped me develop the self 
authoring program,

2628
02:22:15,441 --> 02:22:19,480
which thousands of people are using that
now and we've helped thousands,

2629
02:22:19,490 --> 02:22:22,130
tens of thousands of students now stay 
in university.

2630
02:22:22,131 --> 02:22:25,010
So that's really cool.
Well maybe not given the state of the.

2631
02:22:26,770 --> 02:22:29,790
I'm contributing to the problem,
but you know,

2632
02:22:30,440 --> 02:22:32,970
but they're,
but they're sticking out their plans.

2633
02:22:32,971 --> 02:22:37,971
That's the point.
They're actually making plans and 

2634
02:22:37,971 --> 02:22:37,971
sticking them out.
So.

2635
02:22:37,971 --> 02:22:42,620
So I think that we can and we know how 
to start small with the way to build a 

2636
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:44,910
big system is to build a small system 
that works and then scale it.

2637
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:49,040
And so that's.
I've been talking with my partner,

2638
02:22:49,041 --> 02:22:50,320
his name is Daniel Higgins.
Uh,

2639
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:55,400
I have another partner,
Bob Peele who used to be my graduate 

2640
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:58,011
supervisor at mcgill and we'd been 
working on this sort of thing for about 

2641
02:22:58,011 --> 02:23:01,230
25 years and our goal has been right 
from the beginning to build low cost,

2642
02:23:01,231 --> 02:23:04,630
high quality psychoeducational 
interventions and bring them to his wife

2643
02:23:04,631 --> 02:23:06,990
Deb market as possible.
So,

2644
02:23:07,330 --> 02:23:10,920
and my Daniel in particular is devoted 
most of his life to doing that.

2645
02:23:10,921 --> 02:23:13,140
It's been about 20 years now,
so,

2646
02:23:14,810 --> 02:23:17,990
so while that's a sketch of it all,
outline more of it on,

2647
02:23:18,030 --> 02:23:19,720
on the web at some point,
but that's kind of what,

2648
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:22,340
what we've been deciding what we've been
planning to do.

2649
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:23,420
Alright.
Thank you very much.

2650
02:23:23,421 --> 02:23:23,890
Yep.

2651
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:29,520
Thank you.

2652
02:23:29,980 --> 02:23:32,860
When you were on the Rubin report not 
too long ago,

2653
02:23:32,861 --> 02:23:37,861
uh,
in that discussion you mentioned how a 

2654
02:23:37,861 --> 02:23:39,780
use of psilocybin straightened out and,
uh,

2655
02:23:39,850 --> 02:23:44,850
can produce these transcendent 
experiences which is jarring for a 

2656
02:23:44,850 --> 02:23:48,511
person who may have traditionally,
which for someone who became a Christian

2657
02:23:49,901 --> 02:23:54,901
as a result of their only time doing 
magic mushrooms as jarring piece of 

2658
02:23:54,901 --> 02:23:55,300
information,
I was just wondering if you could expand

2659
02:23:55,301 --> 02:24:00,301
on what you find intriguing about 
religious experience and what we can 

2660
02:24:00,301 --> 02:24:01,210
know about the transcendent from them.
If anything,

2661
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:08,010
that's a tough one,
man.

2662
02:24:14,450 --> 02:24:17,870
The relationship between entheogenic 
use,

2663
02:24:17,871 --> 02:24:22,871
let's say,
which is sometimes what those chemicals 

2664
02:24:22,871 --> 02:24:25,610
are described and religious experiences 
unspecified,

2665
02:24:26,060 --> 02:24:31,060
but it looks like it's profound.
There was a man named Gordon West Saul 

2666
02:24:31,060 --> 02:24:33,650
who wrote a book for,
I remember correctly called Soma.

2667
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:39,190
He was investigating the potential use 
of emoney to miscarrying mushrooms among

2668
02:24:40,401 --> 02:24:45,080
the people who wrote the Hindu holy 
scriptures thousands of years ago,

2669
02:24:45,081 --> 02:24:50,081
and he felt that he identified the 
chemical that they were using the sacred

2670
02:24:50,241 --> 02:24:51,620
drink.
Um,

2671
02:24:52,070 --> 02:24:57,070
the use of Iowasca and psilocybin 
mushrooms and so forth as well document,

2672
02:24:58,610 --> 02:25:01,580
particularly in North America and the 
evidence,

2673
02:25:01,581 --> 02:25:06,581
the empirical evidence that under 
certain conditions those chemicals can 

2674
02:25:06,581 --> 02:25:08,180
produce religious experiences is 
absolutely overwhelming.

2675
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:13,550
There's been good research done recently
at Johns Hopkins looking at Psilocybin,

2676
02:25:13,551 --> 02:25:18,551
the first research that's been done on 
hallucinogens really in 30 years because

2677
02:25:19,550 --> 02:25:22,580
people were so terrified of them in the 
sixties and for good reason.

2678
02:25:23,230 --> 02:25:28,230
I'm indicated that the people that they 
dosed with Psilocybin,

2679
02:25:28,251 --> 02:25:32,200
about 75 percent of them had a mystical 
experience which they regarded as one of

2680
02:25:32,201 --> 02:25:35,590
the five,
three to five most important experiences

2681
02:25:35,591 --> 02:25:40,591
of their life.
And a year later we're characterized by 

2682
02:25:40,591 --> 02:25:45,031
permanent personality transformation,
which was an increase in trade openness 

2683
02:25:45,031 --> 02:25:46,630
of one standard deviation,
which is a lot by the way.

2684
02:25:46,631 --> 02:25:49,510
It moves you from 50th percentile,
the 85th percentile,

2685
02:25:49,870 --> 02:25:50,600
for example.
It's a,

2686
02:25:50,650 --> 02:25:55,650
it's a huge move.
And that look permanent now whether or 

2687
02:25:55,650 --> 02:25:55,900
not that's a good thing,
that's a whole different issue,

2688
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:57,820
but they're very,
very powerful.

2689
02:25:57,850 --> 02:26:02,850
And they also did some recent research 
showing that psilocybin mushrooms were 

2690
02:26:02,850 --> 02:26:07,000
an unbelievably effective smoking 
cessation intervention.

2691
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:12,120
So if I remember correctly,
and I may have this wrong because it's 

2692
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:13,870
been a while since I read it,
they had an 80 percent success rate in,

2693
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:18,900
in stopping people from using a tobacco 
with one silicide been experience and so

2694
02:26:21,130 --> 02:26:22,780
well.
So those things are very,

2695
02:26:22,990 --> 02:26:26,350
all of that's very interesting to me and
I don't exactly know what to make of it.

2696
02:26:26,540 --> 02:26:29,290
I don't know what to make of it at all.
Not even a little bit,

2697
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:30,580
but um,

2698
02:26:32,900 --> 02:26:37,900
but the evidence for the relationship 
between met mystical experiences and 

2699
02:26:39,050 --> 02:26:42,140
hallucinogen use of certain types is 
incontrovertible.

2700
02:26:42,141 --> 02:26:47,141
And I don't.
And I don't think anybody else knows 

2701
02:26:47,141 --> 02:26:47,150
what to derive from that.
I mean,

2702
02:26:47,151 --> 02:26:50,300
one conclusion is something like

2703
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:58,100
religious experiences are a common 
concomitant of going temporarily insane 

2704
02:26:59,130 --> 02:27:01,560
and that it's not a bad hypothesis 
because you see,

2705
02:27:01,561 --> 02:27:06,561
for example,
in the prodrome of illnesses like 

2706
02:27:06,561 --> 02:27:09,471
schizophrenia and sometimes manic 
depressive disorder two on the 

2707
02:27:09,471 --> 02:27:12,741
mannequin,
you do see the emergence often of 

2708
02:27:12,741 --> 02:27:14,070
religious type delusions.
It's not that common,

2709
02:27:14,071 --> 02:27:17,550
but it's not uncommon,
so it's definitely the case that if your

2710
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:22,620
brain function has been detrimentally 
affected,

2711
02:27:22,830 --> 02:27:27,830
one of the consequences can be 
experiences that are subjectively 

2712
02:27:27,830 --> 02:27:29,400
experienced as indistinguishable from 
the religious.

2713
02:27:29,580 --> 02:27:33,150
You also see the same thing in cases of 
epilepsy,

2714
02:27:33,151 --> 02:27:36,240
especially in the pro Jeroma,
so if you have an epileptic condition,

2715
02:27:36,241 --> 02:27:39,120
sometimes you know that you're going to 
have a seizure.

2716
02:27:39,270 --> 02:27:44,250
You can feel it mounting and often,
or at least occasionally,

2717
02:27:44,790 --> 02:27:49,790
those experiences are associated with an
elevation of religious sensation 

2718
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:56,360
deepening meaning that increases in its 
depth and complexity until it's 

2719
02:27:57,361 --> 02:28:01,800
overwhelming and that's what 
subjectively brings on the seizure.

2720
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:06,830
Now,
God only knows how to disentangle 

2721
02:28:06,830 --> 02:28:08,790
causality in a circumstance like that.
Dostoevsky had seizures like that,

2722
02:28:08,791 --> 02:28:10,440
by the way,
so,

2723
02:28:10,830 --> 02:28:11,650
so the,
the,

2724
02:28:11,850 --> 02:28:13,680
the pessimistic viewpoint is

2725
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:18,760
religious phenomenology.
As a consequence of brain disorder,

2726
02:28:19,990 --> 02:28:24,990
the positive more positive side is no 
religious experience is a category of 

2727
02:28:29,151 --> 02:28:34,151
experienced that's within the realm of 
human possibility and there are 

2728
02:28:34,151 --> 02:28:38,651
different modes of eliciting it and we 
know that there are many modes of 

2729
02:28:38,651 --> 02:28:42,461
eliciting it.
Fasting can elicit it dancing under some

2730
02:28:45,201 --> 02:28:50,201
circumstances.
Music enlisted at music elicits that 

2731
02:28:50,201 --> 02:28:53,020
regularly.
I mean basically as far as I'm 

2732
02:28:53,020 --> 02:28:53,020
concerned,
rock concerts are indistinguishable from

2733
02:28:53,020 --> 02:28:55,310
religious rituals.
The rituals,

2734
02:28:55,311 --> 02:28:58,610
not like they don't come with a dogmatic
overlay,

2735
02:28:58,611 --> 02:29:03,611
let's say,
but the ritualistic structure is there 

2736
02:29:03,611 --> 02:29:03,611
and maybe it's there just listening to 
music.

2737
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:07,040
Um,
what that means for the investigation of

2738
02:29:07,041 --> 02:29:09,560
hallucinogens.
I have no idea.

2739
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:14,030
And I would also certainly use the 
caution that Carl,

2740
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:19,040
you've developed when he was talking 
about hallucinogens and he did that I 

2741
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:22,271
think only a very brief number of times.
And I think in relationship to Elvis 

2742
02:29:22,271 --> 02:29:24,710
Huxley's original work on Mescalin 
experiences,

2743
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:29,120
he said,
beware of wisdom that you didn't earn.

2744
02:29:29,940 --> 02:29:32,090
And that's very,
very smart.

2745
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:36,320
So I would say there is something to be 
learned about.

2746
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:41,740
There's something,
there's a lot to be learned about 

2747
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:44,441
hallucinogens.
There may be something to be learned 

2748
02:29:44,441 --> 02:29:44,441
from them,
but having said that,

2749
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:49,130
if you play with fire,
you end up burnt generally speaking.

2750
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:54,160
So I'm all do.
Caution is in effect.

2751
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:56,630
So one more,

2752
02:29:58,650 --> 02:30:00,100
I know your analysis,
Huxley Fan.

2753
02:30:00,101 --> 02:30:02,070
So I thought I'd ask you this question,
um,

2754
02:30:02,940 --> 02:30:06,780
after reading his book,
doors of perception in which he gives an

2755
02:30:06,781 --> 02:30:11,781
account of his experience taking the 
psychedelic drug Mescalin he stated that

2756
02:30:12,990 --> 02:30:16,640
in the final stages of egolessness,
there is an obscene knowledge.

2757
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:19,120
Is that all,
is in all that

2758
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:24,660
actually each.
He then went on to say that this is as 

2759
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:28,471
near I take it as a finite mind can ever
get to perceiving everything that is 

2760
02:30:28,471 --> 02:30:30,120
happening in the universe.
Uh,

2761
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:35,380
I was wondering if maybe you could 
explain what that means because I've 

2762
02:30:35,380 --> 02:30:35,380
been trying to understand it.
Yeah.

2763
02:30:42,930 --> 02:30:47,930
There is a neuroscientist a while back,
whose name I don't remember who had a 

2764
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:51,821
stroke and she being a neuroscientist,
was analyzing the neurological 

2765
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:56,360
consequences of the stroke as it 
occurred,

2766
02:30:57,020 --> 02:31:02,020
if I remember correctly,
the stroke either temporarily or 

2767
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:06,290
permanently took out the function of 
large portions of her left hemisphere.

2768
02:31:06,620 --> 02:31:11,620
And she had exactly that experience.
It was an experience of ego dissolution,

2769
02:31:12,471 --> 02:31:13,810
something like that.
The,

2770
02:31:14,350 --> 02:31:15,330
the,
the,

2771
02:31:15,410 --> 02:31:20,410
the felt sense of,
of identity shifting from that sort of 

2772
02:31:20,670 --> 02:31:25,670
narrow boundary maybe that you would 
define by the boundary of your physical 

2773
02:31:25,711 --> 02:31:30,711
being into something that was much 
broader and much like it gets,

2774
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:33,570
it gets.
It gets hard to describe this without,

2775
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:39,020
you know,
degenerating into hippie poetry from 

2776
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:39,020
1967 very,
very rapidly.

2777
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:43,500
But it's something like a,
a sense,

2778
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:47,190
a sense of,
of the underlying unity of consciousness

2779
02:31:47,191 --> 02:31:50,220
that might be one way of thinking about 
we don't know much about consciousness.

2780
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:55,580
In fact,
I don't think we know anything about 

2781
02:31:55,580 --> 02:31:56,991
consciousness and obviously 
consciousness is something that we all 

2782
02:31:56,991 --> 02:32:00,141
share,
but it's also something that we seem to 

2783
02:32:00,141 --> 02:32:03,070
also experience individually,
but maybe our individual consciousness.

2784
02:32:03,071 --> 02:32:08,071
Is there something like the 
manifestations of something that's a 

2785
02:32:08,071 --> 02:32:10,560
more unified consciousness underneath.
I mean that's hardly an original idea,

2786
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:15,920
but it does seem to be the case that 
under some circumstances there are 

2787
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:17,520
neurological transformations that make 
that

2788
02:32:18,990 --> 02:32:22,140
link more apparent.
Assuming that the link exists now,

2789
02:32:22,141 --> 02:32:22,980
you could say,
well no,

2790
02:32:22,981 --> 02:32:26,370
they're just producing a delusion,
but the funny thing about,

2791
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:32,120
you know,
the funny thing about delusions is that 

2792
02:32:32,120 --> 02:32:32,120
you've got to think,
well,

2793
02:32:32,120 --> 02:32:35,571
how do you know something's a delusion 
and the answer that has to be something 

2794
02:32:35,571 --> 02:32:35,580
like,
well,

2795
02:32:35,581 --> 02:32:38,460
hardly anyone else thinks that that 
would be criteria number one.

2796
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:42,810
Criteria number two would be if you act 
on the delusion,

2797
02:32:42,811 --> 02:32:47,370
do does your ships sink because if 
you're sick ship sinks,

2798
02:32:47,371 --> 02:32:49,560
then it was a delusion.
It's something like that.

2799
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:52,950
But if you act on your delusion and 
things get better,

2800
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:58,760
well then maybe it wasn't a delusion and
there's no evidence from the silicide 

2801
02:32:58,760 --> 02:33:01,980
been studies that have been conducted at
Johns Hopkins that there was detrimental

2802
02:33:01,981 --> 02:33:06,981
effects for the participants and the 
participants certainly don't think that 

2803
02:33:06,981 --> 02:33:07,770
the effects were detrimental.
So,

2804
02:33:07,771 --> 02:33:10,710
and I've been hesitant to talk about any
of this for obvious reasons.

2805
02:33:11,580 --> 02:33:14,070
I'll tell you something really funny.
I think it's funny.

2806
02:33:14,071 --> 02:33:19,071
Anyways,
I had timothy leary's old job at 

2807
02:33:19,071 --> 02:33:20,070
Harvard,
so you know,

2808
02:33:20,071 --> 02:33:25,071
and so larry is a good object lesson and
being very careful about this sort of 

2809
02:33:25,071 --> 02:33:25,260
thing because it certainly,

2810
02:33:29,110 --> 02:33:31,840
it isn't obvious that his net effect was
good

2811
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:36,590
and I say that with some caution because
Larry was a very smart person and he was

2812
02:33:36,591 --> 02:33:41,591
very creative,
but he got tangled up in that 

2813
02:33:41,591 --> 02:33:41,760
hallucinogenic madhouse,
you know,

2814
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:46,780
that had characterized the say the 
period from 1965 to about 1970 and it,

2815
02:33:47,031 --> 02:33:52,031
it,
it didn't seem to me that that was 

2816
02:33:52,031 --> 02:33:54,071
altogether a good thing.
Thing is we have these chemicals now in 

2817
02:33:54,071 --> 02:33:57,671
our culture and people are experimenting
with them like mad and making them 

2818
02:33:57,951 --> 02:34:02,180
illegal doesn't seem to be working in 
large part because there,

2819
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:07,240
I think there were seven known seven to 
20 known psychoactive substances that 

2820
02:34:08,001 --> 02:34:13,001
were illegal in the year 2000 and 
something like 400 now because labs all 

2821
02:34:14,331 --> 02:34:16,490
over the world keep tweaking the 
molecules,

2822
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:19,150
right?
Because molecule is illegal,

2823
02:34:19,151 --> 02:34:24,151
so chemists just shifted a little bit.
Then they have a new hallucinogen and 

2824
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:27,430
which might be fine.
It might not be because now and then you

2825
02:34:27,431 --> 02:34:30,040
can produce a chemical that's 
unbelievably dangerous.

2826
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:33,860
Fentanyl's sort of like that.
There was a drug a while back that I can

2827
02:34:33,910 --> 02:34:35,500
name,
I can't remember the name.

2828
02:34:35,930 --> 02:34:38,110
It was an acronym.
It was a fun drug.

2829
02:34:38,590 --> 02:34:40,600
If you took it once,
it gave you a permanent,

2830
02:34:40,601 --> 02:34:45,601
irreversible,
total Parkinson's disease so people 

2831
02:34:45,601 --> 02:34:47,320
would take it and they were frozen and 
that was it.

2832
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:52,680
So MPTP I think it was called so it 
because it destroyed the same area of 

2833
02:34:52,811 --> 02:34:56,590
the brain that the Parkinson's destroys,
except it did it right away.

2834
02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:57,690
So,
uh,

2835
02:34:58,110 --> 02:35:00,010
you know,
designer drugs,

2836
02:35:00,011 --> 02:35:00,400
right?

2837
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:07,220
A little caution is in order,
how we might approach the issue of 

2838
02:35:07,220 --> 02:35:10,080
hallucinogen use in a mature manner.
Well,

2839
02:35:10,081 --> 02:35:12,390
that's a topic for an entirely other 
discussion.

2840
02:35:12,420 --> 02:35:15,900
I'm not even necessarily sure that it 
can be approached that way,

2841
02:35:15,901 --> 02:35:20,901
although I would say at minimum,
determining what it is that you're up to

2842
02:35:23,121 --> 02:35:25,430
if you're going to experiment,
would be a good thing.

2843
02:35:25,490 --> 02:35:27,830
Like what is it exactly that you're 
serving?

2844
02:35:28,160 --> 02:35:31,220
They're not party drugs,
they're not for fun,

2845
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,710
right?
Whatever they are,

2846
02:35:33,770 --> 02:35:38,770
that's not what they're for.
And so maybe they could be used by 

2847
02:35:38,841 --> 02:35:42,260
people who are carefully orienting 
themselves towards the good.

2848
02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:46,850
Although I wouldn't say that that should
be read as a recommendation.

2849
02:35:48,390 --> 02:35:48,730
Thank you.

2850
02:35:50,850 --> 02:35:55,850
Thank you.
