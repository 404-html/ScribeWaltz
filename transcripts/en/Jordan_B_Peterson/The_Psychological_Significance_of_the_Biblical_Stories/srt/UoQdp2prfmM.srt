1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:02,410
Okay.

2
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,170
Hello everyone.
Thank you again for showing up.

3
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,090
So,
um,

4
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,020
tonight we're going to finish off the 
story of Noah and also the story of the 

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,460
Tower of Babel and I don't think that'll
take very long and then we're going to 

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,890
turn to the abrahamic stories.
And uh,

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,820
there are very complex set of stories.
They sit between the earliest stories in

8
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,790
genesis that I would say end with the 
Tower of Babel.

9
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:01,791
And then the stories of Moses which are 
extraordinarily well developed or the 

10
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,760
abrahamic stories.
There's a whole sequence of them,

11
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,970
multiple stories conjoined together.
And uh,

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,820
there I found them very daunting.
They're very difficult to understand and

13
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:18,240
so I'm going to stumble through them the
best that I can.

14
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:22,450
I would say that's probably the best way
to think about this because they,

15
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,290
they,
they,

16
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,640
they have a narrative content that's 
quite strange.

17
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,630
Um,
I was reading a book while doing this 

18
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,480
called the disappearance of God that I 
found quite helpful.

19
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
And the author of that book argues that 
one of the things that happens in the 

20
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:51,081
old testament is that God is very 
manifest at the beginning in terms of 

21
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:57,321
personal appearances even,
and then that proclivity fades away as 

22
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,990
the old testament develops and there's a
parallel development that it's mainly 

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,760
maybe causally linked.
I'm not exactly sure how to 

24
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:10,890
conceptualize it,
but it appears to be causally linked.

25
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:15,891
Is that the.
The stories about individuals become 

26
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,620
more and more well developed so it's as 
if it's as if as God fades away so to 

27
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:26,691
speak,
the individual becomes more and more 

28
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:29,511
manifest and there's a statement in the 
Old Testament,

29
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,820
the location of which I don't recall,
but I'll tell you about it in future 

30
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,531
lectures were God essentially tells 
whoever he's speaking with and I don't 

31
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:44,250
remember who that is,
that he's going to disappear and let man

32
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,220
essentially go his own way and see what 
happens.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Not a complete disappearance,
but maybe a transformation to something 

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,191
that modern people regard more as a 
psychological phenomena rather than the 

35
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,730
sort of objective entity that God to be 
in the beginning of the biblical 

36
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,571
stories.
And so I've been wrestling with that a 

37
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:09,511
lot because the notion that God,
God appears to Abraham Multiple Times,

38
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,910
and that's not a concept that's easy for
modern people to to grasp in.

39
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,910
For us,
generally speaking,

40
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,520
apart from say,
issues of faith.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,240
God isn't some thing.
Someone who makes himself personally 

42
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,540
manifest in our lives.
He doesn't appear to us.

43
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,580
That's I suppose,
why the question of belief is so 

44
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,041
paramount for modern people.
I presume that if God had was in the 

45
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:48,121
habit of appearing to you,
you likely wouldn't have a problem with 

46
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:49,030
belief.
I mean it might be more complicated than

47
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,470
that,
but that's how it seems to me.

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,040
And so when we read stories about God 
making himself manifest either to a 

49
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:03,151
nation,
say in the case of Israel or to 

50
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:04,270
individuals,
it's not easy to understand.

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,320
It's not easy to understand why people 
would write stories like that if they 

52
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,471
thought like we thought.
And I mean really it wasn't that long 

53
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:14,350
ago that the Bible was written,
say from a biological perspective,

54
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,660
it's really only yesterday.
It's a couple of thousand years,

55
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,340
say 40,000
years,

56
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:23,341
something like that.
That's not very long ago from a 

57
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:23,341
biological perspective,
it's,

58
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,530
it's nothing.
So the first thing I tried to do is to 

59
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,750
see if I could figure out how to 
understand that.

60
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,480
And so I'll start the lecture.
Once we finished the,

61
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,140
the remains of,
of the story of Noah,

62
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,590
I'll start the lecture with a d with an 
attempt to situate the abrahamic stories

63
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,550
in a context that might make them more 
accessible.

64
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,250
These two contexts that worked for me to
make them more accessible.

65
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,120
Let's conclude the newest story first.
However,

66
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,420
when we ended last time,
the art had come to its resting place 

67
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:09,841
and Noah and his family had debarked.
Uh,

68
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,070
and so this is the stories of what 
occurs immediately after afterwards.

69
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,340
It's a very short story,
but I think it's very relevant for both 

70
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,060
of these stories.
The Tower of Babel as well,

71
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:30,061
very relevant for our current times.
And the sons of Noah that went forth of 

72
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:34,651
the Ark were shem and ham and Japheth,
and ham is the father of Canaan.

73
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,330
These are the three sons of Noah and of 
them was the whole Earth overspread.

74
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,480
And Noah began to be a hud husbands men,
and he planted a vineyard and he drank 

75
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:50,560
of the wine and was drunk,
and he was uncovered within his tent and

76
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:55,561
Ham.
The father of Canaan saw the nakedness 

77
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,171
of his father and told his two brethren 
without and Shem and Japheth took a 

78
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:04,101
garment and laid upon both their 
shoulders and went backward and covered 

79
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,701
the nakedness of their father and their 
faces were backward and they saw not 

80
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,421
their father's nakedness.
And Noah awoke from his wine and knew 

81
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,080
what his younger son had done unto him.
And he said,

82
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,750
curse it to be Canaan,
a servant of servants,

83
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,850
shall he be unto his brethren.

84
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,840
And he said,
blessed shall be the Lord God of 

85
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,320
chairman.
Canaan shall be his servant and God 

86
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,071
shall enlarge Japheth.
And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem 

87
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:32,050
and Canaan shall be his servant.
And Noah lived after the flood,

88
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:35,740
350 years and all the days of Noah were 
950 years.

89
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:40,741
And he died.
And the whole earth was of one language 

90
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:41,310
and of one speech.
Okay,

91
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:46,311
so I remember thinking about this story.
It's got to be 30 years ago

92
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,110
and I think the meaning of the story 
stood out for me.

93
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,930
Sometimes when you read complicated 
material,

94
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:04,931
sometimes a piece of it will stand out.
It's for some reason it's like it 

95
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:08,790
glitters.
I suppose that might be one way of 

96
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,790
thinking about it.
It's it,

97
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,170
it you're in sync with it and you can 
understand what it means.

98
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:13,450
I've really experienced that reading the
Tao Te Ching,

99
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,810
which is document I would really like to
do a lecture on at some point because 

100
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,951
some of the verses I don't understand,
but others stand right out and I can 

101
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:23,800
understand them and I think I understood
what this part of the story of.

102
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,120
No Amanda and I think it means,
you know,

103
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,680
we talked a little bit about what 
nakedness meant in the story of Adam and

104
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:34,681
eve and the idea essentially was that to
know yourself naked is to become aware 

105
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,650
of your vulnerability,
the physical,

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,580
your physical boundaries in time and 
space and your,

107
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,970
your,
your physiological,

108
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,480
your fundamental physiological 
insufficiencies as they make might be 

109
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,480
judged by others.

110
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,190
So there's biological insufficiency that
sort of built into you because you're a 

111
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,731
fragile mortal,
vulnerable half insane creature and 

112
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:03,360
that's that's just an existential truth.
And then of course even merely as a 

113
00:08:04,331 --> 00:08:06,070
human being,
even with all those faults,

114
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,100
there are faults that you have that are 
particular to you that might be judged 

115
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,391
harshly by the group while might be,
we'll definitely be judged harshly by 

116
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:16,810
the group.
And so to become aware of your nakedness

117
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:19,120
is to become self conscious and,
and to,

118
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,150
and to,
to know your limits and to know your 

119
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,921
vulnerability.
And that's what is revealed to him when 

120
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:29,160
he comes across his father naked.
It's.

121
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:34,161
So the question is,
what does it mean to see your father 

122
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:34,870
naked?
And it seems to me,

123
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:37,120
and especially in an inappropriate 
manner like this,

124
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:37,510
it,
it,

125
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,620
it,
it,

126
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,730
it's,
it's,

127
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,690
it's as if

128
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,160
ham,

129
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,600
he does the same thing that happens in 
the Mesopotamian creation myth.

130
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,230
When when timeout an absolute give rise 
to the first God's there,

131
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,650
they're the father of the eventual

132
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,060
Deity of redemption.
Martech there are very careless and 

133
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,511
noisy and they kill app sue their father
and attempt to inhabit his corpse and 

134
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,030
that makes timeout enraged and so she 
bursts forth from the darkness to do the

135
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,130
men.
It's like a precursor to the flood story

136
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,400
or an analog to the flood story and I 
see the same thing happening here with 

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,121
him is that he's.
He's insufficiently respectful of his 

138
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:27,171
father and and the question is exactly 
what does the farther represent and you 

139
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:27,171
can say,
well there's,

140
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,450
there's,
there's the father that you have and 

141
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:32,450
that's a human being.
That's,

142
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,170
that's a man like other men,
a man among men,

143
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,380
but then there's the father as such and 
that's the spirit of the father and 

144
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,700
insofar as you have a father,
you have both at the same time.

145
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:46,701
You have the personal father.
That's a man among other men just like 

146
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,850
anyone out there,
his father,

147
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:50,760
but in so far as that man is your 
father.

148
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,460
That means that he's something different
than just another person.

149
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,740
And what he is is the incarnation of the
spirit of the father.

150
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,400
And to see that,
to take it to what to disrespect that 

151
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,570
carelessly,
maybe even like,

152
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,680
no,
it makes a mistake,

153
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:12,681
right?
He produces wine and gets himself drunk 

154
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:12,810
and you might say,
well,

155
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,450
you know,
if he sprawled out there for everyone to

156
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:20,451
see,
it's hardly hams fault if he stumbles 

157
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,371
across it,
but the book is laying out a danger and 

158
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,240
the danger is that,
well,

159
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,300
maybe you catch your father at his most 
vulnerable moment and if you're 

160
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,530
disrespectful,
then you transgress against the spirit 

161
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,821
of the father and if you transgress 
against the spirit of father and lose 

162
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,960
the spirit of the father and lose 
respect for the spirit of the father,

163
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,310
then that is likely to transform you 
into a slave.

164
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,450
That's a very interesting idea and I 
think it's particularly interesting.

165
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,350
Maybe not particularly interesting,
but it's.

166
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,490
It's particularly Germane,
I think,

167
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:58,491
to our current cultural situation 
because I think that were pushed 

168
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,790
constantly to see the nakedness of our 
father,

169
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:05,791
so to speak.
Because of the intense criticism that's 

170
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,470
directed towards our culture and the 
patriarchal culture,

171
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:14,220
so to speak.
We're constantly exposing its weaknesses

172
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:19,221
and vulnerabilities and let's say 
nakedness and there's nothing wrong with

173
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:24,351
criticism,
but the thing about criticism is the 

174
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:24,960
purpose of criticism is to separate the 
wheat from the chaff.

175
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,300
It's not the burn everything to the 
ground,

176
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,530
right?
It's to say,

177
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,230
well,
we're going to carefully look at this.

178
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:36,231
We're going to carefully differentiate.
We're going to keep what's good and 

179
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:36,231
we're going to move away from what's 
bad,

180
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:39,240
but the point of the criticism isn't to 
identify everything is bad.

181
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:44,241
It's two separate.
What's good from what's bad so that you 

182
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:47,421
can retain what's good and move towards 
it and to be careless at that is deadly 

183
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:52,080
because you inhabited by the spirit of 
the father,

184
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,640
right in so far as you're a cultural 
construction,

185
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,640
which of course is something that the 
the postmodern neo Marxists are 

186
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,980
absolutely in phatic about.
You're a cultural construction in so far

187
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:06,160
as you're a cultural construction.
Then your inhabited by the spirit of the

188
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:11,161
father and to be disrespectful towards 
that means to undermine the very 

189
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,350
structure that makes you not all of what
you are.

190
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,480
Certainly,
certainly not all of what you are,

191
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:21,481
but a good portion of what you are in so
far as you're a socialized cultural 

192
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:25,891
entity and if you pull out,
if you pull the foundation out from 

193
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,330
underneath that,
what do you have left?

194
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,500
You can hardly manage on your own,
you know,

195
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,030
it's just not possible.
You're a cultural

196
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,440
creation and so hamm makes this 
desperate error and is careless about 

197
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,960
exposing himself to the vulnerability of
his father.

198
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,970
Something like that.
He does it without sufficient respect 

199
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,650
and the judgment is that not only will 
he be a slave,

200
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:57,651
but so will all of his descendants and 
he's contrasted with the other two sons 

201
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,680
who I suppose are willing to give their 
father the benefit of the doubt,

202
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:06,681
something like that.
And so when they see him in a 

203
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:08,340
compromising position,
they handle it with respect and,

204
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,730
and,
and don't capitalize on it.

205
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,080
And maybe that makes them strong.
That's what it seems to me.

206
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,750
And so I think that's what that story 
means.

207
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,950
It has something to do with respect.
You know?

208
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:27,950
And the funny thing about having respect
for your culture,

209
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:30,290
and I suppose that's partly why I'm 
doing the biblical stories,

210
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,470
is because they're part of,
they're part of my culture.

211
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,970
They're part of our culture perhaps,
but they're certainly part of my culture

212
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,910
and it seems to me that

213
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,690
it's worthwhile to treat that with 
respect to see what you can glean from 

214
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:47,690
it

215
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,240
and,
and not kick it when it's down,

216
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:52,700
let's say.
So.

217
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,160
And so that's how the story of no ends,
you know.

218
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:07,161
And the thing too is Noah is actually a 
pretty decent incarnation of the spirit 

219
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:13,821
of the father.
That which I suppose is one of the 

220
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:15,921
things that makes Hams misstep more 
egregious is that,

221
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,900
I mean,
Noah just built an ark and God everybody

222
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,310
through the flood man,
you know,

223
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,490
it's not so bad in.
So maybe the fact that he happened to 

224
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,320
drink too much wine one day wasn't 
enough to justify humiliating him.

225
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,340
And you know,
I don't think it's pushing the limits of

226
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,370
symbolic interpretation to note on a 
daily basis that were all contained in 

227
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,790
an arc.
Right.

228
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:43,791
And that's the arc that you could think 
about that as the arc that's been 

229
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,181
bequeathed to us by our forefathers.
That's the tremendous infrastructure 

230
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:52,131
that we inhabit,
that we take for granted because it 

231
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:52,131
works so well.

232
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:55,070
That protects us from things that we 
can't even imagine.

233
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:57,590
And we don't have to imagine because 
we're so well protected.

234
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,980
And so one of the things that's really 
struck me hard,

235
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,370
I would say about the disintegration and
corruption of the universities is the 

236
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,540
absolute in gratitude that goes along 
with that.

237
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,600
Criticism,
as I said,

238
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:16,601
is for fine thing.
If it's done in the spirit in a proper 

239
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:18,920
spirit and that's the spirit of 
separating the wheat from the chaff.

240
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,260
But it needs to be accompanied by 
gratitude.

241
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,820
And it does seem to me that anyone who 
lives in in the west,

242
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,170
in the western culture at this time,
in history and in this place and who 

243
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:36,760
isn't simultaneously grateful for that 
is is,

244
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,690
is half blind at least because it's 
never been better than this.

245
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,410
And it could be so much worse.
And it's highly likely that it will be 

246
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,830
so much worse.
Because for most of human history,

247
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,320
so much worse is the norm.

248
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:53,760
So

249
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,810
then there's this little story that 
crops up that seems in some ways 

250
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,220
unrelated to everything that's gone 
before it,

251
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,430
but I think it's also an extremely 
profound little story.

252
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,120
It took me a long time to figure it out.
It's the tower of Babel and it came to 

253
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:21,631
pass as they journeyed from the east,
that they found a plain in the land of 

254
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,500
Shinar and dwelt there.
That's Noah's descendants.

255
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,880
And the whole earth was of one language 
and of one speech and it came to pass as

256
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:32,881
they journeyed from the east,
that they found a plain in the land of 

257
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:33,280
Shinar and they dwelt there and they 
said to one another,

258
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,760
go,
let us make brick and burn them 

259
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,471
thoroughly.
And they had brick for stone and slime 

260
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:42,550
they had for mortar.
So they're establishing a city.

261
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,320
And they said,
go.

262
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:49,321
Let us build a city and a tower whose 
top may reach unto heaven and let us 

263
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:53,650
make a name lest we be scattered abroad 
upon the face of the earth.

264
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,230
And the Lord came down to see the city.
And the tower which the children of men 

265
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,610
built,
and the Lord said,

266
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,790
behold the people is one and they all 
have one language and now this they 

267
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,201
begin to do,
and now nothing will be restrained from 

268
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:12,201
them,
which they have imagined to do.

269
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,270
Go to let us go down and there confound 
their language that they may not 

270
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,901
understand one another's speech,
so the Lord scattered them abroad from 

271
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:25,540
thence upon the face of all the earth,
and they left off to build the city,

272
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,100
therefore is the name of it called Babel
because the Lord did there confound the 

273
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,511
language of all the earth.
And from thence did the Lord scatter 

274
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,571
them abroad upon the face of the earth.
Very difficult story to understand.

275
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:46,030
It's on the face of it.
It doesn't seem to show God in a very 

276
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,141
good light,
although that happens fairly frequently 

277
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:49,141
in the old testament as far as I can 
tell,

278
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,650
but

279
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,490
you know the thing to do if you're 
reading in the spirit of the text,

280
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,460
let's say,
is to remember that it's God that you're

281
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:04,461
talking about.
And so even though you might think that 

282
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,280
he's appearing in a bad light,
your duty as a reader,

283
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,330
I suppose is to assume that you're wrong
and that what he did was right,

284
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,590
and then you're supposed to figure out,
well,

285
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:18,591
how could it possibly be right?
Because the axiomatic presupposition is 

286
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:19,410
that it's God and whatever he does is 
right,

287
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,700
and you might say,
well,

288
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:25,701
you can disagree with that.
And it's also the case that some of the 

289
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:27,360
people that God talks to in the Old 
Testament actually disagree with him and

290
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:32,361
convince him to alter his actions.
But the point still remains that it's 

291
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:32,880
gone.
And if he's doing it,

292
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:36,120
then by definition there's a good 
reason.

293
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,880
There's an idea of much later that John 
Melton develops in in paradise lost,

294
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,480
which is an amazing home.
And it,

295
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,050
it's,
it's,

296
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,390
it's a profound enough poems so that 
it's almost been incorporated into the 

297
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:57,470
biblical structure.
I would say.

298
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:02,471
So the Corpus of Christianity Post 
Milton was saturated by the mill tonic 

299
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:09,610
stories of Satan's rebellion.
None of that's in the,

300
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:15,050
in the,
in the biblical texts or it's only 

301
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,771
hinted at in very brief passages.
And Milton wrote his poem to justify the

302
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,870
ways of God to man,
which is quite an ambition,

303
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,690
really.
It's an amazing,

304
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:31,691
profound ambition to try to produce 
something to produce a literary work 

305
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,130
that justifies being to human beings 
because that's what Milton was trying to

306
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:37,790
do.
Something.

307
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,820
One of my readers here sent me a link 
the other day or our viewers to a work 

308
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:48,611
of philosophy by an Australian 
philosopher whose name I don't remember 

309
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:53,590
who basically wrote a book saying that 
being as such human experience is so 

310
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,901
corrupt and so permeated by suffering,
that it would be better if it had never 

311
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:03,641
existed at all.
Sort of the ultimate expression of 

312
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:06,641
nihilism and Gertha in faust.
His mephistopheles who's Santana 

313
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,880
character obviously has that as a credo.
That's Satan's fundamental motivation is

314
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,290
his objection to creation itself is that
creation is so flawed and so rife with 

315
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,730
suffering that it would be better if it 
had never existed at all,

316
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and so that's his motivation for 
attempting to continue to destroy it in 

317
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:34,451
Milton's Paradise Lost Satan as an 
intellectual figure and you see that 

318
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:38,690
motif emerged very frequently by the way
in popular culture.

319
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:40,640
So for example,
in the lion king,

320
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,030
the figure of scar who's a satanic 
figure is also hyper intellectual and 

321
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,310
that's very common that you know it's 
the evil scientist Motif or the or the 

322
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,210
evil advisor to the king,
the same motif.

323
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,380
It encapsulate something about 
rationality and what it seems to 

324
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,361
encapsulate as the idea that rationality
like Satan is the highest angel in God's

325
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:03,910
heavenly kingdom.
It's a psychological idea.

326
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:08,911
You know that the most powerful sub 
element of the human psyche is the 

327
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:13,681
intellect and it's the thing that shines
out above all within the domain of 

328
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:19,000
humanity and maybe across the domain of 
life itself.

329
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:24,090
The human intellect.
There's something absolutely remarkable 

330
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,251
about it,
but it has a flaw and the floor is that 

331
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,681
it tends to fall in love with its own 
productions and to assume that their 

332
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:32,761
total solzhenitsyn,
when he was writing the Gulag 

333
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:35,431
archipelago had a warning about that 
with regards to totalitarian ideology 

334
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,240
and he said that the price of selling 
your God given sole to the entrapments 

335
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,420
of of human dogma was slavery and death 
essentially,

336
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,690
and Satan in May in Milton's paradise 
lost.

337
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,050
Satan decides that he can do without the
transcendent.

338
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,620
He can do without God,
and that's why foment rebellion.

339
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,540
It's something like that and the 
consequences of that.

340
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,110
The immediate consequence from Milton's 
perspective was that as soon as Satan 

341
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,790
decided that what he knew was sufficient
and that he could do without the 

342
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:20,521
transcendent,
which you might think about as the 

343
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:20,830
domain outside of what you know,
something like that.

344
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:26,230
Immediately he was inhale and when I 
read paradise lost,

345
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:28,330
I was studying totalitarianism and I 
thought,

346
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,650
you know,
the poet,

347
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,730
the true poet,
like a prophet is someone who has 

348
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,381
intimations of the future.
And maybe that's because the poetic 

349
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:42,400
mind,
the philosophical or prophetic mind is a

350
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:47,401
pattern detector and,
and there are people who can detect the 

351
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:48,940
underlying.
It's like the melody of nation,

352
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,540
melody in Song,
the song of a nation and could see how 

353
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:54,540
it's going to develop across the 
centuries.

354
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,320
You see this,
you see that nature because nature,

355
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,910
for example,
in the mid,

356
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,460
around 18,
60 or so,

357
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,100
and he prophesied what was going to 
happen in the 20th century.

358
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:08,101
He said that he said specifically that 
the specter of communism would kill 

359
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,680
millions of people in the 20th century.
It's amazing prophecy.

360
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:17,010
He said that in the notes that became 
will to power and Dostoevsky was of the 

361
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,500
same sort of mind.
Someone who was in touch enough with the

362
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,580
fundamental patterns of,
of,

363
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,790
of,
of human movement that they could 

364
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:27,850
extrapolate out into the future and see 
what was coming.

365
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,450
And I mean,
some people are very good at detecting 

366
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:33,450
patterns.
And,

367
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:33,450
and,
uh,

368
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,210
Milton I think was of that sort and I 
think he had intimations of what was 

369
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:44,521
coming.
As human rationality became more and 

370
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:47,041
more powerful.
Technology became more and more 

371
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:47,041
powerful.
And the intimation

372
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,160
was that we would produce systems that 
dispensed with God,

373
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,120
that we're completely rational and 
completely total that would immediately 

374
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,991
turn everything they touched into 
something indistinguishable from hell.

375
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,280
And in Milton's warning was embodied in 
the poem,

376
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,310
is that the rational mind that generates
a production and then worships it as if 

377
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:15,421
it's absolute immediately occupies hell.
So what does that have to do with the 

378
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,890
Tower of Babel?
Well,

379
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,980
you know what?
Back in 2008,

380
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:24,760
when the,
when,

381
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,810
when we had that economic collapse,
the strange idea emerged politically and

382
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:34,920
that was the idea of too big to fail.
And I thought about that idea for a long

383
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:39,921
time because I thought there's something
deeply wrong with that is one of the 

384
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:44,631
things that made marks wrong was Marx 
believed that capital would flow into 

385
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:52,911
the hands of fewer and fewer people and 
that the dissociation between the rich 

386
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:55,800
and the poor would become more extreme 
as capitalism developed.

387
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,480
And like so many things that mark said,
that's kind of true.

388
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,500
It's kind of true in that

389
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:12,110
the distribution of wealth and in fact 
the distribution of anything that's 

390
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,390
produced follows a peritoneal pattern 
and the prieto pattern basically is that

391
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,750
a small proportion of people end up with
a bulk of the goods and it isn't just 

392
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:20,750
money.
It's,

393
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,410
it's anything that people produce,
creatively ends up in that distribution 

394
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,450
and that's actually the economists 
called up the matthew principle and they

395
00:25:30,451 --> 00:25:35,451
take that from US statement in the New 
Testament and the statement is to those 

396
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,960
who have everything more will be given 
and from those who have nothing.

397
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:41,961
Everything will be taken and it's.
It's a map of the manner in which the 

398
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:46,881
world manifests itself where human 
creative production is involved and the 

399
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:49,740
map seems to indicate that as you start 
to produce and you're successful,

400
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,060
the probability that you will continue 
to be successful or accelerate increases

401
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:56,410
as you're successful.
And as you fail.

402
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,770
The probability that you will fail 
starts to accelerate.

403
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,780
So in your progress through life looks 
like this or like this.

404
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Something like that.
And the reason that Marx was right was 

405
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,660
because he noted that as a feature of 
the capitalist system,

406
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,870
the reason that he was wrong is that 
it's not a feature that's specific to a 

407
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,831
capitalist system.
It's a feature that's general to all 

408
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:24,810
systems of creative production that are 
known and so it's like a natural law and

409
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:29,811
it's enough of a natural law by the way,
that the distribution of wealth can be 

410
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:34,611
modeled by physical models using the 
same equations that govern the 

411
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:35,910
distribution of gas molecules in a 
vacuum.

412
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,330
So it's a really profound,
it's a fundamentally profound 

413
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,201
observation about the way the world lays
itself out and it's problematic because 

414
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,270
if resources accrue unfairly to a small 
minority of people and there's a natural

415
00:26:55,051 --> 00:27:00,051
law like element to that that has to be 
dealt with from a social perspective 

416
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,180
because if the inequality becomes too 
extreme,

417
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,360
then the whole system will destabilize.
And so you can have an intelligent 

418
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,890
discussion about how to mitigate the 
effects of the transfer of creative 

419
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,370
production into the hands of a small 
number of people.

420
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,230
Now,
the other reason,

421
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,790
however,
having said that,

422
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,550
the other reason that Marx was wrong,
there's a number of them.

423
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,610
One is that even though

424
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,870
creative products end up in the hands of
a small number of people,

425
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:37,260
it's not the same people consistently 
across time.

426
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,040
It's the same proportion of people and 
that's not the same thing.

427
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,640
You know,
like imagine that there's water going 

428
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,640
down a drain and you say,
well,

429
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
look at the spiral.
It's permanent.

430
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,180
You think,
well,

431
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:50,460
the spirals permanent,
but the water molecules aren't.

432
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:55,461
They're moving through it and it's the 
same in some sense with the prieto 

433
00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:58,791
distribution is that there's a one 
percent and there's always a one 

434
00:27:58,791 --> 00:27:58,980
percent,
but it's not the same people.

435
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,280
It's the stability of it differs from 
culture to culture,

436
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:07,800
but there's a lot of movement in the 
upper one percent,

437
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:11,790
a tremendous amount of movement and one 
of the reasons for that movement is that

438
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,830
things get large and then they get too 
large and then they collapse.

439
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,940
And so in 2008,
when the politicians said too big to 

440
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,961
fail,
they got something truly backwards as 

441
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:28,320
far as I can tell.
And that was,

442
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,310
it was a reverse.
The statement was reversed.

443
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,100
It should have been so big it had to 
fail.

444
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,120
And that's what I think the story of the
Tower of Babel is about.

445
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:45,121
It's a warning against the expansion of 
the system

446
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:52,740
until it encompasses everything.
It's a warning against totalitarian 

447
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,530
presumption.
So what happens,

448
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:58,531
for example,
when people set out to build the Tower 

449
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:01,740
of Babel,
is they want to build a structure that 

450
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,170
reaches to have it right?
So the idea is that it can,

451
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,690
it can,
it can replace,

452
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,430
it,
can replace the role of God.

453
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:11,431
It's something like that.
It can erase the distinction between 

454
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:15,420
Earth and heaven.
And so there's a utopian kind of vision 

455
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,971
there as well as we can build a 
structure that's so large and 

456
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:18,610
encompassing that,
that,

457
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,210
that it can replace heaven itself.
That's an interesting.

458
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,920
The fact that that doesn't work and that
God objects to it is also 

459
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,591
extraordinarily interesting and it's an 
indication to me of the unbelievable 

460
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:36,731
profundity of these stories.
It's like I think one thing we should 

461
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:40,381
have learned from the 20th century,
but of course didn't was that there's 

462
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,100
something extraordinary dangerous 
totalitarian,

463
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,160
utopian visions at something Dostoevsky 
wrote about,

464
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:48,430
by the way,
in his great book notes from underground

465
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,460
because Dostoevsky had figured out by 
the early 19 hundreds that there was 

466
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,320
something very,
very pathological about a utopian vision

467
00:29:56,321 --> 00:30:01,321
of perfection,
that it was profoundly anti human and 

468
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:04,220
and notes and notes from underground.
He demolishes the notion of Utopia.

469
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,730
One of the things he says that I loved,
it's so brilliant,

470
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,860
he said,
imagine that you brought the socialist 

471
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,851
utopia into being and dusty,
Esq says that human beings had nothing 

472
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:15,970
to do except

473
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,070
eat,
drink,

474
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:23,070
and busy themselves with the 
continuation of the species.

475
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:29,390
He said that the first thing that would 
happen under circumstances like that 

476
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,270
would be that human beings would go mad 
and break the system,

477
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:38,450
smash it just so that something 
unexpected and crazy could happen 

478
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,880
because human beings don't want Utopian 
comfort and certainty.

479
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,450
They want adventure and chaos and 
uncertainty,

480
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:51,110
and so that the very notion of a utopia 
was anti human because we're not built 

481
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:55,131
for static utopia.
We're built for a dynamic situation 

482
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:02,570
where there's demands placed on us and 
where there's the optimal amount of 

483
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:07,380
uncertainty.
Well,

484
00:31:07,381 --> 00:31:12,381
we know what happened in the 20th 
century as a consequence of the 

485
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:15,681
widespread promulgation of Utopian 
schemes and what happened was a ham on a

486
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:22,371
scale that had never been matched in the
entire history of humanity and that's 

487
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,820
really saying something because

488
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,050
there was plenty of mayhem before the 
20th century.

489
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,880
I guess there wasn't as much industrial 
clout behind it and so,

490
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:38,470
so early.
See so early in the biblical narrative,

491
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:43,471
you have a warning against Hubris and 
and some indication that properly 

492
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:48,970
functioning systems have an appropriate 
scale.

493
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,020
I read an article in the Economist 
magazine this week about the rise of 

494
00:31:55,541 --> 00:32:00,541
nationalist movements all over the world
as a counterbalance to globalization.

495
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Maybe it's most market with the European
Economic Community and the economist 

496
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,820
writers.
We're curious about why that counter 

497
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,001
movement has been developing,
but it seems to me that it's also a 

498
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:19,021
tower of Babel phenomena is that maybe 
this is most evident in the European 

499
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:26,270
Economic Community to bring all of that 
multiplicity under the,

500
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,180
what would you call it,
under the umbrella of a single unity is 

501
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,320
to similar caneously erect a system 
where the top is so far from the bottom 

502
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,770
that the bottom has no connection.
The top,

503
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,830
you know,
your,

504
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,860
your,
your social systems have to be large 

505
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,541
enough so they protect you,
but small enough so that you have a 

506
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:52,841
place in them and it seems to me perhaps
that's what's happened in places like 

507
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:56,810
the EEC,
is that the distance between the typical

508
00:32:56,811 --> 00:33:01,811
citizen and the bureaucracy that runs 
the entire structure has got so great 

509
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:08,350
that it's an element of destabilization 
in and of itself,

510
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:13,361
and so people revert back to say 
nationalistic identities because it's 

511
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:19,181
something that they can relate to it.
There's A.

512
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,630
There's a history there and a shared 
identity,

513
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:25,710
a genuine identity,
an identity of language and tradition.

514
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,980
That's not an artificial imposition from
the top and artificial abstract 

515
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,791
imposition in in the Egyptian creation 
myth.

516
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:48,270
The version I'm familiar most familiar 
with in the previous creation myth,

517
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,130
the older one,
the Mesopotamian creation myth,

518
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,110
mostly what you see menacing humanity is
tie matt.

519
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,960
She's the dragon of chaos and so that's 
nature.

520
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,540
It's really,
it's really mother nature,

521
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:07,110
red in tooth and claw,
but by the time the Egyptians come 

522
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,110
along,

523
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,840
it isn't only nature that threatens 
humanity.

524
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:17,841
It's the social structure itself,
and so the Egyptians had two daddies 

525
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,220
that represented the social structure 
and one was,

526
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,000
oh,
cyrus,

527
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:26,001
who was like the spirit of the father.
He was a great hero who established 

528
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:30,291
Egypt but became old and and willfully 
blind and and,

529
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,330
and,
and senile,

530
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,020
and he had an evil brother named seth,
and Seth was always conspiring to 

531
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,090
overthrow him.
And because Cyrus ignored him long 

532
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:49,461
enough,
seth did overthrow chopped up into 

533
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:51,570
pieces and distributed all around the 
kingdom on his son.

534
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:53,790
Horace had to come back and fight.
Well,

535
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:59,090
Cyrus's son,
horace had to come back and defeat seth 

536
00:34:59,090 --> 00:34:59,970
to take the kingdom back.
And that's how that story ends.

537
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,120
But the Egyptian seem to have realized 
maybe because they had become 

538
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,490
bureaucratized to quite a substantial 
degree,

539
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,600
that it wasn't only nature that 
threatened humankind.

540
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:14,520
It was also the proclivity of human 
organizations to become too large,

541
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:19,521
too unwieldy to deceitful and to 
willfully blind and therefore liable to 

542
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,260
collapse.
And again,

543
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:24,930
I see echoes of that in this story of 
the Tower of Babel.

544
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,040
So it's a calling for I kind of humility
of social engineering.

545
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,980
One of the other things I've learned as

546
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,090
a social scientist,

547
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,500
and I've been warned about this by I 
would say great social scientists,

548
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:51,070
that you want to be very careful about 
doing large scale experimentation with 

549
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:57,851
large scale systems because the 
probability that if you implement a 

550
00:35:57,861 --> 00:36:02,861
scheme in a large scale social system 
that that scheme will have the result 

551
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:07,151
you intended is negligible.
What will happen will be something that 

552
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:11,000
you don't intend and even worse,
something that works at counter purposes

553
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:15,950
to your original intent and so and that 
that makes sense.

554
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:20,660
Because if you have a very,
very complex system and you perturb it,

555
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,320
the probability that you can predict the
consequences of the perturbation is 

556
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,570
extraordinary low.
Obviously if the system works though,

557
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:33,470
you think you understand it because it 
works and so you think it's simpler than

558
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:38,471
it actually is,
and so then you think that you're more 

559
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:38,471
love.
It is correct,

560
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:42,020
and then you think that your 
manipulation of the model which produces

561
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:47,410
the outcome new model will be the 
outcome that's actually produced in the 

562
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,500
world.
That doesn't work at all.

563
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:55,450
I thought about that an awful lot 
thinking about how to remediate social 

564
00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:00,221
systems because obviously they need 
careful attention and adjustment and it 

565
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:02,720
struck me that the proper

566
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,590
strategy for implementing social change 
is to stay within your domain of 

567
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:16,571
competence and that requires humility,
which is a virtue that is never

568
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,900
promoted in modern culture.
I would say it's.

569
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,170
It's a virtue that you can hardly even 
talk about,

570
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:31,710
but humility means you probably not as 
smart as you think you are and you 

571
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,970
should be careful.
And so then the question might be,

572
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:34,990
well,
okay,

573
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:38,230
you should be careful,
but perhaps you still want to do good,

574
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,740
you want to make some positive changes,
how can you be careful and do good?

575
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:43,300
And then I would say,
well,

576
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,360
you try not to step outside of the 
boundaries of your competence and you 

577
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,811
start small and you start with things 
that you actually could adjust that you 

578
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,200
actually do understand,
that you actually could fix.

579
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,540
I mentioned to you at one point that one
of the things Carl Jung said was that 

580
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,030
modern men don't see God because they 
don't look low enough.

581
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,620
So very interesting phrase,
and one of the things that I've been 

582
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,490
promoting,
I suppose online is the idea that you 

583
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,291
should restrict your attempts to fix 
things to what's at hand.

584
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,900
So there's probably things about you 
that you could fix,

585
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,910
right?
Things that you know that aren't right,

586
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,480
not anyone else's opinion,
your own opinion that aren't right.

587
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:30,400
You can fix them.
Maybe there's some things that you could

588
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:32,590
adjust in your family.
Although that gets hard.

589
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:38,100
You have to have your act together a lot
before you can to adjust your family 

590
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,650
because things can kick back on you 
really hard and you think,

591
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:40,960
well,
it's hard to put yourself together.

592
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,970
It's really hard to put your family 
together.

593
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,190
Why the hell do you think you can put 
the world together?

594
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,030
Right?
Because obviously the world is more 

595
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,030
complicated than you and your family,
and so if you.

596
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,980
If you're stymied in your attempts even 
to set your own house in order,

597
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:59,100
which of course you are,
then you would think that what that 

598
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,951
would do would be to make you very,
very leery about announcing your broad 

599
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:03,310
scale plans for social revolution.

600
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,480
Well,
it's a peculiar thing because that isn't

601
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:12,481
how it works because people are much 
more likely to announce their plans for 

602
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:15,010
broad scale social revolution than they 
are to try to set themselves straight or

603
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:20,011
to set their family's straight and I 
think the reason for that is that as 

604
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:20,950
soon as they tried to set themselves 
straight or their families,

605
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,090
the system immediately kicks back at 
them right instantly.

606
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,480
Whereas if they announced their plans 
for large scale social revolution,

607
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,530
the lag between the announcement and the
kickback is so long that they don't 

608
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:38,570
recognize that there's any error there 
and so you know,

609
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:41,020
you can get away with being wrong if,
if,

610
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,340
if nothing falls on you for a while and 
so,

611
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,290
and it's also an incitement to hubris 
because you can now see your,

612
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,980
your plans for large scale social 
revolution and stand back and you don't 

613
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,350
get hit by lightning and you think,
well,

614
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:58,690
I might be right even though you're not.

615
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,840
You're seriously not right.
I might be right.

616
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:02,890
And then you think,
well,

617
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:08,310
how wonderful is that?
Especially if you could do it without 

618
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,340
any real effort.
And I really do think fundamentally,

619
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:12,340
I believe that that's what universities 
teach students now.

620
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,670
That's what they teach them to do.
I really believe that and I think it's 

621
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,421
absolutely appalling and I think it's 
horribly dangerous because it's not that

622
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:26,290
easy to fix things,
especially if you don't.

623
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,560
Especially if you're not committed to 
it.

624
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,500
And I think you know,
if you're committed because what you try

625
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,800
to do is you try to straighten out your 
own life first and that's enough.

626
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,380
I think it's a statement in the new 
testament that it's.

627
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,700
I think it's in the new testament that 
it's more difficult to rule yourself 

628
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,760
than to rule the city and that's not a 
metaphor.

629
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:50,820
It's like all of you who've made 
announcements to yourself about changing

630
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:55,240
your diet and going to the gym every 
January know perfectly well.

631
00:40:55,241 --> 00:41:00,241
How difficult it is to regulate your own
impulses and to bring yourself under the

632
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:04,240
control of some.
What would you say?

633
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:10,170
Well structured and ethical,
attentive structure of values.

634
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,750
It's extraordinarily difficult.
And so people don't do it and instead 

635
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,811
they wander off and I think they create 
towers of Babel and the story indicates,

636
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:28,050
well those things collapse under their 
own weight and everyone goes their own 

637
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,050
direction.

638
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,190
I think I see that happening with the 
lgbt community.

639
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,310
I think because one of the things I've 
noticed,

640
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:42,311
it's very interesting because the 
community is in some sense it's not a 

641
00:41:42,311 --> 00:41:42,620
community,
but

642
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,910
that's a technical error,
but it's.

643
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,250
It's composed of outsiders,
let's say,

644
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,330
and what you notice across the decades 
is that the acronym list keeps growing 

645
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,270
and I think that's because there's an 
infinite number of ways to be an 

646
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,361
outsider and so once you open the door 
to the construction of a group that's 

647
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:09,920
characterized by failing to fit into the
group,

648
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:15,310
then you immediately create a category 
that's infinitely expandable and so I 

649
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:17,810
don't know how long the acronym list is 
now.

650
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,970
It depends on which acronym list you 
consult,

651
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,240
but I've seen lists of 10 or more 
acronyms and one of the things that's 

652
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:31,031
happening is that the community is 
starting to fragment in its in its 

653
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:37,211
interior because there is no unity.
Once you put a sufficient plurality 

654
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:42,941
under the sheltering structure of a 
single umbrella,

655
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:47,330
say the disunity starts to appear 
within,

656
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:53,020
and I think that's also a.
it's a manifestation of the same issue 

657
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,440
that this particular story is dealing 
with.

658
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,140
So that ends,
I would say,

659
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,280
the most archaic stories in the Bible.
There's something about the flood story 

660
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:12,570
and and also the Tower of Babel.
I think they outline the two fundamental

661
00:43:12,571 --> 00:43:17,040
dangers that be set mankind.
One is the probability that

662
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,350
blindness and sin will produce a natural
catastrophe or entice one.

663
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,190
That's something modern people are very 
aware of in principle,

664
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:31,191
right?
Because we're all hyper concerned about 

665
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,021
environmental degradation and 
catastrophe and so that's the continual 

666
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,450
reactivation of an architectural idea in
our,

667
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:41,990
in our unconscious minds that there's 
something about the way we're living 

668
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,260
that's unsustainable and that will 
create a catastrophe and so interesting 

669
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,821
because people believe that firmly and 
deeply and but they don't see the 

670
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:53,280
relationship between that and the 
archetypal stories because it's the same

671
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:57,090
story.
Overconsumption greed,

672
00:43:57,091 --> 00:44:02,091
all of that is producing an unstable 
state and nature will rebel and take us 

673
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:03,030
down.
Right?

674
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:06,870
You hear that every day in every 
newspaper and every TV station.

675
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,310
It's broadcast to you constantly,
so that idea is presented in,

676
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,620
in Genesis,
in the story of Noah,

677
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:17,850
and then the other warning that exists 
in the stories.

678
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,880
One is beware of natural catastrophe 
that's produced as a consequence of 

679
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,541
blindness and greed will say the other 
is be aware of social structures.

680
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:34,051
That overreach because it'll also 
produce fragmentation and 

681
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:35,720
disintegration,
and so it's quite remarkable.

682
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:40,721
I think that that with at the close of 
the story of the Tower of Babel,

683
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,960
we've got both of the permanent 
existential dangers that present 

684
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:51,230
themselves to humanity already 
identified

685
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,260
at the end of the story of Adam and eve.
There's like a fall into history,

686
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:07,090
right?
So in one way history begins with the 

687
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:07,090
fall,
but there's like a second fall,

688
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:11,720
I think with the flood in the Tower of 
Babel and history in even more real 

689
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:16,791
sense begins now.
It begins with the story of Abraham and 

690
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:17,220
and it's,
it's.

691
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,420
We're no longer precisely in the realm 
of the purely mythical.

692
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,220
That would be another way of thinking 
about it.

693
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,060
We have identifiable person who's part 
of an identifiable tribe,

694
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:32,061
who's doing identifiable things.
We're in the realm of history and so 

695
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:32,970
history begins twice in the Old 
Testament.

696
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,360
I suppose it begins again after Moses as
well,

697
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:41,361
but we've moved out of the domain of the
purely mythical into the realm of 

698
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:44,460
history with the emergence of the 
stories about Abraham.

699
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,020
This is from Elvis Huxley.
So the first thing that that I want to 

700
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,931
talk about in relationship to the 
abrahamic stories is this idea of the 

701
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:55,440
experience of God,
because Abraham,

702
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:59,280
although quite identifiable as an actual
individual,

703
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:05,660
is also characterized by this 
peculiarity and the peculiarity is that 

704
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,920
God manifests himself to Abraham.

705
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,430
Both has a voice and but also as a 
presence.

706
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:17,210
The story is never described exactly how
God manifests himself except now and 

707
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:20,550
then he comes in the form of an angel 
that's fairly concrete,

708
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,120
but it's a funny thing that the author 
of or authors of the Abrahamic stories 

709
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:31,250
seems to take the idea that God would 
make an appearance more or less for 

710
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:36,300
granted,
and so it's very.

711
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,320
I think the part of the reason that I've
struggled so much with the abrahamic 

712
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,201
stories is because it's so hard to get a
handle on that and to understand what 

713
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:48,351
that might mean and so I'm going to hit 
it from a bunch of different 

714
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:51,681
perspectives and we'll see if we can 
come up with some understanding of it.

715
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,730
The first thing I'll do is tell you a 
story about female neurologist whose 

716
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:05,301
name escapes me at the moment.
She wrote a book called my stroke of 

717
00:47:05,301 --> 00:47:05,970
insight.
Jill bolte a I think is her name,

718
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,680
and she was a harvard trained.
She was.

719
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,430
She had.
She had medical training from Harvard in

720
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,700
neuropsychological function and knew a 
lot about hemispheric specialization.

721
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,880
We talked a little bit about hemispheric
specialization before.

722
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:26,390
One of the ways of conceptualizing the 
difference between the two hemispheres 

723
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,771
is that the left hemisphere operates in 
unknown territory and the right 

724
00:47:30,771 --> 00:47:30,771
hemisphere operates in unknown

725
00:47:30,771 --> 00:47:35,250
territory.
That's one way of thinking about or the 

726
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:35,530
left hemisphere operates in the orderly 
domain.

727
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:40,531
In the right hemisphere operates in the 
chaotic domain or the left hemisphere 

728
00:47:40,531 --> 00:47:43,780
operates in the domain of detail,
and the right hemisphere operates in the

729
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,290
domain of the large picture.
It's something like that.

730
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,780
Now people differ in their neurological 
wiring,

731
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:53,320
so those are over generalizations,
but that's okay.

732
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:55,030
We're.
We'll live with that for the time being.

733
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,180
It's certainly not an overgeneralization
to point out that you do in fact have 

734
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,750
two hemispheres and that their 
structures differ and if the connections

735
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:03,880
between the market which could happen,
for example,

736
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,830
if you had surgery for intractable 
epilepsy,

737
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:11,040
that each hemisphere would be capable of
housing its own consciousness that's 

738
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,271
been well documented by a neural neural 
neurologist named [inaudible] who did 

739
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,620
and Sperry who did split brain 
experiments must be 30 years ago now,

740
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:26,580
so and we know that the right and the 
left hemisphere are specialized for 

741
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:26,950
different functions.

742
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,150
The Right Hemisphere,
for example,

743
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,390
seems to be more involved in 
degeneration of negative emotion and the

744
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:36,391
left hemisphere more involved in the 
generation of positive emotion and 

745
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:36,940
approach.
So the right hemisphere stops you in the

746
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:38,350
left hemisphere,
moves you forward.

747
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,130
Anyways,
Jill Bolty,

748
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:48,030
I hope I've got that right.
Had a stroke and maintained 

749
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,981
consciousness during the stroke and 
analyzed it while it was happening and 

750
00:48:52,981 --> 00:48:54,490
she was able.
Well,

751
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:59,491
it was happening to hypothesize about 
what part of her brain was being 

752
00:48:59,491 --> 00:49:03,991
destroyed and what.
So she had a congenital blood vessel 

753
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:07,840
malformation and had an aneurysm and it 
just about killed her.

754
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,520
But she said that it affected her left 
hemisphere and she said that she 

755
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:21,121
experienced a sense of divine unity as a
consequence of the stroke because the 

756
00:49:21,761 --> 00:49:26,761
left hemisphere function was disrupted 
and destroyed and so she became a right 

757
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:31,051
hemisphere dominant and her experience 
of that was the disillusion of the 

758
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:35,020
specific ego into the into absolute 
consciousness,

759
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:35,830
something like that.

760
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:41,550
Now that's only a case study and you 
don't want to make too much of case 

761
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:45,511
studies,
but there is an overwhelming amount of 

762
00:49:45,511 --> 00:49:47,860
evidence that those two kinds of 
consciousness exist.

763
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,520
One being your consciousness of you as a
localized and specified being and the 

764
00:49:55,541 --> 00:50:00,541
other being this capacity to experience 
oceanic disillusion and the sense of the

765
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:08,521
cosmos being one.
Now why we have those capacities for 

766
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:14,281
different conscious experiences is very 
difficult to understand.

767
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:19,850
I mean,
part of me thinks that maybe we have a 

768
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,011
generic human brain that's the brain of 
the species and allied with that.

769
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:29,180
We have a specific individual brain and 
one is the left hemisphere and the other

770
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:34,181
is the right hemisphere,
the left hemisphere of being the 

771
00:50:34,181 --> 00:50:35,981
specific individual brain,
and usually it's on and working because 

772
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:39,050
you obviously have to take care of 
yourself as a specific entity and not as

773
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:41,570
a generalized cosmic phenomena.

774
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:46,160
It's hard to dice salary when you're a 
generalized cosmic phenomena,

775
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:51,730
right?
So you have to be more pointed than 

776
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:51,730
that,
but,

777
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:51,730
but look,
let's make no mistake about it.

778
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:56,870
The fact that those different states of 
consciousness exist is not disputable.

779
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,530
They can be elicited in all sorts of 
ways,

780
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:06,370
and so I'm going to read you something 
that Elvis Huxley wrote about this back 

781
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:10,750
I think in 1956.
This was after he started his 

782
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:17,531
experimentation with masculine because 
the psychedelics were introduced into 

783
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:20,330
Western culture in the 19 fifties and 
whole bunch of different ways.

784
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:25,390
Siliciden mushrooms,
Lsd was discovered right at the end of 

785
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:29,471
World War II was discovered by accident.
Actually Laboratory sandow was labs.

786
00:51:29,811 --> 00:51:34,811
The guy who discovered it,
Albert Hoffman had spilled some on his 

787
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:34,910
hands.
You can absorb it through your skin,

788
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,960
and he was biking home and had the 
world's first LSD trip,

789
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:43,280
which was somewhat of a shock to him and
then to the entire world.

790
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,820
Huxley,
who was a great literary figure,

791
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,840
a real genius.
I'm experimented with masculine in the 

792
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,811
late fifties,
and he wrote a book called the doors of 

793
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:58,931
perception,
which had a huge impact on the emerging 

794
00:51:58,931 --> 00:51:59,560
psychedelic culture,
both on the east coast,

795
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,300
at Harvard and on the West Coast with 
Ken keyes.

796
00:52:03,301 --> 00:52:05,960
He and his merry pranksters,
the people who popularized lsd.

797
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,840
That's all documented in a book called 
the electric koolaid acid test,

798
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:11,510
which I would highly recommend.
It's Tom Wolf.

799
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:13,820
It's brilliant book.
I'm on east coast.

800
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:18,821
It was timothy leary.
I had timothy leary's old job at 

801
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:19,910
Harvard,
so that was kind of cool,

802
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,020
you know,
warped way.

803
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:26,650
So I met people there who knew him,
who didn't think much of them also,

804
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:31,100
but who did know him,
but Huxley had this masculine experience

805
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:35,510
and it transported him to this 
alternative consciousness.

806
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:40,511
And he said that during his masculine 
experience that the entire world glowed 

807
00:52:40,511 --> 00:52:40,730
from within.

808
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,880
Like if there was an inner light,
like a paradisical inner light,

809
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:49,180
and then everything was deeply 
meaningful and symbolically suggestive 

810
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,530
and overwhelming and beautiful and 
timeless,

811
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,860
so he had an experience of divine 
eternity,

812
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:59,420
I suppose is this most straightforward 
way to to put that and we know perfectly

813
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:03,950
well that the psychedelic drugs that all
share the same chemical structure,

814
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:06,530
they interact with the brain chemical 
called Serotonin,

815
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,200
which is a very,
very fundamental neurotransmitter.

816
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:13,550
They all have approximately the same 
range of effects,

817
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:19,510
although those effects are very.
There's a very large multitude of 

818
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,350
effects that that sort of exists.
Underneath that umbrella.

819
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,080
Huxley was

820
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:30,170
staggered by his masculine experience.
He,

821
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:35,320
he didn't really know what to make of it
and I think that that's the common 

822
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,750
experience of people who have 
exceptionally profound psychedelic 

823
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:39,970
experiences.
And I'll,

824
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:45,060
I'll,
I'll tell you some documentation about 

825
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,940
that in a moment,
but he spent quite a long time trying to

826
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:49,480
come to grips with what this might mean 
from an intellectual perspective.

827
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:51,450
And Huxley had a great brain.
I mean,

828
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,740
if someone was going to wrestle with a 
problem like that,

829
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,950
he was a good candidate.
He must've had a verbal Iq of 180,

830
00:53:56,951 --> 00:54:00,550
I mean he's.
His books are incredibly literate,

831
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:05,551
incredible,
incredible mastery of language and 

832
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:07,030
complexity of characterization and and 
intellectual discourse.

833
00:54:07,031 --> 00:54:12,031
Really remarkable.
So this is what Huxley had to say after 

834
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:16,741
his masculine experience.
He talked about heaven and hell and he 

835
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:20,281
talked about that in reference to bad 
trips essentially because it was known 

836
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:25,170
by that point that a psychedelic 
experience could transport you to an 

837
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,881
ecstatic domain of divine revelation,
but could take you to the worst 

838
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:30,660
imaginable place as well.

839
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:35,660
And Huxley was very interested in why 
you would even have the capacity for 

840
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:39,901
experiences like that and which I think 
is a very good question and it's 

841
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,230
completely unanswered question.
I mean,

842
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:45,330
we don't know much about consciousness 
and we know even less about 

843
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,481
psychedelics.
I would say they are an absolute 

844
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:51,481
mystery.
I don't think we understand them in the 

845
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:54,151
least.
Huxley did a good job of starting to at 

846
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:54,850
least map out the mysteries of the 
terrain.

847
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:59,940
He said like the earth of 100 years ago,
our minds still has its darkest 

848
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,010
Africa's.
It's unmapped,

849
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:05,070
bordeauxs and Amazonian basins in 
relation to the fauna of these regions.

850
00:55:05,711 --> 00:55:10,711
We are not yet zoologists.
We are mere naturalists and collectors 

851
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:12,040
of specimens.
The fact is unfortunate,

852
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:14,680
but we have to accept it.
We have to make the best of it.

853
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:20,730
However lowly the work of the collector 
must be done before we can proceed to 

854
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,030
the higher scientific tasks of 
classification,

855
00:55:22,031 --> 00:55:27,031
analysis,
experiment and theory making like the 

856
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:27,031
giraffe and the duck billed.
Platypus.

857
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:31,830
The creatures inhabiting these remoter 
regions of the mind are exceedingly 

858
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,070
improbable.
Nevertheless,

859
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:38,071
the exists they're facts of observation 
and as such they cannot be ignored by 

860
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:40,840
anyone who was honestly trying to 
understand the world in which he lives.

861
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:51,310
When psychiatrist started to study lsd 
that was mostly in the late fifties and 

862
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:56,420
running forward from that,
they thought about the drug has a 

863
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,500
psychotomimetic which was a chemical 
substance that would induce psychosis,

864
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:06,130
but that turned out to not be true,
not with the psychedelics because 

865
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:11,500
schizophrenia were given lsd and the 
schizophrenia reported that while the 

866
00:56:12,771 --> 00:56:16,730
experience experience with certainly 
extraordinarily strange,

867
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,890
it wasn't like being schizophrenia and 
then it was found later that if you gave

868
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:24,790
schizophrenia amphetamines,
that made them worse.

869
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:29,410
In fact,
you can induce a paranoid psychosis in a

870
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:31,930
normal person by overdosing them with 
amphetamines,

871
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,320
so whatever the hallucinogens or 
psychedelics are doing,

872
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:40,740
it's not the same thing as mania and 
it's not the same thing as 

873
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:40,740
schizophrenia.

874
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,240
Not at all.
So,

875
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:55,290
so you can't just write the experience 
off as and induced psychosis,

876
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:02,040
whatever it is,
independent of its utility or lack 

877
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,040
thereof.

878
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,270
It's not that

879
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:09,260
now it can be induced by drugs can be 
induced by deprivation,

880
00:57:09,261 --> 00:57:09,950
right?
I mean,

881
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,240
there are accounts throughout history of
people putting themselves in the extreme

882
00:57:14,241 --> 00:57:18,920
physiological situations in order to 
induce transformations of consciousness.

883
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,530
Fasting is one of the routes to doing 
that.

884
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:26,660
Dancing is another root isolation,
prolonged periods of isolation will also

885
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:30,470
do it.
Now you could say that exposing yourself

886
00:57:30,471 --> 00:57:35,471
to any of those nxs produces a state 
that's in distinguishable from illness 

887
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:42,100
and that there's no reason to assume 
that the phenomena that are associated 

888
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,410
with illness have any utility 
whatsoever.

889
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,870
Although it's interesting to me that

890
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:55,260
a disrupted consciousness can produce 
coherent experiences.

891
00:57:55,261 --> 00:57:57,490
It's not exactly what you'd expect if it
was just an illness.

892
00:57:57,491 --> 00:57:58,440
You know,
if you develop,

893
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:03,441
say a high fever,
your experience isn't transcendent and 

894
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:09,421
coherent.
It's fragmented in pathologized and and 

895
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:10,590
the difference I think is quite 
distinct.

896
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,280
Although we don't only.
We don't have to only speculate about 

897
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,621
that because there's been enough 
experimental work done now with with 

898
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:20,400
hallucinogens.
Psychedelics to indicate that the notion

899
00:58:20,401 --> 00:58:25,401
that what they produce is something 
that's only akin to pathology is wrong 

900
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:30,220
because it's not a matter of opinion at 
this point in the sequence of scientific

901
00:58:30,871 --> 00:58:32,610
and historical investigation.
In fact,

902
00:58:32,611 --> 00:58:35,730
there was a large scale study done 10 
years ago,

903
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:38,640
five years ago,
of 200,000

904
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:43,641
people who had experimented with 
psychedelics and they were mentally and 

905
00:58:43,641 --> 00:58:46,170
physically healthier than people who 
hadn't on virtually every parameter.

906
00:58:46,171 --> 00:58:50,280
They examined,
in fact the rate of flashbacks.

907
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:54,360
You heard of LSD flashbacks,
that mostly a hypothetical phenomena,

908
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:59,630
but the rate of self reported flashbacks
was higher among the non psychedelic 

909
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:02,940
users that among the psychedelic users,
so that was very interesting.

910
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:04,620
It was a huge study.
Now it might be,

911
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:09,680
you could say that those who had 
experimented with psychedelics were 

912
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,551
prone to be healthier to begin with,
but that still contradicts the pathology

913
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,200
argument,
so it doesn't matter either way.

914
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,690
The pathology argument is contradicted

915
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:19,990
now.

916
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,670
Oh,
I didn't put that in.

917
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,160
It was Dr Jill,
Jill Bolte Taylor.

918
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,880
This is what she said about her stroke.
I remember that first day of the stroke 

919
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,930
with terrific bittersweetness.
In the absence of the normal functioning

920
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:41,080
of my left orientation association area,
my perception of my physical boundaries 

921
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,220
was no longer limited to where my skin 
met air.

922
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,520
I felt like a genie liberated from its 
bottle.

923
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:51,780
It's a good metaphor.
The energy of my spirit seemed to flow 

924
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,870
like a great whale gliding through a sea
of silent euphoria.

925
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:59,050
The absence of physical boundary was one
of glorious bliss recently.

926
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,860
It's Dr Roland Griffith.

927
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,880
I met him once at a conference in San 
Francisco.

928
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:12,840
Surprise,
surprise.

929
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:18,570
I conference on awe and this was just 
when he was embarking on his experiments

930
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:23,571
with Psilocybin,
which were the first experiments on 

931
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:26,451
hallucinogens that were permitted by the
National Institute of Mental Health in 

932
01:00:26,551 --> 01:00:28,440
some three,
four decades.

933
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:31,770
He,
he had to be very careful to lay out the

934
01:00:31,771 --> 01:00:36,090
scientific protocols so that the ethics 
committees would approve the experiments

935
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:41,091
and so that the federal funding agencies
would also allow the experiments to go 

936
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:45,531
through.
He started to experiment with silicide 

937
01:00:45,531 --> 01:00:49,150
man and he's found a number of and 
published a number of very interesting 

938
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:55,010
results.
One was that a single siliciden trip and

939
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:03,170
I specify trip because sometimes when 
people take psilocybin at the doses that

940
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:08,601
griffith uses,
they don't have a psychedelic 

941
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:09,210
experience.
Most people who take the dose do,

942
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:14,211
but not everyone.
Those who take the dos and don't have 

943
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:17,541
the mystical experience don't 
experienced the consequences of taking 

944
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:20,480
the drug and the consequences can be 
quite profound,

945
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,840
so one consequence is that if you have 
the mystical experience that's 

946
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,850
associated with suicide than ingestion,
you're liable to

947
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:34,970
represent that to others and yourself as
one of the two or three most important 

948
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:39,471
experiences of your entire life,
so that would be at the same level as 

949
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,790
the birth of your child or your 
marriage,

950
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:45,120
let's say assuming that those were 
transcendent experiences,

951
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,140
but,
but that's,

952
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:52,790
but that's how people describe them.
So that's very interesting in and of 

953
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:56,121
itself.
Then the next thing that griffith,

954
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:01,700
another thing that Griffith reported was
that one year after a silicide than dose

955
01:02:03,031 --> 01:02:06,660
a single psilocybin dose profound enough
to induce a mystical experience,

956
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:12,110
that trait openness of the participants 
had increased one standard deviation,

957
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:17,870
which is a tremendous amount,
and so it looked like one dose produced 

958
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,720
a permanent neurological and 
psychological.

959
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,560
Now I'm not saying that that's a good 
thing.

960
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,160
I'm not saying that because I don't 
think that openness is a n troubled 

961
01:02:29,601 --> 01:02:34,601
blessing,
but it's certainly a testament to the 

962
01:02:34,601 --> 01:02:35,480
unbelievable potency of the of the 
drugs.

963
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,780
There's about a 10 percent chance by the
way,

964
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,570
with suicide,
but ingestion of a trip to hell,

965
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:46,870
and so that's certainly something very 
much worth considering when you're 

966
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:50,690
thinking about the potential effects of 
this kind of experience.

967
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,680
So the mystical experience produced by 
Psilocybin is rated by people as the 

968
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,121
most profound,
among the most profound experience of 

969
01:03:04,121 --> 01:03:06,191
their life as life changing.
It produces permanent personality 

970
01:03:06,191 --> 01:03:09,350
transformations.
80 five percent success in smoking 

971
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,310
cessation with a single dose,
right?

972
01:03:10,311 --> 01:03:12,380
That's another thing that griffiths 
demonstrated.

973
01:03:12,381 --> 01:03:17,381
Now that is mind boggling because there 
are chemical treatments for smoking 

974
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:21,170
cessation.
Buproprion is one.

975
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:27,220
It reduces craving to some degree,
but it's success rate is nowhere near 85

976
01:03:29,301 --> 01:03:32,510
percent,
certainly not with a single dose,

977
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:38,000
and so we don't understand how it can be
that that occurs,

978
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:43,300
but it's nicely documented by Griffith 
team in this experiment he gave 

979
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:47,360
Psilocybin to people who are dying of 
cancer.

980
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:54,980
Cancer patients often develop chronic 
clinically significant symptoms of 

981
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,401
depression and anxiety.
Previous study suggested Siliciden may 

982
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:59,760
decrease depression and anxiety and 
cancer patients.

983
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,760
Aldous Huxley took Lsd on his death bed 
by the way,

984
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:08,630
so the idea that there was something 
about psychedelic substances that could 

985
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:17,090
buffer people against the catastrophes 
of mortality is an idea that's as old as

986
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:22,980
experimentation with the drug itself.
The effects of Siliciden were studied in

987
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:27,740
51 cancer patients with life threatening
diagnosis and symptoms of depression and

988
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:30,060
or anxiety.
Unsurprisingly,

989
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:40,110
I don't really know if it's reasonable 
to describe the emotional state of 

990
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:43,681
people diagnosed with cancer of 
uncertain prognosis or mortal 

991
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:47,170
significance as depression.
Precisely.

992
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:52,550
You know,
you know what I mean is that if you go 

993
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:53,710
to the doctor and he tells you that you 
have intractable fatal cancer,

994
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:57,910
the normative response is to be rather 
upset and anxious about that,

995
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:03,420
and so it.
One of the things that bothers me about 

996
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,721
clinical psychiatry and clinical 
psychology is the automatic 

997
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:09,451
presupposition that even overwhelming 
states of negative emotion are properly 

998
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:13,411
categorized as depression because I 
don't think you're depressed when you 

999
01:05:13,411 --> 01:05:16,831
get a cancer diagnosis.
I don't think that's the right way to 

1000
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:18,010
think about it.
I think that you have a big and

1001
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
it's not surprising that you're 
overwhelmed by negative emotion and to 

1002
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:23,920
think about that as a psychiatric 
malfunction is a major error,

1003
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,520
but anyways,
it's a side issue with regards to this 

1004
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,001
study.
The effects of Psilocybin were studied 

1005
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:37,441
in 51 cancer patients with life 
threatening diagnosis and symptoms of 

1006
01:05:37,441 --> 01:05:40,891
depression and or anxiety.
I cannot imagine how they got this 

1007
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:43,000
through an ethics committee.
It's just we're going to take people who

1008
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:48,001
have uncertain diagnosis of cancer that 
are potentially life threatening and 

1009
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:48,940
we're going to give them psychedelics.
It's like,

1010
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,390
but they did it.
They did it and I think it's a testament

1011
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:57,340
to griffiths stature as a researcher 
that that that was allowable.

1012
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,580
This was a randomized double blind 
crossover trial.

1013
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,430
Very carefully designed clinical 
investigation.

1014
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:09,300
People were assigned to the treatment 
group or the drug group or the non drug 

1015
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,051
group randomly blindly and investigated 
the effects of the drug.

1016
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:19,830
Also with different doses,
which is another hallmark of a well 

1017
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:22,241
designed pharmacological study.
Very low placebo like dos one or three 

1018
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:27,271
milligrams per 70 kilograms of body 
weight versus a high dose 22 or 30 

1019
01:06:27,271 --> 01:06:31,621
milligrams per 70 kilograms of of 
siliciden chemical psilocybin 

1020
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:36,810
administered and counterbalance sequence
with five weeks between sessions in a 

1021
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:40,291
six month follow up instruction to 
participants and staff minimized the 

1022
01:06:41,471 --> 01:06:44,770
effects of expectancy participants,
staff and community observers,

1023
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:49,771
rated participant moods,
attitudes and behaviors throughout the 

1024
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:52,951
study,
and it's also the hallmark of a well 

1025
01:06:52,951 --> 01:06:55,321
designed study because they didn't rely 
on a single source of information for 

1026
01:06:55,321 --> 01:06:55,420
the outcome data.
Right?

1027
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:56,950
They got self reports,
that's fine,

1028
01:06:56,951 --> 01:07:01,951
but they had relatively objective 
observers also gather data at the same 

1029
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:06,241
time,
high dose psilocybin produced large 

1030
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:09,721
decreases in clinician and self related 
measures of depressed mood and anxiety 

1031
01:07:09,721 --> 01:07:13,950
along with increases in quality of life,
life meaning and optimism and decreases 

1032
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:16,780
in death anxiety.
That's an interesting.

1033
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:20,650
It's a subtle and scientifically spar 
statement,

1034
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:25,651
but it's a very interesting one.
It was the in there's a.

1035
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:28,630
there's an intimation of a causal 
relationship here,

1036
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:32,740
increases in quality of life life 
meaning and decreases in death,

1037
01:07:32,741 --> 01:07:33,400
anxiety.

1038
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:41,610
I mean,
the intimation there is that one of the 

1039
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:42,580
ways of decreasing your anxiety about 
death is to increase the felt meaning in

1040
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:46,990
your life and the psilocybin dose just 
potentiate that,

1041
01:07:46,991 --> 01:07:51,991
but it's a good thing to know in a 
general manner if it happens to be a 

1042
01:07:51,991 --> 01:07:52,000
generalizable truth,
right?

1043
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:55,480
If you're terrified of mortality,
terrified of vulnerability,

1044
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:01,260
there's always the possibility that the 
life path that you're following isn't 

1045
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,490
rich enough,
the buffer you against the negative 

1046
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:09,720
element of existence.
It's a reasonable hypothesis and an 

1047
01:08:09,821 --> 01:08:14,821
optimistic one.
I think although a difficult one at six 

1048
01:08:14,821 --> 01:08:17,611
month followup,
these changes were sustained with about 

1049
01:08:17,611 --> 01:08:19,850
80 percent of participants continuing to
show clinically significant decreases in

1050
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:24,851
depressed mood and anxiety.
Stephen Ross commenting about this,

1051
01:08:25,371 --> 01:08:30,371
he was a co investigator,
said it is simply unprecedented in 

1052
01:08:30,371 --> 01:08:33,221
psychiatry that a single dose of a 
medicine produces these kinds of 

1053
01:08:33,221 --> 01:08:33,780
dramatic and enduring results,
right?

1054
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:38,420
Which means we have no idea why this 
happens.

1055
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:45,110
Participants in attributed improvements 
and attitudes about life slash self,

1056
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:46,100
mood,
relationships,

1057
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:51,400
and spirituality to the high dose 
experience with more than 80 percent 

1058
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:56,021
endorsing moderately or greater,
increased wellbeing in life 

1059
01:08:56,021 --> 01:08:57,290
satisfaction.
Community observers showed corresponding

1060
01:08:57,291 --> 01:09:02,291
changes,
mystical type silent psilocybin 

1061
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:05,840
experience on session day mediated the 
effect of Psilocybin dose on therapeutic

1062
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,610
outcomes.
What that means is that,

1063
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:13,450
well,
when researchers were trying to look at 

1064
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:14,690
a causal relationship between drug 
ingestion and the positive outcome,

1065
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,080
the causal relationship was drug 
ingestion,

1066
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:19,910
mystical experience,
positive outcome.

1067
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,370
It wasn't drug ingestion,
positive outcome.

1068
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:27,020
There had to be the experience produced 
by the pharmaceutical agent in order for

1069
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:29,960
the pharmaceutical agent to have had its
effect.

1070
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,520
Now we don't.
Again,

1071
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:34,730
we don't know why that is either.
Maybe some people needed a higher dose.

1072
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:39,760
Who knows because people vary 
tremendously in their sensitivity to 

1073
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:40,370
pharmaceutical substances.
Now,

1074
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,780
why am I telling you all this?

1075
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:47,020
Well,
I'm telling you for a variety of 

1076
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,331
reasons.
One is the first is make no mistake 

1077
01:09:49,331 --> 01:09:52,370
about it.
Human beings have the capacity for forms

1078
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:57,371
of consciousness that are radically 
unlike our normative forms of 

1079
01:09:57,371 --> 01:10:00,671
consciousness and the evidence that 
those alternative forms of consciousness

1080
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,360
are purely pathological,
which is the simplest explanation,

1081
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:10,361
right?
You perturb the system produces 

1082
01:10:10,361 --> 01:10:10,361
pathology,
that's negative.

1083
01:10:10,361 --> 01:10:14,150
That is the simplest explanation.
The evidence for that is weak at best.

1084
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:17,870
Leaving out the bad trip issue,
which which is non trivial,

1085
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:23,530
the empirical evidence as it accrues in 
fact seems to suggest that the 

1086
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:27,290
consequence of mystical,
positive mystical experiences associated

1087
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:30,830
with psychedelic intake is 
overwhelmingly positive.

1088
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:35,831
Even in extreme situations and you 
really can't find a more extreme 

1089
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:39,041
situation than uncertain cancer 
diagnosis with concomitant and 

1090
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:41,520
depression and anxiety.
Like.

1091
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:45,020
I mean that's not as bad as it gets,
but it gets kind of in the ballpark.

1092
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:48,230
And so the fact that even under 
circumstances like that,

1093
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:53,620
there was the overwhelming probability 
that the experience would be positive 

1094
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,170
because that's another thing you 
wouldn't expect.

1095
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:59,171
You know,
even from some of the earlier earliest 

1096
01:10:59,171 --> 01:10:59,900
discussions about psychedelic use that 
were put forth by people,

1097
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:04,340
including Timothy leary describing the 
importance of set.

1098
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:09,370
Right so that the early experimenters 
noted that if you had a psychedelic 

1099
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:13,620
experience and you were in a bad state 
or in a bad place,

1100
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:16,530
that that was one of the precursors to a
bad trip.

1101
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:21,531
That the negative emotion that you 
entered the experience with could be 

1102
01:11:21,531 --> 01:11:25,170
magnified tremendously by the,
by the chemical substances.

1103
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:28,500
So that it was necessary to be somewhere
safe.

1104
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:31,230
To be around people that you trust,
to be in a familiar environment,

1105
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:36,210
to get all the variables that you 
couldn't control under control,

1106
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:41,540
but here's a situation where that isn't 
what's happening at all because people 

1107
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:45,201
have this cancer diagnosis of a cancer 
diagnosis of unspecified outcome and 

1108
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:47,220
they still,
the vast majority of them had a positive

1109
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:52,221
experience and the positive experience 
experience had long lasting positive 

1110
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:52,680
consequences.

1111
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:58,340
So,
so the case that the transcendent 

1112
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:02,070
experience is not real,
that's wrong.

1113
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:08,390
It's real.
Now we don't know what that means 

1114
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,510
because it actually challenges to some 
degree our concepts of what constitutes 

1115
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:14,721
real,
but it certainly well within the realm 

1116
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:16,710
of normative human experience.
So it's part of the human capacity.

1117
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:21,980
And you know,
there there's been other neurological 

1118
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:21,980
experiments to.
There's,

1119
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:22,260
there's a researcher,
Canadian researcher,

1120
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:23,940
if I remember correctly,
who invented something.

1121
01:12:23,941 --> 01:12:28,941
He called the God helmet and it used 
electromagnetic stimulation,

1122
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:32,850
brain stimulation to induce mystical 
experiences.

1123
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:38,180
Now,
I don't remember what part of the brain 

1124
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:38,180
he was shutting off or activating with 
that particular gadget,

1125
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:41,100
but and you know,
there's,

1126
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:41,720
there's,
there's,

1127
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:46,830
there's,
there's all sorts of other indications 

1128
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,911
of this sort of thing that have cropped 
up in other domains of the neurological 

1129
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:51,810
literature.
For example.

1130
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,560
It's very common for people who are 
epileptic to have religious experiences 

1131
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:01,170
as part of the prodromal to the actual 
seizure.

1132
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:03,480
That was the case with Dostoyevsky,
for example,

1133
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:08,810
who had incredibly intense religious 
experiences that would culminate an 

1134
01:13:08,881 --> 01:13:13,320
epileptic seizure and he said that they 
were of sufficient quality that he would

1135
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:18,321
give up his whole life to have had the.
And the funny thing too is that in my 

1136
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:23,451
reading of Dostoevsky at least is that I
think that epileptic seizures and the 

1137
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:28,581
associated mystical experiences were 
part of what made him a transcendently 

1138
01:13:28,581 --> 01:13:32,721
brilliant author.
I don't think that he would have broken 

1139
01:13:32,721 --> 01:13:35,151
through into the domains of insight that
he possessed without those strange 

1140
01:13:35,151 --> 01:13:39,711
neurological experiences.
And it was certainly not the case that 

1141
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:43,281
his epilepsy or the experiences that 
were associated with it produced what 

1142
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:48,501
you might describe as an impairment in 
his cognitive function is quite the 

1143
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:48,840
contrary.
At least that's how it looks to me.

1144
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:58,400
Here's another.
Here's another something worth 

1145
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:58,560
considering.
I don't know how important it is,

1146
01:13:58,561 --> 01:14:02,400
but it might be really important.
It depends on how important this is.

1147
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:05,670
Something that Carl Jung said.
So it depends on how important youngest,

1148
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:11,570
now Freud established the field of 
psychoanalysis and with an 

1149
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:17,370
investigation,
I would say rigorous investigation into 

1150
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:21,691
the contents of the unconscious and 
modern psychologists and psychiatrists 

1151
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:21,691
like to.

1152
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,220
What would you say denigrate Freud,
but.

1153
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:30,260
And I think there's a reason for that.
I think that Freud's fundamental 

1154
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:33,101
insights were so profound and so 
valuable that they got immediately 

1155
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,460
absorbed into our culture and now they 
seem self evident.

1156
01:14:34,461 --> 01:14:35,960
And so that all that's left of Freud,
his,

1157
01:14:35,961 --> 01:14:37,660
his errors.
No,

1158
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:42,661
because we believe everything else.
We believe all the profound things he 

1159
01:14:42,661 --> 01:14:42,770
discovered,
we just take them for granted.

1160
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:46,310
And so we don't believe the things that 
he said that weren't quite on the money.

1161
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:49,160
And that's all we credit with him with 
now,

1162
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:54,430
but he was certainly the first person 
who brought up the idea of the 

1163
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:58,240
unconscious in a in a rigorous manner,
and he was the first person to do a 

1164
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:02,471
rigorous examination of dreams because 
the interpretation of dreams is a great 

1165
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:02,840
book.
It's well worth reading,

1166
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:08,500
and he was the first person to note that
people were in some sense inhabited by 

1167
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,671
subpersonalities that had a certain 
degree of autonomy and independent life.

1168
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:18,190
Brilliant observation.
The cognitive psychologists haven't 

1169
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:20,621
caught up with that at all yet.
Ewan was profoundly affected by Freud.

1170
01:15:23,231 --> 01:15:25,780
Jung was profoundly affected by nature 
and by Freud.

1171
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:29,950
Those were his two main intellectual 
influences.

1172
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:35,730
I don't think one more than the other.
He split with Freud on the religious 

1173
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:41,821
issue.
That was what caused the disruption in 

1174
01:15:41,821 --> 01:15:44,551
their relationship.
And I think it's an extremely 

1175
01:15:44,551 --> 01:15:46,480
interesting historical occurrence.
It might be a profound significance.

1176
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:52,290
Freud believed that the fundamental myth
of the human being was the Eda Pole 

1177
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,830
myth.
And the myth

1178
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,800
from a broader perspective is a failed 
hero's story.

1179
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:03,230
So the eatable myth is the myth of a man
who develops who grows up,

1180
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:07,700
but then accidentally becomes too close 
to his mother,

1181
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,130
sleeps with her,
he doesn't know who she is,

1182
01:16:10,131 --> 01:16:13,670
and as a consequence blinds himself and 
there's a,

1183
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:19,450
there's a,
there's a warning about human 

1184
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:22,301
development gone wrong in that story and
I think that Freud put his finger on it 

1185
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:26,440
extraordinarily well because human 
beings have a very long period of 

1186
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,850
dependency.
And one of the things that you do see in

1187
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:33,851
clinical practice is that many people's 
problems are associated with their 

1188
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
inability to break free of their family.
Like they're consumed by the family 

1189
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,160
drama,
right?

1190
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:43,400
They can't get beyond what happened to 
them in their family.

1191
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,610
They're stuck in the past.
It's.

1192
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,650
And that's,
that's equivalent symbolically speaking,

1193
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,950
you might say to the idea of being too 
close to your mother of,

1194
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:57,070
of,
of the boundaries being improperly 

1195
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:57,070
specified.

1196
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,820
And that happens far more often than 
anyone would like to think.

1197
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:02,150
As I said for I thought it was a 
universal,

1198
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:07,880
but you see,
he had a different idea and his idea was

1199
01:17:07,881 --> 01:17:11,660
that it wasn't the hero story.
That was the universal human myth.

1200
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:16,010
It was the successful hero's story and 
that's a big difference.

1201
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:21,370
I could seriously a big difference 
because the successful hero story is 

1202
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:27,720
your member in sleeping beauty.
You may remember this in the Disney 

1203
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,271
movie,
the evil queen traps the prince in a 

1204
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:31,760
dungeon and she's not going to let them 
out till he's old.

1205
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:36,761
Right?
And so there's this comical scene where 

1206
01:17:36,761 --> 01:17:37,520
she's down in the dungeon,
he's all in chains and she's laughing at

1207
01:17:37,521 --> 01:17:42,521
him,
telling him what his future is going to 

1208
01:17:42,521 --> 01:17:42,950
be like.
She's quite evil and you know,

1209
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,290
she,
she paints this wonderful picture of him

1210
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:48,700
being freed in like 80 years and 
hobbling out of the castle on his,

1211
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:51,920
his horse that's so old,
he can barely stand up and him with gray

1212
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:52,250
hair.

1213
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,340
And,
and you know,

1214
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:58,380
she,
she recites this story of his eventual 

1215
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,640
triumphant departure from the castle as 
a old and decrepit man.

1216
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,950
And she has a great laugh about it and 
it's nice,

1217
01:18:03,951 --> 01:18:05,300
you know,
it's a real punchy story.

1218
01:18:05,301 --> 01:18:07,370
It's really something wonderful for 
children.

1219
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:12,670
That story and he gets free of the 
shackles and the things that freedom our

1220
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:21,020
three little female ferries,
the positive aspect of the feminine that

1221
01:18:21,021 --> 01:18:26,021
frees him from the dungeon,
so it's very interesting and very 

1222
01:18:26,021 --> 01:18:26,360
accurate from a psychological 
perspective.

1223
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:31,361
It's the negative element of the 
feminine that encapsulates him in the 

1224
01:18:31,361 --> 01:18:33,740
dungeon and it's the positive element of
the feminine and that frees him and then

1225
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:35,450
he.
He has a queen.

1226
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,150
The Evil Queen is not very happy when he
escapes.

1227
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:43,151
You may remember that she stands on top 
of her castle tower and starts to spin 

1228
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,600
off cosmic sparks.
I mean,

1229
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:49,601
she's quite the creature enveloped in 
flame and then she turns into a dragon 

1230
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:54,130
and she then the prince has to fight 
with her in order to make contact with 

1231
01:18:55,041 --> 01:19:00,041
sleeping beauty and an awakened her from
her comatose existence as her 

1232
01:19:00,981 --> 01:19:05,981
unconscious existence and wants a 
brilliant.

1233
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:10,850
It's a brilliant representation of a 
successful hero myth.

1234
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:16,180
He,
he doesn't end up staying in an unholy 

1235
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:22,091
relationship with his mother.
Let's say he escapes and then conquers 

1236
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:28,931
the worst thing that can be imagined and
is ennobled by that and that as a 

1237
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:34,211
consequence,
he's able to wake the slumbering 

1238
01:19:34,211 --> 01:19:37,211
feminine from its coma and that's a 
union story and that's the story that he

1239
01:19:38,181 --> 01:19:42,620
juxtaposed against Freud.
See Freud thought of religious phenomena

1240
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:46,220
as part of an old tide.
That would be,

1241
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:47,780
that would drown.
Rationality,

1242
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:52,840
rationality.
That's why Freud was so vehemently anti 

1243
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,260
religious and you thought,
no,

1244
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:00,280
it's not the case.
You're throwing the baby out with the 

1245
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,441
bathwater.
There's something profound and central 

1246
01:20:02,441 --> 01:20:07,000
to the hero myth and union clinical work
is essentially the awakening of the hero

1247
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:13,380
myth in the,
in the analysis and in the client or the

1248
01:20:13,381 --> 01:20:18,381
patient to conceptualize yourself as 
that which can confront chaos and 

1249
01:20:18,661 --> 01:20:23,661
triumph and that that's associated with 
an ennobling of the of consciousness and

1250
01:20:24,241 --> 01:20:25,800
the establishment of pop.

1251
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:29,130
Proper positive relationships between 
male and female.

1252
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,670
And you know,
I'm a skeptical person.

1253
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:38,330
I'm a very,
very skeptical person and I've tried 

1254
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:42,491
with every trick.
I have to put a lever underneath young 

1255
01:20:42,491 --> 01:20:45,680
story and lifted up and disrupt it and 
I,

1256
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:50,880
I can't do it.
I think he was right and that Freud was 

1257
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:50,880
wrong.
I mean,

1258
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,801
I have great respect for Freud.
I think he got the progam problem 

1259
01:20:54,801 --> 01:20:57,861
diagnosed very,
very nicely and in my clinical work I 

1260
01:20:57,861 --> 01:21:00,210
see the phenomena that Freud described 
emerged continually,

1261
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:03,510
constantly the best.
If you're interested in that,

1262
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:06,510
there's a documentary you should watch.
I may have mentioned it before.

1263
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,460
I think it's the best documentary ever 
made.

1264
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:13,530
Certainly the best one I've ever seen.
It's called crumb and it's about a 

1265
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,030
underground cartoonists.
Robert Crumb,

1266
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:17,730
who who is part of the hippie movement 
in,

1267
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,880
although he hated hippies,
he was part of the hippie movement in 

1268
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,540
the sixties in San Francisco and started
the entire underground comic.

1269
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:30,900
What culture that that manifested itself
eventually in graphic novels,

1270
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:36,170
there's quite a significant figure from 
the perspective of popular art and a 

1271
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:41,421
very,
very intelligent man and also I would 

1272
01:21:41,421 --> 01:21:44,121
say a hero,
although a very bent and depraved and 

1273
01:21:44,121 --> 01:21:47,331
warped one.
Someone very acutely aware of his own 

1274
01:21:47,331 --> 01:21:50,811
shadow and the documentary outlines his 
attempts to escape from his absolutely 

1275
01:21:52,651 --> 01:21:57,651
dreadful mother and the failure of his 
two brothers to do the same thing.

1276
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,770
One of whom ended up as a street beggar 
in San Francisco and the other who drank

1277
01:22:01,771 --> 01:22:04,890
furniture Polish and died six months 
after the documentary was produced.

1278
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,830
It's an unbelievably shocking 
documentary.

1279
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:13,010
It's the only piece of film that I've 
ever seen that captures Friday and 

1280
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:19,851
pathology.
I've never seen anything because he 

1281
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:20,670
can't see it generally,
unless you're in a clinical situation,

1282
01:22:20,671 --> 01:22:22,770
unless you know the details of someone's
lives,

1283
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,890
the personal intimate details,
you cannot communicate it,

1284
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:30,360
but the documentary as who made the film
was Robert Ziegler off,

1285
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:33,780
if I remember correctly,
was a friend of the crumbs and so he got

1286
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:38,781
access in a way that no one else would 
have and they were also very forthright 

1287
01:22:38,781 --> 01:22:39,360
and forthcoming about their situation.

1288
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,810
In general.
I would highly recommend that it's.

1289
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:45,960
It's a real punch.
If you want to know how a rapist thinks,

1290
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:49,920
like if you actually want to know,
because maybe you don't want to know.

1291
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,540
In fact,
you probably don't want to know,

1292
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:54,270
right?
Because do you really want to know that?

1293
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:59,870
Because to understand that means to put 
yourself in that position and to 

1294
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:02,631
understand it.
If you really want to know how a serial 

1295
01:23:02,631 --> 01:23:05,361
sexual Predator thinks and why,
if you watch crum and pay attention,

1296
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:11,290
you'll know and that's only a tiny bit 
of what the film has to offer.

1297
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,970
It's really quite remarkable.

1298
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:15,310
Anyways,

1299
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:24,240
young split with Freud on the issue of 
the oedipal story as the fundamental 

1300
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:31,081
myth of humankind and on the issue of 
the validity of the religious viewpoint 

1301
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:38,130
and young came down heavily on the side 
of the validity of the religious 

1302
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:42,001
viewpoint and he established that in a 
book called symbols of transformation 

1303
01:23:42,001 --> 01:23:44,440
which was written in 1914,
and that's the book that broke,

1304
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:48,280
that produced the break permanent split 
with Freud and that book,

1305
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:52,330
I would say that books actually been 
written three times.

1306
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:58,410
It was written as symbols of trip four 
times written as symbols of 

1307
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:01,081
transformation,
which young extensively revised when he 

1308
01:24:01,081 --> 01:24:03,481
was old,
and then it was rewritten in is in a 

1309
01:24:03,481 --> 01:24:04,840
sense by a student of Yoga called Eric 
Norman,

1310
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:07,930
who is also something someone I would 
really recommend.

1311
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:10,480
Eric Norman,
I think is [inaudible] greatest student,

1312
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:16,470
and he wrote two books.
He wrote one called the origins and 

1313
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:19,561
history of consciousness,
which is a description of the 

1314
01:24:19,561 --> 01:24:19,990
development of consciousness,
out of unconsciousness,

1315
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:23,870
using the hero myth as a,
as an as a,

1316
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:24,890
as a,
as a,

1317
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,800
what would you say as a,
as an interpretive skeleton,

1318
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:32,810
so Newman viewed the hero myth as the 
dramatized story of the emergence of 

1319
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:39,331
human consciousness out of the 
surrounding unconsciousness in which it 

1320
01:24:39,331 --> 01:24:40,420
was embedded,
the struggle for consciousness,

1321
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:43,090
the struggle of consciousness upward 
towards the light,

1322
01:24:43,091 --> 01:24:48,091
like a lotus flower struggles up through
the muck and they and the water to to 

1323
01:24:48,091 --> 01:24:51,850
lay itself on the surface of the water 
and and bloom and reveal the Buddha,

1324
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:57,090
which is of course what the lotus flower
does from a symbolic perspective and 

1325
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:57,090
for,
for for Norman.

1326
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:00,140
The hero's story was the story of the 
development,

1327
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:05,150
the successful development of 
consciousness and the origins of 

1328
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:05,560
consciousness.
The origins and history of consciousness

1329
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:08,230
is a great book.
Interestingly,

1330
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:13,580
Camille Paglia row read the origins and 
history of consciousness.

1331
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:18,290
She's one of the few mainstream 
intellectuals that I've ever encountered

1332
01:25:18,291 --> 01:25:23,291
who read that and commented on it,
and she believed that it would be 

1333
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:27,461
sufficient antidote to postmodern 
denigration of literature.

1334
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,990
She thought it was that powerful work 
and I believe that.

1335
01:25:32,991 --> 01:25:37,991
I think it's a remarkable book.
Carl Jung wrote the foreword to that 

1336
01:25:37,991 --> 01:25:42,401
book and he said in the forward that it 
was the book that he wished he would 

1337
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:42,920
have written,
so it's sort of like young.

1338
01:25:42,921 --> 01:25:44,990
He wrote,
I don't remember how many volumes,

1339
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:49,890
dozens of very thick,
difficult volumes was.

1340
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,120
Norman was able to

1341
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:58,610
what?
Distill those into a single volume 

1342
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:02,211
statement,
and so I would also say if you're 

1343
01:26:02,211 --> 01:26:02,211
interested in young,
the best book to read is the origins and

1344
01:26:02,211 --> 01:26:07,011
history of consciousness.
It's the best intro into into the union 

1345
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:07,011
world.
Soon,

1346
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:10,520
it's very difficult to,
very difficult to understand.

1347
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:14,660
It requires a real shift of perspective 
in order to understand what he's talking

1348
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:17,690
about.
And Norman wrote another book called the

1349
01:26:17,691 --> 01:26:22,691
great mother,
which is a little bit more specialized 

1350
01:26:22,691 --> 01:26:26,591
in some sense,
but it's also extremely interesting 

1351
01:26:26,591 --> 01:26:28,631
because it fleshes out the archetype of 
chaos and its representation as feminine

1352
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:34,990
and it's a brilliant book as well and 
highly highly worth reading both those 

1353
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:37,160
books.
Anyways,

1354
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:44,020
young was a very strange person and a 
visionary and and so that's kept them 

1355
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:47,390
outside of the academic realm almost 
entirely.

1356
01:26:47,391 --> 01:26:52,391
I mean,
I was constantly warned as an 

1357
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:54,401
undergraduate and then a graduate 
student and then a professor against 

1358
01:26:54,401 --> 01:26:57,320
ever talking about young in any way 
whatsoever.

1359
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:59,990
When I went on the job market,
when I was at mcgill,

1360
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:05,410
when I had graduated from mcgill,
I had done my scientific research and 

1361
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:07,010
analysis a holism and I had a fairly 
lengthy publication record that was pure

1362
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:12,011
empirical research and really neuro 
physiological research into the 

1363
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:18,191
pharmacology of alcoholism and I 
established a reasonably solid dossier 

1364
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:25,530
publications,
but at the same time I was writing this 

1365
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:28,001
book that became maps of meaning and so 
I'd split my time in graduate student 

1366
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:28,700
school.
Between these two endeavors.

1367
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:33,701
One very specifically neurological and 
pharmacological and really biologically 

1368
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:37,970
based and the other very abstract 
religious,

1369
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:39,410
symbolic,
psychoanalytic,

1370
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:45,190
the complete opposite,
but I could see that the two things 

1371
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:48,520
overlapped really nicely and there was a
number of scientists at the time that 

1372
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:52,631
we're also drawing the same conclusions,
the same relationship between the 

1373
01:27:52,631 --> 01:27:57,371
biology and the psychoanalysis.
Jaak Panksepp who wrote a book called 

1374
01:27:57,371 --> 01:27:58,730
affective neuroscience,
which is a great classic,

1375
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:04,120
is one of those people who who saw the 
relationship between the neurobiology of

1376
01:28:04,401 --> 01:28:09,401
emotion and motivation and the 
psychoanalytic insights never became a 

1377
01:28:09,401 --> 01:28:10,940
mainstream view,
but I think it's too complex.

1378
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:15,940
I think that bridging the gap between 
the biology and the and the symbolic is 

1379
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:17,660
too much for people.
Generally speaking,

1380
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:22,690
you know,
it was certainly virtually too much for 

1381
01:28:22,690 --> 01:28:22,690
me because I got quite ill when I was a 
graduate student.

1382
01:28:22,690 --> 01:28:27,670
I think for a variety of reasons.
I also would go out and party three 

1383
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:28,340
nights a week and so that probably had 
something to do with it,

1384
01:28:28,341 --> 01:28:33,341
but,
but working on those two things 

1385
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:34,760
simultaneously was also rather 
exhausting.

1386
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:40,150
Now you was a tremendously insightful 
clinician and he was a strange person,

1387
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:42,170
introverted,
visionary,

1388
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,300
high and introversion,
very,

1389
01:28:44,301 --> 01:28:44,930
very,
very,

1390
01:28:44,931 --> 01:28:46,490
very,
very high in openness,

1391
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:50,240
like off the charts and also God only 
knows what his Iq was.

1392
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:51,890
I mean,
every time I read young,

1393
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,530
it's like reading Nietzsche.
It's terrifying because you know,

1394
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:59,540
he's,
he's so damn smart that he can think up 

1395
01:28:59,540 --> 01:28:59,600
answers to questions that you don't 
even.

1396
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,560
It's not like you don't understand 
answers.

1397
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:06,561
This is the,
you never conceptualized the damn 

1398
01:29:06,561 --> 01:29:06,561
questions.
It's really something to read.

1399
01:29:06,561 --> 01:29:06,600
Someone like that,
right?

1400
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:07,530
Who says,
well,

1401
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:08,820
here's a mystery and you think,
wow,

1402
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:11,880
I'd never thought of that is a mystery,
and here's the solution.

1403
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,140
It's like,
okay,

1404
01:29:13,141 --> 01:29:13,990
that's,
that's,

1405
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:20,340
that's something you know,
and he could read Greek and he could 

1406
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:20,940
read.
He read all the ancient.

1407
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:25,410
He read a very large variety of ancient 
languages and was very familiar with the

1408
01:29:25,411 --> 01:29:30,411
entire corpus of,
of astrological thought and of l 

1409
01:29:30,411 --> 01:29:34,821
chemical thought and of classic 
literature and Biblical stories.

1410
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:39,750
And I mean educated in a way that no one
is educated now,

1411
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:44,280
and so he's very daunting person to 
encounter and terrifying.

1412
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:47,700
Absolutely terrifying.
His Book Ion,

1413
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:52,290
which is the second volume of the second
volume of volume nine,

1414
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:54,210
which is the archetypes of the 
collective unconscious.

1415
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,180
That damn book has just absolutely 
terrifying because young,

1416
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:01,770
he's one of these visionaries who can 
see way underneath the social structures

1417
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:06,771
and look at patterns that are developing
across for you in young's case across 

1418
01:30:06,771 --> 01:30:09,060
thousands of years and lays them out and
so that's a really.

1419
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:13,260
That's really something to to encounter.
Ion is a terrifying book.

1420
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,970
Anyways,
one question might be,

1421
01:30:17,971 --> 01:30:19,190
well,
because I read the organ,

1422
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,850
I think,
how the hell did he know these things?

1423
01:30:20,851 --> 01:30:24,270
How could he figure these things out?
I can't understand how he could possibly

1424
01:30:24,271 --> 01:30:26,610
know these things.
Well,

1425
01:30:26,611 --> 01:30:31,611
here's a partial answer.
Young was a visionary,

1426
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:34,470
and so what that means as far as I can 
tell,

1427
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,430
and we could do a little quick survey 
here.

1428
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:42,350
How many of you think you think in words
and put up your hand.

1429
01:30:42,351 --> 01:30:43,410
See,
do you think in words?

1430
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:46,250
Okay,
so it looks like.

1431
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:48,680
What about pictures?
How many of you think in pictures?

1432
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:51,310
Okay,
so that's interesting.

1433
01:30:51,311 --> 01:30:53,440
How many of you think that's about half 
and half by the way?

1434
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:58,560
Probably have fewer on the word side.
How many of you think in pictures and 

1435
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:58,560
words?

1436
01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:00,100
Okay,
so all right,

1437
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:02,380
so it was roughly a third in each 
category,

1438
01:31:02,381 --> 01:31:07,381
but that's also something that I really 
haven't encountered any research on from

1439
01:31:07,841 --> 01:31:09,880
the neuropsychological perspective.
It's like,

1440
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,130
well,
do you think in pictures or do you think

1441
01:31:12,131 --> 01:31:17,131
it words and.
And is that actually a reliable 

1442
01:31:17,131 --> 01:31:19,711
distinction?
I think I think in words most of the 

1443
01:31:19,711 --> 01:31:23,341
time,
but I can think in pictures like if I'm 

1444
01:31:23,341 --> 01:31:25,891
trying to build something,
I can think in pictures very almost 

1445
01:31:25,891 --> 01:31:28,921
instantaneously,
but it isn't my natural mode of 

1446
01:31:28,921 --> 01:31:31,081
thinking.
I'm hyperverbal and so my natural mode 

1447
01:31:31,081 --> 01:31:31,081
of thinking is to think everything 
through in words,

1448
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:36,450
but I know my wife doesn't like that.
She thinks in images and then has to 

1449
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:38,530
translate them into words and so 
anyways,

1450
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,320
you was very literate and he could 
really think in words,

1451
01:31:41,321 --> 01:31:46,321
but he could really think in images.
Also talking to my wife quite 

1452
01:31:46,321 --> 01:31:50,011
extensively like her,
the intensity of her visualization 

1453
01:31:50,011 --> 01:31:51,190
vastly exceeds mine.

1454
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:56,370
So for example,
if I close my eyes and then try to 

1455
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:58,381
imagine the crowd in front of me,
it's pretty low resolution and vague and

1456
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,890
brilliantly colored and vivid.
You know what it's.

1457
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,720
It's like I'm seeing through a glass 
darkly,

1458
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:08,620
let's say I can't bring images to mind 
with that with spectacular clarity,

1459
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:13,621
but my wife is very good at that and 
young seem to be absolutely a genius at 

1460
01:32:14,651 --> 01:32:19,651
that kind of thinking and he had a lot 
of visionaries in his family history as 

1461
01:32:19,651 --> 01:32:20,590
well.
So I don't know to what degree there's a

1462
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:24,270
hereditary component of that and I don't
know to what degree that's actually like

1463
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:29,340
a neurological specialization,
I presume that would be associated with 

1464
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:32,260
the trade.
Openness distinguishes itself,

1465
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:35,620
differentiates itself into interest in 
ideas and interest in in statics.

1466
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:40,621
And my suspicion are is that the people 
who are more interested in aesthetics 

1467
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,600
are the visionary types,
the ones that think in images anyways.

1468
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:46,720
You could really think in images and he 
could imagine beings.

1469
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:52,320
And I had a client once who was a lucid 
dreamer and how many of you have had a 

1470
01:32:53,111 --> 01:32:54,160
lucid dream?
So you know,

1471
01:32:54,161 --> 01:32:59,161
you're dreaming while you're many that 
that phenomena wasn't really even even 

1472
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:03,970
identified as a phenomenon until the end
of the 19th century.

1473
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:09,060
There was a book written about it that 
Freud tried to get his hands on but 

1474
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:09,310
couldn't because it was a very rare 
book.

1475
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:14,490
And then there was a researcher about 30
years ago who started to study lucid 

1476
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:15,100
dreams.
But anyways,

1477
01:33:15,101 --> 01:33:20,101
I had a client who was a lucid dreamer 
and one of the things she could do was 

1478
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:25,200
ask her dream characters what 
information they were trying to convey 

1479
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:30,360
and they would tell her.
So that was very interesting and one of 

1480
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:34,951
the consequences of that was,
and I don't have the story completely 

1481
01:33:34,951 --> 01:33:35,320
right in my memory,
but it's close enough.

1482
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,890
She was afraid of a very large number of
things.

1483
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:44,400
And in her dream,
I think it was a gypsy standing by a 

1484
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:48,360
wagon,
told her that if she was going to be 

1485
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:52,891
successful in university,
that she would have to visit a 

1486
01:33:52,891 --> 01:33:57,181
slaughterhouse.
And that was something that was way 

1487
01:33:57,181 --> 01:33:58,960
beyond her capacity to tolerate.
She was a vegetarian.

1488
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:00,970
She couldn't stand the sight of raw meat
even.

1489
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,840
And so,
and she was very oppressed and depressed

1490
01:34:04,841 --> 01:34:08,590
and anxious because of the 
slaughterhouse nature of existence.

1491
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:13,950
And so her dream focused on that and one
of the consequences of that,

1492
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:18,040
because the slaughter house was out of 
the question as a clinical intervention,

1493
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:20,920
um,
I took her to an embalming,

1494
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:23,250
right?
Because,

1495
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:25,060
because I asked her,
I asked her what,

1496
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,150
what,
what might be equivalent to that.

1497
01:34:28,151 --> 01:34:31,030
And so she suggested that.
And you know,

1498
01:34:31,031 --> 01:34:33,760
exposure therapy is a hallmark of 
clinical psychology,

1499
01:34:33,761 --> 01:34:34,030
right?

1500
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:38,110
One of the things you do with people as 
a clinician is you find out what they're

1501
01:34:38,111 --> 01:34:42,460
afraid of and you gradually and 
voluntarily expose them to that.

1502
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:47,640
And that cures them.
And that's associated with the hero 

1503
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:47,640
myth,
right?

1504
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,761
It's exactly the same thing.
It's like there's a dragon and it's 

1505
01:34:50,761 --> 01:34:51,280
stopping you because there's lots of 
dragons.

1506
01:34:51,281 --> 01:34:53,380
Most of them aren't stopping you.
You can ignore them.

1507
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,150
You don't have to just go,
you know,

1508
01:34:55,450 --> 01:35:00,450
slash away at randomly.
You're not supposed to be fighting 

1509
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:01,310
dragons that aren't in your way,
but if they are in your way,

1510
01:35:01,311 --> 01:35:06,311
you can't ignore them.
And then you decompose them into sub 

1511
01:35:06,311 --> 01:35:08,510
dragons and you have people you know,
take them on and as they take them on,

1512
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,680
they dispense with the dragon and they 
gain the power of the drag.

1513
01:35:11,681 --> 01:35:13,910
It's like a video game.
Actually.

1514
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:15,260
A video game is like that.

1515
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:17,690
That's why people like the video games.
Well that's right,

1516
01:35:17,691 --> 01:35:20,510
right.
There's a reason that you absorbed power

1517
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:22,760
when you overcome things,
when you play a video game.

1518
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:26,150
It's not like that's intrinsic to the 
video game structure.

1519
01:35:26,151 --> 01:35:28,580
That's an archetypal idea.
Anyways,

1520
01:35:28,581 --> 01:35:33,581
we went and saw an embalming,
which was a very interesting experience 

1521
01:35:33,581 --> 01:35:36,620
and,
and quite,

1522
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:42,070
quite useful for her because she knew 
what she could tolerate after that and 

1523
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,160
it was a hell of a lot more than she 
thought she could tolerate.

1524
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:47,690
And so that's very useful to know.
Back to you.

1525
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:52,130
He's a visionary thinker now.
My client,

1526
01:35:52,131 --> 01:35:57,131
I said she could lucid dream and she 
could ask her dream characters what they

1527
01:35:59,001 --> 01:36:01,340
wanted and what they were trying to 
communicate to her.

1528
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:03,740
So that was pretty interesting.
That happened.

1529
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:05,570
Spontaneous.
They had nothing to do with me.

1530
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:10,890
You know,
I'm interested in dreams in any of my 

1531
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:12,491
clients are great dreamers,
especially the creative ones because I 

1532
01:36:12,491 --> 01:36:15,851
think it's a hallmark of creativity to 
have vivid dreams and to be able to 

1533
01:36:15,851 --> 01:36:18,971
remember them,
but that was a faculty that was natural 

1534
01:36:18,971 --> 01:36:23,921
to her young had this other client at 
one time.

1535
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:29,710
At one point she had a variety of fears 
and she had this dream that she told me 

1536
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:33,950
and she was walking down a beach and on 
the side of the beach,

1537
01:36:33,951 --> 01:36:35,690
up a dune,
small noon.

1538
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:38,840
There was this old man with a snake,
a big python,

1539
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,450
and there's a crowd around him.
And uh,

1540
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:47,110
she was walking by the snake handler and
the snake and the crowd and she didn't 

1541
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:51,731
want to have anything to do with them.
He was sort of showing people this 

1542
01:36:51,731 --> 01:36:54,211
snake.
And she told me that dream and I 

1543
01:36:54,211 --> 01:36:54,211
thought,
well,

1544
01:36:54,211 --> 01:36:54,770
you know,
you probably need to go see that snake.

1545
01:36:55,900 --> 01:37:00,000
And so I relaxed or quasi hypnotic 
technique,

1546
01:37:00,001 --> 01:37:05,001
and it's very straightforward.
Hypnosis is generally nothing but 

1547
01:37:05,001 --> 01:37:09,370
pronounced relaxation low.
You have to be susceptible to hypnosis 

1548
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:12,791
to actually fall into a hypnotic trance.
As a consequence of being relaxed or 

1549
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:16,361
just relaxed her,
I had her breathe deeply and pay 

1550
01:37:16,361 --> 01:37:19,781
attention to different parts of her body
and just relax her muscles one by one 

1551
01:37:19,781 --> 01:37:23,321
essentially so that she could 
concentrate and then I told her we play 

1552
01:37:23,321 --> 01:37:25,250
with the dream a little bit and say 
union technique.

1553
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:26,210
I said,
well,

1554
01:37:26,211 --> 01:37:29,180
so called the dream image to mind,
which she could do quite well.

1555
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:29,930
Said,
okay,

1556
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:31,670
so let's,
let's explore it.

1557
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,600
So like pretend it's like pretend play 
in.

1558
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,800
You know,
if you're a kid in your pretend playing,

1559
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:39,610
you don't exactly direct the game,
right you,

1560
01:37:39,611 --> 01:37:41,330
you,
you play the game.

1561
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:45,230
So it's partly your direction obviously 
because you're the player,

1562
01:37:45,231 --> 01:37:50,231
but the thing also happened 
spontaneously of its own accord and you 

1563
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:54,191
can think about that as a dialogue 
between the conscious mind and the 

1564
01:37:54,191 --> 01:37:54,191
unconscious mind.
In some sense,

1565
01:37:54,191 --> 01:37:58,401
it's developmental dialogue.
It's not a fun game if you just direct 

1566
01:37:58,401 --> 01:37:58,410
it.
It's only a fun game.

1567
01:37:58,411 --> 01:38:02,420
If you're inviting in something is 
welling up as a consequences.

1568
01:38:02,421 --> 01:38:03,950
It's the same thing that happens when 
you're.

1569
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:07,770
You're engaged in some kind of artistic 
or literary production.

1570
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:10,100
If it's all top down,
you know,

1571
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:12,660
if you're forcing it then it's 
propaganda,

1572
01:38:12,661 --> 01:38:13,230
it's empty.

1573
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:18,530
What do you want to sort of put yourself
in a receptive state of mind in an 

1574
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:21,651
imaginative state of mind and it's sort 
of half you and half nature itself 

1575
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,080
manifesting itself in your creative 
imagination.

1576
01:38:25,081 --> 01:38:29,190
And that was the sort of state that we 
were striving for and she,

1577
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,910
I asked her when she was in relaxed,
I said,

1578
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:37,911
well,
what do you think about the snake 

1579
01:38:37,911 --> 01:38:37,911
handler?
And she said,

1580
01:38:37,911 --> 01:38:39,951
well,
he's probably a charlatan and he's just 

1581
01:38:39,951 --> 01:38:39,951
there trying to impress the crowd and to
show off.

1582
01:38:39,951 --> 01:38:43,971
And she was afraid to go up there 
because she thought people would push 

1583
01:38:43,971 --> 01:38:43,971
her towards the snake and she'd have to 
touch it.

1584
01:38:43,971 --> 01:38:46,200
And so there was a fear of the crowd 
issue going on there too.

1585
01:38:46,201 --> 01:38:47,920
And I said,
well just look,

1586
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:53,090
go up there,
but do it under these conditions is 

1587
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:53,090
that,
you know,

1588
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:53,910
if,
if people get pushy,

1589
01:38:53,911 --> 01:38:54,750
what are you going to tell them?

1590
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:56,580
And so we figured out something.
He said,

1591
01:38:56,581 --> 01:38:59,660
look,
just tell them that you know,

1592
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:04,740
you want to look at the snake at your 
own pace and that you don't need any 

1593
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:07,290
encouragement or help and it would be 
good if you were just left alone,

1594
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:12,291
so that enabled her to defend herself.
So she was afraid that the crowd would 

1595
01:39:12,291 --> 01:39:13,260
push her to do something that she didn't
want to do.

1596
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:15,900
That was part of the theme of the dream.
So anyway,

1597
01:39:15,901 --> 01:39:20,901
she eventually climbed the Dune in her 
imagination and went into the crowd and 

1598
01:39:20,901 --> 01:39:22,770
the crowd turned out to be quite 
welcoming and not hostile and not pushy,

1599
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:24,510
which isn't what you'd expect,
right?

1600
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:29,511
Because you'd think the crowd would have
reacted in accordance with their fears 

1601
01:39:29,511 --> 01:39:32,730
since it was her fantasy that that's the
thing about fantasies.

1602
01:39:32,731 --> 01:39:37,731
They have this autonomous quality,
but the crowd was welcoming and not 

1603
01:39:37,731 --> 01:39:39,630
hostile and it turned out that the snake
handler wasn't a charlatan.

1604
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:45,260
He was just an old guy who had this 
snake and he was out there just showing 

1605
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:48,540
it to people because he thought it was a
cool thing and and and that maybe it was

1606
01:39:48,541 --> 01:39:52,080
good for people to come and look at a 
snake and so she got close enough to the

1607
01:39:52,081 --> 01:39:53,670
snake to touch it.
And so.

1608
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:59,530
So I'm telling you that because I want 
you to understand a bit more about what 

1609
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:00,930
[inaudible] was trying to do.
And so he wrote these books,

1610
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:06,810
notebooks that haven't been published 
yet called the block books and the black

1611
01:40:06,811 --> 01:40:11,811
books are the documentation of his 
experiments with his imagination and 

1612
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:16,620
what he would do is daydream like,
like a child daydreams.

1613
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:21,980
He regained that faculty.
Although I think with us it was a 

1614
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:21,980
faculty that has never really 
disappeared.

1615
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:27,110
And he had figures of imagination that 
came to him that he could speak with.

1616
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:33,650
And he spoke with these figures of 
imagination and documented that over a 

1617
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:35,550
very long period of time.
And that was originally.

1618
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:40,670
That was eventually distilled into a 
book called the Red Book,

1619
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:44,820
which was published about three or four 
years ago.

1620
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:50,270
And it was a book that young regarded as
the central source from which all his 

1621
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:57,021
inspiration emerged,
sort of the way it looks to me is that 

1622
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,050
we embody a lot of information in our 
action,

1623
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:07,310
right?
And our action has developed as a 

1624
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:11,221
consequence of imitating other people 
and not only the people or the people 

1625
01:41:11,221 --> 01:41:15,781
around us,
but of course the people around us 

1626
01:41:15,781 --> 01:41:17,461
imitated the people who came before them
and those people in mutated the people 

1627
01:41:17,461 --> 01:41:20,941
who came before them and so on so far 
back that it's as far back as you can 

1628
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:25,591
go.
And so you embody these patterns of 

1629
01:41:25,591 --> 01:41:26,950
behavior that are extremely informative,
that you don't understand,

1630
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:30,040
that are consequences of collective 
imitation across the centuries.

1631
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:35,050
And then those patterns can become 
manifest as figures of the imagination.

1632
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:41,350
And those figures of imagination are the
distillations of patterns of behavior.

1633
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:45,910
And so as the distillations of patterns 
of behavior,

1634
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:49,060
they have content and it's not you that 
content.

1635
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:52,210
It's you could even think about it as 
content that's evolved.

1636
01:41:52,211 --> 01:41:56,200
Although it's culturally transmitted,
it's content that's evolved and so these

1637
01:41:56,201 --> 01:42:01,201
figures of the imagination can reveal 
the structure of reality to you and 

1638
01:42:01,721 --> 01:42:04,540
that's what happened with young and 
that's what he described in the red book

1639
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:07,810
and that was what permeated his 
psychology,

1640
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:13,590
psychology.
That was based on the presupposition 

1641
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:15,640
that the fundamental architectural 
structures of religious belief.

1642
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,600
We're not pathological,
not deceitful,

1643
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:24,100
not protective in some delusional sense 
against the fear of death,

1644
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:29,340
but quite the contrary,
the very stories that enabled us to move

1645
01:42:29,801 --> 01:42:34,801
forward as confident human beings in the
face of chaos itself and it's 

1646
01:42:36,641 --> 01:42:41,641
conceivable,
I think perhaps probable that nothing 

1647
01:42:41,951 --> 01:42:46,951
more important conceptually happened in 
the 20th century than that because it 

1648
01:42:48,851 --> 01:42:53,851
was the first time post enlightenment 
that ever prashant between the intellect

1649
01:42:55,871 --> 01:43:00,850
and the underlying religious archetipal 
substructure occurred.

1650
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:06,210
You have in the capacious intellect of 
young and the same thing happened to 

1651
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:10,051
some degree with piaget.
The religious domain and the factual 

1652
01:43:10,051 --> 01:43:14,371
domain were brought back together and 
the fact of young's enduring and 

1653
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:18,070
increasing popularity and influence,
I would say,

1654
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:20,950
is a direct consequence of that.
Now.

1655
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:29,250
Some of his work was spun off into the 
new age and and the new age is a very 

1656
01:43:29,381 --> 01:43:34,381
optimistic and naive movement is 
predicated on the idea that you can do 

1657
01:43:34,381 --> 01:43:36,670
nothing say,
but follow your bliss and that will take

1658
01:43:36,671 --> 01:43:41,671
you ever hire to enlightenment and 
that's not the union idea at all.

1659
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:48,510
The union idea is that what you most 
need will be found where you least want 

1660
01:43:49,061 --> 01:43:51,830
to look.
So this story,

1661
01:43:51,831 --> 01:43:52,070
King

1662
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,690
Arthur,
there's the story of King Arthur,

1663
01:43:53,691 --> 01:43:55,310
the.
They're all in a round table,

1664
01:43:55,311 --> 01:43:56,960
right?
King Arthur and his knights,

1665
01:43:56,961 --> 01:43:59,290
they're all equals.
They're all super ordinate,

1666
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:02,150
but they're all equals and they go off 
to look for the holy grail.

1667
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:07,430
The holy grail is the container of the 
redemptive substance,

1668
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:12,470
whatever that is,
might be the cup that Christ used at the

1669
01:44:12,471 --> 01:44:17,471
last supper might be jealous that was 
used to capture his blood on the cross,

1670
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:20,690
right when he was pierced by a sword.
The stories differ,

1671
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:23,210
but that's the holy grail and the holy 
grail is lost.

1672
01:44:23,211 --> 01:44:28,211
That's the redemptive substance and the 
knights of King Arthur go off to search 

1673
01:44:28,211 --> 01:44:30,020
for the holy grail and but they don't 
know where to look,

1674
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:35,560
so where do you look when you don't know
where to look for something you need 

1675
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:38,080
desperately,
but I've lost.

1676
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:43,890
Well,
each of the nights goes into the forest 

1677
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:45,751
at the point that looks darkest to him 
and that's union psychoanalysis in a 

1678
01:44:46,061 --> 01:44:51,061
nutshell.
It's like that which you fear and avoid 

1679
01:44:51,061 --> 01:44:54,781
that which you hold in contempt,
that which disgusts you and that you 

1680
01:44:54,781 --> 01:44:59,011
avoid.
That's the gateway to what you need to 

1681
01:44:59,011 --> 01:45:00,130
know.
There's nothing new agey about that.

1682
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:03,610
That's for sure.
Now,

1683
01:45:03,611 --> 01:45:05,260
young,
when he started this endeavor,

1684
01:45:06,190 --> 01:45:11,190
we started with this.
This is part of the notebooks from the 

1685
01:45:11,190 --> 01:45:11,190
block book.
He said

1686
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:15,500
he wrote my soul,
my soul.

1687
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:17,030
Where are you?
Do you hear me?

1688
01:45:17,031 --> 01:45:18,740
I speak.
I call you.

1689
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,890
Are you there?
I've returned.

1690
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:27,940
I'm here again.
I've shaken the dust of all the lands 

1691
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:29,360
from my feet and I've come to you.
I'm with you.

1692
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:35,200
After long years of long wandering,
I have come to you again for the unions.

1693
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:42,070
The Hero's journey is a journey within 
and and I think that that's probably the

1694
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:49,240
bias of introverts to believe that the 
hero's journey isn't only an inward 

1695
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:54,041
journey.
I think that it can be an outward 

1696
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:54,920
journey too because I don't think it 
matters where you confront the unknown,

1697
01:45:54,921 --> 01:45:59,921
whether it's within her,
without what matters is whether or not 

1698
01:45:59,921 --> 01:46:01,900
you confront the unknown.
That's what matters,

1699
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:12,720
but he found that what he had ignored 
was an undiscovered part of themselves,

1700
01:46:13,141 --> 01:46:18,070
so that might be something that was 
equivalent to Huxley's notion that there

1701
01:46:18,071 --> 01:46:23,071
were tremendous,
tremendous potential breadth in the 

1702
01:46:23,071 --> 01:46:26,371
realm of human conscious experience and 
Huxley was influenced to some degree by 

1703
01:46:26,371 --> 01:46:30,181
Yung.
Now Yung knew of Huxley's experiments 

1704
01:46:30,181 --> 01:46:33,490
and had commented on psychedelic use and
he said something like,

1705
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:35,830
beware of wisdom you did not earn.

1706
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:40,640
And Don was very good at stating things 
very profoundly,

1707
01:46:40,641 --> 01:46:45,641
very simply.
And that's a very intelligent piece of 

1708
01:46:45,641 --> 01:46:45,770
advice.
Be Aware of wisdom you did not earn.

1709
01:46:45,771 --> 01:46:49,410
He wrote a paper if you're interested in
this sort thing.

1710
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:53,910
He wrote a paper called the relations 
between the ego and the unconscious,

1711
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:59,300
which is an absolute master work,
but completely incomprehensible unless 

1712
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:00,990
you know what it,
unless you know what it's about and what

1713
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:04,620
it's about is the danger of what he 
called ego inflation,

1714
01:47:04,621 --> 01:47:09,621
and so one of the things that can happen
as a consequence of a revelatory 

1715
01:47:09,621 --> 01:47:12,621
experience is that the division between 
the individual ego and and the and what 

1716
01:47:15,961 --> 01:47:20,961
would you call it,
so hard to come up with a word that 

1717
01:47:20,961 --> 01:47:23,841
isn't somehow naive or or or cliched,
to erase the relationship,

1718
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:31,550
the boundary between the specific 
consciousness of the ego and the more 

1719
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:35,721
generalized consciousness and more 
generalized consciousness as such,

1720
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:42,300
is a dangerous thing to do because you 
can start to equate yourself,

1721
01:47:42,301 --> 01:47:46,440
your specific self with that more 
generalized consciousness as such,

1722
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:51,950
and you thought about that.
Is it something akin to a psychotic 

1723
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:55,281
inflation and the paper relations 
between the ego and the unconscious is a

1724
01:47:56,221 --> 01:47:58,590
document that tells you how to avoid 
that.

1725
01:47:59,190 --> 01:47:59,970
If you're

1726
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:07,890
playing in this kind of realm and one of
the injunctions is to keep your feet on 

1727
01:48:09,431 --> 01:48:14,431
the ground.
He thought that was what partly what 

1728
01:48:14,431 --> 01:48:16,300
happened to Nisha was that Nina wasn't 
grounded enough in life.

1729
01:48:16,301 --> 01:48:20,560
He wasn't grounded enough in day to day 
rituals and routines and the mundane.

1730
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:23,830
Now you can debate whether or not that's
the case,

1731
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,510
whether or not that's a reasonable 
argument,

1732
01:48:25,511 --> 01:48:29,410
but that was still what you unbelieved.
Okay,

1733
01:48:29,411 --> 01:48:34,411
so why am I telling you all this?
I'll finish with this from December 19,

1734
01:48:35,681 --> 01:48:40,681
13 onward.
Young Carrie going in the same 

1735
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:42,811
procedure,
deliberately evoking a fantasy in a 

1736
01:48:42,811 --> 01:48:43,150
waking state and then entering into it 
as a drama.

1737
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:48,420
These fantasies may be understood as a 
type of dramatize thinking in pictorial 

1738
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:49,030
form.
In retrospect,

1739
01:48:49,031 --> 01:48:54,031
he recalled that his scientific question
was to see what took place when he 

1740
01:48:54,031 --> 01:48:57,631
switched off consciousness.
The example of dreams indicated the 

1741
01:48:57,631 --> 01:49:01,531
existence of background activity and he 
wanted to give this a possibility of 

1742
01:49:01,531 --> 01:49:02,830
emerging just as one does when taking 
masculine.

1743
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:05,320
These journals are youngest 
contemporary,

1744
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:10,350
contemporaneous clinical ledger to his 
most difficult experiment or what he 

1745
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:13,720
later describes as a voyage of discovery
to the other pole of the world,

1746
01:49:14,410 --> 01:49:16,330
young unbelief that we were dreaming all
the time,

1747
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:22,320
but that during waking life,
that pressure of external images was 

1748
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:26,260
such that the unconscious fantasy 
imagery was,

1749
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,610
or that the fantasy imagery was of 
insufficient magnitude to be conscious,

1750
01:49:30,611 --> 01:49:34,420
but that we were always situated in a 
dream in relationship to the world.

1751
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:35,780
So

1752
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:49,490
when we started talking about the 
creation of the universe at the 

1753
01:49:49,490 --> 01:49:54,401
beginning of the genesis stories,
I spent quite a long time setting the 

1754
01:49:54,401 --> 01:49:55,530
stage for the stories because

1755
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:02,040
there's no point in having a 
conversation about the God who gives 

1756
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:05,371
rise to being unless you have some sense
of what that might conceivably mean to 

1757
01:50:05,371 --> 01:50:10,351
the modern mind.
And I felt the same way about 

1758
01:50:10,351 --> 01:50:13,860
neighborhood Amec stories is I couldn't 
get a handle on them until I could 

1759
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:17,890
understand and articulate more clearly 
what it might mean.

1760
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:22,880
How a modern person might understand a,
uh,

1761
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:26,740
a direct experience of God.
And the first question would be,

1762
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:32,550
is such a thing possible?
And the answer that seems to be a 

1763
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:33,280
qualified yes.
First of all,

1764
01:50:33,281 --> 01:50:36,100
it's a universal human experience.
That's a very strange thing.

1765
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:41,520
It's not something that people have made
up as Freud might have it as a defense 

1766
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,750
against death.
It's not a tenable hypothesis.

1767
01:50:44,110 --> 01:50:49,110
It's a realm of potential experience.
Now that experience doesn't necessarily 

1768
01:50:49,211 --> 01:50:52,450
have to have the Judeo Christian content
that we've been discussing.

1769
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:55,450
Quite the contrary.
They are manifestations of this,

1770
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:00,800
these alternative forms of consciousness
all over the world that take on their 

1771
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:01,810
own peculiar forms.
Although their pattern to some degree,

1772
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,430
that's like the hero myth,
for example,

1773
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:08,431
of myth of the fight against the dragon 
seems to be unbelievably widespread and 

1774
01:51:08,431 --> 01:51:09,730
so it's not as if it's random.

1775
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,230
Sorry,
I should just see what time it is here,

1776
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:26,380
but there's not much point in having a 
discussion about what happens to Abraham

1777
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:32,010
unless you can conceptualize it in terms
that are amenable to modern skeptical 

1778
01:51:32,231 --> 01:51:37,231
consciousness so we can establish the 
proposition that mystical experience is 

1779
01:51:37,231 --> 01:51:41,521
not only possible,
it's quite common and it's inducible in 

1780
01:51:41,521 --> 01:51:44,701
a variety of ways and the manner in 
which it's inducible is reliable and 

1781
01:51:44,701 --> 01:51:49,141
there's no evidence as well that it's 
pathological in in fact there's a fair 

1782
01:51:49,141 --> 01:51:52,441
bit of evidence that the patterns of 
behavior that are associated with the 

1783
01:51:52,441 --> 01:51:55,480
mystical experience are core elements of
proper human adaptation in the world.

1784
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:22,310
The Abrahamic stories open up with a 
manifest God.

1785
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:27,340
Now I'm going to read you some things 
from Friedman who wrote the 

1786
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:27,340
disappearance of God.

1787
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,140
He was trying to look at the underlying 
structure of the stories.

1788
01:52:31,141 --> 01:52:36,141
Now no freedom and noted that the books 
in the Old Testament were written by a 

1789
01:52:36,141 --> 01:52:41,011
lot of different people at very 
different times and then they were 

1790
01:52:41,011 --> 01:52:45,271
sequenced by other people.
For reasons that we don't exactly 

1791
01:52:45,271 --> 01:52:49,531
understand,
but there's still an underlying 

1792
01:52:49,531 --> 01:52:53,561
narrative.
There's multiple underlying narrative 

1793
01:52:53,561 --> 01:52:56,351
unity's despite the fact of that rather 
arbitrary sequencing and that's a 

1794
01:52:56,351 --> 01:52:57,430
strange thing,
you know,

1795
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:01,130
I guess you could say if you had a 
collection of ancient books and you were

1796
01:53:01,131 --> 01:53:03,830
trying to put them together,
you try to put them together in some way

1797
01:53:03,831 --> 01:53:05,970
that made sense,
right,

1798
01:53:05,971 --> 01:53:10,971
and it wouldn't make sense unless you 
stumbled across some kind of underlying 

1799
01:53:10,971 --> 01:53:11,480
narrative that allowed you to order 
them,

1800
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:17,160
and so it's not entirely surprising that
that are ordered in a manner that's 

1801
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:21,191
comprehensible,
but Friedman's comments on the 

1802
01:53:21,191 --> 01:53:23,150
underlying narrative structure,
part of it was,

1803
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,070
well,
we'll go through this.

1804
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:30,250
The books of the Old Testament were 
composed by a great many authors 

1805
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:31,130
according to both traditional religious 
views in modern critical scholarship,

1806
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:36,610
the phenomenon of the diminishing 
apparent presence of God across so many 

1807
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:40,151
stories through so many books by so many
authors spread over so many centuries is

1808
01:53:40,161 --> 01:53:44,060
consistent enough to be striking,
impressive and ultimately mysterious,

1809
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:48,890
but the hiding of the divine phase is 
only half the story.

1810
01:53:48,891 --> 01:53:53,891
There's another development also 
extending across the course of the 

1811
01:53:53,891 --> 01:53:55,190
entire narrative of the Hebrew Bible,
which we must see before.

1812
01:53:55,191 --> 01:54:00,191
We can appreciate the full force of this
phenomena and before we can pose the 

1813
01:54:00,191 --> 01:54:01,400
solution to the mystery of this,
of how this happened,

1814
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:04,040
gradually from genesis to Ezra,
an estimate,

1815
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:08,450
there is a transition from divine to 
human responsibility for life on earth.

1816
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:13,490
The story begins in genesis with God in 
complete control of the creation,

1817
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:18,670
but by the end,
humans have arrived at a stage at which 

1818
01:54:18,670 --> 01:54:19,490
in all apparent ways,
they have responsibility for the fate of

1819
01:54:19,491 --> 01:54:22,310
the world.
The first two human beings,

1820
01:54:24,570 --> 01:54:27,000
Adam and eve,
take little responsibility themselves.

1821
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:32,690
They do not be design or build anything.
When they're embarrassed over their 

1822
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:32,690
nudity,
they do not make clothes.

1823
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:37,850
They cover themselves with leaves.
It's God who makes their first clothing 

1824
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:37,850
for them.

1825
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:43,610
No.
I'm by no means a fully developed 

1826
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:43,610
personality.
No,

1827
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:44,460
it is not an every man either.
Broadly speaking,

1828
01:54:44,461 --> 01:54:48,150
he reflects a step beyond Adam and eve 
and human character and responsibility.

1829
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:54,380
Abraham,
beyond that counts of divine commands 

1830
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:56,310
that Abraham does carry out.
The narrative also includes a variety of

1831
01:54:56,311 --> 01:54:59,100
stories in which Abraham acts on his own
initiative.

1832
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:02,070
He divides land with his nephew lot.
He battles kings.

1833
01:55:02,071 --> 01:55:04,950
He takes concubines,
he argues with his wife Sarah,

1834
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:07,140
on two occasions,
he tells kings that Sarah,

1835
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:08,790
his sister,
out of fear,

1836
01:55:08,791 --> 01:55:13,791
that they will kill him to get his wife,
and he arranges his son's marriage in 

1837
01:55:13,791 --> 01:55:15,120
the place of the single story of Noah's 
drunkenness.

1838
01:55:15,121 --> 01:55:20,121
There are,
in the case of Abraham the stories of 

1839
01:55:20,121 --> 01:55:22,281
man's life.
The Abraham section thus develops the 

1840
01:55:22,281 --> 01:55:25,581
personality and character of a man of 
man to a new degree in biblical 

1841
01:55:25,581 --> 01:55:27,150
narrative will picturing and him a new 
degree of responsibility.

1842
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:29,970
It is not just that Abraham has kindler 
kinder,

1843
01:55:29,971 --> 01:55:31,200
gentler,
more intrepid,

1844
01:55:31,201 --> 01:55:36,201
more ethical,
or a better debater than his ancestor 

1845
01:55:36,201 --> 01:55:36,201
noah.
Rather.

1846
01:55:36,201 --> 01:55:40,281
Both the Noah and Abraham stories or 
pieces of a development of an 

1847
01:55:40,281 --> 01:55:41,610
increasingly stronger stance of humans 
relative to the deity.

1848
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:44,670
Before the story is over,
humans will become a great deal,

1849
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:46,500
stronger and bolder than Abraham.

1850
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:57,270
I don't know what that means,
you know?

1851
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:02,070
See,
it isn't.

1852
01:56:02,730 --> 01:56:07,380
It is certainly the case that the 
individual exists in the modern world,

1853
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,710
the differentiated self aware,
self conscious individual,

1854
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:15,860
and it's certainly the case that that 
wasn't the case at some point in the 

1855
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:17,460
past and so it's the case that there's 
been a development.

1856
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,530
I don't know if you could call it a 
progression,

1857
01:56:19,531 --> 01:56:24,531
but a development of the autonomous 
individual over some span of historical 

1858
01:56:24,721 --> 01:56:26,790
time.
Now we don't know how long that's been,

1859
01:56:26,791 --> 01:56:29,640
but my suspicions are.
It hasn't been that long.

1860
01:56:29,641 --> 01:56:31,250
I mean

1861
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:39,170
I read once about a Neolithic ceremony 
that involve the particular placement of

1862
01:56:40,021 --> 01:56:45,021
a bear skull in a cave and then I read 
that and they had found these placements

1863
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:52,790
in caves that were at least 25,000
years old and then I read that they 

1864
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:56,421
found caves in Japan among the Ainu who 
were the indigenous inhabitants of 

1865
01:56:56,421 --> 01:57:01,071
Japanese territory and rather archaic 
people who had the same ceremony with 

1866
01:57:01,291 --> 01:57:05,940
the bear and that put the skull in the 
same orientation and place in caves.

1867
01:57:06,150 --> 01:57:09,720
And that that tradition remained 
unbroken for about 25,000

1868
01:57:09,721 --> 01:57:11,310
years.
And you think it will.

1869
01:57:11,311 --> 01:57:16,311
Is it possible for an oral or ritual 
tradition to remain unbroken for spans 

1870
01:57:16,311 --> 01:57:19,050
of tens of thousands of years,
and the answer to that is not only is it

1871
01:57:19,051 --> 01:57:22,170
possible,
it's actually the norm because like

1872
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:25,660
one chimpanzee is like the next 
chimpanzee,

1873
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:27,340
right in the.
In the progression,

1874
01:57:27,341 --> 01:57:32,341
in the biological progression.
If you took a chimpanzee troop now and 

1875
01:57:32,341 --> 01:57:35,971
you went back 25,000
years and you looked at a chimpanzee 

1876
01:57:35,971 --> 01:57:35,971
troop,
it'd be the same thing.

1877
01:57:35,971 --> 01:57:39,811
There's no historical progression.
That's how you can tell the chimps 

1878
01:57:39,811 --> 01:57:41,920
really don't have culture because if 
they could even accrete one,

1879
01:57:41,921 --> 01:57:46,450
1000th of a percent of culture 
transmissible culture progeneration,

1880
01:57:46,690 --> 01:57:49,570
it wouldn't take more than about a 
million years before they'd have a whole

1881
01:57:49,571 --> 01:57:53,980
civilization and they don't.
They're the same as they were and so the

1882
01:57:53,981 --> 01:57:58,981
continuity,
the stability and unchanging nature of 

1883
01:57:58,981 --> 01:58:02,461
his species,
essentially speaking is the rule that 

1884
01:58:02,461 --> 01:58:06,990
the variant is us.
It's like what the hell happened after 

1885
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:07,990
the last ice age,
15,000

1886
01:58:07,991 --> 01:58:12,991
years ago,
we went from tribal uniform stable to 

1887
01:58:13,151 --> 01:58:18,151
whatever the hell we are now.
It's this transition from generic too 

1888
01:58:19,101 --> 01:58:24,101
specific.
It's something like that and I can't 

1889
01:58:24,101 --> 01:58:26,021
help but think that that's reflected in 
this text and it has something to do 

1890
01:58:26,021 --> 01:58:27,440
with this transition of consciousness 
from,

1891
01:58:28,850 --> 01:58:32,690
from what?
From possession by the generic divine to

1892
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:36,020
dominance by this specific individual.
If something like that,

1893
01:58:36,021 --> 01:58:40,800
is that a neurological transformation?
Is that what this is a record of being?

1894
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:41,980
We don't know.

1895
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:47,010
One of the things you said about God 
because young's relationship with God as

1896
01:58:47,291 --> 01:58:52,291
an object of belief is very complex,
hidden in his technical writing,

1897
01:58:53,051 --> 01:58:55,870
he always talks about the image of God.
He never talks about God.

1898
01:58:55,871 --> 01:59:00,871
He talks about the image of God.
He said that the image of God dwells 

1899
01:59:00,871 --> 01:59:04,321
within us,
not the same thing as God dwelling 

1900
01:59:04,321 --> 01:59:04,321
within.
Right?

1901
01:59:04,321 --> 01:59:07,810
Because we could mean all of these 
capacities that we have for transcendent

1902
01:59:07,811 --> 01:59:10,540
consciousness could be a byproduct of 
biological evolution.

1903
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:15,160
They could have no reflection.
They can have no relationship whatsoever

1904
01:59:15,161 --> 01:59:20,161
to an actual transcendent reality.
There's no way of telling the 

1905
01:59:20,161 --> 01:59:22,120
transcendent reality seems to manifest 
itself as an element of experience,

1906
01:59:22,121 --> 01:59:23,800
but that doesn't mean that it has in 
reality,

1907
01:59:23,801 --> 01:59:27,580
outside of this objective,
even if it's even if it exists as it is,

1908
01:59:27,581 --> 01:59:29,370
it clearly does,
but

1909
01:59:41,150 --> 01:59:46,150
Friedman suggests that what's happening 
in the biblical narrative is the 

1910
01:59:46,150 --> 01:59:50,111
sequential emergence of the individual 
as a redemptive force and that the old 

1911
01:59:51,351 --> 01:59:56,351
testament documents that implicitly,
unconsciously as a consequence of 

1912
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:02,440
descriptive fantasy and that that's 
what's going on in the book and that so 

1913
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:08,600
the Cosmos is under the control of 
generic daddy to begin with,

1914
02:00:08,601 --> 02:00:13,601
something like that,
and then that controls shifts to 

1915
02:00:13,601 --> 02:00:15,230
localized,
identifiable,

1916
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:20,620
increasingly personal and detailed 
individuals and you see that in Noah and

1917
02:00:21,381 --> 02:00:26,381
then you see the neighborhood and then 
you see it in Moses and then there's 

1918
02:00:26,381 --> 02:00:30,400
this working out of what it would mean 
to be a fully developed individual and 

1919
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,450
that's what these stories.
They're there,

1920
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,830
they're there.
They're like prototypes.

1921
02:00:33,831 --> 02:00:38,831
There are attempts to to to bring about 
the proper motive being right and so 

1922
02:00:39,441 --> 02:00:44,441
Abraham is a,
is a manifestation of that because he 

1923
02:00:44,441 --> 02:00:44,441
enters into a covenant with God.

1924
02:00:44,441 --> 02:00:46,100
He's selected by God,
interest into a partnership with God.

1925
02:00:46,101 --> 02:00:51,101
It's not exactly obvious.
God provides him with forward motion and

1926
02:00:51,891 --> 02:00:56,891
intuition and leads them towards a 
successful mode of being and it's 

1927
02:00:57,561 --> 02:00:59,630
complex,
successful mode being because Abraham is

1928
02:00:59,631 --> 02:01:02,060
a very complex life.
There's plenty of ups and downs,

1929
02:01:02,061 --> 02:01:07,061
right?
It's not unbroken purity of being 

1930
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:11,090
towards a divine hand.
Abraham lies and cheats and deceives and

1931
02:01:11,091 --> 02:01:16,040
does all sorts of things that that a 
real person would do and and Moses,

1932
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:21,041
for example,
kill someone and so these people that 

1933
02:01:21,041 --> 02:01:22,220
the biblical people are very genuine 
individuals,

1934
02:01:22,490 --> 02:01:24,860
but they're given with all their faults,
right,

1935
02:01:24,861 --> 02:01:26,600
with all their sins,
with all their deceit,

1936
02:01:26,601 --> 02:01:31,601
they're still put forth as potential 
modes of proper models of potential 

1937
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:37,240
proper being in the world and the entire
Corpus of the Bible seems to be nothing 

1938
02:01:37,641 --> 02:01:40,580
but an attempt to keep up variance

1939
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:45,580
of the personality.
Trying to experiment to find out what 

1940
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:49,160
personality works in the world.
Of course,

1941
02:01:49,161 --> 02:01:54,161
from a Christian perspective,
that culminates in the figure of Christ 

1942
02:01:54,161 --> 02:01:56,300
as the redemptive word and that's 
associated as we've already talked about

1943
02:01:56,301 --> 02:02:00,680
with the force that brought order out of
chaos.

1944
02:02:00,681 --> 02:02:05,681
At the beginning of time and so well,
that's my attempt to provide proper 

1945
02:02:09,891 --> 02:02:14,891
context for the understanding of 
Abrahamic stories and so hopefully with 

1946
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:20,800
that context we can move forward being 
able to swallow the camel so to speak,

1947
02:02:23,001 --> 02:02:28,001
of the initial presence of God in the 
stories and so we'll return to all of 

1948
02:02:29,211 --> 02:02:30,860
that next week.

1949
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:38,780
Thank you.

1950
02:02:48,850 --> 02:02:53,850
Let's wait one second.
Until people have an opportunity to 

1951
02:02:53,850 --> 02:02:55,900
leave,
I would very much like to ask the people

1952
02:02:55,901 --> 02:03:00,901
who are asking the questions to take a 
few seconds before they asked the 

1953
02:03:00,901 --> 02:03:04,150
question and make sure that the mic is 
positioned properly so that everyone can

1954
02:03:04,151 --> 02:03:09,151
hear you because people keep writing and
complaining that while they're very 

1955
02:03:09,151 --> 02:03:13,261
happy with the questions and I would say
the questions have been a very high 

1956
02:03:13,261 --> 02:03:16,411
caliber so far,
but they're not very happy that they 

1957
02:03:16,411 --> 02:03:18,871
can't hear them,
so I know that you're obviously nervous 

1958
02:03:18,871 --> 02:03:19,960
and in a hurry when you want to ask you 
a question,

1959
02:03:19,961 --> 02:03:24,961
but take a second or two to set the mic 
up properly and make sure that everyone 

1960
02:03:24,961 --> 02:03:27,970
can hear you and so have a way out.
It blew Dr.

1961
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:28,750
Peter says,
Hey,

1962
02:03:28,751 --> 02:03:31,910
there we go.
I'd like to ask you

1963
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:34,230
about two different psychological 
disorders.

1964
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:37,020
The first being borderline personality 
disorder,

1965
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:42,380
so two lectures ago,
somebody asks you about it and you gave 

1966
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:45,720
a very sparse answer.
I can't remember exactly what you said,

1967
02:03:45,721 --> 02:03:50,721
but it seemed like it was,
it was too much complexity to just 

1968
02:03:51,931 --> 02:03:54,270
answer it right there and then.
And then somebody else.

1969
02:03:54,271 --> 02:03:59,271
All Cox asked you about the same 
disorder in your Patriot on live stream 

1970
02:03:59,271 --> 02:04:02,970
recently and when they,
when they asked you that you kind of,

1971
02:04:03,450 --> 02:04:06,510
you kind of stopped for a moment and 
something I don't know,

1972
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:11,640
something kind of flicked on in your 
head and it seemed like in you and you 

1973
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:12,930
thought for a couple seconds and then 
you said,

1974
02:04:12,931 --> 02:04:17,931
you know what?
I don't think that I can answer that 

1975
02:04:17,931 --> 02:04:18,990
right now because it's just too.
It's just too bloody complex.

1976
02:04:19,290 --> 02:04:24,290
And I was wondering just like many young
men have gravitated towards your 

1977
02:04:25,591 --> 02:04:30,591
lectures,
do you think that there's something 

1978
02:04:30,591 --> 02:04:32,301
about this particular disorder that a,
there's something about people with this

1979
02:04:33,481 --> 02:04:36,810
particular disorder that might gravitate
to your insights and your.

1980
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:38,880
Okay.
Okay,

1981
02:04:38,881 --> 02:04:41,910
so now I would say probably no to the 
second one,

1982
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:44,970
but I could comment more about 
borderline personality disorder.

1983
02:04:44,971 --> 02:04:47,310
I think I have enough mental energy to 
do that tonight.

1984
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:52,790
So technically speaking,
it's often considered the female variant

1985
02:04:53,941 --> 02:04:57,350
of anti social personality disorder.
So it's,

1986
02:04:57,351 --> 02:04:58,080
it's,
it's,

1987
02:04:58,110 --> 02:05:01,570
it's classified or it's classified in,
in,

1988
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:03,780
in the domain of externalizing 
disorders,

1989
02:05:03,781 --> 02:05:07,560
acting out disorders.
And I think what happens,

1990
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:13,520
we don't understand borderline 
personality disorder very well and it's 

1991
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,360
characterized by tremendous impulsivity,

1992
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:22,080
radical confusion of identity,
um,

1993
02:05:22,450 --> 02:05:25,140
and then this pattern of idealization 
of,

1994
02:05:25,430 --> 02:05:30,430
of people with whom the person afflicted
with the disorder is associated with 

1995
02:05:32,351 --> 02:05:36,250
radical idealization of those people and
then radical devaluation of them.

1996
02:05:37,150 --> 02:05:39,670
And then there's another theme that sort
of weaves along with it,

1997
02:05:39,671 --> 02:05:44,671
which is the proclivity of people with 
borderline personality disorder to 

1998
02:05:45,101 --> 02:05:50,101
presume that they will be abandoned and 
then to act in a manner that makes such 

1999
02:05:50,501 --> 02:05:52,120
a bad admin,
virtually certain.

2000
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:58,560
And so it's very complicated disorder.
But that I think gets at the crux of it.

2001
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:05,620
One of the things that's interesting 
about people with borderline personality

2002
02:06:05,621 --> 02:06:10,621
disorder in my experience is that 
they're often quite intelligent and you 

2003
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:15,130
see in the person with borderline 
personality disorder,

2004
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:20,340
something like that,
the waste or the squandering of 

2005
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:22,951
tremendous potential,
they seem capable of thinking through 

2006
02:06:23,561 --> 02:06:27,070
the nature of their problems and 
analyzing them and discussing it,

2007
02:06:27,310 --> 02:06:30,640
but not capable whatsoever of 
implementing any solutions

2008
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:32,180
and

2009
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:45,480
technically there's no relationship 
between Iq and conscientiousness.

2010
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:51,680
It's very weird because if you read the 
neuropsychological literature and you 

2011
02:06:52,861 --> 02:06:54,870
read about the functions of the 
prefrontal Cortex,

2012
02:06:54,871 --> 02:06:59,871
they're usually conceptualized in 
intellectual terms and they're 

2013
02:06:59,871 --> 02:07:01,530
associated with planning and 
strategizing and so forth,

2014
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:07,250
and that's what conscientiousness is,
is planning and strategizing and 

2015
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:13,080
implementation,
but the correlation between Iq and 

2016
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:15,931
conscientiousness is zero and so as the 
correlation between working memory and 

2017
02:07:15,931 --> 02:07:20,080
conscientiousness is zero and zero is a 
very low correlation.

2018
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:21,730
Right?
I mean really,

2019
02:07:21,731 --> 02:07:25,180
it's hard to find things in psychology 
that are correlated at zero.

2020
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:28,150
Things tend to be correlated to some 
degree.

2021
02:07:28,151 --> 02:07:33,151
They tend to be interrelated.
The borderline seems to be able to 

2022
02:07:33,161 --> 02:07:36,160
strategize the abstract

2023
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:40,730
but not to be able to implement.
And so this,

2024
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:44,200
the intellect per se seems to be 
functional,

2025
02:07:44,201 --> 02:07:49,060
but it's not embodied in action.
It's very.

2026
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:54,061
So it can be frustrating to be 
associated with someone who has 

2027
02:07:54,061 --> 02:07:57,661
borderline personality disorder because 
they can tell you what the problem is 

2028
02:07:57,661 --> 02:07:58,720
and even tell you what the solution 
might be,

2029
02:07:58,721 --> 02:08:00,580
but there's no implementation.

2030
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:06,020
So maybe something went wrong 
developmentally.

2031
02:08:06,110 --> 02:08:08,510
We don't know exactly how these sorts of
things come about.

2032
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:12,020
The other thing that seems to be 
characteristic of borderline people with

2033
02:08:12,021 --> 02:08:17,021
borderline personality disorder is that 
they remind me very much of people who 

2034
02:08:17,021 --> 02:08:21,581
are two years old and in some manner 
like people with borderline personality 

2035
02:08:22,251 --> 02:08:24,350
disorder can have temper tantrums.
In fact,

2036
02:08:24,351 --> 02:08:29,351
they often do and you know now and then 
you see a temper tantrum and they're 

2037
02:08:29,351 --> 02:08:30,200
usually thrown by two year olds.
Right?

2038
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:33,470
Most people grow out of temper tantrums 
by the time they were about three.

2039
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:36,290
They're very rare at four,
which is a good thing because if they're

2040
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:39,770
still there at four,
that is not a good diagnostic predictor.

2041
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:44,840
That's a good diagnostic predictor.
But it's not the kind that you want.

2042
02:08:45,710 --> 02:08:50,710
And you know,
it's funny the way that we respond to 

2043
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:53,681
two year old temper tantrums because the
two year old will throw themselves on 

2044
02:08:53,681 --> 02:08:56,981
the ground and eat their hands and their
legs on the floor and scream and yell 

2045
02:08:56,981 --> 02:08:57,740
and turn red or even blue.

2046
02:08:57,740 --> 02:09:02,740
I saw a child once who was capable of 
holding his breath during a temper 

2047
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:04,580
tantrum until he turned blue,
which was really an impressive feat.

2048
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:05,780
You should try that,
right?

2049
02:09:05,781 --> 02:09:08,420
It's really hard.
You really have to work at it.

2050
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:12,770
And you see that in adult borderlines,
they'll have temper tantrums.

2051
02:09:12,771 --> 02:09:14,810
And the funny thing is when a two year 
old does it,

2052
02:09:14,811 --> 02:09:15,800
it's like it's,
you know,

2053
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:19,880
it's a little off putting.
But when an adult does it,

2054
02:09:20,150 --> 02:09:25,150
it's completely bloody terrifying.
And it happens very frequently with 

2055
02:09:25,150 --> 02:09:27,620
borderlines.
And so I would also say to some degree,

2056
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:33,370
they didn't get properly socialized 
between that critical period of 

2057
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:36,251
development between two and four.
And you see the same thing with adult 

2058
02:09:36,251 --> 02:09:39,791
males who grow up to be antisocial 
because a large proportion of adult 

2059
02:09:39,791 --> 02:09:42,080
males who grow up to be anti social are 
aggressive as children,

2060
02:09:42,410 --> 02:09:43,220
as two year olds.

2061
02:09:44,050 --> 02:09:46,550
So there's a small proportion of two 
year olds who are quite aggressive,

2062
02:09:46,551 --> 02:09:51,551
they'll kick and hit and bite and steal 
if you put them with other two year 

2063
02:09:51,551 --> 02:09:51,551
olds.
It's about five percent of the,

2064
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,990
of the males,
smaller fraction of the females,

2065
02:09:54,380 --> 02:09:56,840
but most of them are socialized by the 
time they're four,

2066
02:09:57,110 --> 02:10:02,110
but there's a small percentage who 
aren't and they tend to stay antisocial 

2067
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:03,460
and they tend to turn into longterm 
offenders and,

2068
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:05,660
and it,
and the develop that critical period for

2069
02:10:05,661 --> 02:10:10,661
socialization development seems to be 
between two and four and it seems to be 

2070
02:10:10,661 --> 02:10:13,991
mediated by pretend play in rough and 
tumble play in those sorts of 

2071
02:10:13,991 --> 02:10:17,471
mechanisms.
And if it isn't instantiated by the age 

2072
02:10:17,471 --> 02:10:20,050
of four,
it doesn't happen and it doesn't look 

2073
02:10:20,050 --> 02:10:20,420
like it's addressable.
Now,

2074
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:25,100
there are dialectic behavioral therapies
that have been developed for people with

2075
02:10:25,101 --> 02:10:28,790
borderline personality disorder and 
their purported to be successful.

2076
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:29,840
But.

2077
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:32,550
Okay,
thank you.

2078
02:10:32,580 --> 02:10:33,600
If I,
uh,

2079
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:34,490
severe second,

2080
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:38,180
a psychological disorder I wanted to ask
you about is a psychopathy.

2081
02:10:38,570 --> 02:10:43,570
So you've mentioned that a psychopaths 
tend to switch from dominance hierarchy 

2082
02:10:43,570 --> 02:10:46,080
to dominance hierarchy because people 
get tired of their shenanigans.

2083
02:10:46,081 --> 02:10:47,720
And they have to be volunteer fresh 
people,

2084
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:51,530
um,
and psychopaths also tend to be very low

2085
02:10:51,531 --> 02:10:56,531
in conscientiousness.
And you said that when you see some of 

2086
02:10:56,531 --> 02:10:59,801
these protesters at your speeches,
some of the men in particular,

2087
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:00,830
uh,
your,

2088
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:06,010
you're a clinical intuition tells you 
that there's something seriously 

2089
02:11:06,010 --> 02:11:07,340
pathological about them.
And,

2090
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:12,400
uh,
I was wondering if you would suspect 

2091
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:12,400
that some of these men might be 
psychopathic

2092
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:13,850
as well.
Some of them likely are,

2093
02:11:13,851 --> 02:11:18,851
but I don't know if a higher proportion 
of the ones who show up at protests and 

2094
02:11:18,851 --> 02:11:20,270
sort of creeped me out or I don't know 
if,

2095
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:23,720
if there's a higher proportion of people
like that at the protests are not.

2096
02:11:24,020 --> 02:11:29,020
I mean,
I suspect in general that regardless of 

2097
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:32,441
the protest,
the proportion of people who have 

2098
02:11:32,441 --> 02:11:35,441
personality disorders among protestors 
is higher than the proportion of people 

2099
02:11:35,441 --> 02:11:39,311
who have personality disorders in the 
general population because you just 

2100
02:11:39,311 --> 02:11:41,240
expect that you just expect that kind of
acting out behavior.

2101
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,290
I'm not,
believe me,

2102
02:11:42,291 --> 02:11:45,410
I'm not saying that all protest is 
associated with personality disorder.

2103
02:11:45,411 --> 02:11:48,260
I'm not saying that at all.
There's plenty of reason for protest,

2104
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:52,430
but some of the reason for protests are 
credible reasons and some of them aren't

2105
02:11:52,431 --> 02:11:53,090
credible reasons,
so

2106
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:56,900
seeing that like the social justice 
hierarchy,

2107
02:11:56,901 --> 02:12:01,901
so to speak,
would be one of the last that these 

2108
02:12:01,901 --> 02:12:01,901
confused

2109
02:12:01,901 --> 02:12:01,901
that's,
that's,

2110
02:12:01,901 --> 02:12:04,240
that's a different issue.
You know there are,

2111
02:12:05,290 --> 02:12:08,080
there are analysis of the dangers of 
agreeableness,

2112
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:13,590
so agreeableness is a personality trait 
that underlies the radical egalitarian 

2113
02:12:13,590 --> 02:12:17,230
ethos because agreeable people want 
everything to be shared equally and it's

2114
02:12:17,231 --> 02:12:22,231
a good.
I think it's a good ethos for a small 

2115
02:12:22,231 --> 02:12:25,141
group for a family because family is 
kind of a communist system in some 

2116
02:12:25,141 --> 02:12:25,141
sense.
Right?

2117
02:12:25,141 --> 02:12:29,611
It's like you want the food to be 
divided up equally among the children 

2118
02:12:29,611 --> 02:12:33,330
clearly,
and you want all the children sort of 

2119
02:12:33,330 --> 02:12:35,131
regardless of their inherent abilities 
to have the same opportunities and 

2120
02:12:35,131 --> 02:12:39,511
perhaps even the same outcomes.
So I think agreeableness which is 

2121
02:12:39,511 --> 02:12:41,200
associated at least in part with 
maternal maternal,

2122
02:12:41,590 --> 02:12:44,440
the maternal instinct,
let's say maternal patterns of behavior.

2123
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:49,800
I think it's,
it's a good first pass motivational 

2124
02:12:50,171 --> 02:12:53,530
approximation to a localized familial 
ethic.

2125
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:56,110
I think it's a catastrophe at larger 
scales.

2126
02:12:56,590 --> 02:13:01,590
I don't think it scales at all.
I actually think that's why we evolve 

2127
02:13:01,590 --> 02:13:04,921
conscientiousness,
because conscientiousness is the 

2128
02:13:04,921 --> 02:13:06,130
principle that allows larger scale 
organizations to exist.

2129
02:13:06,490 --> 02:13:10,930
Agreeableness won't do it now.
Conscientiousness is a mystery,

2130
02:13:10,990 --> 02:13:13,150
right?
We don't have a neurological model.

2131
02:13:14,140 --> 02:13:17,560
We don't have a conceptual model.
We don't have an animal model,

2132
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:22,830
we don't have a pharmacological model,
and we really only have one way of 

2133
02:13:22,830 --> 02:13:25,720
assessing which is self and other 
reports of personality proclivity.

2134
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:31,650
So anyways,
the problem with agreeableness,

2135
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:36,660
this has been modeled by game theorists,
is that a population of cooperative 

2136
02:13:37,261 --> 02:13:41,040
people can be dominated by a single 
shark,

2137
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:48,240
so agreeableness is insufficient as a 
principal because it opens itself up to,

2138
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:57,170
what do you call that?
Manipulation and manipulation.

2139
02:14:02,581 --> 02:14:04,840
Let's let's leave it at that to 
manipulation and,

2140
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:05,470
and,
and,

2141
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:08,340
and exploitation.
That's the other thing.

2142
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:11,100
Exploitation.
So

2143
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:13,560
thank you.

2144
02:14:19,170 --> 02:14:20,010
Hi,
Dr Peterson.

2145
02:14:20,011 --> 02:14:25,011
I had one quick comment and aggression 
of somebody's comments was about your 

2146
02:14:25,011 --> 02:14:27,420
idea of subpersonalities is one nine 
monsters.

2147
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:32,800
Now there's the idea of multiple 
personality or split personality 

2148
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:36,201
disorder.
It's controversial as to whether or not 

2149
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:38,661
it exists,
but there's some recent research that 

2150
02:14:38,661 --> 02:14:41,451
suggests that you may actually have 
multiple personalities that use 

2151
02:14:41,911 --> 02:14:46,911
different parts of the brain,
so they have differential access to the 

2152
02:14:46,911 --> 02:14:49,191
hippocampus.
They have their own memories and they 

2153
02:14:49,191 --> 02:14:49,191
can,
um,

2154
02:14:49,191 --> 02:14:53,700
they use their brain differently,
but that seems to be an exaggeration of 

2155
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:56,670
some personalities to me,
which is quite interesting.

2156
02:14:57,630 --> 02:14:59,790
The question I had was about,
um,

2157
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:05,150
so you talked about young and how um,
you should confront that which you don't

2158
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:08,980
want to confront the most or you're most
afraid of,

2159
02:15:08,981 --> 02:15:11,170
are disgusted by that you have the most 
resistance to,

2160
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:12,600
um,
so,

2161
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:15,010
but we were talking about psychedelics 
and uh,

2162
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:16,440
and the experience of hell.
So,

2163
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:22,180
uh,
at least some of the people I've talked 

2164
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:22,350
to,
they're described negative trip says I'm

2165
02:15:22,530 --> 02:15:26,670
an experience of a,
of constant fear,

2166
02:15:26,730 --> 02:15:28,570
prolonged fear,
and um,

2167
02:15:28,650 --> 02:15:33,650
some of the most dramatic and 
personalized that they've ever 

2168
02:15:33,661 --> 02:15:38,661
experienced.
So shouldn't a negative psychedelic 

2169
02:15:38,661 --> 02:15:42,230
trips elicit the kind of concentration 
that a young thought you should engage 

2170
02:15:42,930 --> 02:15:43,110
in?

2171
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:47,640
Could be?
Could well be it?

2172
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:54,480
It's conceivable that I read this 
strange book once that made the claim 

2173
02:15:59,221 --> 02:16:04,221
that what was in the Ark of the covenant
was a mixture that was made from am 

2174
02:16:04,830 --> 02:16:06,330
Anita Mascara,
mushrooms,

2175
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:12,590
and that's not as far fetched as you 
might think because there was a 

2176
02:16:12,590 --> 02:16:16,251
mycologist in amateur knit mycologist 
named Gordon West saw who established 

2177
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:22,340
credibly the notion that it was an Itam 
is scarier potions that was the Soma of 

2178
02:16:24,691 --> 02:16:28,980
the rig Veda,
and so it's a strange idea,

2179
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:29,380
but

2180
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:35,940
it's not an idea that's completely 
outside of the realm of possibility and 

2181
02:16:38,051 --> 02:16:41,520
the Amanitas must carry out the Flyer 
Erik,

2182
02:16:41,890 --> 02:16:46,890
the red mushroom with white dots and 
it's used in shamanic rituals in cross 

2183
02:16:46,890 --> 02:16:51,250
Asia and it's apparently not toxic and 
it's dried form.

2184
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:54,820
Although that is not a recommendation.
No,

2185
02:16:54,910 --> 02:16:59,910
this is serious,
serious and dangerous speculation and 

2186
02:16:59,951 --> 02:17:04,951
material.
One of the things that the priests had 

2187
02:17:04,951 --> 02:17:09,751
to do before they communed with what was
ever in the Ark of the covenant was 

2188
02:17:10,841 --> 02:17:15,841
purified themselves and so one 
possibility is that the bad psychedelic 

2189
02:17:18,611 --> 02:17:23,611
experience is a involuntary 
confrontation with what you'd describe 

2190
02:17:24,551 --> 02:17:29,551
as the shadow.
Like so be aware of experimenting with 

2191
02:17:32,670 --> 02:17:37,020
substances that produce divine 
revelations if you're in a serious state

2192
02:17:37,021 --> 02:17:42,021
of disorder.
And I do think that is what happens to 

2193
02:17:42,021 --> 02:17:45,411
people is that they encounter everything
about them that's chaotic and out of 

2194
02:17:46,411 --> 02:17:51,411
place and some people get trapped in 
that and they can't get beyond it and 

2195
02:17:51,411 --> 02:17:52,620
that's because there's so much of it

2196
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:57,080
and so,
but we don't know enough to know.

2197
02:17:58,970 --> 02:18:03,970
So thanks.

2198
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:17,720
So you a son of a bitch.
How are you?

2199
02:18:20,030 --> 02:18:22,170
I'm not too bad.
You got a question?

2200
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:27,080
No,
I've got a real question.

2201
02:18:27,081 --> 02:18:28,910
I got a question.
You're going to like this one.

2202
02:18:29,010 --> 02:18:34,010
Okay.
It's about inspiration because you talk 

2203
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:35,891
about inspiration quite a bit in this 
lecture series and also I wanted to 

2204
02:18:35,891 --> 02:18:39,491
point out you have a I guess a 45 minute
armchair discussion which you have a 

2205
02:18:40,251 --> 02:18:45,251
video of of one paragraph of Nietzsche's
beyond good and evil just posted and it 

2206
02:18:45,381 --> 02:18:50,381
seems like you're awestruck at the 
structure and the choices and I guess 

2207
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:56,620
the ideas contained in various layers of
this paragraph and you're inspired and 

2208
02:18:57,411 --> 02:19:00,560
that inspires you to I guess,
do your work that you do.

2209
02:19:01,130 --> 02:19:06,130
I encountered I guess a similar 
phenomenon here with one sentence 

2210
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:11,950
written by the Great Joseph Cardinal 
Ratzinger and I mean this one sentence 

2211
02:19:13,191 --> 02:19:18,191
answers the question,
why do people search for God and if you 

2212
02:19:18,191 --> 02:19:19,360
could read it out and then 
deconstructed.

2213
02:19:19,370 --> 02:19:24,370
It's once.
It's at the end of page one.

2214
02:19:27,141 --> 02:19:27,650
Oh,
five.

2215
02:19:27,651 --> 02:19:29,570
If you want to read it from the book or 
I just.

2216
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:34,640
That's the question.
That human existence not only poses but 

2217
02:19:35,311 --> 02:19:39,150
itself is the inconclusiveness inherent 
in it.

2218
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:43,440
The bounds it comes up against and that 
yet urine for the unbounded,

2219
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:48,740
more or less in the sense of niches,
assertion that all pleasure yearns for 

2220
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:49,950
eternity.
It experiences itself as a moment.

2221
02:19:50,430 --> 02:19:55,430
This simultaneity of being limited and 
of yearning for the unbounded and open 

2222
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:59,870
has always presented,
man from resting and himself made him 

2223
02:19:59,870 --> 02:20:03,441
sense that he is not self sufficient,
but only comes to himself by going 

2224
02:20:03,441 --> 02:20:05,910
outside himself and moving toward the 
entirely other.

2225
02:20:05,911 --> 02:20:10,050
An infinitely greater well.
It's a hell of a sentence.

2226
02:20:11,380 --> 02:20:16,380
When I read that sentence,
I decided I wanted to write like Joseph 

2227
02:20:16,930 --> 02:20:21,930
Cardinal Ratzinger.
I had a very similar experience when I 

2228
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:21,930
watched the Joe Rogan podcast.
Eight 77.

2229
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:24,260
I said,
I want to speak like Jordan Peterson.

2230
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:26,570
That's what I wanted to do.

2231
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:31,670
So I had this.
I had this discussion with a patron and 

2232
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:36,621
supporter this week,
a young guy from Australia and and he 

2233
02:20:36,991 --> 02:20:40,290
said something very interesting that's 
related to this and it's,

2234
02:20:40,530 --> 02:20:42,960
it's something that's very profound.
I said,

2235
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:48,020
I think there's this idea in 
Christianity that we've discussed 

2236
02:20:48,361 --> 02:20:52,350
briefly that the judge and the redeemer 
are the same figure.

2237
02:20:52,980 --> 02:20:54,450
Now,
you know in the book of revelation,

2238
02:20:54,451 --> 02:20:59,451
you may know this and you may not,
Christ comes back as a judge and he has 

2239
02:21:00,331 --> 02:21:04,110
a sword coming into.
It's a revelatory vision that that book,

2240
02:21:04,111 --> 02:21:07,800
it's a very strange.
It's the last thing you'd expect.

2241
02:21:07,801 --> 02:21:10,230
Conservative Christian is to believe in,
believe me,

2242
02:21:10,470 --> 02:21:13,680
it's such a visionary hallucination,
the book of revelation,

2243
02:21:13,681 --> 02:21:18,681
but Christ comes back with a sword 
coming out of his mouth and he comes 

2244
02:21:18,681 --> 02:21:22,041
back as a judge and he divides the 
damned from the redeemed and most are 

2245
02:21:22,041 --> 02:21:24,660
damned in some are redeemed who's very,
very harsh.

2246
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:29,900
A young believer that the figure of 
Christ in the Gospels was too agreeable 

2247
02:21:30,030 --> 02:21:35,030
to merciful,
to tilted towards mercy and that that 

2248
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:37,940
called out for a counter position and 
that was the counter position of 

2249
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:39,240
judgment.
Very interesting hypothesis,

2250
02:21:39,750 --> 02:21:42,480
but then,
but then there's this melding of the two

2251
02:21:42,481 --> 02:21:45,210
ideas that the judge and the redeemer 
are the same thing.

2252
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:48,120
Okay?
Now,

2253
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:53,870
this young man told me that his life 
lacked purpose and direction and meaning

2254
02:21:54,481 --> 02:21:57,510
and that he was nihilistic until he 
started.

2255
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:00,390
He read Zen and the art of motorcycle 
maintenance,

2256
02:22:01,110 --> 02:22:02,670
which is a book I actually liked quite a
bit.

2257
02:22:02,671 --> 02:22:05,880
I've read it three times at different 
decades of my life and one of the things

2258
02:22:05,881 --> 02:22:10,881
that's very interesting about that book 
is that it's an examination of the idea 

2259
02:22:10,881 --> 02:22:14,061
of quality,
of the idea that there are qualitative 

2260
02:22:14,061 --> 02:22:17,751
distinctions between things and that we 
have an instinct to make qualitative 

2261
02:22:17,751 --> 02:22:22,251
distinctions,
and so a qualitative distinction is 

2262
02:22:22,251 --> 02:22:23,910
simply this is better than that,
which is a judgment.

2263
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:29,750
Okay.
What ratzinger is hypothesizing is that 

2264
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:31,860
the person ended up,
you know,

2265
02:22:31,861 --> 02:22:35,010
how the idea of the modern ideas,
you're supposed to accept yourself.

2266
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:37,200
I think that's an insane idea,
by the way.

2267
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:38,190
Really.
I think.

2268
02:22:38,191 --> 02:22:42,480
I can't think of a more nihilistic idea 
then that you're already okay.

2269
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:43,380
It's like,
no,

2270
02:22:43,381 --> 02:22:48,381
you're not,
and the reason you're not is could be 

2271
02:22:48,381 --> 02:22:48,381
way more than you are,
and so what do you want to be?

2272
02:22:48,381 --> 02:22:52,440
You want to be okay as you are or do you
want to strive towards what's better?

2273
02:22:53,150 --> 02:22:55,140
And this young man,
this Australia,

2274
02:22:55,141 --> 02:23:00,141
and he said that the reason that Zen and
the art of motorcycle maintenance had 

2275
02:23:00,141 --> 02:23:03,591
such an impact on him was because he 
wasn't happy with his current mode of 

2276
02:23:03,591 --> 02:23:07,911
being right.
He didn't consider the manner in which 

2277
02:23:07,911 --> 02:23:11,721
he conducted themselves sufficient and 
the fact that the author of Zen and laid

2278
02:23:14,461 --> 02:23:17,440
out the notion that you could make 
qualitative distinctions in there.

2279
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:22,470
There really was a difference between 
good things and bad things are great 

2280
02:23:22,470 --> 02:23:23,280
things and evil things.
It gives you direction.

2281
02:23:24,030 --> 02:23:29,030
It gives you,
gives you the possibility of moving 

2282
02:23:29,030 --> 02:23:32,181
upward and and ratzinger is pointing out
at least to some degree that human 

2283
02:23:32,181 --> 02:23:36,060
beings are insufficient in and of 
themselves and need the movement upward.

2284
02:23:36,061 --> 02:23:39,360
And so they need to conceptualize 
something like the highest good.

2285
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:44,070
And then to strive for that.
And the thing is is that there isn't any

2286
02:23:44,071 --> 02:23:48,990
difference between conceptualizing the 
good and being judged.

2287
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:51,800
Because if you're going to conceptualize
the good and move towards it,

2288
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:54,150
what you have to do is separate from 
yourself.

2289
02:23:54,151 --> 02:23:57,870
All those things that aren't good and 
leave them behind.

2290
02:23:58,140 --> 02:24:00,780
And that's why the redeemer and the 
judge or the same thing,

2291
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:03,510
and one of the things that's really 
appalling,

2292
02:24:03,511 --> 02:24:08,511
I think about our modern world is that 
we're rejecting the notion of 

2293
02:24:08,511 --> 02:24:08,910
qualitative distinctions.

2294
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:09,540
You said,
well,

2295
02:24:09,541 --> 02:24:14,541
we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings
by saying that one thing is better than 

2296
02:24:14,541 --> 02:24:14,541
the other.
It's like,

2297
02:24:14,541 --> 02:24:15,180
okay,
fair enough.

2298
02:24:15,181 --> 02:24:19,050
It's not fun to be cast off with the 
damned,

2299
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:24,260
that's for sure.
But if people are in fact insufficient 

2300
02:24:24,260 --> 02:24:27,390
in an in their present condition,
which seems to be the case,

2301
02:24:27,570 --> 02:24:32,570
we try finding someone who isn't.
Then if you deny the possibility of 

2302
02:24:32,830 --> 02:24:37,770
qualitative distinction because you want
to promote a radical egalitarianism,

2303
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:42,980
then you remove the possibility of 
redemption because there's no movement 

2304
02:24:42,980 --> 02:24:46,551
towards the good.
And it seems to me that it's a 

2305
02:24:46,551 --> 02:24:48,830
catastrophe to sacrifice the good for.
Well,

2306
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:53,930
it's a catastrophe to sacrifice the good
for the equal because for us to be 

2307
02:24:53,930 --> 02:24:58,131
equal,
it would be mean as far as I can tell 

2308
02:24:58,131 --> 02:24:58,830
that we would all be equally unredeemed 
and miserable.

2309
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:04,580
And so you also mentioned in the 
previous paragraph,

2310
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:14,000
I believe that even in the case when you
experienced the human life at its 

2311
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:18,381
fullest,
at its most beautiful as it's most 

2312
02:25:18,381 --> 02:25:18,381
meaningful,
you have a deep,

2313
02:25:18,381 --> 02:25:22,080
I guess understanding that you have 
something to be thankful for you.

2314
02:25:22,081 --> 02:25:24,030
You need to thank somebody for that.
It's not

2315
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:28,210
based entirely on your own merit and 
that points you toward something else.

2316
02:25:28,211 --> 02:25:33,130
And also in that you can have a 
profoundly positive experience,

2317
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:39,000
you know,
in the best sense without that 

2318
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:39,000
accompanying it.
That's a feeling of being blessed.

2319
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:43,691
It's something like that back.
And also I'd like to wait,

2320
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:46,090
hold it.
I'm going to stop you.

2321
02:25:46,370 --> 02:25:48,310
Okay,
because I'm going to ask this person,

2322
02:25:48,430 --> 02:25:52,360
but I would like to say that those were 
remarkably good questions.

2323
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:58,030
So the experience and thank you for the 
wonderful lecturer.

2324
02:26:03,850 --> 02:26:08,850
I'm giving you a working definition of 
truth and say within the Abrahamic 

2325
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:15,190
religious tradition,
would you say that the more perhaps 

2326
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:19,180
mystical sects and denominations which 
play place more emphasis on the 

2327
02:26:20,210 --> 02:26:25,210
transcendental experience of God or the 
experience as opposed to the more 

2328
02:26:26,571 --> 02:26:31,571
fundamentalist Orthodox literalist which
perhaps emphasize the,

2329
02:26:32,330 --> 02:26:34,660
what I've noticed,
um,

2330
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:40,420
moral policing of behaviors.
Would you say that the former is more 

2331
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:43,280
true than the latter?
No and no.

2332
02:26:43,350 --> 02:26:45,980
And,
and it continues to be.

2333
02:26:46,210 --> 02:26:51,210
We could former in some way serve as an 
antidote to extremist literalism 

2334
02:26:52,250 --> 02:26:54,410
jihadism,
fundamentalism.

2335
02:26:54,450 --> 02:26:54,810
Okay.
So,

2336
02:26:54,811 --> 02:26:57,810
yes to the second part,
but the first part,

2337
02:26:57,970 --> 02:27:00,080
it's a great question.
We do.

2338
02:27:00,310 --> 02:27:04,980
We did some research on this awhile back
because we were looking at the different

2339
02:27:04,981 --> 02:27:08,970
religious proclivities of liberals and 
conservatives and liberals.

2340
02:27:08,971 --> 02:27:13,971
Like if you're liberal it means you're 
high in openness and low in 

2341
02:27:13,971 --> 02:27:16,131
conscientiousness and if you're 
conservative than your high in 

2342
02:27:16,131 --> 02:27:18,921
conscientiousness and low in openness 
and that the liberals are spiritual and 

2343
02:27:18,921 --> 02:27:22,941
the conservatives are dogmatic,
but it's best to think of those as 

2344
02:27:23,160 --> 02:27:24,570
partners,
right?

2345
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:29,600
Because the,
the spiritual mystical end is where the 

2346
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:33,771
revelations emerge and the renewal.
But that's where there's chaos and 

2347
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:39,380
discord as well because what's new 
disrupts what stable and so what's new 

2348
02:27:39,901 --> 02:27:43,230
has to be turned into.
It has to be integrated into what stable

2349
02:27:43,231 --> 02:27:48,231
and so you need both those poles and of 
course if the dogmatist get the upper 

2350
02:27:48,231 --> 02:27:51,591
hand,
then everything turns into a tyranny of 

2351
02:27:51,591 --> 02:27:52,080
stone that that's Egypt,
Egypt in the Old Testament.

2352
02:27:52,350 --> 02:27:53,820
But if the,
if the.

2353
02:27:54,180 --> 02:27:59,180
If the mystics get the upper hand,
then everything floats off the earth 

2354
02:27:59,180 --> 02:28:02,610
into some impractical ether.
That is equally counterproductive.

2355
02:28:02,910 --> 02:28:06,420
And so there has to be a dialogue 
between those different polls.

2356
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:09,420
And I think you see that in the 
distribution of human temperament.

2357
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:12,270
You know the conscientious types,
they tend to be orderly.

2358
02:28:12,420 --> 02:28:17,420
The orderly types tend to tend towards 
the kind of a right wing 

2359
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:18,810
totalitarianism.
That's their proclivity when they.

2360
02:28:18,860 --> 02:28:19,650
When,
when they.

2361
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:22,250
When things get out of hand,
if they're low in openness,

2362
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:27,430
that's a danger.
But you see the same thing with the 

2363
02:28:27,430 --> 02:28:29,840
people who are too open and not 
conscientious at all.

2364
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:32,780
They're dreaming all the time,
but they never do anything.

2365
02:28:32,781 --> 02:28:35,030
There's never anything implemented and 
that that's a bad.

2366
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:40,360
That's a bad thing,
so I don't think that you can say that 

2367
02:28:40,360 --> 02:28:44,160
like the dogmatic structure is necessary
because that perpetuates the system and 

2368
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:48,341
the revelatory elements is necessary 
because that renews it when renewal is 

2369
02:28:48,341 --> 02:28:51,581
necessary and there has to be a 
continual dialogue between those 

2370
02:28:51,581 --> 02:28:54,641
elements so that neither of them fall 
prey to their own particular form of 

2371
02:28:54,641 --> 02:28:59,080
pathology.
And that's one of the problems with the 

2372
02:28:59,080 --> 02:28:59,510
current political.
What would you call it,

2373
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:03,080
polarization that's occurring across the
West,

2374
02:29:03,081 --> 02:29:06,170
is that the right and the left are not 
talking to each other anymore and it's a

2375
02:29:06,171 --> 02:29:11,171
very bad thing because the left will 
wander into a pit and fail without 

2376
02:29:12,530 --> 02:29:13,250
boundaries.

2377
02:29:13,370 --> 02:29:18,370
And the right will enclose itself in 
smaller and smaller spaces until it 

2378
02:29:18,370 --> 02:29:22,451
can't move without the left.
And one of the reasons that democracy 

2379
02:29:22,451 --> 02:29:24,470
works is because it makes people talk or
allows them to talk.

2380
02:29:25,030 --> 02:29:27,330
You can have it either way,
but it,

2381
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:28,000
it's,
it's,

2382
02:29:28,090 --> 02:29:32,750
it's because every virtue has its vice.
Right?

2383
02:29:32,751 --> 02:29:33,960
And so,
uh,

2384
02:29:33,990 --> 02:29:38,990
met a virtue is something like the 
amalgamation of singular virtues into 

2385
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:42,911
something that's a transcendent 
structures that has more to do with the 

2386
02:29:42,911 --> 02:29:44,270
harmony of virtues rather than with any 
given virtue,

2387
02:29:44,750 --> 02:29:49,750
even though I think that free freedom of
speech is the clearest manifestation of 

2388
02:29:49,750 --> 02:29:51,140
that harmony of virtues.
So.

2389
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:55,700
And so all could be a lubricant for the 
beginning of this discussion.

2390
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:59,290
Do you think between the Liberals and 
conservatives?

2391
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:09,560
I don't know how to answer that doesn't,
doesn't follow immediately from your,

2392
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:16,670
from your initial presuppositions.
So the ar experience is a different 

2393
02:30:16,670 --> 02:30:18,210
issue.
Yeah.

2394
02:30:18,211 --> 02:30:20,880
Well the.
Yes.

2395
02:30:20,910 --> 02:30:24,760
At least exposing conservatives to some 
form of that experience because it,

2396
02:30:24,810 --> 02:30:28,200
could it be a prerequisite for more 
productive dialogue?

2397
02:30:31,390 --> 02:30:32,420
See,
I mean in,

2398
02:30:32,430 --> 02:30:33,000
in,
in,

2399
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:34,120
in,
in the church,

2400
02:30:34,121 --> 02:30:36,880
in a church ceremony,
let's say a classical church ceremony,

2401
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:39,130
there's some intermingling of both,
right?

2402
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:44,280
You mean you think about a church 
ceremony that takes place in a gothic 

2403
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:44,280
cathedral.
We started,

2404
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:47,800
got the dogma and the and the,
and the relatively rigid rule structure,

2405
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:53,040
but at the same time that's aligned with
intense beauty in the architectural 

2406
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:53,320
forms.
In the,

2407
02:30:53,321 --> 02:30:58,321
in the light streaming in through the 
stained glass windows and the music and 

2408
02:30:58,321 --> 02:30:59,890
I mean the Gothic cathedral is a forest,
right?

2409
02:30:59,891 --> 02:31:04,891
It's a stone forest with sunlight 
streaming in through the trees and 

2410
02:31:04,891 --> 02:31:09,570
instead it's a balance between structure
light there absolutely unbelievable 

2411
02:31:09,570 --> 02:31:11,920
structures and then they speak of the 
transcendent but it.

2412
02:31:12,100 --> 02:31:17,100
But inside that there's a structure and 
so it seems that in order for the 

2413
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:18,190
religious impulse to be balanced 
property,

2414
02:31:18,191 --> 02:31:20,190
there has to be a reasonable

2415
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:25,940
dialog.
Even in practice between the mystical 

2416
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:25,940
are inspiring,
transcendent,

2417
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:26,910
and the dogmatic.
Yeah.

2418
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:32,240
Either of those can go as either of 
those goes to straight without the 

2419
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:32,580
other.
If you're too dogmatic,

2420
02:31:32,581 --> 02:31:37,380
do you need all likely?
Yes.

2421
02:31:37,381 --> 02:31:42,381
Because that would show you that there's
something beyond your own 

2422
02:31:42,381 --> 02:31:42,381
presuppositions.
So,

2423
02:31:43,530 --> 02:31:45,720
so all I should tell you something 
interesting about,

2424
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:46,500
ah,
as a,

2425
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:51,860
as a physiological phenomena,
you know how you're listening to music 

2426
02:31:51,860 --> 02:31:55,011
and you get chills.
Some people experienced that more than 

2427
02:31:55,011 --> 02:31:55,170
others.
Open people experienced that more.

2428
02:31:55,171 --> 02:32:00,171
Or music is a pretty reliable solicitor.
Have chills.

2429
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:06,090
That's Palo erection.
That's your hair standing on end.

2430
02:32:06,510 --> 02:32:09,600
You see a cat when it sees a dog puffs 
up,

2431
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:13,370
that's all.
It's the same thing like that.

2432
02:32:13,371 --> 02:32:16,320
That chill is your hair standing on end 
and that's the.

2433
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:21,090
That's the sensation you get in the 
presence of a predator.

2434
02:32:21,150 --> 02:32:24,750
It's something like that.
And so there are experiences.

2435
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:30,680
I mean obviously it's become very 
cognitively and emotionally complex and 

2436
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:34,671
human beings,
but it's fundamental evolutionary 

2437
02:32:34,671 --> 02:32:37,640
underpinning is the instantaneous pilot 
erection that you see in prey animals 

2438
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:39,990
when they're confronted by a predator.
And of course that would be,

2439
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:45,170
if you are a rabbit,
you can bloody well believed that you 

2440
02:32:45,170 --> 02:32:45,540
see a wolf and it would inspire all,
that's for sure.

2441
02:32:45,541 --> 02:32:50,541
I mean,
if a wolf that was 20 feet high came 

2442
02:32:50,541 --> 02:32:50,541
bounding in here,
man,

2443
02:32:50,541 --> 02:32:54,920
you'd feel off.
So now that will convince you that 

2444
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:55,890
there's something that you still need to
know.

2445
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:01,580
Last,
last question,

2446
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:03,710
perfect timing.
Hi Dr.

2447
02:33:03,711 --> 02:33:08,711
Beard Peterson.
My name is Gary and I'm a clinical and 

2448
02:33:08,711 --> 02:33:10,901
counseling master's student right now.
And so one of the key ideas that's been 

2449
02:33:10,901 --> 02:33:15,041
surfacing time and time again in your 
lecturers is the idea that phenomenology

2450
02:33:15,470 --> 02:33:20,470
is structured and flows mythologically 
and the way that plays out as I'm 

2451
02:33:23,870 --> 02:33:28,870
supposing effectively just pay attention
to what comes up kind of naturally and 

2452
02:33:29,661 --> 02:33:34,661
you can locate the cow elements and your
experience and product them with 

2453
02:33:34,661 --> 02:33:39,460
whatever degree of necessity you think.
So I'm trying to situate this within the

2454
02:33:39,561 --> 02:33:44,561
clinical context.
We can conceptualize psychotherapy as a 

2455
02:33:46,941 --> 02:33:51,941
kind of guided journey just as you 
touched on in this lecture where it's 

2456
02:33:52,491 --> 02:33:55,190
more of a metal journey in a sense,
a meadow heroic journey,

2457
02:33:55,191 --> 02:33:56,450
but I know how you want to think about 
it,

2458
02:33:56,780 --> 02:34:01,780
but just for those of us who are 
interested in kind of grounding and 

2459
02:34:01,851 --> 02:34:05,510
implementing these ideas within 
psychotherapeutic practice,

2460
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:08,900
what should we watch out for in the 
process itself?

2461
02:34:09,500 --> 02:34:11,720
What comes up?
What should we be afraid of,

2462
02:34:11,721 --> 02:34:14,990
were fearful of or cautious about,
or what should we tend towards?

2463
02:34:15,170 --> 02:34:15,890
That's my question.

2464
02:34:17,860 --> 02:34:20,120
Well,
I think one of the,

2465
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:26,760
one of the people who I've read that's 
had the biggest impact on me as a 

2466
02:34:27,101 --> 02:34:30,390
clinician was Carl Rogers.
Um,

2467
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:36,060
and the reason for that is that Carl 
Rogers put tremendous emphasis on 

2468
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:39,301
listening,
like it's almost impossible to 

2469
02:34:39,301 --> 02:34:40,540
overestimate how useful it is to listen 
to your clients.

2470
02:34:40,710 --> 02:34:45,710
Like you need a Meta scheme in some 
sense and the metal scheme I think is 

2471
02:34:47,081 --> 02:34:52,081
laid out in the sermon on the mount.
It's something like Orient Yourself and 

2472
02:34:52,961 --> 02:34:57,961
your client towards the good that the 
client has to conceptualize what that 

2473
02:34:59,051 --> 02:35:00,940
might be.
You can serve as a guide,

2474
02:35:00,941 --> 02:35:05,941
but it has to come from that person 
because one of the things that you want 

2475
02:35:05,941 --> 02:35:09,721
to find out from your client is okay,
what's wrong they have to tell you and 

2476
02:35:11,050 --> 02:35:13,990
what would not having something wrong 
look like,

2477
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:19,220
like what is it?
If you could have what you wanted and 

2478
02:35:19,220 --> 02:35:19,510
that and that,
that would be good.

2479
02:35:19,510 --> 02:35:21,140
What would that look like?
Okay.

2480
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:23,260
So that establishes your star,
right?

2481
02:35:23,261 --> 02:35:28,261
It's like Japan establishing the 
relationship with the Star at the 

2482
02:35:28,261 --> 02:35:28,630
beginning of Pinocchio.
Here's what we're aiming at.

2483
02:35:29,230 --> 02:35:30,760
Okay,
so now you've got that Schema.

2484
02:35:30,761 --> 02:35:34,000
Here's what we're aiming at.
Now you might say you might think,

2485
02:35:34,001 --> 02:35:39,001
well now what happens to the client as 
they meet their dragons along the way 

2486
02:35:39,001 --> 02:35:43,140
and their dragons would be,
well now you know what you want and 

2487
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:44,470
there are things in your way,
and some of those things might.

2488
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:47,320
Many of those things are going to be 
intensely practical,

2489
02:35:47,590 --> 02:35:49,720
but they're practical slash 
psychological,

2490
02:35:49,721 --> 02:35:54,721
so like so maybe someone is has a job 
and they would like to move forward in 

2491
02:35:54,721 --> 02:35:58,891
their job,
but they're terrified of speaking in 

2492
02:35:58,891 --> 02:35:58,891
public.
Well,

2493
02:35:58,891 --> 02:36:01,831
you know,
is that a psychological problem or a 

2494
02:36:01,831 --> 02:36:01,831
practical problem?
It's both.

2495
02:36:01,831 --> 02:36:03,430
It's also a real problem in many 
positions.

2496
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:08,350
Unless you can speak fluently publicly,
you're going to hit a ceiling and you're

2497
02:36:08,351 --> 02:36:13,351
not going to go anywhere and so for the 
person to move towards that goal,

2498
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:20,160
then they have to confront the obstacles
that manifest themselves within that 

2499
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:24,721
framework.
And part of your job as a clinician is 

2500
02:36:24,721 --> 02:36:26,290
to identify the obstacles and to 
discriminate them from things they don't

2501
02:36:26,291 --> 02:36:27,690
have to worry about.
Right?

2502
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:29,620
Part of it is,
you know,

2503
02:36:29,621 --> 02:36:34,240
you can't just run around and try to 
combat all of the chaos in the world.

2504
02:36:34,360 --> 02:36:36,820
Some of it is your chaos and a bunch of 
it isn't,

2505
02:36:37,210 --> 02:36:42,210
and the chaos that's yours is the chaos 
that emerges as you move towards a 

2506
02:36:42,210 --> 02:36:45,551
necessary goal and so partly what you're
doing by listening to your client is to 

2507
02:36:45,551 --> 02:36:47,020
help them cut their dragons down to 
size.

2508
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:52,280
You know,
because what'll happen if you start to 

2509
02:36:52,280 --> 02:36:52,280
talk to somebody about public speaking 
and you really talked to them,

2510
02:36:52,310 --> 02:36:57,310
is that you decompose the problem into a
set of maybe 20 sub problems like,

2511
02:36:57,640 --> 02:37:02,640
well,
do you know exactly how to give a 

2512
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:02,640
speech?
Like what's your theory of,

2513
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:03,400
of,
of public speaking?

2514
02:37:04,030 --> 02:37:06,010
You know how to look at people when 
you're talking.

2515
02:37:06,460 --> 02:37:09,250
Do you know how to speak loudly enough 
so that people can hear you?

2516
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:12,940
Do you have a philosophy of,
of public speaking?

2517
02:37:13,180 --> 02:37:15,440
I mean all those things are necessary.
In order to do it properly,

2518
02:37:15,441 --> 02:37:16,400
you need to decompose

2519
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:19,430
that with the client and then to make 
those problems,

2520
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:24,520
you have to decompose them to the point 
where they can be met by a practical 

2521
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:27,140
solution and then you have to guide the 
person through the implementation of the

2522
02:37:27,141 --> 02:37:32,141
practical solution and mostly you do 
that by listening.

2523
02:37:32,870 --> 02:37:37,870
It's like what you need to be is the 
person who helps the person that you're 

2524
02:37:37,870 --> 02:37:39,650
working with orient themselves towards a
better future.

2525
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:43,460
That's the compact.
You and I are in this space at this time

2526
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:46,670
to make things better.
First of all,

2527
02:37:46,671 --> 02:37:51,671
we have to decide what better would look
like and second we need a strategy and 

2528
02:37:51,671 --> 02:37:53,210
third we need to.
Once we have that,

2529
02:37:53,211 --> 02:37:58,211
we're going to see the obstacles and 
some of those are going to be 

2530
02:37:58,211 --> 02:38:00,581
psychological and some of them are going
to be practical and we're going to 

2531
02:38:00,581 --> 02:38:03,191
engage in joint problem solving of 
whatever sort is necessary in order to 

2532
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:09,550
minimize the impact of those problems or
to gain from the problems in dream 

2533
02:38:09,550 --> 02:38:10,430
analysis can be extremely useful for 
that.

2534
02:38:10,430 --> 02:38:15,430
By the way,
it's even more useful for helping the 

2535
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:17,090
person identify what the goal is because
that's often difficult for people,

2536
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:17,600
so like,
well,

2537
02:38:17,601 --> 02:38:19,970
I know that something's wrong,
but I don't know what I want.

2538
02:38:20,390 --> 02:38:22,790
Sometimes people get so stuck there that
they just can't get.

2539
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:25,760
They just can't get out of it.
So.

2540
02:38:25,761 --> 02:38:30,761
And then what would you watch out for 
phenomenal phenomenologically?

2541
02:38:31,610 --> 02:38:33,320
The way it shows up,
the way it's experienced?

2542
02:38:34,910 --> 02:38:36,260
Well,
I would say as a clinician,

2543
02:38:36,261 --> 02:38:38,750
one of the things that you should watch 
out for is resentment.

2544
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:44,680
So there's A.
There's a couple of rules of thumb I 

2545
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:47,421
that I think are useful.
Don't do anything for your clients that 

2546
02:38:47,421 --> 02:38:48,020
they can do for themselves and don't do 
them any favors.

2547
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:54,100
Now I think you can step beyond the 
confines of your role carefully now and 

2548
02:38:56,931 --> 02:39:01,931
then to show that there's a more human 
connection than the merely contractual.

2549
02:39:06,020 --> 02:39:11,020
I think that's very useful,
but their problems are not your 

2550
02:39:11,020 --> 02:39:15,671
problems.
You do not have any right to their 

2551
02:39:15,671 --> 02:39:17,501
problems and so you have to maintain 
that detachment because otherwise you 

2552
02:39:17,501 --> 02:39:21,041
can steal their destiny.
You don't want to be the person that 

2553
02:39:21,041 --> 02:39:21,680
solves their problems because you steal 
their destiny.

2554
02:39:21,681 --> 02:39:26,681
When you do that,
you want to be someone with whom they 

2555
02:39:26,681 --> 02:39:27,950
can figure things out for themself and 
so there's.

2556
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:30,890
There can be hubris and being a 
clinician because you can be the problem

2557
02:39:30,891 --> 02:39:32,870
solver and that elevates you to a 
position.

2558
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:36,170
You elevate yourself to that position.
You'll fall flat on your face,

2559
02:39:36,260 --> 02:39:38,660
you'll hurt your clients and things will
kick back on you very,

2560
02:39:38,661 --> 02:39:41,120
very hard because what the hell do you 
know?

2561
02:39:41,860 --> 02:39:46,860
Right?
Nothing because that person is very 

2562
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:49,070
complicated and they need to.
They need to sort themselves out and.

2563
02:39:49,071 --> 02:39:54,071
But you can be a facilitator for that,
but that's all you should be and so you 

2564
02:39:54,071 --> 02:39:54,170
have to watch that.

2565
02:39:54,170 --> 02:39:57,680
You have to watch over.
Becoming over entail really entangled,

2566
02:39:57,681 --> 02:40:02,681
so you have to maintain your detachment 
in the best sense and you have to not 

2567
02:40:02,681 --> 02:40:06,821
overstep your.
It's easy to become hubris stick when 

2568
02:40:06,821 --> 02:40:07,370
the person is looking to you for the 
answers.

2569
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:10,250
It's like you might.
You don't have the answers,

2570
02:40:10,251 --> 02:40:13,860
although you might be able to find,
help the person find their way.

2571
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:16,420
That's what you do with everyone you 
love to write.

2572
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:21,440
I mean you don't provide them with the 
answers because then they become little 

2573
02:40:21,571 --> 02:40:24,540
clones of you and unhappy,
bitter,

2574
02:40:24,541 --> 02:40:29,541
resentful and angry little clones of 
view because you usurped their destiny.

2575
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:35,960
And so the same thing applies within 
familiar arrangements or friendships,

2576
02:40:36,571 --> 02:40:38,670
all of that.
So

2577
02:40:40,810 --> 02:40:45,270
thank you.
