1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,880
So I've been thinking this week about 
doing this one of them once a month on a

2
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,440
continuing basis,

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,970
so thank you.

4
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,000
So I think if I do that,
I think it will be here,

5
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:32,210
although it's harder to rent this 
theater during the academic year,

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,540
but if it isn't here it will be 
somewhere else and I'd like to continue 

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,390
doing this.
I'm learning a lot from doing it and,

8
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,050
and uh,
once a month would really be good 

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:44,050
because then I could really do the 
background work and,

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,730
and uh,
and I could probably do that for a 

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,580
couple of years because obviously this 
is going very quickly,

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,490
but that's okay.
You know,

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,500
I mean,
it shouldn't go any faster than it can 

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:56,510
go and that's how it,
that's how it seems to me anyways.

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,950
So,
uh,

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,210
this has been,
this has been a very steep learning 

17
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,350
curve for me with regards to these 
stories because I didn't understand them

18
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:14,351
very well and I've got better at using 
the resources on line to help me do my 

19
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:19,601
background investigation.
I have a lot of books and some of you 

20
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,390
may have noticed that I'm online.
I posted a conversation I had with 

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,480
Jonathan Otto and his and his brother 
Matthew.

22
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,820
Um,
I hope it's matthew.

23
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:31,880
I re names escape me so badly,
but I believe that's right.

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,910
He just finished a book on the,
on the Bible and so I've been doing a 

25
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,180
lot of thinking and talking about these 
stories,

26
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,910
trying to understand what they're about.
And,

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,650
and then there's all these commentaries,
there's a great site,

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,840
I think it's called Bible hub that has 
every single verse of the Bible is 

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,791
listed there.
And then with each verse there are like 

30
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:58,160
they've aggregated 10 commentaries from 
about 10 commentaries from over the last

31
00:01:58,161 --> 00:01:58,970
400 years.

32
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,970
And so there's like a dense page on 
every line and that's one of the things 

33
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:06,050
that's really interesting about this 
book too,

34
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:11,051
is that it's,
it's aggregated so much commentary that 

35
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:11,051
it's,
that it's,

36
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:13,730
it's much bigger than it looks.
The book is much bigger than it looks.

37
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:16,820
And so it's been very interesting to 
become familiar with those two.

38
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:21,821
And the fact that this site is set up 
with all the commentary split up by 

39
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:23,630
versus means you can rapidly compare the
commentaries and get a sense of,

40
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,820
you know,
how people have interpreted this over 

41
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,030
while at least several hundred years,
but of course much longer than that 

42
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,731
because of the people who wrote the 
commentaries were of course reading 

43
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:34,640
things that were older than that.
So that's been very,

44
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,510
very interesting.

45
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:36,560
Um,

46
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,620
so last week we talked about a couple of
things.

47
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,370
We talked about how you might understand
the idea of a divine encounter.

48
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,180
And then we also paralleled that with 
the idea that God disappears in the Old 

49
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:53,660
Testament.
He,

50
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,260
he bows out as the stories progress.
And that seems to be a,

51
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,190
an emergent property.
The sequencing of the stories,

52
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:05,191
right?
Because all the books were written by 

53
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:06,571
independent people are different people 
and then they were aggregated by other 

54
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:08,230
people.
And so the narrative continuity,

55
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,300
is it some kind of emergent property 
that's,

56
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,420
that's a consequence of this interaction
between people,

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,660
readers and writers over centuries.
And it's strange that given that there 

58
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,980
are also multiple coherent narratives 
that united,

59
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,760
you know,
it's really,

60
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,950
it's really not that easy to understand 
that,

61
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:25,720
but it does at least seem to be the 
case.

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,260
And so,
and the third thing we talked about was 

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,080
that as God bows out,
so to speak,

64
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,740
the,
the,

65
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,120
the,
the individual personality seems of the,

66
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:42,121
of the characters that are involved,
the human characters that are involved 

67
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:42,310
seems to become more and more developed.

68
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,680
And it isn't exactly clear what that,
I mean,

69
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,800
what it means is that God steps away and
man steps forward.

70
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,830
That's what it means.
But why it's arranged like that or they 

71
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,820
or they say ultimate significance of 
that is by no means clear.

72
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,790
And so.
So Abraham,

73
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,350
who we're going to concentrate on today 
is quite a well developed character.

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,160
And I would say there are two,
there are multiple endings and 

75
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,780
beginnings in the biblical stories.
The most important ending,

76
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,380
I suppose,
is the ending of the of the garden of 

77
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,080
Paradise and and the the disenchantment 
of the world and the and the sending 

78
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:23,410
forth of Adam and eve into history,
right into the future,

79
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,440
into a,
into a mode of being that has a future 

80
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,090
as part of it and that has history as 
part of it and that has the necessity of

81
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,890
sacrifice and toil as part of it.

82
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,380
That's obviously crucial and then 
that's.

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,610
That is replayed with the story of Noah 
because everything is destroyed and then

84
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:44,611
the world is created a new and then 
sacrifices have to be made in order for 

85
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:48,241
the world to begin.
And then you see the same thing happen 

86
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:48,241
again after the Noah story and the Tower
of Babel.

87
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:51,550
Because history,
as we really understand history seems to

88
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:56,551
start with Abraham because the stories 
of Abraham sound like historical stories

89
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:01,921
and you know,
scholars debate about the historical 

90
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:01,921
accuracy of the Bible.
And I suppose there's.

91
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,010
There's no way of determining once and 
for all the degree to which you might 

92
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,840
regard the accounts as equivalent to 
modern empirical history.

93
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:15,841
But this is a psychological 
interpretation of the biblical stories,

94
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,880
not a historical interpretation,
and it certainly does seem to be the 

95
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:20,950
case that from a psychological 
perspective,

96
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,550
we enter something like the domain of 
the modern conceptualization,

97
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,580
relatively modern conceptualization of 
history with Abraham beyond the accounts

98
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,900
of divine commands that Abraham carries 
out.

99
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,430
This is from Friedman,
man,

100
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:38,431
I mentioned in the last lecture who 
wrote the disappearance of God in a 

101
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,850
variety of other books that are well 
worth reading.

102
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,240
The narrative also includes a variety of
stories in which Abraham acts on his own

103
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:46,390
initiative.
He divides land with his nephew lot.

104
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,250
He battles kings,
he takes concubines,

105
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,400
he argues with his wife Sarah.
On two occasions he tells kings that 

106
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,990
Sarah is his sister out of fear,
that they will kill him to get his wife.

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,200
He arranges his son's marriage in the 
place of the single story of Noah's 

108
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,200
drunkenness.
There are,

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,290
in the case of Abraham,
the stories of a man's life.

110
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:08,291
And one of the things I was really 
struck by reading this in depth and 

111
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:12,641
reading the commentary is how much like 
a story about a person it is,

112
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,390
you know,
Abraham isn't a divine figure in,

113
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,110
in any,
in any archetipal sense.

114
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,110
Precisely.
I mean he has architectural elements 

115
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,690
because he's also obviously the founder 
of a nation.

116
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:26,060
But fundamentally he's a human being 
and,

117
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,510
and he makes,
he has the adventures and he makes the 

118
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,510
mistakes of a human being.
And that's,

119
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,080
it's the mistake part that really struck
me.

120
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,500
You know,
because it,

121
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,550
it,
it.

122
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,630
I was talking with a friend of mine this
week,

123
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,810
Norman Doidge,
whose a very remarkable person in many 

124
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,800
ways and he was taking me to task.
He was reading my book,

125
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,110
which I'm going to publish,
which will be out in January.

126
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,440
And in the book are in one section.
I contrasted the god of the Old 

127
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,491
Testament with the god of the New 
Testament and made the case sort of 

128
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:01,691
based on North Road fries ideas that the
god of the Old Testament was really 

129
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:02,000
harsh and judgmental,
you know?

130
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:06,160
And that the god of the New Testament 
was more merciful and you know,

131
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,840
at least to some degree,
more sweetness and light.

132
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,460
And Norman took me to task about that,
saying that that was a,

133
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,280
an overly christianized interpretation,
which would make sense because I derived

134
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:21,281
it in part from northrop Frye.
And I really have come to understand 

135
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:25,151
that more that,
that he's right because that he's right 

136
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:27,791
about that because the god in the Old 
Testament is actually far more merciful 

137
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,050
than he's generally made out to be.
And you really see this with a.

138
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:35,051
it's good news for fundamentally,
if you regard the representation of God 

139
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:38,090
as somehow key to the description of 
being itself.

140
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,310
I mean,
Abraham makes a lot of mistakes,

141
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,870
you know,
serious mistakes.

142
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,850
And,
and yet he has a life and he's,

143
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,880
and he's blessed by God despite the fact
that he's pretty deeply flawed and 

144
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,460
engages in deceptive practice.
I mean,

145
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:54,461
he's a good man,
but he's not a perfect man by any 

146
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:54,830
stretch of the imagination and,
and things work out really well for him.

147
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,840
And he's the founder of a nation and all
of that.

148
00:07:56,841 --> 00:08:00,080
And that's good news for everyone 
because perfect people are very,

149
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,520
very hard to find.
And if the,

150
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,720
the,
the,

151
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,930
the only pathway to having a rich and 
meaningful life was through perfection,

152
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:13,541
then we would all be in deep trouble.
And so that's very satisfying to read 

153
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,350
that.
And the other,

154
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,330
the other thing that I've been struck by
is that,

155
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,620
you know,
Abraham,

156
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,850
and I think this is actually absolutely 
key to the interpretation of the story.

157
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,330
Abraham goes out and does things.
That's the thing.

158
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:31,331
And so one of the things that I've 
noticed in my life is that nothing I've 

159
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,560
ever done was wasted.
And by done,

160
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:36,050
I mean put my heart and soul into it,
you know,

161
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:38,960
like,
like attempted with,

162
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,960
with all of my effort that always 
worked.

163
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,360
Now it didn't always work the way I 
expected it to work.

164
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,360
That's a whole different issue.
But the payoff from it was always 

165
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
positive.
I always something always something of 

166
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,121
value always accrued to me when I made 
the sacrifices necessary to do 

167
00:08:56,121 --> 00:09:00,200
worthwhile.
And so I think part of the message in 

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,561
this story of a,
the abrahamic stories is go do 

169
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:03,561
something.
And,

170
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:04,240
and I've,
I've,

171
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,320
I've thought about this in a variety of 
ways outside of the interpretation of 

172
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,730
this story because I have this program 
some of you might be familiar with which

173
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:16,731
is called future authoring program and 
it's designed to help people make a plan

174
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,410
for three to five years into the future.
You know?

175
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:23,190
And so what you do is you,
you answer some questions,

176
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,730
it's a writing program.
You answered some questions about how 

177
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,600
you would like your life to be,
what you would like your character to be

178
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,020
three to five years down the road if you
were taking care of yourself.

179
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,630
Like you are taking care of someone that
you actually cared about.

180
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,870
So you kind of have to split yourself 
into two people and treat yourself like 

181
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,680
you,
like someone you have respect for and 

182
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,571
that you want the best.
For now it's not easy because people 

183
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:50,061
don't necessarily have respect for 
themselves and they don't necessarily 

184
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:51,630
want what's the best for themselves 
because they have a lot of self contempt

185
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:55,050
and a lot of self hatred and a lot of 
guilt and a lot of existential angst.

186
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:58,560
And and a lot of self consciousness and 
all of that,

187
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:02,640
and so people don't necessarily take 
care of themselves very well and I think

188
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,600
it's.
I think it's.

189
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,720
I think you have an obligation.
It's one of the highest moral 

190
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,691
obligations to treat yourself as if 
you're a creature of value and that is 

191
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:16,731
in some sense it's in some sense that's 
independent of your actions and you 

192
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:20,720
might think about that metaphorically as
a recognition of your divine worth in 

193
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
the biblical sense,
regardless of your,

194
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,360
of your sins,
so to speak.

195
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,840
And I think that's,
that's,

196
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,080
that's powerful language as far as I'm 
concerned.

197
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:33,081
Once you understand it anyways with the 
self authoring program in the future 

198
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:33,180
authoring program,
you,

199
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,010
you ask you answer questions about what,
what,

200
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,260
how you would like your friendships to 
be conducted because it's useful to 

201
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,591
surround yourself with people who are 
trying to move forward and more 

202
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:48,501
importantly,
who are happy when you move forward and 

203
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,440
not happy when you move back backwards.
Not when you fall.

204
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:54,441
That isn't what I mean,
but when you're doing self destructive 

205
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:54,441
things,
your friends shouldn't be there to cheer

206
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:56,340
you on and because then they're really 
not acting like friends.

207
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,330
Obviously,
you know,

208
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,080
I know it's obvious,
but it still happens all the time and 

209
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,080
people allow it to happen.
It's not a good idea.

210
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,390
And now how would you like to sort your 
family out,

211
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,630
and I was thinking about this this week 
too because I was thinking about Noah's 

212
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,170
Ark and there was a phrase in that story
that I didn't understand,

213
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,720
which was that noah was perfect in his 
generations.

214
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,030
I thought,
I don't know what that means and you 

215
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,551
know when you're,
when you're going through a book like 

216
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,891
the Bible,
if you don't understand a phrase that 

217
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:25,080
actually means you've missed something,
it doesn't mean that that's just not.

218
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,820
You know,
that's not Germane to the story.

219
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,920
It means you're stupid.
You didn't get it,

220
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,180
man.
You didn't get it.

221
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:35,181
You didn't understand it.
And so the idea that Noah was perfect in

222
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:40,611
his generations and that's why he could 
build an arc that would sustain him and 

223
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:43,350
him and and humanity itself through the 
flood.

224
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,990
It meant that he not only did he walk 
with God,

225
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:50,991
which is something that we talked about 
in the context of the sermon on the 

226
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:51,210
mount,
but the established proper relationships

227
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,250
with his family,
with his children.

228
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,500
And so what that meant was that his,
not only was he well integrated as a 

229
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,830
person,
but his level of integration had reached

230
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:02,890
the point where it's stretched out 
beyond him and encompassed his family.

231
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,010
And so it was noah and the family that 
was in the arc.

232
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:11,011
And I can tell you,
and I really understood this this year 

233
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,370
because I had a very tumultuous year or 
you could think about it from a personal

234
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:17,371
perspective.
I could think about it as a year that 

235
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:17,371
had no shortage of floods.
And My.

236
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:20,080
And part of the reason that I was able 
to get through it.

237
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,220
I also had terrible health problems.
And one of the reasons I was able to get

238
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:27,670
through it was because my family really 
came together around me,

239
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:28,600
my kids,
my wife,

240
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:33,601
my parents and my friends as well,
and particularly a certain group of 

241
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:39,460
friends and that's partly all of that 
came together in my mind this week and I

242
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:39,700
thought,
oh,

243
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:44,701
that's what it means to be perfect in 
his generations meant that he hadn't 

244
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:48,691
just straightened himself out.
He'd also straightened out his 

245
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:52,270
relationships with his family and I can 
tell you that when crisis strikes you,

246
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,160
which it will,
it will.

247
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,510
The flood will come,
right?

248
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:57,460
That's why the apocalypse has always 
upon us.

249
00:12:57,461 --> 00:13:02,461
The flood will definitely come into your
life and to the degree that you've 

250
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:06,060
organized yourself psychologically and 
also healed the relationships between 

251
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,441
you and your family.
That could be the critical element that 

252
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:13,910
determines whether you live or die when 
a crisis comes or or whether it's 

253
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,070
someone in your family lives or dies.
And so the idea of the arc containing 

254
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,241
the man who's who walks with God and 
whose generations are perfect and that 

255
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:22,900
that's what sustains humanity through 
the crisis.

256
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:26,230
It's like you couldn't be more 
psychologically accurate than that.

257
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,730
You know,
the other thing I was thinking about 

258
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:31,840
this week I,
I was thinking about another line in the

259
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,960
new testament.
I think it's from the sermon on the 

260
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:36,960
mount,
but I'm not absolutely sure.

261
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,520
Christ compares the Kingdom of Heaven to
a mustard seed and so I was thinking 

262
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:47,011
about a mustard seed is a very tiny seed
and it grows into quite a spectacular 

263
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:50,731
complex plant and I was thinking about 
how you should operate in the world in 

264
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:56,371
order to make it a better place,
assuming that that's what you should be 

265
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:59,491
doing and that is what you should be 
doing and there there's lots in the 

266
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:03,601
world to fix everything that bothers you
about the world and about yourself 

267
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,230
should be fixed and you can do that.

268
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,250
And my dawning realization,
I have a friend,

269
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,040
he lives in Montreal.
His name is James.

270
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,310
Simon is a great painter and he's taught
me a lot of things,

271
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:20,311
helped.
He's helped me design my house and 

272
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:22,111
beautify it and I bought some paintings 
from him a couple of years ago and he 

273
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:27,811
did this series of paintings where he 
went around North America and stood in 

274
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:31,951
different places and then he painted the
view from here down and so it's his feet

275
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:35,860
planted in different places on roads in 
the desert,

276
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:40,861
on the ocean.
I have one actually hanging over my 

277
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:40,861
toilet,
which is him standing at a urinal.

278
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:42,640
I'm now.
Well,

279
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:47,641
you know,
he was trying to make a point and the 

280
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,291
point was that wherever you are,
it's worth paying attention and that's 

281
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,680
because you know,
so all these places that he visited,

282
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,340
he looked exactly

283
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,340
where he was standing by the side of the
road in the desert side of mundane in 

284
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,210
some sense.
But then maybe he put 40 hours into that

285
00:14:59,211 --> 00:14:59,810
painting.
You know,

286
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,390
when it's very,
very realistic painting with really good

287
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:07,391
light.
And what he's telling you as a painter 

288
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:08,810
is everything is worth paying attention 
to an infinite amount,

289
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:11,840
but you don't have enough time.
And so the artists does that for you.

290
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,790
Right?
The artist looks and locks and locks and

291
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:18,791
locks and locks and then gives you that 
vision and so then you can look at the 

292
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,241
painting and it reminds you that right 
where you are is there's every 

293
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:26,771
everything that there is is right where 
you are and that's a hard thing to 

294
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:26,771
realize,
but it's actually true.

295
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,110
And so I've been telling people online 
in various ways and the lectures that 

296
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,480
they should start fixing up the world by
cleaning up the room.

297
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,480
And I wanted to just elaborate on that a
little bit before I get back to the 

298
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,751
lecture itself.
So I'd say it's become this Internet 

299
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:45,020
weird Internet meme,
you know,

300
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,570
and,
and,

301
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,730
and,
and it's a joke and good.

302
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:54,731
It's a jewel.
I really happy about the fact that so 

303
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:57,581
much of this has got the leaving of 
humor and it's really important because 

304
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,880
that's what stops things from 
degenerating into,

305
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,390
into conflict humor.
And I was thinking about this idea of 

306
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,990
cleaning up your room in relationship to
the mustard seed idea.

307
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,570
And you see the thing about cleaning up 
your room.

308
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,780
This is also something I learned from 
Carl young and his studies on alchemy 

309
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,830
because for young,
when the alchemist was attempting to 

310
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,521
make the philosopher's stone,
he was not only engaged in the 

311
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:24,071
transformation of the material world,
but he was engaged in a process of self 

312
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:27,491
transformation that occurred at the same
time as the as the chemical trap,

313
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,800
as the chemical transformation,
so it was a psychological work in some 

314
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:32,800
sense.

315
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,430
Let's say you want to sort out your room
and beautified because the beauty is 

316
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,911
also important and let's say that all 
you have is just a little room like 

317
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:43,151
you're not rich.
You're poor and you don't have any 

318
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:43,151
power.
That's another thing,

319
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:45,320
but you've got your damn room and you've
got this space right in front of you.

320
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:50,321
You know that that's a part of the 
cosmos that you can come to grips with 

321
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:50,750
and you might think,
well,

322
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:52,880
what's there in front of you right in 
front of you?

323
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,950
And the answer to that is it depends on 
how open your eyes are.

324
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,690
That's the proper answer because you 
could say,

325
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,270
w William Blake said this,
for example,

326
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,520
eldest Huxley made comments that were 
very similar that in a transcendent 

327
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,031
state,
you can see infinity in the finite and 

328
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:10,031
you might say,
well,

329
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:13,301
you can say,
and you can see infinity in what you 

330
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:13,301
have within your grasp.

331
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:15,110
If you look and you could save,
maybe that's the case with your room,

332
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,350
and so you want to clean up your room.
Well,

333
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,910
okay,
how do you do that?

334
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,290
Exactly?
Well,

335
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,291
a room,
his room is a place to sleep and so if 

336
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,711
you set your room up properly,
then you figure out how to sleep and 

337
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:29,711
when you should sleep and how you should
sleep,

338
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:32,390
and then you figure out when you should 
wake up and then you figure out,

339
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,420
well,
what clothes you should wear because 

340
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:37,420
they have to be arranged properly in 
your dresser,

341
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,721
and then you have to have some place to 
put your clothes and you're going to 

342
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:40,721
have some clothes.
You have to figure out what you're going

343
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:41,960
to wear those clothes to do.
Right?

344
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,050
And then that means you have to figure 
out what you're going to do and then 

345
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,721
your room has to serve that purpose 
because otherwise it isn't set up 

346
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:52,380
properly and if it doesn't set up,
if it doesn't serve your purposes,

347
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,590
you will be unhappy and not happy in the
room because the way that we perceive 

348
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,710
the world is as a place to move from 
point a to point B in,

349
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,060
and then if the place that we're in 
facilitates that movement,

350
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:07,290
then we're happy to be there.

351
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,370
And if the place that we're in serves as
an obstacle to that movement,

352
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:15,210
then we're unhappy to be there.
And so what it means to set up your room

353
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:18,240
is that you have to have somewhere to go
that's worthwhile.

354
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:23,241
Or you can set up your room and your 
room has to be set up to facilitate 

355
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:23,700
that.
And then the next thing is,

356
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,500
well maybe you have to make it 
beautiful,

357
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,790
but that's not easy,
right?

358
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:31,791
That means you have to have some taste 
and that doesn't mean you have to have 

359
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,881
money.
It doesn't because you can be garish 

360
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:35,640
with money and you can be tasteful with 
nothing.

361
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,660
All you need is taste and taste,
beats money when it comes to beautifying

362
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,480
things,
that money is trivial because it's not.

363
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:47,481
The taste is crucial and people who are 
very artistically oriented can make 

364
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:49,860
beautiful things out of virtually 
nothing and not only that,

365
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:53,010
the literature suggests that if you're 
going to make beautiful things,

366
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,490
putting real constraints on,
on what you allow yourself to do,

367
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,490
facilitates creativity instead of 
interfering with it.

368
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,490
Because let's say you have to make 
something out of nothing,

369
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,100
right?
Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,

370
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:10,101
right?
You have to make something out of 

371
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:11,961
nothing.
You have to be creative in order to do 

372
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:14,301
that,
and so then to beautify your room means 

373
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:18,201
that you also have to develop your 
capacity to be creative and so then you 

374
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:21,621
can make your room shine,
but then what will happen is that if 

375
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,150
your family isn't together,
they will interfere with that.

376
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:29,290
You will interfere with that because you
won't have the discipline to do it 

377
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:29,670
properly,
but then when you start building this,

378
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,270
this,
this little microcosm of perfection with

379
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:38,271
what you have at hand and it'll evoke 
all the pathologies of everyone in your 

380
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:39,390
household.
The wonder what the hell you're up to in

381
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,720
there and they won't necessarily be 
happy because if you're.

382
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,940
If they're in a lowly place,
let's say,

383
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:49,140
and so are you and you're trying to move
out of that than the higher you move out

384
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:54,141
of that,
the more the place they're in looks bad 

385
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:54,141
and you might say,
well,

386
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,280
what they should do is celebrate your 
victory over chaos and evil,

387
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,510
but that isn't what will happen.

388
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,720
What will happen instead is that they 
will attempt to pull you back down.

389
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,050
They'll attempt to,
and obviously all families don't do 

390
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,050
that,
but,

391
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,160
but all families do that to some degree 
and some families do almost nothing but 

392
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:12,480
that.
And so what that means is that if you're

393
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:17,481
going to organize your room,
then you're going to have to confront 

394
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:18,570
the devils in your house.
And that's often.

395
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,800
That's often a terrifying thing because 
some of those devils have have lineages 

396
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,450
that go back many,
many,

397
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:29,451
many generations and God only knows what
you have to struggle with in order to 

398
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:33,351
overcome that and so and so to sort 
yourself out into fix up your room is a 

399
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,970
nontrivial matter.
You know,

400
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:41,180
and you can do that.
You'll learn by doing that and then 

401
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,931
maybe you'll learn enough by doing that 
so that you can fix up your family a 

402
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:47,991
little bit and then having done that,
you'll have enough character so that 

403
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:51,740
when you to operate in the world at your
job or maybe in the broader social 

404
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,921
spheres,
that you will be a force for good 

405
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,010
instead of harm because you'll have 
learned some humility by noting just how

406
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:02,011
difficult it was to put your damn room 
together well and yourself for that 

407
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:02,011
matter.

408
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:06,420
And so you'll proceed cautiously with 
your eyes open towards the good and so 

409
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,700
well.
Those are some of the things I've been 

410
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:12,700
thinking about this week and they're 
Germane,

411
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,890
Germane to what we're going to discuss 
tonight.

412
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:19,891
Because what happens at the beginning of
the abrahamic stories is basically God 

413
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:23,860
comes to Abraham and just says,
go get going,

414
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:24,970
man,
do something,

415
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,380
do something,
get going.

416
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,730
And you might think,
well,

417
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:29,950
where should I go?
And God,

418
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,980
God is somewhat vague about that in 
where he sends Abraham.

419
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:36,240
It's a real fixer upper man.
It's like there's starvation narrow,

420
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:39,730
and there's tyranny and there's,
and there's marital dissolution.

421
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,180
And there's deceit.
Like it's just like where you live,

422
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:44,920
you know,
it's exactly the same thing.

423
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,610
It's,
it's,

424
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,680
it's tyranny and catastrophe.
So that's great.

425
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,800
The tyrannical great father because 
because Abraham ends up having to 

426
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,010
sojourn in Egypt and,
and uh,

427
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,880
there's a feminine.

428
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,890
So Mother Nature is on the rampage and 
Abraham lies about,

429
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:00,970
his wife has,
we'll see.

430
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:03,250
And so it's the world.
It's the world.

431
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:06,160
It's tyranny and,
and vulnerability and deceit.

432
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,760
And yet God says goal.
Because if you do go,

433
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,060
then you'll become a father of nations.
And you think,

434
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,110
well,
again,

435
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:19,111
that's pretty good news,
although it's strange because you'd 

436
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:21,511
expect that if God chose Abraham,
then he'd send them immediately to the 

437
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:22,420
land of honey land of milk.
And honey,

438
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:27,421
and that isn't what happens at all.
It doesn't happen at all and Abraham 

439
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:31,021
never gets there,
but his mission is still regarded as 

440
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:34,000
divine and thank God for that because 
that's what your mission will be because

441
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:35,410
that's what you will encounter in your 
life.

442
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,620
Those are the arc archetipal things.
Everyone encounters the tyranny of the 

443
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,131
social structure and the and the 
rapaciousness of nature and the 

444
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:48,091
deceitful,
the deceitful quality of the human 

445
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:48,091
psyche.

446
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:48,190
It's like that's the world.
Now.

447
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,040
It's a negative.
That's a negative view in some sense,

448
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:56,041
but it's positive in the story because 
what it basically says is something 

449
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,110
that's akin to the sermon on the mount,
which is that if you're aligned with God

450
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,590
and you pay attention to the divine 
injunction,

451
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,950
then you can operate in the midst of 
chaos and tyranny and deception and 

452
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,481
flourish,
and you could hardly hope to have a 

453
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:13,540
better piece of news than that.
Given that that's exactly where you are.

454
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,860
So and I didn't see any of that neighbor
having stories to begin with,

455
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:21,310
so that's been very interesting to have 
that sort of reveal itself.

456
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,340
Abraham section nus develops the 
personality and character of man to 

457
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,230
integrate new degree in biblical 
narrative.

458
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,640
Well picturing him in a new degree of 
responsibility in him,

459
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:40,650
a new degree of responsibility.
So here's the other thing that's really 

460
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,381
struck me and I think this is absolutely
crucial importance and I don't know how 

461
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,100
much importance but it's certainly 
important to me.

462
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,040
One of the things that has just blown me
away in the last year because I've 

463
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,430
talked to lots of people,
lots of people live,

464
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,460
you know,
but also lots of people online but it's 

465
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,400
more obvious live and it's obvious in 
this theater as well as I've.

466
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,660
I've gone around and spoken and a large 
proportion of my audience has been young

467
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,490
man young,
you know,

468
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,580
under 30,
something like that.

469
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,720
And I've spoken to them a lot about 
responsibility.

470
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,230
And what's so odd about,
about this is that of all the things 

471
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,370
that I've spoken about,
because I can see the audience and I can

472
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:24,371
feel how the audience is reacting 
because I'm always paying attention to 

473
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:24,590
all of you.
It's in so far as I can manage that.

474
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:25,310
So I,
I,

475
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,510
I get some sense of how,
what I'm saying is landing,

476
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:34,511
you know,
which you have to do if you're going to 

477
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:36,191
speak effectively to people and what,
what happens is if I talk about 

478
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:40,151
responsibilities,
everyone b is silent just like they are 

479
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:42,020
now silent and not moving,
right?

480
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,820
Focusing attentive,
say pick up your responsibility,

481
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:51,821
pick up the heaviest thing you can and 
carry it and the room goes quiet and 

482
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:55,751
everybody's eyes open.
And I think that always makes somebody 

483
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:55,751
break up.

484
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,260
I was,

485
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,380
I don't know why I was speaking to an 
English journalist today who's going to 

486
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,380
write an article in spectator magazine.
I was talking about this and at the same

487
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,950
point in the discussion the same,
I had the same emotional reaction.

488
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,000
I don't really understand it.
It's,

489
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,080
I think it's something.
There's something about it that's so 

490
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,721
crucial because you know,
we've been fed this unending diet of 

491
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:30,800
rights and freedoms and there's 
something about that especially.

492
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:36,310
There's something about that that so 
pathologically wrong and people are 

493
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,731
starving for the antidote.
And the antidote is truth and 

494
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:39,860
responsibility,
right?

495
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:41,240
And it isn't,
it isn't.

496
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:43,370
Because that's what you should do in 
some,

497
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,050
you know,
in some,

498
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,940
some I know better or someone knows 
better for you,

499
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,740
what you should do sense.
It's that.

500
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,930
It's that.
It's that.

501
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,270
It's that that's the secret to a 
meaningful life and without a meaningful

502
00:25:56,271 --> 00:26:01,271
life,
then all you have is suffering and 

503
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:03,610
nihilism and despair and all of that and
self contempt and and that's not good 

504
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:08,311
and so the man hits necessary for men to
stand up and take responsibility and 

505
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,560
they all know that and and are starving 
for that message and the message is more

506
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,360
that that's also a good thing to stand 
up and take responsibility because 

507
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,360
you're cursed so much.

508
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,500
Now from,
from,

509
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,530
from,
from when you're young with this notion 

510
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,931
that your active engagement with the 
world is part of what is destroying and 

511
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:31,880
undermining the planet and adding to the
tyranny of the social systems.

512
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,830
It's like,
how about not so much that,

513
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,310
hey,
because it's,

514
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,460
it's,
it's to soul deadening.

515
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:41,530
It's andy human right to the core and my
sense instead is that you know,

516
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,370
if you,
if you were able to reveal

517
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,590
the best of yourself to you in the 
world,

518
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:51,591
that you would be an overwhelming force 
for good and that whatever errors might 

519
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:54,870
be made along the way would wash out in 
the works,

520
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:58,320
and that's the other thing that you see 
in the abrahamic stories because Abraham

521
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:01,530
is not a perfect person by any stretch 
of the imagination.

522
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:03,930
He's a real person and he makes 
mistakes,

523
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:06,510
but it doesn't matter.
The overarching narrative is,

524
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,870
you know,
maintain your covenant with God,

525
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,550
and despite your inadequacies,
then not only will you prevail,

526
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,280
but your descendants will prevail.
It's great.

527
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:18,840
That's really good news.
You know,

528
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,420
so it's been really something to see 
that in the,

529
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,470
in the stories.
It's not that.

530
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,130
So that's responsibility.
It's not just that Abraham is kinder,

531
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:34,131
gentler,
more intrepid ethical or a better 

532
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:34,131
debater than his ancestor noah.
Rather.

533
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,660
Both the Noah and Abraham,
stories or pieces of a development of an

534
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:41,661
increasingly stronger stance of humans 
relative to the daddy before the story 

535
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,320
is over,
humans will become a good deal,

536
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:48,321
stronger and bolder than Abraham,
and that's really something to say 

537
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:48,321
because Abraham is pretty bold.

538
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,640
So we'll.
Let's read the stories.

539
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,880
The first one is about Abraham,
Sarah,

540
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,820
and lot.
Now these are the generations of Tara.

541
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,470
Tara begat a Ram,
so his name is Abraham to begin with,

542
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,160
and that actually turns out to be 
important.

543
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:03,840
It's not Abraham knee,
Horton,

544
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,520
inherent,
inherent begat lot.

545
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:11,180
So heroin is Abrams.
Brother and heroin died before his 

546
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,601
father,
terah in the land of his Nativity in Er 

547
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:15,780
of the chaldees and Abraham and nay 
whore took them wives.

548
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,760
The name of Abram's wife was Sarah and 
the name of [inaudible] wife Milka,

549
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,820
the daughter of heroin,
the father of Milkah and the father of 

550
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,160
Isca,
but Sarah was barren.

551
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:31,190
She had no child and Terah took Abraham,
his son and lot the son of heroin,

552
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,920
his son's son and daughter in law,
his son,

553
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:39,921
Abram's wife,
and they went forth with them from the 

554
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:41,931
earth cellies from Irv,
the Chaldees to go into the land of 

555
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:41,931
Canaan.

556
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:45,560
That's exile and they came into heroin 
and dwelt there and the days of Terah 

557
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,100
were 205 years and Terah died inherent 
and there's a reason that Sarah is,

558
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,070
is introduced as barren and to set the 
stage.

559
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,780
I think it was Anton Chekov who when he 
was talking about this stage setting for

560
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:00,030
a play,
that if there was a rifle hanging on the

561
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,340
wall,
then it had better been used before.

562
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:05,010
I believe the second act or it shouldn't
be hanging there at all.

563
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,310
Right?
And so this is stage setting and part of

564
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:12,600
the reason that the biblical writers are
pointing out that Abram's wife is barren

565
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:15,000
is because it's a real catastrophe for 
Abraham,

566
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,090
for Sarah as well,
that she's barren.

567
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,120
And so it's showing the trouble that 
Abraham was in at the beginning of the 

568
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,970
story.
And it's also.

569
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,420
It's also see what happens as the story 
progresses is that Abraham,

570
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,310
Abraham and Sarah are eventually granted
his son,

571
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,110
but it's way late in the story and 
they're very,

572
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:39,111
very old by the time it happens and of 
course you're not going to be a father 

573
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,740
of nations without having a child,
and so the the,

574
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:42,220
the writers

575
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,220
who are attempting to make the case that
if you forthrightly pursue that which 

576
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,960
God directs you to pursue,
let's say that all things are possible.

577
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:58,030
That's the idea and the narrative and 
you might say that's naive and you know 

578
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,810
it.
It's not it.

579
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,620
You think when you're naive,
right,

580
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,220
and then you dispense with that idea and
then when you stop being the sort of 

581
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,721
person who dispenses with ideas,
then you come to another place and 

582
00:30:12,721 --> 00:30:16,411
that's the place where you think you 
have no idea what might be possible for 

583
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:16,450
you.
If you,

584
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,240
if you've got things together and 
pursued what you should pursue,

585
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,770
you don't know how much what's 
impossible to you right now would become

586
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:28,771
possible under those conditions.
It's an unknown phenomena and like I've 

587
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:33,961
watched people who've put themselves 
together across time incrementally and 

588
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:36,790
continually and they become capable of 
things that are jaw,

589
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,710
not only jaw,
droppingly amazing,

590
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,690
but also sometimes metaphysically 
impossible to understand and so we don't

591
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,880
know the limits of human endeavor.

592
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,910
We truly don't,
and it it's premature to put a cap on 

593
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,330
what it is that we are,
what,

594
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,960
what it is that we're capable of.
And so you,

595
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:59,961
you know,
you're already something and maybe 

596
00:30:59,961 --> 00:30:59,961
you're not so bad in your current 
configuration,

597
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:04,080
but you may wonder if you did nothing 
for the next 30 years except put 

598
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,221
yourself together just exactly what 
would you be able to do and you might 

599
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:08,221
think,
well,

600
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:09,850
that's worth finding out.
But of course that's,

601
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,510
that's the adoption of responsibility.
And one thing I've also learned over the

602
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:18,510
years because I've been curious about 
this battle between meaning and 

603
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:18,510
nihilism.
You know,

604
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,071
and I mean I could see for a long while 
the rationale in nihilism and the power 

605
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:26,020
of the nihilistic argument,
but it,

606
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:26,780
it,
it,

607
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,780
it occurred to me across time that 
despite that the power of the nihilistic

608
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:34,300
argument is more powerful than naive 
optimism,

609
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,480
but it's not more powerful than the 
optimism that is not naive because the 

610
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:45,811
optimism that is not naive says it's 
self evident that the world is a place 

611
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:50,161
of suffering and that there are things 
to be done about that and it's self 

612
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:52,900
evident that people are flawed and that 
there's things to be done about that.

613
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,900
And then the non naive optimist says the
suffering could be reduced and the 

614
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:04,831
insufficient c could be overcome if 
people oriented themselves properly and 

615
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:09,841
did what they were capable of doing.
And I do not believe that that's 

616
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:10,050
deniable.
I do.

617
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:15,090
I do.
I think that human potential is 

618
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:15,190
virtually limitless and that there's 
nothing,

619
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:19,240
perhaps it's beyond our grasp before 
careful as individuals and as a society.

620
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,480
And so I think that there's no reason 
for nihilism and there's no reason for 

621
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,890
hopelessness and,
and there's no reason to bow down before

622
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:29,920
evil because we're capable of so much 
more.

623
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,340
And I think that you can easily,
you know that first because you're not 

624
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,940
happy with who you are and you're 
ashamed and embarrassed about it as you 

625
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,181
should be.
And you know it because if look out 

626
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:44,531
there,
you see people who are capable of doing 

627
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:46,481
great things and you know that we're not
giving it our all and still we're not 

628
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:46,920
doing so badly,
you know?

629
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,300
And so you might wonder if,
if,

630
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:54,510
if we devoted 90 percent of our effort 
to putting things right instead of 55 

631
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,900
percent of our effort,
or maybe even less than that,

632
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,080
you might wonder just how well could 
things be put together.

633
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,530
And I think that you can figure that out
by starting with your room,

634
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,250
by the way.

635
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,890
And the Lord said unto Abraham,
and this is the,

636
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,810
this is the opening of the story.
Get thee out of thy country and from thy

637
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:19,250
kindred and from thy Father's House unto
a land that I will show the.

638
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:24,020
And this is one of those phrases where 
every clause is significant.

639
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,760
Go somewhere you don't understand.
That's the first thing.

640
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,540
Get thee out of thy country.
You know,

641
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,610
back in the 19 twenties there was a 
whole slew of American writers who ended

642
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:37,970
up as expatriates in Paris,
hemingway among them,

643
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:42,710
and who wrote the Great Gatsby,
Fitzgerald,

644
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:44,120
yes.
And then a variety of others.

645
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:49,121
It was very inexpensive in Paris at the 
time and part of their transformation 

646
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:53,741
into great literary figures was the fact
that they were out of their country and 

647
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,951
now they could see what their country 
was because you can't see what your 

648
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:56,951
country is until you leave it.

649
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,780
So you have to go into the unknown and 
that's God's first command.

650
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,940
Go into the unknown because you already 
know what you know and so and that's not

651
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:09,941
enough unless you think you're enough.
And if you're not enough and you don't 

652
00:34:09,941 --> 00:34:13,421
think you're enough,
then you have to go where you haven't 

653
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:15,341
been.
And so that's the first commandment to 

654
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:15,341
Abraham.
It's like,

655
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:15,500
okay,
that's a good one.

656
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,140
That makes perfect sense.
Go to where you don't know.

657
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,660
Yes.
And from my kindred will that.

658
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,760
What does that mean?
It means grow up,

659
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,800
right?
That's what it means.

660
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:29,801
It means get away from your family 
enough so that you can establish your 

661
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:30,530
independence.
And that isn't because there's something

662
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:32,600
wrong with your family.
Although perhaps there is,

663
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:37,601
you know,
as long as there is perhaps wrong with 

664
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:37,601
you,
but it means get away.

665
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,280
You know,
I talked to people very frequently whose

666
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:45,281
families have provided them with too 
much protection and they know it 

667
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:47,270
themselves and that means they're 
deprived of necessity.

668
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,460
You know,
one of the things that you see in,

669
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:54,461
in the United States for example,
is that the children are first 

670
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:56,060
generation immigrants often do better 
than the,

671
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,650
than the,
than their children.

672
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,980
And the reason for that is that the 
children are first generation 

673
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,110
immigrants,
have necessity driving them.

674
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:08,470
And you don't know how much you need 
necessity to drive you because maybe 

675
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,700
you're not very disciplined.
And if a catastrophe doesn't immediately

676
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:11,480
be fall,
you,

677
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:16,481
if you don't act forthrightly today,
then maybe you'll never act 

678
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:16,481
forthrightly,
right?

679
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:20,060
Because the gap between your foolishness
and the punishment is,

680
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:25,250
is lengthened by your unearned wealth.
And so you never grow up and learn and 

681
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,621
you have to get yourself away from your 
dependency in order to allow necessity 

682
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:35,201
to drive you forward.
And that's to become independent and to 

683
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:38,981
become mature.
And I think part of what's happening in 

684
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:39,600
our culture is that the,
the,

685
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:44,630
the force that's attacking the 
forthright movement forward of young men

686
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:50,871
in particular is afraid of the power of 
man because it's confused about the 

687
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:54,420
distinction between power and authority 
and competence.

688
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Like I know a man who's who has 
authority and competence has power as a 

689
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:02,840
byproduct,
but the authority and competence,

690
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,620
everything and,
and,

691
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,630
and people who can't understand that 
fail to make the distinction between 

692
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,900
power and authority of competence and 
they're afraid of power.

693
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,270
And so they destroy authority and 
competence.

694
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,240
And that's a terrible thing because we 
need authority and competence.

695
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:23,241
What else is going to.
What else is going to allow us to 

696
00:36:23,241 --> 00:36:23,241
prevail?
In the long run,

697
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,430
and so you get away from your country 
and you get away from your kin and from 

698
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:28,830
your father's house,
right?

699
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,740
And you go out there and you establish 
yourself in the world.

700
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:36,741
It's a call to adventure.
That's what this the first lines in the 

701
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:40,641
Abrahamic story is a call to adventure.
So great unto a land that I will show 

702
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:43,320
you.
Well,

703
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:44,280
you know,
what does that mean?

704
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,790
You know?
One of the things that I've been struck 

705
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,810
very hard by a number of writers,
Carl Young,

706
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,070
obviously among them,
I mean he,

707
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,540
he wrote things like Nisha,
that if you understand them,

708
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:05,541
they just break you into pieces and one 
of the things that young understood in 

709
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:10,461
the psychoanalysts understand it's one 
of the most terrifying elements of 

710
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,300
psychoanalytic thinking is very tightly 
allied with religious thinking,

711
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:15,210
which is that you are not the master of 
your own house.

712
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,210
There are spirits that dwelling within 
you,

713
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,480
meaning you have a will and you can 
exercise a certain amount of conscious 

714
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:29,511
control over your being,
but there are all sorts of things that 

715
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:31,320
occur within you that seem to be beyond 
your capacity to control your dreams.

716
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:33,190
For example,
that's a really good example.

717
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:34,590
Are Your impulses.
For example,

718
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:39,591
you might,
you might think of those as so foreign 

719
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:39,591
from you that they're not even.

720
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:39,591
You don't even want them to be part of 
you,

721
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,310
but,
but more subtly even.

722
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,220
How about what you're interested in?
What compels you?

723
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,900
Like,
where does that come from?

724
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,720
Exactly.
Because you can't.

725
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:53,721
God,
you can't conjure it up of your own 

726
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:53,721
accord.
You know?

727
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:54,840
So if you're a student in,
you're taking difficult course,

728
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,430
you might say to yourself,
well,

729
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:58,650
I need to sit down and study for three 
hours,

730
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,810
but then you sit down and that is what 
happens.

731
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,240
Your attention goes everywhere and you 
might say,

732
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:05,370
well,
whose attention is it?

733
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:10,371
Then?
If it goes everywhere because you say 

734
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:10,371
it's your attention,
it's like,

735
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:10,380
well,
if it's your attention,

736
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:12,660
maybe you will be able to control it,
but you can't.

737
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,080
And so then you might think,
well jen and just exactly what the hell 

738
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,080
is controlling it.
And you might say,

739
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,660
well,
it's random.

740
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:19,030
It's,
well,

741
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,340
I better not be random.

742
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:25,580
I can tell you that that's.
That happens to some degree in 

743
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,311
schizophrenia.
There's an element of randomness in 

744
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:28,311
that.
It's not random.

745
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:32,870
It's driven by the action of phenomena 
that I think are best considered as 

746
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:37,090
something like subpersonalities or 
they'll even only a partial description.

747
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,110
You can't make yourself interested in 
something.

748
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,670
Interest manifests itself in grips you.
That's a whole different thing.

749
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,660
And so what is it that's gripping you 
and how do you conceptualize that?

750
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:54,350
Is that a divine power?
Well,

751
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:59,351
it's divine as far as your concern 
because it grips you and you can't do 

752
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:02,761
anything about it.
And so there's a calling in you towards 

753
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:03,670
what you're compelled by and what you're
interested in.

754
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:06,910
And sometimes that might be very dark 
and sometimes not,

755
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,880
but you're compelled forward by your 
interest.

756
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,540
And so and so the idea that what moves 
you away from your country and your 

757
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:19,180
father's house and the comforts of your 
childhood home is,

758
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,980
is something that's beyond you.

759
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,400
And that you listened to in Harken to.
That's exactly right.

760
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,390
And you can say,
well,

761
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:30,391
I don't want to call it that God.
It's like it doesn't matter what you 

762
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:30,391
call it.
Exactly.

763
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,480
It doesn't matter to what it is,
what it's called.

764
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,110
It still is,
and if you don't listen to it,

765
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:40,180
that's the other thing.
If you don't listen to it,

766
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:43,870
and I've been a clinician and talked to 
enough people now as old as I am,

767
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,370
to know this.
Absolutely.

768
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,190
If you do not listen to that thing that 
beckons you forward,

769
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,160
you will pay for it like you cannot 
possibly imagine.

770
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,880
You'll have everything that's terrible 
about life in your life and nothing 

771
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,901
about it that's good and worse.
You'll know that it was your fault and 

772
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,500
that you squandered what you could have 
had.

773
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:08,790
So this is not only a calling forth,
but a warning unto a land that I will 

774
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:13,080
show the and that's it,
that I will show the that.

775
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,700
And you don't want to be too concrete 
about this.

776
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:20,701
You know,
there's all sorts of new territories 

777
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:20,701
that you can inhabit.
If you.

778
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:25,500
There's this abstract and conceptual 
territory of Gilda University and you 

779
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,710
study biology or you studied physics or 
or any discipline.

780
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,360
You're in a territory,
right?

781
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,910
You're in the territory that all of the 
scholars have established,

782
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:35,911
and then as you master the discipline,
you move out beyond the established 

783
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:35,911
territory,
into the unknown,

784
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,750
and that's a new land,
right?

785
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,780
Maybe it's even a land of your enemies 
for that matter,

786
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,750
but it's a new land to the frontier is 
always in front of you.

787
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,530
And so you know when the earth was less 
inhabited than it is now.

788
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:52,710
The frontier was the psychological 
frontier and the geographical frontier 

789
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,520
was the same thing and now they've 
separated to some degree because there's

790
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:58,420
not so much geographical frontier,
but there's the frontier is a place that

791
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:03,421
never disappears and the land that's 
beyond the land that you know is always 

792
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:03,421
there.

793
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:08,250
And it's always where you should go.
And all of that packed into these four 

794
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,360
phrases so well.
So when I've been thinking about 

795
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:16,030
narrative,
you look at the world through a story,

796
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:17,170
you can't,
you can't help it.

797
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:21,580
And this story is what gives value to 
the world or or the stories,

798
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,620
what you extract from the value of the 
world.

799
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:28,621
You can look at it either way,
you're somewhere and it's not good 

800
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:28,621
enough,
right?

801
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:30,340
That's the eternal human predicament.
Wherever you are,

802
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:35,341
isn't good enough.
And to some degree that's actually a 

803
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:35,341
good thing because if it was good 
enough,

804
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:38,360
well there's nothing for you to do.
So it's actually maybe a good thing that

805
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:43,361
it's insufficient.
And that might be why sometimes having 

806
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:46,691
less iss is better than having more.
I don't want to be a pollyanna about 

807
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:47,270
that.
I mean,

808
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:52,271
I know that there's deprivation that can
reach to the point where it's no where 

809
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:56,351
it's completely counterproductive,
but it isn't always the case that 

810
00:41:56,351 --> 00:41:58,290
starting with little is you.

811
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,980
If you start with little,
you start with more possibility.

812
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:05,981
It's something like that.
So you move from always from what's 

813
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,040
unbearable about the present to some 
better future.

814
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,780
Right?
And if you don't have that,

815
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:13,781
then you have no,
you have nothing but threatened and 

816
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,330
negative emotion.
You have no positive emotion because the

817
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:18,830
positive emotion is generated in the 
conception of the better future and then

818
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:22,460
the evidence that you generate yourself,
that you're moving towards it.

819
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,310
That's where the positive and fulfilling
meaning of life comes.

820
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:27,320
So you want to set up this structure 
properly.

821
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,500
It's very,
very important and so what it means is 

822
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,511
that you want to be going somewhere 
that's good enough so that the going is 

823
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:37,670
worth the while and you can ask yourself
that,

824
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:40,700
and that's partly what we tried to build
into the future authoring program,

825
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:41,690
which is,
well,

826
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,490
we know what's wrong with life.

827
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,060
It's rife with suffering and 
insufficiency in deception and evil.

828
00:42:47,061 --> 00:42:49,010
It's all of that obviously.
Okay,

829
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,020
what would make the journey worthwhile?
Or you can ask yourself that.

830
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,960
It's like,
alright,

831
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,100
in order to bear up hundred this load,
what is it that I would need to be 

832
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,700
striving to attain?
And if you ask yourself that,

833
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:05,360
that's to knock and the door will open.
That's what that means.

834
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:10,361
If you ask yourself that,
then you will find an answer and you'll 

835
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:10,361
think you'll shrink away from it.
You'll think,

836
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,990
well,
there's no way I could do that.

837
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,160
It's like,
well,

838
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,670
you don't know what you could do.
You don't know what's possible and 

839
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,070
you're not as much as you could be,
and so god only knows what you could,

840
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:27,100
what you could do and have and give if 
you sacrificed everything to it.

841
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,280
And that's the reason that Abraham is 
constantly making sacrifices and it's 

842
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,430
archaic,
right?

843
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,700
He's burning up like baby lambs,
but like while they're alive,

844
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:40,580
you know that something and they're 
valuable and that's something,

845
00:43:40,581 --> 00:43:45,581
it's you have to admit,
even if you think about it as a modern 

846
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:49,031
person,
that the act of sacrificing something 

847
00:43:49,031 --> 00:43:49,580
might have some dramatic compulsion to 
it.

848
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,910
You know,
to go out into a flock and to take 

849
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:55,430
something that's new board and to cut 
its throat into bleed it into burn.

850
00:43:55,431 --> 00:44:00,431
It might be a way of indicating to 
yourself that you're actually serious 

851
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:03,710
about something and it isn't so obvious 
that we have rituals of seriousness like

852
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:08,711
that now.
And so it's not so obvious that we're 

853
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:10,871
actually serious about anything.
And so maybe that's not such a good 

854
00:44:10,871 --> 00:44:14,081
thing.
And so maybe we shouldn't be thinking 

855
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:14,081
that these people were so archaic and 
primitive and superstitious.

856
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,460
It's possible that they knew something 
that we don't.

857
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:22,390
It's certainly in the abrahamic stories.
One of the things that maintains 

858
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:23,280
Abraham's covenant with God is his 
continual,

859
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:28,281
a willingness to sacrifice it.
It's so that sacrificial issue is so 

860
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:31,721
important because you are not committed 
to something unless you're willing to 

861
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:35,561
sacrifice for it.
Commitment and sacrifice are the same 

862
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:38,991
thing and I think its borders on 
miraculous that those concepts are 

863
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:42,570
embedded into this narrative at the 
level of dramatic action.

864
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:44,640
You know,
instead of abstract explanation,

865
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,820
people are acting this out and then the 
fundamental conception is so profound 

866
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:54,051
that it's really quite.
It's quite inspiring and it's 

867
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:57,560
breathtaking really,
when you understand what message is 

868
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,281
trying to be conveyed,
you have to make sacrifices and what do 

869
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,690
you have to sacrifice?
You have to sacrifice that which is most

870
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:08,691
valuable to you currently that stopping 
you and God only knows what that is.

871
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:11,070
It's certainly the worst of you.

872
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,160
It's certainly that and god only knows 
to what degree you're in love with the 

873
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,620
worst of you.
So well,

874
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:24,621
so you moved from the unbearable present
to the ideal future and and you can't 

875
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:29,301
help that.
You have to live in a structure like 

876
00:45:29,301 --> 00:45:29,301
that.
That's your house,

877
00:45:29,301 --> 00:45:32,211
that's another way of thinking about it 
and if you want to get your house in 

878
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:33,750
order and if you want it to be a place 
that you can live properly,

879
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:38,751
then you have to plan the future.
That is perfect.

880
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,460
And then I think,
well what does that mean?

881
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,530
It means it's good for you.
Right?

882
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:51,531
And one of the things that I do all the 
time with my clinical and consulting 

883
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:53,640
clients is try to figure out what would 
be good for them,

884
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,040
but we do more than that.
We try to think,

885
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:56,640
okay,
well what,

886
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:01,650
how can we set this up so it's really 
good for you and that all the side 

887
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,390
consequences of that are things that are
good for other people.

888
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:09,290
And so because people are often also 
timid about trying to get something 

889
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:12,621
that's good for themselves because they 
feel that it's selfish or that they 

890
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:12,621
don't deserve it.
So we set it up so that.

891
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:12,990
Well,
look,

892
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:17,991
we're going to set it up so that it's 
plainly obvious that this will not harm 

893
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:22,500
the structure of the universe for you to
have what you need and to do it in a way

894
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:27,501
that's of benefit to other people.
There's no downside to that and and so 

895
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:32,391
it's okay.
It's okay if you reach out and take 

896
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:32,391
that.
And one of the things that's interesting

897
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:36,441
about the biblical stories,
Abrahamic stories as well as the God 

898
00:46:36,441 --> 00:46:39,450
doesn't really seem to be opposed to the
success of the people that he's chosen.

899
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:43,500
You know what happens to them as,
as they progress through their journey,

900
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:48,470
as they get larger flocks and they get 
more authority and they get,

901
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,790
they get more,
they get life more abundant.

902
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,590
That's what happens.
It's God isn't,

903
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,050
doesn't seem to be a miser in the old 
testament.

904
00:46:55,051 --> 00:47:00,051
It's like if you put in the effort and 
you and you accept the covenant and you 

905
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:04,431
make the sacrifices,
then you get to be successful and maybe 

906
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:07,820
successful beyond your wildest dreams 
and that that's actually seems to be 

907
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,320
okay with God and that's pretty cool 
given that you know,

908
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:15,370
that the general notion of Old Testament
God is that all he's doing is casting 

909
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,890
out curses in death,
you know,

910
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:20,280
wherever he happens to wander.
And I mean there's certainly no shortage

911
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:20,860
of that,
but.

912
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,680
But again,
it seems to me that that's very good 

913
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,211
news and that you also don't have to be 
perfect in order for to have that 

914
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:29,620
happen.
And then the other thing,

915
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,930
this is the issue about going into the 
unknown.

916
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:33,100
It's like,
well,

917
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:38,101
if you leave your country and your kin 
and your father's house and you go out 

918
00:47:38,101 --> 00:47:40,420
into a land that your intuition guides 
you to,

919
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,870
you're going to undergo these radical 
transformations.

920
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:48,871
This is a sacrificial transformation too
because you're moving forthrightly and 

921
00:47:48,871 --> 00:47:50,320
voluntarily into chaos.
Right?

922
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:53,050
And that's the same as the dragon fight.
That's the hero's story.

923
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:56,830
And what will happen there is that you 
will transform yourself,

924
00:47:56,831 --> 00:48:01,831
and so the call to an ideal is also the 
call to a sequence of deaths and 

925
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:05,200
rebirths that move you closer and closer
to the ideal.

926
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:09,160
And that's what that's what God is 
calling Abraham to do.

927
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:15,650
In the first sentence of this story,
you see these things echoed

928
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,010
in the strangest places.
And so these are stills that I took from

929
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:31,910
Pinocchio and this little cricket.
So he is this still small voice,

930
00:48:31,911 --> 00:48:33,590
right?
That's the thing that calls to you.

931
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,130
It's your conscious conscience in part,
it's your intuition in part,

932
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,160
and it's the thing that opens up the 
great book of the world,

933
00:48:40,161 --> 00:48:42,950
the great sacred book of the world.
And that's what happens here,

934
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:48,190
right?
And the animators are at pains to show 

935
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:48,950
you that it's a leather bound book with 
guilt lettering.

936
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:53,030
It's a valuable book and it's something 
that's quiet that's showing it to you,

937
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,290
right?
You have to meditate.

938
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:59,291
Let's say you have to be somewhere where
the world isn't drowning you out in 

939
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:02,831
order to understand how to open this,
to listen to that voice that tells you 

940
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:05,300
where you should go with what you should
do next,

941
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,350
and then what happens is that something 
beckons to you in the night.

942
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,700
It's a star,
right?

943
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:13,950
It's something that transcends the 
horizon.

944
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,480
It's,
it's glitters,

945
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:18,500
it's brilliant.
It's not day to day it.

946
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,520
It's something that's beyond you.
It's something that represents a 

947
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,860
transcendent ideal and that makes it 
manifest to you.

948
00:49:25,861 --> 00:49:30,660
If you're quiet enough to listen and 
that's what you wish upon so strangely,

949
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:35,661
right,
and people do that they wish upon a 

950
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:37,791
star,
they teach their children that and they 

951
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:37,830
don't know why.
What do you mean you wish upon a star?

952
00:49:37,831 --> 00:49:42,831
What in the world does that mean?
It means you lift your eyes to the 

953
00:49:42,831 --> 00:49:44,940
heavens and make a pact with the 
transcendent and then your and then what

954
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:48,750
your heart's desire will come to you.
That's what it means and you think,

955
00:49:48,751 --> 00:49:49,380
well,
that's so.

956
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:54,650
That's not naive.
It's the most sophisticated thing that 

957
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:57,060
you can know and it's the birth of the 
hero,

958
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:58,200
right?
Because that's the.

959
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:03,620
That's the Nativity star obviously,
and this is where it takes place.

960
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:06,710
It's just

961
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:11,690
anywhere and the person who is just a 
carpenter and a toy maker,

962
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:16,691
but that's pretty good at carpenter.
If you're a deceitful carpenter than 

963
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:18,710
your house falls down and if you're a 
toy maker then you love children.

964
00:50:18,711 --> 00:50:20,150
It's a good start.
You know?

965
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:22,340
So.
So Japan who lives in this little,

966
00:50:22,341 --> 00:50:22,890
it's,
it's,

967
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,920
it's a,
it's not a grand house,

968
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,770
it's,
it's just an everyday house,

969
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:32,771
but everything that's happening and it 
is good and so that means it's a palace 

970
00:50:32,771 --> 00:50:34,580
because everything in it is how that's 
happening is good.

971
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,980
There's a saying and I don't remember 
where it comes from.

972
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:41,270
Then it's better to have bread and water
in peace than a feast in conflict.

973
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:46,271
And like that's not a saying,
that's just the starkest possible 

974
00:50:46,271 --> 00:50:50,021
description of the truth because there's
nothing worse than eating a grande meal 

975
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:53,060
with people you hate and despise that 
are at each other's throats.

976
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,670
It's much better to have bread and water
in peace.

977
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:56,990
It's,
it's not,

978
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,040
it's,
it's just clearheaded analysis of the 

979
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,480
structure of the world to say things 
like that,

980
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,960
and so the magical transformation can 
happen in the most mundane of places 

981
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,250
because,
and the reason for that is that the 

982
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,591
mundane nature of places is an illusion 
because every place is the potential 

983
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:21,250
birthplace of the Kingdom of God.
That's the case and so Japan,

984
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,880
he's a good guy.
He has a kitten.

985
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,240
The kitten likes them.
He makes puppets and he's humble person 

986
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,940
and he knows that compared to the ideal 
that he's attempting to subscribe to,

987
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:39,941
that he's.
He's not a based before it or anything 

988
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:44,081
like that.
He's not despicable in relationship to 

989
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:46,961
it,
but the reason he's on his knees is 

990
00:51:46,961 --> 00:51:47,000
because the thing he's pointing at is 
above him.

991
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,320
You know,
if he.

992
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,800
It wouldn't be the right aim if it 
wasn't above him and so the fact that 

993
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,331
he's on his knees so to speak,
is only an indication that his aim is 

994
00:51:58,331 --> 00:52:01,901
proper because you should be on your 
knees to something that you actually 

995
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:01,901
admire.

996
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:04,010
And if you don't feel like being on your
knees in front of it,

997
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:05,900
then perhaps you don't actually admire 
it,

998
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:08,480
and then that means you haven't got the 
stage set properly.

999
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:13,810
It could be.
It should be something that fills you 

1000
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,151
with all your aim should,
should be add something that fills you 

1001
00:52:16,151 --> 00:52:19,361
with all because what?
Why do something else while perhaps 

1002
00:52:19,361 --> 00:52:22,610
because it's easy and perhaps because 
it's malevolent and all of those things,

1003
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:27,611
but,
but those are no answer to the problems 

1004
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,221
that beset you.
They just make things worse and that's 

1005
00:52:30,221 --> 00:52:32,531
clear.
And so then Japan will have as having 

1006
00:52:32,531 --> 00:52:34,910
made his packed his covenant,
just like Abraham,

1007
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:36,740
he falls into a dream,
right?

1008
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:41,741
He falls into a dream and the rest of 
the movie actually takes place in a 

1009
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:41,741
dream.
And it's a dream.

1010
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,840
It's the dream within which 
transformation takes place and that's 

1011
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,630
laid out,
at least in part time stops in,

1012
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,640
in the Pinocchio Story and everything 
happens to Pinocchio in some sense in 

1013
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,930
Atlanta,
that's outside of normal time.

1014
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,450
And that's,
that's the infinite archetipal space.

1015
00:52:56,451 --> 00:52:58,490
And that's a real place.
That's a real place.

1016
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:03,730
The infinite and the finite coexist and 
most of the time we're in the place of 

1017
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:08,081
the finite,
but that doesn't mean that the place of 

1018
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:10,270
infinite doesn't exist.
It just means that we can't get access 

1019
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:10,270
to it.
We just get intimations of it.

1020
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,980
From time to time,
you know when things are going perfectly

1021
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:17,981
well for you on those rare occasions 
where everything comes together for the 

1022
00:53:17,981 --> 00:53:22,150
brief moment,
you inhabit that divine place and you 

1023
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,361
have some sense of what your life could 
be like if you organized it from 

1024
00:53:25,361 --> 00:53:29,310
smallest element to the largest element 
and that's a place that you can inhabit,

1025
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:34,670
if not forever,
in a manner that at least felt like 

1026
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:34,670
forever.

1027
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,160
Well,
because of Japan was decisioned,

1028
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:50,460
the transcendent manifests itself.
It takes the form of the blue fairy 

1029
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,190
here.
That's the positive element of nature,

1030
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,450
right?
So we could say,

1031
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,890
well,
nature,

1032
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,100
it's not so clear that she's on your 
side,

1033
00:53:57,101 --> 00:54:02,101
right?
She's the Red Queen in Alice in 

1034
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:02,740
wonderland who runs around screaming.
When you go down the rabbit hole,

1035
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:07,060
she runs around screaming off with their
heads and who says,

1036
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:12,540
in my kingdom,
you have to run as fast as you can just 

1037
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:12,880
to stay in the same place.
That's mother nature,

1038
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,260
but then we might say,
well,

1039
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:19,710
how do we know that Mother Nature's 
attitude towards you isn't negative 

1040
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:23,220
because your attitude towards things 
isn't proper and that's what this film 

1041
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,290
attempts to indicate.
The idea is that if you aim properly,

1042
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:31,740
then nature aligns itself behind you.
Now it also a raise itself in front of 

1043
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:34,090
you,
perhaps even as an antagonist,

1044
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,120
but the power that it it,
it provides you with from within might 

1045
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:42,460
be sufficient to overcome it from 
without.

1046
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:48,150
And I think that I think that the 
clinical evidence is clear about that 

1047
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:52,710
because one of the things that we do 
know is that if you take people who are 

1048
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:56,161
confronting terrible things and 
shrinking from them and you teach them 

1049
00:54:56,681 --> 00:55:01,681
how to structure their behavior so that 
they can advance with courage.

1050
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:08,820
Everything works better for them.
Their fears decrease and their character

1051
00:55:08,861 --> 00:55:13,861
grows and so there might be enough of 
nature within us to help us withstand 

1052
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:17,620
the nature that's outside of us and it 
depends,

1053
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:21,370
at least to some degree on how it is 
that we orient ourselves in the world to

1054
00:55:21,371 --> 00:55:23,980
some to some unknowable degree.

1055
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:27,310
Now

1056
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:31,640
Japan warrants an autonomous individual 
as a son

1057
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:39,130
and that's also something that makes him
a great person because autonomous 

1058
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:42,320
individuals have their own will and if 
you're a tyrant,

1059
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:47,321
it's the last thing that you're going to
want and if you're the tyrant who's 

1060
00:55:47,321 --> 00:55:50,591
jealous of his son,
it's even more so the last thing you're 

1061
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:54,131
ever going to want and so to aim high 
and to want the development of the 

1062
00:55:54,131 --> 00:55:57,230
autonomous individual or the same thing,
and I would say that's the core story in

1063
00:55:57,231 --> 00:56:02,231
some sense of of Western culture is to 
aim high and to develop the autonomous 

1064
00:56:02,231 --> 00:56:05,720
individual or the same thing and that's 
what happens in Pinocchio.

1065
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:10,900
That's what happens in the story of 
Abraham and the transformation takes 

1066
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,981
place.
The Magical Transformation and the 

1067
00:56:14,981 --> 00:56:18,160
Pinocchio Story.
One of the things that's so interesting 

1068
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,561
about it,
and this is part of it's mythological 

1069
00:56:20,561 --> 00:56:20,930
substructure from the scientific 
perspective,

1070
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:25,931
there's only two determining forces with
regards to the destiny of the 

1071
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:25,990
individual.

1072
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,050
There's nature,
deterministic and culture,

1073
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,260
deterministic and then scholars wrangle 
about which of those is the greater 

1074
00:56:35,201 --> 00:56:40,201
force,
but in mythological stories there's 

1075
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:42,421
always a third element.
The third element is something like 

1076
00:56:42,421 --> 00:56:45,451
autonomous consciousness and there's no 
place for autonomous consciousness in 

1077
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:47,050
the deterministic story of nature and 
culture,

1078
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,630
but we all act as if autonomy is 
consciousness,

1079
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:54,631
is the primary reality and the biblical 
stories are predicated on the idea that 

1080
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:58,570
autonomous consciousness is what gives 
rise to the world and I don't think that

1081
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:02,830
we're in a position to presume that that
is necessarily an error,

1082
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,510
and so what that means is to aim high 
and to develop the autonomous individual

1083
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:12,511
is six is simultaneously the decision to
formulate an allegiance with the 

1084
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:19,890
conscious power that brings being into 
existence and that all takes place 

1085
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:25,110
inside this little puppet and then he 
has his adventures,

1086
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:25,710
right?
He's,

1087
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,860
he's,
he's still half jackass and half 

1088
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:30,860
deceptive,
but he's still.

1089
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,030
Despite that,
despite all the errors,

1090
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:38,031
he has the capacity to move forward and 
to transform into something to transform

1091
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:44,870
himself into something that can be 
properly considered described as a true 

1092
00:57:45,391 --> 00:57:48,240
son of God and that's the right aim

1093
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,840
and it works like this.
As far as I can tell.

1094
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:54,230
You know,

1095
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,120
when I talked to people about doing the 
future authoring program,

1096
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,040
they often put it off and it's not 
surprising because it's hard and,

1097
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,580
and be,
but it's more than that.

1098
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,060
They think,
well,

1099
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:07,060
I don't know how to write.
I'm going to do a bad job.

1100
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,900
I don't really like assignments.
I'm going to have to do it perfectly.

1101
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:16,110
I need to wait until I have enough time 
and like one of those is enough to stop 

1102
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,040
you cold and all five of them you're 
just done.

1103
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:23,310
And so I tell people do it haphazardly,
a tiny bit at a time and badly because 

1104
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:31,741
you can do that.
I tell my students when they're doing 

1105
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,351
their thesis master's thesis,
write a really bad first draft and then 

1106
00:58:34,351 --> 00:58:35,530
we have a little conversation about that
because they don't think.

1107
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:40,030
I mean that because it sounds like a 
cliche in some sense.

1108
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:42,430
It's not a cliche.
It's not a cliche at all.

1109
00:58:42,431 --> 00:58:42,940
It means

1110
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,020
you're a terrible writer,
but,

1111
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,980
but if someone put a gun to your head 
and said,

1112
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:54,120
you have to have your a hundred page 
thesis done by next Monday,

1113
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,600
or I'll shoot you,
but I don't care how terrible it is,

1114
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,920
you would sit down and write it and the 
thing is then you have it right then,

1115
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,020
then you have something and then you can
fix it.

1116
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,990
You can iterate and fix it.
That bad first draft.

1117
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,390
That's the most valuable thing,
and so that's what you need.

1118
00:59:09,391 --> 00:59:13,680
You need a bad first draft of yourself 
and there's.

1119
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:17,730
There's an idea in the young developed 
about the trickster and the gesture,

1120
00:59:17,731 --> 00:59:18,660
the comedian,
right?

1121
00:59:18,661 --> 00:59:23,661
That the trickster is the precursor to 
the savior and that's one of the things 

1122
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:27,821
I learned from young that was just.
It's so unlikely you'd never think that 

1123
00:59:27,821 --> 00:59:29,030
it's so amazing that that might be the 
case,

1124
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:30,790
but the,
the,

1125
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,120
the,
the satirical and the erotic and the and

1126
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,980
the troublemaker that the comedian,
the fool,

1127
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,620
the fool is the precursor to the savior.

1128
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:44,830
Why?
Because you're a fool when you start 

1129
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:44,900
something new and so if you're not 
willing to be a fool,

1130
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:47,210
then you'll never start anything new,
and if you never started anything new,

1131
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:52,211
then you won't develop.
And so the willingness to be a fool is 

1132
00:59:52,211 --> 00:59:54,080
the precursor to transformation and 
that's the same as humility.

1133
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:56,120
And so if you're going to write your 
destiny,

1134
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,240
you can do a bad first job.
You're going to get smarter as you move 

1135
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,781
forward.
That's the thing is that so something 

1136
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:04,781
beckons to you.
That's what happens here.

1137
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:08,090
Maybe the star that you pedal wished on 
was the wrong damn star,

1138
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,220
but at least it was a star,
right?

1139
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:14,870
At least it was in the sky.
At least it moved him forward and so you

1140
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:19,871
say in your life or something grips you 
and fills you with interest and you 

1141
01:00:19,871 --> 01:00:20,090
think,
well,

1142
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:20,930
should I do that?

1143
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,840
And the answer is,
if not that,

1144
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:27,650
then something.
What if it's a mistake?

1145
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,620
It's a mistake.
Rest assured,

1146
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,140
what do you know?
You're going to stumble around,

1147
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:34,850
right?
And what's going to happen is this,

1148
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,670
you're going to move to,
you're going to not stay in spaces,

1149
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:39,260
you're not going to wander around in 
circles.

1150
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,090
And I see people like that.
They said,

1151
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:42,110
well,
I never knew what to do,

1152
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:47,111
and now I'm 40 so that's not so good.
That's not so good.

1153
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,070
And you might say,
well,

1154
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,280
and there is literature to that suggests
that people are a lot more unhappy when 

1155
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:59,261
they look back in their lives about the 
things they didn't do than they are 

1156
01:00:59,261 --> 01:01:01,430
about the mistakes they made while they 
were doing things.

1157
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:06,700
And so that's really worth thinking 
about too because there's redemptive 

1158
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,541
mistakes and a redemptive mistake would 
be a mistake that you make when you go 

1159
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:10,541
out and try to do something.

1160
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:10,940
You know,
you actually,

1161
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:11,840
you think,
okay,

1162
01:01:11,841 --> 01:01:14,290
I'm going to try to do this.
When you're not good at it,

1163
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,800
you make a bunch of mistakes.
It's like,

1164
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:21,010
what's the consequence if you pay 
attention is you're not quite so stupid 

1165
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,370
anymore.
That's the thing is you've been informed

1166
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:24,380
by your,
by the results of your errors,

1167
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:28,340
and so what happens is you,
you follow the beacon,

1168
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:31,850
you follow the light and you're blind so
you don't know where the light is.

1169
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,390
It's dimly apprehended only and you're 
afraid to follow it,

1170
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:40,570
but you decided to take some stumbling 
steps towards it and as you take 

1171
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:45,401
stumbling steps towards it,
you become illuminated and enlightened 

1172
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,270
and informed because of the nature of 
your experience,

1173
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:52,271
because you're pushing yourself beyond 
where you are and you're going into the 

1174
01:01:52,271 --> 01:01:53,510
country that you have not yet been in 
and you learn something,

1175
01:01:53,511 --> 01:01:56,120
and so what happens then is the star 
moves.

1176
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,550
You move 10 feet towards it and you 
think,

1177
01:01:58,551 --> 01:01:59,450
no,
that's not right.

1178
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,130
I didn't get it right.
It isn't there.

1179
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:03,390
It's actually there,
and so then you,

1180
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:08,570
you see it somewhere else and you shift 
yourself slightly and you move forward 

1181
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:12,581
and that's what happens is that you 
continue as you changed the thing that 

1182
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:16,820
guides you forward,
moves,

1183
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,970
right?
It's like God in in the,

1184
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:21,270
in the desert,
in Egypt,

1185
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,760
the pillar of light that you're 
following gets moving.

1186
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:26,730
It's not a permanent thing.
You move towards it,

1187
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:29,880
it moves away.
It guides you forward and so you say,

1188
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:33,570
well,
is what I'm aiming at paradise itself.

1189
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:36,000
And the answer to that is no,
because what do you know?

1190
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:38,910
You see you couldn't see paradise if it 
was right in front of you,

1191
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:44,150
but you might get a glimmer of it and so
you move towards it and you grow and 

1192
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:49,041
then the next time you open your eyes 
you see a little bit more clearly and 

1193
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:50,640
that's what happens is that just happens
over and over,

1194
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,200
right?
It keeps moving

1195
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:59,380
and so you move like this,
but the thing that's so cool is that all

1196
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:02,480
those zigs and zags you say on each of 
those Zags,

1197
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,120
zigs is a catastrophe.
I hit a wall,

1198
01:03:05,121 --> 01:03:07,520
my God,
and then I had to die a little bit and I

1199
01:03:07,521 --> 01:03:10,400
barely got back up.
It's a phoenix transformation at each,

1200
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:13,010
at each turn,
and it's painful,

1201
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,350
but the thing is is that even though 
you've.

1202
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,370
You've traveled 20 miles,
let's say on that road,

1203
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,590
and you've only moved three miles 
forward.

1204
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:25,460
You've moved three miles forward instead
of falling backwards,

1205
01:03:25,461 --> 01:03:28,580
because that's the thing too is that if 
you stand still,

1206
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,990
you fall backwards.
You cannot stand still because the world

1207
01:03:32,991 --> 01:03:37,991
moves away from you.
If you stand still and there's no 

1208
01:03:37,991 --> 01:03:41,100
status,
there's only backwards and so if you're 

1209
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:41,100
not moving backward,
back,

1210
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:46,030
forwards,
then you're moving backwards and that's 

1211
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,120
more more of the underlying truth of the
matthew principle to those who have 

1212
01:03:51,651 --> 01:03:54,740
everything more will be given from those
who have nothing.

1213
01:03:54,741 --> 01:03:57,680
Everything will be taken.
It's a warning.

1214
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:03,040
Do not stay in one place.
Well as you zig and zag,

1215
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:09,471
maybe the maybe the cataclysm of each 
transformation starts to lessen.

1216
01:04:10,571 --> 01:04:13,840
There's not so much of you that has to 
die with every mistake

1217
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,440
and maybe you end up oriented at least 
reasonably properly,

1218
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,470
and if you were sensible,
that would have been your trip,

1219
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,170
but it wasn't right.
It's that and perhaps it's a lot worse,

1220
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:30,171
did not.
Perhaps there's no shortage of 

1221
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:32,091
backtracking,
but it doesn't matter because as you 

1222
01:04:32,091 --> 01:04:32,091
stumble forward,
you,

1223
01:04:32,091 --> 01:04:36,440
you illuminated and inform yourself,
and perhaps that's partly because the 

1224
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,151
world is made of information and if you 
encounter it and tangle with it than it 

1225
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:47,601
informs you and then you become informed
and then your information and then 

1226
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:52,371
you're ready,
and so God says to Abraham,

1227
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:59,200
I will make of thee a great nation and I
will bless thee and make thy name great 

1228
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:06,760
and thou shalt be a blessing.
That's,

1229
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:09,880
that's a good offer.
Fundamentally,

1230
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,460
I mean it.
It means

1231
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:18,640
what does it mean to to be made a great 
nation of?

1232
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:24,670
Well,
perhaps it has something to do directly 

1233
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,491
with your descendants,
but I don't think it's just that you 

1234
01:05:26,491 --> 01:05:29,071
know,
is if you're a force for good in the 

1235
01:05:29,071 --> 01:05:31,231
world,
then that radiates out from you and if 

1236
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:34,441
you're good enough,
it's difficult to say how much of an 

1237
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:35,550
impact on things you could have.
You know Dostoevsky,

1238
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:39,580
who was a very crazy person,
partly because of his epilepsy,

1239
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:44,940
he said,
a man is not only responsible for 

1240
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,851
everything he does,
but for everything that everyone else 

1241
01:05:47,851 --> 01:05:47,851
does,
and you think,

1242
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:48,730
well,
no,

1243
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:51,610
no,
no,

1244
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,900
and yes,
sometimes no.

1245
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,890
Sometimes that's what you think of your 
cataclysmic,

1246
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,860
cataclysmic,
really depressed,

1247
01:05:59,861 --> 01:06:04,861
right,
is that your sins are so egregious that 

1248
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:06,520
they're unforgivable and that in some 
manner you're at,

1249
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:09,340
you're at fault for everything that's 
terrible with the world,

1250
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:14,430
but there's actually truth in that and 
there's actually redemptive truth in 

1251
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:17,701
that is that things wouldn't be so bad 
if you weren't so if you weren't so far 

1252
01:06:20,171 --> 01:06:25,171
from what you could be,
and that's terribly pessimistic because 

1253
01:06:25,171 --> 01:06:25,300
it's all on you,
man,

1254
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,030
but it's terribly optimistic because 
God,

1255
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:33,031
there's a lot of things that you could 
do and if you're crying out for 

1256
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:36,391
something to do,
then that's the best news you could 

1257
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:36,391
possibly have.

1258
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:37,870
It's like things aren't so good,
but neither are you.

1259
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:42,310
So if you stopped doing the things that 
you knew to be destructive,

1260
01:06:42,311 --> 01:06:43,810
which is the right place to start.
You know,

1261
01:06:43,811 --> 01:06:48,811
if you're going to clean up your room,
what do you do first while you just get 

1262
01:06:48,811 --> 01:06:51,781
rid of the mess,
you know when you know what no one has 

1263
01:06:51,781 --> 01:06:53,020
to come in and tell you.
Hopefully what's the worst mass?

1264
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:57,130
It's just it announces itself to you and
you can certainly know yourself and this

1265
01:06:57,131 --> 01:06:59,770
is a very easy meditative exercise to 
sit down and think,

1266
01:06:59,771 --> 01:07:02,650
okay,
I'm doing one thing really stupidly that

1267
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,720
I should stop doing.
It's like,

1268
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,850
how long is it going to take you to 
figure out what that is?

1269
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,800
It's about two seconds,
right?

1270
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:13,950
You've known it forever.
Then you could even make it less 

1271
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:13,950
demanding.
You could say,

1272
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:19,330
there was some stupid things that I'm 
doing that I know are stupid and wrong 

1273
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:24,540
that I could stop doing that I would 
stop doing,

1274
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:30,690
and then you can just start with that 
and you can just do that and maybe it's 

1275
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:30,690
just a little thing.

1276
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:31,870
Although it's not because it's,
it's a.

1277
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,540
it's a step forward on the proper 
voyage.

1278
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:36,280
It's not a small thing and you think,
well,

1279
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:37,930
what would happen?
You could say,

1280
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:39,700
let's do this for a year or even a 
month,

1281
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,800
just try not to do things,
you know,

1282
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:46,801
to be stupid and wrong for a month.
And that means not to say things you 

1283
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:47,350
know,
to be stupid and wrong as well.

1284
01:07:47,351 --> 01:07:50,320
Maybe that's the most important thing.
Just do it as an experiment,

1285
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:55,770
see what happens.
And it's so fun because I have people 

1286
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:56,200
writing to me from all over the world 
who are saying they're doing that.

1287
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,190
They're saying,
well,

1288
01:07:57,191 --> 01:07:59,110
you know,
I cleaned up my room and,

1289
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:02,440
and then I stopped saying stupid things 
and my God,

1290
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,220
it's like things are way better.
It's like who would have guessed it?

1291
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:11,380
You know?
And so it's low hanging fruit man,

1292
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:13,420
because there's,
that's the other thing.

1293
01:08:13,421 --> 01:08:14,830
If there's a lot of things wrong with 
you,

1294
01:08:14,831 --> 01:08:17,000
then it's really easy to start fixing 
it.

1295
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:18,320
You know,
you've got so much.

1296
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,840
There's so much territory that you can 
inhabit.

1297
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,610
I will make of thee a great nation.
I will bless thee.

1298
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:30,730
That's good.
I mean the whole nation thing that's 

1299
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:30,730
positive,
but to have God on your side,

1300
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:35,291
that's you know,
you might want that when things get 

1301
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:39,521
rough,
that would be good and make their name 

1302
01:08:39,521 --> 01:08:41,060
great and thou shalt be a blessing.
Wonderful.

1303
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:45,920
That's a good deal,
and I will bless them that bless thee.

1304
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:51,100
That's good too,
and curse him that curses thee and in 

1305
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:51,860
these shallow families of the earth,
be blessed.

1306
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:59,200
That's something that's something that 
wouldn't be something.

1307
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:04,501
If you could wake up and your day was 
composed in part of people thanking you 

1308
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:07,930
for all the good things you've done in 
the world,

1309
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:09,580
would that be good?

1310
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:16,740
It's not impossible for that to happen.
So Abraham departed.

1311
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:22,610
Yes.
As the Lord had spoken unto him and lot 

1312
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:26,061
went with him and Abraham was 70 and 
five years when he departed out of her 

1313
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,540
own.
That's all old now.

1314
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:30,150
Abraham lives a long time,
but this is also part of the story.

1315
01:09:30,151 --> 01:09:32,040
So he has a wife who can't have 
children.

1316
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,600
He has nothing.
Obviously.

1317
01:09:33,601 --> 01:09:38,601
He's been hanging around.
Dad's shocked for a little too long 

1318
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:38,601
given that he's 75,
right?

1319
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:40,170
It's time.
It's time to get on the fire,

1320
01:09:40,171 --> 01:09:44,550
lit underneath him a bit and so he's not
got much going for him,

1321
01:09:44,551 --> 01:09:47,670
but he still decides to to move forward 
and I've seen this too,

1322
01:09:47,671 --> 01:09:52,671
you know,
like if you don't have your destiny in 

1323
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:52,671
hand by your time you're 30,
it's,

1324
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:57,121
it's rough.
You start hurting and if you don't have 

1325
01:09:57,121 --> 01:09:57,121
your destiny in hand by the time you're 
40,

1326
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,380
then you really start hurting and 
forties,

1327
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:05,100
a real fork in the road.

1328
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:11,760
The fork in the road.
That's always where you meet the devil 

1329
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,951
by the way.
And that's because every time you have 

1330
01:10:13,951 --> 01:10:14,860
to make a decision,
the possibility of evil beckons.

1331
01:10:14,861 --> 01:10:16,750
That's why that is.
I had a friend,

1332
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:19,810
I've told you a little about him and he 
killed himself just after 40.

1333
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:25,430
No,
he had had a book published with a very 

1334
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:25,430
small press.
He was quite a good writer,

1335
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,450
but he could not get himself together 
and it hit him too hard at 40.

1336
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,460
And I'm not saying that it's hopeless at
40.

1337
01:10:30,461 --> 01:10:35,461
I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying that partly because of 

1338
01:10:35,461 --> 01:10:38,671
these verses,
but also partly because of what I've 

1339
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:40,501
seen in my clinical practice.
I've had people come to me who have had 

1340
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:42,070
very chaotic and the ill spent lives,
let's say,

1341
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,520
who were in that neighborhood of age and
and it's true for people who are older 

1342
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,051
as well,
who then decided to make a real effort 

1343
01:10:52,051 --> 01:10:53,920
and to try to make where they were 
better.

1344
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,810
You know,
instead of being bitter about where they

1345
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:59,240
weren't because that's the bitterness 
that really does you,

1346
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:02,740
when it's really not good.
It's the opposite of gratitude.

1347
01:11:02,741 --> 01:11:03,610
It's,
it's,

1348
01:11:03,611 --> 01:11:06,250
it's the manifestation of resentment 
that makes you malevolent.

1349
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,050
It's very,
very bad to be better.

1350
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,610
It's not,
it's not.

1351
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,350
It's hell to be bitter,

1352
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,410
and if you're 40 and you're not 
successful,

1353
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:20,460
then you have to accept your lot and you
have to start to improve what's right in

1354
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:22,950
front of you and if you do that,
it doesn't take very long.

1355
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:26,670
It's quite interesting to watch people.
Things can be a lot better in six months

1356
01:11:26,671 --> 01:11:29,400
and they can be way better in two years.
It's a struggle,

1357
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:34,401
uphill struggle,
but it's by no means impossible and I 

1358
01:11:34,401 --> 01:11:35,070
don't know again what the limit of that 
is.

1359
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:40,071
I suppose it depends on the degree to 
some degree on the degree of your 

1360
01:11:40,071 --> 01:11:40,071
commitment,
but anyway,

1361
01:11:40,071 --> 01:11:44,421
so aber,
it's another indication of the real 

1362
01:11:44,421 --> 01:11:45,870
validity of this story.
God isn't setting this up to be easy,

1363
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:50,871
right?
Abraham was old and he and and his and 

1364
01:11:50,871 --> 01:11:51,150
his wife is old too,
and more than that,

1365
01:11:51,151 --> 01:11:56,151
she's barren.
How is he going to be the father of 

1366
01:11:56,151 --> 01:11:56,151
nations?
How is he going to be successful?

1367
01:11:56,151 --> 01:12:01,070
Well,
the initial departure point is 

1368
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:02,730
insufficient,
radically insufficient,

1369
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:07,850
and,
and that's very inspiring because it 

1370
01:12:08,101 --> 01:12:10,560
means that you can start from where you 
are.

1371
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:17,220
So Abraham departed,
as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot 

1372
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,741
went with him and Abraham was 75 years 
old when he departed out of her around 

1373
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:23,730
and Abraham took Sarah,
his wife and lot his brother's son and 

1374
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:23,950
all their substance that they had 
gathered.

1375
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:27,310
And you know,
he has a relationship with law,

1376
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,750
right?
And he doesn't have his own son,

1377
01:12:28,751 --> 01:12:33,751
but he,
his brother died and so he takes his 

1378
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:34,120
nephew as his son that's grateful,
you know,

1379
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:39,130
did he could be very angry and have 
nothing to do with them because he 

1380
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:39,160
didn't get his own son.
But that isn't,

1381
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,550
that isn't what happens is he's offered 
to substitute let's say,

1382
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:45,580
and he accepts it and so good for him,
you know?

1383
01:12:45,581 --> 01:12:50,581
And that's.
And that's also something that I've seen

1384
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:55,980
that characterize as people who can make
the best of a bad lot is they don't get 

1385
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:00,690
exactly what they want,
but something comes along that offers 

1386
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,750
possibilities that are sufficient 
perhaps if exploited properly,

1387
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:09,240
and they open their heart and welcomed 
them in instead of rejecting them in 

1388
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:09,580
bitterness.
And so that's a good thing.

1389
01:13:09,581 --> 01:13:14,240
And that's part of Abraham's character.
And Abraham took Sarah,

1390
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:19,250
his wife and lot his brother's son and 
all their substance that they had 

1391
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:19,250
gathered and all the souls that they had
gotten in her.

1392
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:24,181
And,
and they went forth to go into the land 

1393
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:24,181
of Canaan into exile,
let's say,

1394
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:24,520
and into the land of Canaan.
They came.

1395
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:30,550
And that's another repetition of the 
transformation story,

1396
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:35,551
right?
You have to go to a land where you're 

1397
01:13:35,551 --> 01:13:35,551
not welcome

1398
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:41,030
an apron pass through the land unto the 
place of Chm onto the plane of Maura and

1399
01:13:41,031 --> 01:13:46,031
the Canaanite was then in the land and 
the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said 

1400
01:13:46,031 --> 01:13:46,220
unto thy seed,
I will give you this land.

1401
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:51,221
And there he built an altar to the Lord 
who appeared unto him and he removed 

1402
01:13:51,221 --> 01:13:55,541
from thence onto a mountain on the east 
of Bethel and pitched his tent having 

1403
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:59,171
Bethel on the west and high on the east.
And there he built an altar unto the 

1404
01:13:59,171 --> 01:13:59,270
Lord and called upon the name of the 
Lord.

1405
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:03,860
Now we don't understand these rituals 
precisely.

1406
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:08,861
You know,
I don't know if the people who did this 

1407
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:11,051
engaged in a meditative ritual was not 
the idea that you take something of 

1408
01:14:11,051 --> 01:14:11,950
value.
You do this,

1409
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:17,060
you,
you undertake this dramatic 

1410
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:17,230
transformation of a life and death 
transformation.

1411
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,330
And is that an aid to meditation?

1412
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:21,390
And what do you do?
Do you sit down and think?

1413
01:14:21,391 --> 01:14:22,360
Do you,
do you pray?

1414
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,790
Pray being to ask,
you know,

1415
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,110
to what do I do next?
How do I orient myself in the world as a

1416
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:32,230
useful exercise to do that too.
I think it's something that people could

1417
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:37,231
do every morning.
I think it's useful to sit down and 

1418
01:14:37,231 --> 01:14:37,231
think,
okay,

1419
01:14:37,231 --> 01:14:38,080
what's the most important thing I should
do today?

1420
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:43,000
What I have an array of things that call
to me to be done,

1421
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:48,180
some of which I will do with joy and 
some of which I will bear as 

1422
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:51,440
responsibilities,
but they array themselves in front of me

1423
01:14:51,441 --> 01:14:54,280
and what should I attend to first?
Well,

1424
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:59,550
do you ask or do you decide and it seems
to me when I do it because I do it all 

1425
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:00,880
the time.
I do it every morning.

1426
01:15:00,881 --> 01:15:02,230
I try to sit down and think,
okay,

1427
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:07,231
I've got things that I would like to do 
and things that call to me out of 

1428
01:15:07,231 --> 01:15:09,130
necessity,
what do I do first?

1429
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:14,130
And it's not so much a decision as it is
a question and I don't know what I'm 

1430
01:15:14,201 --> 01:15:17,530
calling on.
It's I'm calling on my capacity to think

1431
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:20,230
I suppose,
but that's not my capacity exactly.

1432
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,900
I,
I can,

1433
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:28,170
I can commune with whatever provides the
answers and I can think that that's me 

1434
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:28,170
thinking,
but,

1435
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:32,590
and now it isn't that I believe that.
I can't think.

1436
01:15:32,591 --> 01:15:34,660
I do believe that I can consciously 
think,

1437
01:15:34,661 --> 01:15:37,090
but that's not the same as calling for 
inspiration.

1438
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:42,240
It's not the same process.
Just like a dream is not conscious 

1439
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,571
thinking.
It's something that happens to you and 

1440
01:15:45,571 --> 01:15:47,460
that kind of inspiration is also 
something that happens to you because I 

1441
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:47,460
asked myself,
well,

1442
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,330
what's the most important thing I could 
do next?

1443
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:53,620
And then I have an answer to that,
but it isn't because I decided exactly.

1444
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:58,850
I've decided that I'll do it,
whatever it is and that I want to know 

1445
01:15:58,850 --> 01:15:58,850
what it is.

1446
01:15:58,850 --> 01:15:58,850
Those are the decisions,
but.

1447
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:04,110
But there's an involuntary aspect to the
sorting that occurs and that's the 

1448
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,390
psychological equivalent I suppose to 
this.

1449
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:12,570
And I guess the sacrifice is when I feel
that I will do whatever it is that calls

1450
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:21,270
to be done.
Then I don't do the other things that I 

1451
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:21,640
might want to do.
And that's a sacrifice.

1452
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:27,420
It's to me it's the proper sacrifice 
because my sense is that things don't go

1453
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:33,001
properly unless you do what's most 
important and if I want things to go 

1454
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:37,651
properly and I do because I've had my 
taste of things not going properly,

1455
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:43,650
I want things to go properly and so then
it's not so difficult to do what's 

1456
01:16:45,461 --> 01:16:50,461
necessary to to do what makes things go 
properly under those circumstances and 

1457
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:55,300
it's hardly.
See,

1458
01:16:55,301 --> 01:17:00,301
this is partly why the story of Sodom 
and Gomorrah is embedded in the 

1459
01:17:00,301 --> 01:17:03,901
abrahamic stories,
I think because that's an apocalyptic 

1460
01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:03,901
story,
right?

1461
01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:07,750
If things go badly enough,
the whole city is destroyed.

1462
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,110
Okay,
and then and

1463
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:15,120
the reason it goes badly,
it's because the people in the city do 

1464
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,380
not behave properly and the people in 
the city might be you.

1465
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:23,220
And so if you're not behaving properly,
then you go and so does the city and 

1466
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,970
maybe you don't want.
Maybe you do want that,

1467
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,940
but maybe you don't want that and if you
don't want that,

1468
01:17:27,941 --> 01:17:31,270
then maybe.
And you know that if you don't do things

1469
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:33,010
property,
then it's Un the city.

1470
01:17:33,011 --> 01:17:38,011
If you actually know that,
then maybe that terrifies you badly 

1471
01:17:38,011 --> 01:17:41,941
enough so that you're willing to make 
the sacrifice to do the right things 

1472
01:17:41,941 --> 01:17:43,150
instead of the impulsive things that you
might otherwise want to do.

1473
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:51,620
You know,
I learned from Viktor Frankl in from 

1474
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,100
Carl Yogan,
from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and for many

1475
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:58,101
of the people whose works on the 
Holocaust that I read and on the 

1476
01:17:58,101 --> 01:18:02,010
catastrophes in the Soviet Union,
and the people who'd studied most deeply

1477
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:07,011
always came to the same conclusion.
The state became corrupted because each 

1478
01:18:07,411 --> 01:18:12,411
individual allowed themselves to be 
corrupted or perhaps participated 

1479
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:14,520
joyfully in the process of being 
corrupted.

1480
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:18,400
And the consequence of that was the end 
of the world.

1481
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:22,820
And so what that means is that if you 
don't behave properly,

1482
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,960
then you bring about the end of the 
world and maybe you think,

1483
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:28,730
well,
that's only the end of your world.

1484
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:34,090
Fair enough.
Or maybe it's the only the end of your 

1485
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:34,090
family's world.
Know.

1486
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:35,000
Which I suppose might give you some 
pause,

1487
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:40,570
but there's more to it than that because
you're connected to everyone else and 

1488
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,980
what you do that isn't good

1489
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:50,670
distributes itself and all the things 
you don't do that could be good take 

1490
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:54,370
away from the whole.
And so if you know that,

1491
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,100
and I do think you know that if you take
it seriously,

1492
01:18:57,101 --> 01:19:02,101
because if you look at,
if you look at the historical events,

1493
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,550
the cataclysmic events of the 20th 
century,

1494
01:19:05,551 --> 01:19:09,180
seriously,
I do not think that you can fail to come

1495
01:19:09,181 --> 01:19:14,181
to that conclusion.
And Abraham journeyed going on still 

1496
01:19:16,861 --> 01:19:17,970
towards the south.

1497
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:25,170
That's interesting because to go south 
means to go downhill to it's not good to

1498
01:19:25,171 --> 01:19:30,171
go south.
It's colloquial for going to where you 

1499
01:19:30,171 --> 01:19:31,860
shouldn't go.
And so this is what happens to Abraham.

1500
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,460
You know,
he,

1501
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:38,150
his accent is preceded by a descent.
And that's very common in life I would 

1502
01:19:38,731 --> 01:19:40,320
say.
And so it.

1503
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:45,470
So the redemptive element of this 
narrative is that if the covenant is 

1504
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:49,290
constructed properly,
so it's an arc,

1505
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:54,440
which is your decision to align yourself
with God for all intents and purposes.

1506
01:19:54,931 --> 01:19:59,931
Then even the journey south can be part 
of a broader journey upward and there 

1507
01:20:02,191 --> 01:20:07,191
was a famine in the land.
That's mother nature failing to 

1508
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,160
cooperate.

1509
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:13,610
I mean,
that's got to be pretty disheartening 

1510
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:13,610
for Abraham,
don't you think?

1511
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:16,461
Because he finally gets it together when
he's 75 to leave and then you know,

1512
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,500
because God says,
well,

1513
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,850
let's get going and,
and so the first place he goes,

1514
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:22,890
everyone's starving to death.
It's like,

1515
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:27,980
you know,
you might think about that as a test of 

1516
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:27,980
faith,
wouldn't you say?

1517
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:29,550
But he keeps going,
and then what happens?

1518
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:31,770
Well,
he has to go to Egypt so great.

1519
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:32,580
He goes,
where?

1520
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:34,560
He's starving,
where everyone's starving,

1521
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,110
and then to get away from where 
everyone's starving,

1522
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:42,230
he goes to a tyranny.
So the whole beginning of the story's 

1523
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:46,430
not particularly auspicious,
and Abraham went down into Egypt to 

1524
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,390
soldier in there for the famine was 
grievous in the land.

1525
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,760
It's a repetition of the same idea 
again.

1526
01:20:51,761 --> 01:20:54,580
There's downhill voyage out into chaos,
right?

1527
01:20:54,581 --> 01:20:59,581
It's repeated over and over that the 
beginning of Abraham's journey is 

1528
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:01,180
basically a secrets of,
of,

1529
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,400
of experiences,
of exile,

1530
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,690
chaos,
tyranny,

1531
01:21:04,691 --> 01:21:09,691
and catastrophe.
While you should be able to relate to 

1532
01:21:09,691 --> 01:21:12,511
that,
you know how hard it is to get things 

1533
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:12,511
together.
You know,

1534
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:13,690
you go out to do what you're supposed to
do,

1535
01:21:13,691 --> 01:21:18,691
say,
and there's your be set by the 

1536
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:19,060
intransigence of the world and failure.
Well,

1537
01:21:19,061 --> 01:21:20,620
so what are you supposed to do about 
that?

1538
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,340
Well,

1539
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,010
maintain your faith in the good and 
continuing to move forward.

1540
01:21:27,011 --> 01:21:28,870
That's the idea.
And part of that,

1541
01:21:28,871 --> 01:21:31,390
even if even if you don't buy the 
metaphor,

1542
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:33,220
it's like what are you going to do 
instead?

1543
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:38,320
That won't make it worse.
So even if there,

1544
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:43,330
if it isn't an APP that you're pursuing 
your at least for stalling the 

1545
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:46,060
transformation of the chaos into your,
of your life,

1546
01:21:46,061 --> 01:21:49,210
into sheer hell.
And that can certainly happen.

1547
01:21:49,211 --> 01:21:51,640
You know,
you see people who are having a terrible

1548
01:21:51,641 --> 01:21:56,641
time and then you see people who are 
having a terrible time who were also 

1549
01:21:56,641 --> 01:22:00,710
inhale and it's a lot better to just 
have a terrible time than to have a 

1550
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:03,040
terrible time and be in hell at the same
time.

1551
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,520
And it came to pass when he was come to 
near to enter into Egypt that he said 

1552
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:10,690
unto [inaudible] wife,
behold,

1553
01:22:10,691 --> 01:22:13,120
now I know that thou art a fair woman to
look upon,

1554
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,210
therefore it shall come to pass.
When the Egyptians cells see the,

1555
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,880
that they shall say,
this is his wife and they will kill me,

1556
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:21,610
but they will save the alive.
So look,

1557
01:22:21,611 --> 01:22:23,950
I mean Abraham,
Abraham is really having a rough time.

1558
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:26,410
He's a failure,
right?

1559
01:22:26,411 --> 01:22:31,411
I mean,
he's wandering around through the land 

1560
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:31,411
of starvation.
Now he's going to go be a cause.

1561
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:35,841
I slave in Egypt,
he has this incredibly attractive wife 

1562
01:22:35,841 --> 01:22:40,320
and all he can look forward to is the 
fact that the most successful man in 

1563
01:22:40,781 --> 01:22:43,750
Egypt,
the Pharaoh will take her from him.

1564
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,560
So he's got the whole embitterment thing
pretty much nailed down as far as I can 

1565
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:54,391
tell.
And this is when he makes one of his 

1566
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:54,391
errors,
let's say.

1567
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:57,190
And one of the areas that humanizes him.
Say,

1568
01:22:57,191 --> 01:23:02,191
I pray thee that thou art my sister.
Then it may be well for me for my sake 

1569
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:03,130
and my soul shall live because of the.

1570
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,270
And it to pass that when Abraham was 
coming to Egypt,

1571
01:23:07,271 --> 01:23:09,700
the Egyptians beheld the woman that she 
was very fair.

1572
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:14,790
The prince is also a pharaoh saw her and
commended her before Pharaoh and the 

1573
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:18,361
woman was taken into Pharaoh's house and
he and treated Abraham well for her 

1574
01:23:18,361 --> 01:23:21,841
sake.
And he had sheep and oxen and he asked 

1575
01:23:21,841 --> 01:23:22,060
his men,
servants and maid servants she asses and

1576
01:23:22,061 --> 01:23:27,061
camels.
So actually things worked out pretty 

1577
01:23:27,061 --> 01:23:27,061
well for,
for Abraham,

1578
01:23:27,061 --> 01:23:27,280
despite his deceit.
Right?

1579
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:32,430
Which is quite interesting.
And I guess it's because if the 

1580
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:34,420
overarching structure is solid,
something like that,

1581
01:23:34,421 --> 01:23:39,421
it's something like that,
then then errors can still be forgiven 

1582
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:44,930
to,
to speak about it from a metaphorical 

1583
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:46,981
perspective.
And the Lord Plagued Pharaoh and his 

1584
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:49,000
house with great plagues because of 
Sarah Abraham's wife.

1585
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:55,240
While it doesn't seem very fair,
but because the pharaoh didn't know,

1586
01:23:55,241 --> 01:23:57,820
but,
but it's not the right way to look at it

1587
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,140
the right way to look at it.

1588
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,830
See,
there's a story later in the,

1589
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:05,950
in the Bible about David and David.
David could be a pretty bad guy,

1590
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:12,030
you know,
so one of the things he does is when he 

1591
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:12,030
becomes king,
he,

1592
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:16,130
he's in his castle and he's looking over
the city and he sees a woman nude 

1593
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,060
bathing nude,
sunbathing nude on a,

1594
01:24:19,061 --> 01:24:21,220
on a,
on a roof out on the city,

1595
01:24:21,221 --> 01:24:24,340
and he's smitten by her,
floored by her,

1596
01:24:24,341 --> 01:24:27,460
and he has inquiries made about who she 
is,

1597
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:32,730
her name is Bathsheba,
and he finds out who her husband is and 

1598
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:37,111
her husband actually happens to be a 
general in his army and he arranges for 

1599
01:24:39,911 --> 01:24:43,210
that generally be put at the thick of 
the battle and killed.

1600
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:48,470
And then he takes Bathsheba.
So and,

1601
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:52,600
and,
and the Lord is not pleased by that.

1602
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:55,180
Let's put it that way.
And that's interesting.

1603
01:24:55,181 --> 01:25:00,181
You know,
it's an interesting story because you 

1604
01:25:00,181 --> 01:25:03,601
might say,
well why can't the king do whatever the 

1605
01:25:03,601 --> 01:25:03,601
hell he wants?

1606
01:25:03,601 --> 01:25:04,070
Like seriously,
he,

1607
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,500
he's the king,
he's not.

1608
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:08,800
And he's not like the prime minister or 
the president,

1609
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:09,430
right?
He,

1610
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:12,130
he's the king.
And so you might say,

1611
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:17,131
well,
why is the king subject to any rules 

1612
01:25:17,131 --> 01:25:18,871
whatsoever?
What's the rationale for the king being 

1613
01:25:18,871 --> 01:25:20,140
subject to rules?
Well,

1614
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:25,200
the rationality emerges in these stories
is there are social strictures that are 

1615
01:25:25,361 --> 01:25:30,361
such that even if the ruler of the land 
transgresses against them,

1616
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:35,610
there will be hell to pay and that's 
continually presented over and over in 

1617
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:39,040
the biblical stories and it's a natural 
law sort of ideas that there are.

1618
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:44,490
There are intrinsic rules to the game of
social human being and if you and maybe 

1619
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:50,590
intrinsic rules to the to the natural 
state of human being,

1620
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:55,740
you break those rules consciously or 
unconsciously at your absolute peril and

1621
01:25:56,831 --> 01:26:00,790
not only at your apparel but at the 
peril of the state and it doesn't matter

1622
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:05,791
who you are and so I would say this 
actually an indication of God being fair

1623
01:26:06,051 --> 01:26:10,610
rather than being unfair because the 
rule here is pharaoh or not.

1624
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:16,460
You don't get to take someone else's 
wife and the ignorance is no excuse.

1625
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:21,640
Now you might say that's a little bit 
harsh and perhaps it is a little bit 

1626
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:21,770
harsh,
but it's not without merit.

1627
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,460
The idea is not without merit,
and of course Abraham is

1628
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:31,860
complicit in this.
Despite that he is successful and 

1629
01:26:32,331 --> 01:26:36,080
Farrell called Abraham and said,
what is this that thou has done unto me?

1630
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:38,540
Why did so now tell me that she was very
wife?

1631
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,360
Why said Thou you?
She is my sister.

1632
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:44,960
I might've taken her to me to wife.
Now,

1633
01:26:44,961 --> 01:26:47,600
therefore,
behold thy wife take her and go thy way,

1634
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:51,320
and Pharaoh commanded his men concerning
him and they sent them away and his wife

1635
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:54,820
and all that he had and Abraham went out
of Egypt.

1636
01:26:54,821 --> 01:26:57,580
He and his wife and all that he had and 
lot with him into the south.

1637
01:26:57,730 --> 01:27:00,820
And Abraham was very rich in cattle,
in silver and in gold.

1638
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:03,870
And so what's interesting,
you know,

1639
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:05,590
Abraham,
he,

1640
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:08,340
he goes to the place of famine and then 
he goes to the,

1641
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:14,090
to this place of territory and then he,
he lies and then he almost loses his 

1642
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:15,810
wife,
but because he goes,

1643
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:22,410
things work out for him and so hooray 
for that.

1644
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,960
And he went on his journeys from the 
south.

1645
01:27:24,961 --> 01:27:29,961
Even the best.
I went to the place where his tent had 

1646
01:27:29,961 --> 01:27:29,961
been at the beginning between Bethel and
high,

1647
01:27:29,961 --> 01:27:33,950
under the place of the altar.
So he makes another sacrifice which he 

1648
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:36,060
had made there at the first and there 
Abraham called on the name of the Lord.

1649
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:37,410
Well,
so he's had an adventure,

1650
01:27:37,411 --> 01:27:37,950
right?
He's,

1651
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:38,910
he's,
he's,

1652
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:41,030
he's finished his journey.
And,

1653
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:46,060
and so there's a culminating point in 
this narrative and now he doesn't know 

1654
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:46,060
what to do.
He's,

1655
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:46,740
he's left the place,
he's out.

1656
01:27:46,741 --> 01:27:51,741
He doesn't know what to do.
So it's time to build an altar and make 

1657
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:54,000
a sacrifice and figure out and to ask 
for divine guidance once again to figure

1658
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:54,390
out,
okay,

1659
01:27:54,391 --> 01:27:56,640
well I'm done that been there,
done that.

1660
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:59,940
What's next?
And the question is asked,

1661
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:02,970
seriously,
and this is something to consider if you

1662
01:28:02,971 --> 01:28:06,720
want to know what to do,
ask seriously and say,

1663
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,840
I'm willing to see Abraham sacrifices a 
life to his vow.

1664
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,040
Well,
so what do you do?

1665
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:16,720
Well,
you don't sacrifice an animal.

1666
01:28:16,721 --> 01:28:18,820
You don't.
You don't make a blood sacrifice.

1667
01:28:18,821 --> 01:28:21,010
You do it psychologically.
You say,

1668
01:28:21,011 --> 01:28:23,290
I'm going to sacrifice my life to this 
aim.

1669
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,170
That's what you do.
If you're serious,

1670
01:28:27,171 --> 01:28:28,400
what do I do next?
Well,

1671
01:28:28,401 --> 01:28:30,740
I'm going to sacrifice my life to this 
aim.

1672
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,010
What is it that I should do that's worth
sacrificing my life too?

1673
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:36,860
That's a serious question.
Well,

1674
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:41,900
maybe that's the sort of question that 
people don't ask because they're afraid 

1675
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:42,590
of the seriousness of the question and 
the and the what,

1676
01:28:42,591 --> 01:28:47,591
the magnitude of the potential answer.
Do you really want to know what you 

1677
01:28:47,591 --> 01:28:48,290
should do that would be worth 
sacrificing your life too?

1678
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,560
Well,
the answer is yes because it's worth it,

1679
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:56,810
but the answer is also no because really
it's your life.

1680
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,220
You know what?
If you're wrong and you're probably,

1681
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:08,420
but maybe that doesn't matter,
maybe it doesn't matter because maybe 

1682
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:09,810
the rightness is in the process and not 
in the naughty,

1683
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,010
in the decision,
right?

1684
01:29:11,011 --> 01:29:16,011
Because it's not.
It's the beginning of a sequence of 

1685
01:29:16,011 --> 01:29:16,890
decisions as we've already pointed out 
unto the place of the altar which he had

1686
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:21,891
made there at the first and there 
Abraham called on the name of the Lord 

1687
01:29:21,891 --> 01:29:23,700
and Lord also and lot also,
which went with Abraham.

1688
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,760
Abraham had flocks and herds and tents,
and the land was not able to bear them 

1689
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:32,810
that they might dwell together for their
substance was great so that they could 

1690
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:35,661
not dwell together and there was a 
strife between the herdman of Abram's 

1691
01:29:35,661 --> 01:29:39,081
cattle.
The cowboys and the Herdman have 

1692
01:29:39,081 --> 01:29:39,840
launched council and the Canaanite in 
the parasite dwelled in the land.

1693
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:41,760
Well,
and that's interesting too,

1694
01:29:41,761 --> 01:29:46,761
because you know,
Abrams having a pretty good time of it 

1695
01:29:46,761 --> 01:29:46,761
now,
right?

1696
01:29:46,761 --> 01:29:46,761
He's out of starvation.
Hey,

1697
01:29:46,761 --> 01:29:49,380
that's good.
He's out of the tyranny now.

1698
01:29:49,381 --> 01:29:52,680
He's kind of wealthy and then the story 
flips on him.

1699
01:29:52,681 --> 01:29:55,020
He's wealthy and now a bad thing happens
to them,

1700
01:29:55,021 --> 01:29:57,150
right?
It's got all this wealth and so does his

1701
01:29:57,151 --> 01:29:59,850
nephew and now they can't get along 
because they have too much stuff.

1702
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:03,660
So that's quite comical as well.
I think that's a comic interlude here.

1703
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:07,980
Now they handle it properly and Abraham 
said unto lot,

1704
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:13,010
let there be no strife.
I pray thee between me and the in 

1705
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:15,860
between my herdman and I heard because 
we're brothers is not the whole land 

1706
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:18,060
before the separate thyself.
I pray thee from me.

1707
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:23,300
If you'll take the left,
then I'll take the right or if you 

1708
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:23,340
depart to the right,
then I'll go to the left.

1709
01:30:23,341 --> 01:30:25,380
So basically they sit down and say,
well,

1710
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,630
you know,
one of us has got to get out of town and

1711
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:29,430
it can be one or the other.

1712
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:31,350
It doesn't really matter.
We can flip a coin here,

1713
01:30:31,351 --> 01:30:32,970
but we have to.
We have to separate.

1714
01:30:32,971 --> 01:30:37,971
And so they do it amicably and lot 
lifted up his eyes and looked at all of 

1715
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:41,220
the plain of Jordan that it was well 
watered everywhere.

1716
01:30:41,221 --> 01:30:42,960
So that's an intimation of Eden,
right?

1717
01:30:42,961 --> 01:30:47,961
Because you remember eating means well 
watered place before the Lord destroyed 

1718
01:30:47,961 --> 01:30:50,820
Sodom and Gomorrah,
even as the garden of the Lord,

1719
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:53,160
like the land of Egypt.
As the outcome is done to soar.

1720
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,640
So interesting.
You get four shout and we can hear 

1721
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:58,640
again,
right?

1722
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,041
So lot and Abraham are making the 
decision about where to go and and lot 

1723
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:06,440
looks out and sees a reasonable place,
but then this warning comes up that 

1724
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:08,640
there's a.
there's a city out there,

1725
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:12,420
there's a place out there where things 
are not going to go well.

1726
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:15,480
Things are being done badly and things 
are not going to go well.

1727
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:19,510
Then lot chosen mold the plaintiff,
Jordan and lot journey the eastern,

1728
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:24,540
they separated themselves.
The one from the other Abraham dwelled 

1729
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,191
in the land of Canaan in law dwell in 
the cities of the plain and pitched his 

1730
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:31,131
tent towards Sodom,
but the men of Sodom were wicked and 

1731
01:31:31,131 --> 01:31:34,080
sinners before the Lord exceedingly.
Now the word sin,

1732
01:31:34,081 --> 01:31:37,020
I've mentioned this to you before.
I think it's an interesting word.

1733
01:31:37,021 --> 01:31:42,021
It's.
It's the derivation of an archery term 

1734
01:31:42,021 --> 01:31:44,750
in my understanding of its derivation 
and it the Greek word was Hamartia and 

1735
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:49,160
Hamartia is an archery term,
which means to miss the Bullseye and you

1736
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:54,170
think it's worth thinking about that 
metaphorically because you've got to 

1737
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:54,170
think about all the ways that you could 
miss the Bullseye,

1738
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:55,320
right?
You close your eyes.

1739
01:31:55,650 --> 01:32:00,650
That's very common.
You could not lift up the damn bow and 

1740
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:02,410
Arrow to begin with.
You could face the wrong way.

1741
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:06,700
You could be unskilled in your aim,
but I have and I also like the,

1742
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:11,730
the,
the archery metaphor because human 

1743
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:11,730
beings are built on a hunting platform,
right?

1744
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:16,680
And we always aim at things were things 
that were were ballistic creatures on a 

1745
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,640
trajectory always,
and we're always aiming at something.

1746
01:32:18,641 --> 01:32:23,641
We're always aiming at the mark and 
which is of course what you do when you 

1747
01:32:23,641 --> 01:32:23,641
hunt,
right?

1748
01:32:23,641 --> 01:32:23,680
Because you have to hit the mark 
precisely.

1749
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:29,010
And that's what we're like.
And so what we're like that 

1750
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:29,290
psychologically we have to aim at 
something and then move towards it.

1751
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:32,770
And,
and so to sin is to miss the mark,

1752
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:35,530
is to,
is to miss the Bullseye,

1753
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:37,120
to fail,
to take aim,

1754
01:32:37,121 --> 01:32:41,760
to aim badly dame carelessly,
or to not aim at all.

1755
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,440
And that says,
well,

1756
01:32:43,441 --> 01:32:47,900
that's,
that's like a sin of a mission.

1757
01:32:47,901 --> 01:32:52,901
That's to not do.
And then to be wicked is to aim at what 

1758
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:52,901
you know you shouldn't.
A mad.

1759
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:54,470
And again,
I don't,

1760
01:32:54,471 --> 01:32:57,170
I don't think of that as an external 
morality precisely.

1761
01:32:57,530 --> 01:33:02,530
I think that you can read the entire 
biblical narrative again from a 

1762
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:05,861
psychological perspective and say,
we're not talking about external codes 

1763
01:33:05,861 --> 01:33:07,220
of conduct here,
although we could.

1764
01:33:07,610 --> 01:33:11,090
We're not.
The wickedness that's being described is

1765
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,920
the act of you doing something that you 
know to be wrong,

1766
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:17,260
period,
you know,

1767
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,150
and you may do something you don't know 
if it's wrong or not.

1768
01:33:19,151 --> 01:33:24,151
That isn't a sort of thing that we're 
talking about and we're not talking 

1769
01:33:24,151 --> 01:33:26,581
about the things that you do that are 
right are there that other people think 

1770
01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:27,070
are wrong.
We're not talking about those either.

1771
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,710
We're talking about those things that 
you consciously do,

1772
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:32,200
although you know them to be wrong 
yourself,

1773
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:37,710
and that's the things that seem to get 
people into the most trouble in these 

1774
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:37,900
stories and I believe that to be the 
case.

1775
01:33:37,901 --> 01:33:39,880
I think that's very accurate.
Psychologically,

1776
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:42,940
it's amazing because I see this all the 
time.

1777
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:46,000
If you do something wrong and because 
you're ignorant,

1778
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:48,670
you don't know better and it doesn't go 
well for you,

1779
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:54,540
that's the case,
but if you do something wrong and you 

1780
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,851
know it's wrong,
the punishment is is manifold and I 

1781
01:33:56,851 --> 01:34:01,381
think the reason for that.
I think the reason for that is because 

1782
01:34:01,381 --> 01:34:02,410
that makes you cane.
It means you betray your own ideal,

1783
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,240
right?
If you just don't know,

1784
01:34:04,241 --> 01:34:05,200
well,
you haven't been trained,

1785
01:34:05,201 --> 01:34:07,270
your ideal,
you're just not together,

1786
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:12,280
you maybe you're even willfully blind,
but if you do something you know to be 

1787
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:15,601
wrong,
then you've betrayed your own ideal and 

1788
01:34:15,601 --> 01:34:15,601
that lands you.
Cain says to God,

1789
01:34:15,601 --> 01:34:16,300
once Kayden destroys able,
he says,

1790
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,100
I cannot bear my punishment,

1791
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:27,840
and the Lord said unto Abraham,
after that lot was separated from lift 

1792
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,741
up,
now look upward and look from the place 

1793
01:34:31,741 --> 01:34:36,481
where they'll are northward and 
southward and eastward and westward for 

1794
01:34:36,481 --> 01:34:39,010
all the land which thou seest to thee.
I will give it and the seed forever,

1795
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:44,640
and then we'll make those seat as the 
dust of the earth so that if a man can 

1796
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:45,970
number the dust of the earth than shell,
all thy seed be numbered.

1797
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:51,930
Arise,
walk through the land and the length of 

1798
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:51,930
it and the breadth of it for I will give
it unto thee

1799
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:59,780
in the Cathedral.
At short,

1800
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,980
I can't say that properly because my 
French is nonexistent.

1801
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:11,320
So a cathedral is a cross and that 
transformation takes place at the crux 

1802
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:16,421
of the cross,
which is exactly right because the the 

1803
01:35:16,421 --> 01:35:19,420
transformation takes place at the point 
of maximal suffering and the cathedral 

1804
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:21,470
is designed to indicate that right 
symbolically.

1805
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:22,460
Now

1806
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:32,410
what happens in a religious ceremony is 
also a journey and it's a journey in 

1807
01:35:32,410 --> 01:35:36,971
some senses to the holy city,
and then that's also played out in the 

1808
01:35:36,971 --> 01:35:36,971
idea of pilgrimage,
right?

1809
01:35:36,971 --> 01:35:38,540
Because you go to the holy city,
actually,

1810
01:35:38,541 --> 01:35:41,720
you go to Jerusalem or wherever it is 
that you think the holy city is.

1811
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:47,200
You go there and that takes you out of 
your country and away from your kid and 

1812
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,110
away from your family into the strange 
land.

1813
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:51,260
And as you make the journey,
you transform and when you come back,

1814
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:53,300
you're not the same.
That's the Hobbit,

1815
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,160
right?
That's the story of the hobbit.

1816
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:58,190
But let's say you can't afford to go on 
a pilgrimage.

1817
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:03,940
So you go to the cathedral at chart and 
there's a huge maze on the ground and 

1818
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,480
it's the world north,
west,

1819
01:36:05,481 --> 01:36:07,820
south and east,
just as God describes here.

1820
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:13,570
So it's laid out and you enter the maize
at one side and in the middle is a stone

1821
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:19,010
pattern that looks like a flower and 
it's.

1822
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:23,240
It's the place where being wells fourth 
and it's at the center of the Cathedral,

1823
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:27,380
and what that means is that if you 
accept your suffering,

1824
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:30,920
then you move to the place where the 
spirit of being wells fourth,

1825
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:35,980
that's what that means,
and so you enter the the maze and you 

1826
01:36:36,471 --> 01:36:41,471
walk and it's divided into quadrants and
you walk one quadrant completely and 

1827
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:47,171
then the main pathway takes you into the
next quadrant and you walked that 

1828
01:36:47,171 --> 01:36:48,410
completely and then it takes you to the 
third one and the fourth one.

1829
01:36:48,411 --> 01:36:51,680
And then when you walk the maze 
completely everywhere.

1830
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:53,690
When you've gone everywhere in the 
world,

1831
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:54,500
north,
south,

1832
01:36:54,501 --> 01:36:55,610
east and west,
where you've.

1833
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:59,420
When you've traversed the territory 
completely,

1834
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:02,180
then you come to the center and then 
it's yours.

1835
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:07,780
And that's what this is.
So I've noticed when I've been 

1836
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:07,780
renovating houses,
I'd like to do that.

1837
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I paid a lot of attention to the 
psychological process of house 

1838
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,110
renovation because I learned from young 
that you said this,

1839
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:20,530
this is something man.
He said because he was.

1840
01:37:20,531 --> 01:37:23,080
He was talking about the stages of 
integration,

1841
01:37:23,081 --> 01:37:26,050
psychological integration,
and he looked beyond piaget.

1842
01:37:26,051 --> 01:37:27,700
I would say,
um,

1843
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,890
although piaget looked very far,
he said,

1844
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:32,170
here,
here's a conjunction.

1845
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:36,030
You have to get your rationality on your
emotion together.

1846
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:37,830
That's a male,
female conjunction,

1847
01:37:37,831 --> 01:37:40,530
symbolically speaking,
male rationality,

1848
01:37:40,531 --> 01:37:42,870
female emotionality.
You want to bring those together so that

1849
01:37:42,871 --> 01:37:47,871
they're oriented in the same direction.
Your emotions in your rationale will be 

1850
01:37:47,871 --> 01:37:51,471
served the same purpose,
so then you're unified in mind and 

1851
01:37:51,471 --> 01:37:51,471
spirit,
let's say,

1852
01:37:51,471 --> 01:37:53,490
but that's sort of good enough.
Once you've got that together,

1853
01:37:53,491 --> 01:37:55,260
then there's a boat.
You have a body,

1854
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:55,980
and then that's

1855
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,190
a male female conjunction again,
a divine conjunction,

1856
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:03,720
the recreation of Adam before his 
division into female and male,

1857
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,800
and the reconstruction of the 
androgynous Christ that all that,

1858
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:12,801
all those ideas are linked together.
So now you have your emotion and your 

1859
01:38:12,801 --> 01:38:14,250
rationality moving in the same 
direction,

1860
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:19,820
but you're not acting it out.
So now you have to unite that abstract 

1861
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:24,150
part of you with your body and start 
acting out what you think and feel,

1862
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,570
and that's the next conjunction,
but it's not the last one.

1863
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:32,310
The last conjunction is when you realize
that there is no distinction between you

1864
01:38:32,311 --> 01:38:37,311
and your experience there the same thing
and so then when you put together your 

1865
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:39,330
house,
you're putting together yourself.

1866
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:45,120
So I've noticed when I've lived in 
places rented or owned,

1867
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:48,120
didn't matter.
Then if there were part of the place,

1868
01:38:48,121 --> 01:38:51,090
if there was a part of the place that I 
hadn't attended to,

1869
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,760
whatever that might mean,
it might meant cleaned.

1870
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:59,360
It might've meant fixed,
but it certainly meant at least 

1871
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,060
thoroughly investigated.
Then that was chaos.

1872
01:39:00,061 --> 01:39:02,520
It was like it was.
It was like the desert.

1873
01:39:02,521 --> 01:39:04,380
That part that's,
that's a way of thinking about it.

1874
01:39:04,381 --> 01:39:06,450
It wasn't mine.
Even if I owned it wasn't mine.

1875
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:11,690
I had to interact with it before it 
became mine and I had to interact with 

1876
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:14,010
it and I had to put it in order and then
it became mine and then.

1877
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:17,010
And then to the degree that it became 
mine and was in order,

1878
01:39:17,011 --> 01:39:22,011
then I was also put an order.
Now you know that because you go into 

1879
01:39:22,011 --> 01:39:24,570
places that make you uncomfortable and 
maybe it's your own house,

1880
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,010
it's highly probable.

1881
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,570
It's highly probable.
I,

1882
01:39:27,571 --> 01:39:28,680
you know,
I walk into,

1883
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:31,710
well Chinese doctors do this.
Traditional Chinese doctors,

1884
01:39:31,711 --> 01:39:36,711
they go into place people's place and 
they diagnosed their health conditions 

1885
01:39:36,711 --> 01:39:38,790
on the,
on the balance of Yin and Yang chaos and

1886
01:39:38,791 --> 01:39:41,400
order.
They walk into a house that this is easy

1887
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:42,630
to do.
You walk into a house,

1888
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:44,430
there's too much chaos.
Hey,

1889
01:39:44,431 --> 01:39:49,050
you can detect that in no time flat.
Everything is out of order and chaotic.

1890
01:39:49,051 --> 01:39:54,051
You don't even want to be there.
You certainly don't want to open the 

1891
01:39:54,051 --> 01:39:54,051
refrigerator.
That's for sure.

1892
01:39:54,051 --> 01:39:55,860
And there are things that should've been
done years ago,

1893
01:39:55,861 --> 01:39:58,440
everywhere.
And every one of those things is a fight

1894
01:39:58,441 --> 01:40:01,050
that hasn't happened and something 
that's been avoided.

1895
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,690
And you can't even walk in there and 
maintain your health.

1896
01:40:03,691 --> 01:40:08,691
As soon as you walk in there,
you're sicker than you were when you 

1897
01:40:08,691 --> 01:40:08,691
were outside.
And that's one sort of place.

1898
01:40:08,691 --> 01:40:13,490
And then another sort of places you go 
in and you look at the living room and 

1899
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:19,190
the person has vacuum the living room 
rug and the lines that were vacuumed are

1900
01:40:20,221 --> 01:40:25,221
parallel to one another and the and the 
furniture is covered with plastic and 

1901
01:40:25,921 --> 01:40:30,921
you get a glass of water and then just 
as you're going to set it down on the 

1902
01:40:30,921 --> 01:40:33,741
coffee table,
the person rushes over and puts a 

1903
01:40:33,741 --> 01:40:35,991
coaster underneath it and everything in 
that house says to you that it would be 

1904
01:40:35,991 --> 01:40:40,100
a lot more perfect in that house if you 
were either not there or dad and that's.

1905
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:43,860
And that's the message that the whole 
house is blasting at you.

1906
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:49,070
And if you happen to live there,
then you're going to be sick and what 

1907
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:50,100
you're going to be sick from is too much
order.

1908
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:53,470
And in the other house you're going to 
be sick from too much chaos.

1909
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:59,130
And so when you interact with the house,
the unexplored parts are the chaos that 

1910
01:41:02,361 --> 01:41:07,361
had the parts that you have not yet 
contended with are the chaos that has 

1911
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:11,120
not yet been transformed by your 
embodied logos.

1912
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:15,560
Action into habitable territory.
And it does not belong to you.

1913
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:21,990
Arise,
walk through the land in the length of 

1914
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:21,990
it and the breadth of it,
for I will give it unto thee,

1915
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:26,670
the neighbor and removed his tent and 
came and dwelt in the plaintiff camera 

1916
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:27,850
which is in Hebrew and in built there an
altar unto the Lord.

1917
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:32,500
And it came to pass in the days of 
[inaudible],

1918
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:34,960
King of Shinar,
Arioch,

1919
01:41:34,961 --> 01:41:37,960
King of Lsr cheered a little more.
There's a lot of kings,

1920
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:40,540
we won't talk about them.
These made war with Barrett,

1921
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:42,640
King of Sodom,
and with Burger King of Gomorrah,

1922
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:45,640
she nap king of Admah and the king of 
Bela,

1923
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:50,641
which is your.
And these were joined together in the 

1924
01:41:50,641 --> 01:41:51,860
veil of system,
which is the salt sea [inaudible].

1925
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:57,660
Now,
this is actually very much relevant 

1926
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:58,570
today because you see the veil of see 
them,

1927
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:03,840
which is the salt sea is the farthest 
south you can go if south is down 

1928
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,690
because it's the Dead Sea and the Dead 
Sea is the lowest place that there is.

1929
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:12,370
So what's happened is that there's chaos
in the lowest place that there is.

1930
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:17,700
That's what this story says.
And what happens to Lord as he gets 

1931
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:18,970
tangled up in the chaos of the lowest 
place that there is,

1932
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:30,160
and in the 14th year came chedorlaomer 
and the kings that were with him and 

1933
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,760
smote the Ref fames and asteroid name,
and the zooms and Hammond,

1934
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:37,780
the eminence and Chava Korea,
Korea theme and the whites in their 

1935
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:38,750
mount sire onto elpar in which is by the
wilderness.

1936
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:41,180
And they returned and came to end 
Mishpat,

1937
01:42:41,181 --> 01:42:43,250
which has Kadesh and smote all the 
country.

1938
01:42:43,251 --> 01:42:46,370
The male acolytes,
amalekites,

1939
01:42:46,371 --> 01:42:51,371
and the amorites that dwelt in has a has
is zoned to my.

1940
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:55,610
Hey.
Hey has azonto mark.

1941
01:42:55,640 --> 01:43:00,640
There we go perhaps and their window 
with the King of Sodom and the king of 

1942
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:03,731
Gomorrah,
and the king of Admah and the king of 

1943
01:43:03,731 --> 01:43:03,731
Babylon,
and the king of Bela.

1944
01:43:03,731 --> 01:43:03,770
The same as Zara.
And they joined,

1945
01:43:03,771 --> 01:43:08,771
battled with them in the veil of sodium.
So this is absolute chaos and mayhem in 

1946
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:11,750
the lowest place.
It's hell essentially

1947
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:19,390
with Cheddar,
a little more of the king of a lamb and 

1948
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:19,390
with title of King,
of Nations.

1949
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:22,361
And Amarillo fail.
King of Shinar and area king of Ella's 

1950
01:43:22,361 --> 01:43:23,570
or four kings with five and the veil of 
system was full of slime pits.

1951
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:28,780
Low inhale like with war isn't enough.
They had to throw the slime pits in 

1952
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,380
there.
Apparently around the Dead Sea.

1953
01:43:30,381 --> 01:43:35,381
There are pits of a bite bitumen like 
the like the tar pits in near La and so 

1954
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:40,751
that this seems to actually be 
historically accurate and the kings of 

1955
01:43:40,751 --> 01:43:41,390
Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there 
and they've remained,

1956
01:43:41,391 --> 01:43:46,391
fled to the mountain and they took their
goods and they took all the goods of 

1957
01:43:46,391 --> 01:43:49,301
Sodom and Gomorrah and all their 
victuals and went their way and they 

1958
01:43:49,301 --> 01:43:50,690
took lot.
Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom

1959
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:51,860
and his in departed.

1960
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:57,110
So Abraham has a family member who falls
into the lowest place and there came one

1961
01:43:57,111 --> 01:44:02,111
that had escaped and told Abraham the 
Hebrew for he dwelt in the plaintiff or 

1962
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:03,380
the amorite brother of his goal.
And brother vainer.

1963
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:08,410
And these were confederate with Abraham.
And when Abraham heard that his brother 

1964
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:09,140
was taken captive.
He armed his trained servants,

1965
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:11,450
born in his own house,
318,

1966
01:44:11,451 --> 01:44:13,070
and pursued them on to Dan.
Well,

1967
01:44:13,071 --> 01:44:15,410
so now we also know that Abraham is a 
pretty brave guy,

1968
01:44:15,411 --> 01:44:20,411
right?
He gets word that this horrible war has 

1969
01:44:20,411 --> 01:44:23,411
broken out in the worst of all possible 
places and that his nephew is involved 

1970
01:44:23,411 --> 01:44:27,230
in the first thing he does.
His mountaintop is posy and get the hell

1971
01:44:27,231 --> 01:44:30,260
in there and rescue his nephew.
So Abraham's no,

1972
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:33,680
whatever goodness is from the Old 
Testament perspective,

1973
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,870
it isn't harmlessness,
right?

1974
01:44:35,871 --> 01:44:38,420
It isn't emasculation and castration.

1975
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:42,410
It's not that it's not weakness,
it's not the inability to fight,

1976
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:47,590
none of that is associated with virtue.
It's the sort of strength and enable 

1977
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:50,420
someone to mountain arm team of 300 
people when he finds out that his nephew

1978
01:44:50,421 --> 01:44:55,421
is being kidnapped in a terrible war and
to get the hell out there and take them 

1979
01:44:55,421 --> 01:44:56,240
back.
And so that's,

1980
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,570
that's a,
that's a,

1981
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:03,140
that's a call to two.
It's a coal to power that not,

1982
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:06,950
not a kind of peaceful meekness.
That's funny too,

1983
01:45:06,951 --> 01:45:09,350
because you know there's a line in the 
new testament,

1984
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:14,560
the meek shall inherit the earth.
I've got to look at my phone for a sec 

1985
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:14,560
here because I don't know what time it 
is.

1986
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:18,000
There's a line in the new testament that
says it's in the sermon on the mount,

1987
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:23,020
says the meek shall inherit the earth,
and that I read that line always 

1988
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:23,020
bothered me.

1989
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:23,020
I thought,
no way.

1990
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:23,930
That's not that.
That's not right.

1991
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:29,590
Knee can't be the right word.
So when I was doing the story of Noah 

1992
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:31,160
and talking about the sermon on the 
mount,

1993
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:34,070
I spent a bunch of time looking at 
commentaries on that line,

1994
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:35,880
looking at the roots,
the,

1995
01:45:35,881 --> 01:45:40,881
you know,
the Greek roots in the Hebrew roots and 

1996
01:45:40,881 --> 01:45:41,780
trying to figure out what that meant and
it meat does not mean meek.

1997
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:44,120
That's wrong.
Here's what it means.

1998
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:47,180
Those who have weapons and know how to 
use them,

1999
01:45:47,181 --> 01:45:50,600
but still keep the machine will inherit 
the earth.

2000
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:53,270
Jesus,
that's a lot different,

2001
01:45:53,271 --> 01:45:55,910
man.
It's a lot better,

2002
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:58,340
right?
Because the way it's normally knits,

2003
01:45:58,341 --> 01:46:02,960
normally interpreted is if you're so 
weak that your harmless,

2004
01:46:02,961 --> 01:46:04,880
then things will go well for you.
It's like,

2005
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:06,350
no,
that's not right.

2006
01:46:06,351 --> 01:46:08,420
That's and that's not.
That can't be right.

2007
01:46:08,421 --> 01:46:13,421
It doesn't fit with the narrative is 
certainly doesn't fit with this 

2008
01:46:13,421 --> 01:46:14,180
narrative and he divided himself against
them.

2009
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:18,130
He and his servants by night and smoke 
them and pursued them into Hobart,

2010
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:23,140
which is on the left side of Damascus 
and he brought back all the goods and 

2011
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:25,550
his brother lot and his goods and the 
women also ended the people.

2012
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:31,330
Good work.
Abraham and the kings of Sodom went out 

2013
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:34,631
to meet him after his return at the 
slaughter of Charitable Omer and of the 

2014
01:46:34,631 --> 01:46:36,560
kings that there were there with him at 
the Valley of [inaudible],

2015
01:46:36,561 --> 01:46:41,561
which is the king.
Stale and Melchizedek King of Salem 

2016
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:43,550
brought forth bread and wine and he was 
the priest of the most high God.

2017
01:46:43,551 --> 01:46:46,430
And he blessed him and said,
blessed be Abraham of the Most High God,

2018
01:46:46,431 --> 01:46:51,431
possessor of heaven and earth,
and blessed be the most high God which 

2019
01:46:51,431 --> 01:46:51,431
has delivered

2020
01:46:51,431 --> 01:46:53,880
thine enemies into thy hand and gave him
tithes of all.

2021
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:59,410
And the King of Sodom said to Abraham,
give me the person's intake diet goods 

2022
01:46:59,410 --> 01:47:02,661
to myself,
that the goods that Abraham Abraham 

2023
01:47:02,661 --> 01:47:05,910
rescued right out of the kinks.
And Abraham said to the King of Sodom,

2024
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:09,420
I have lift up my hand unto the Lord.
What does that mean?

2025
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:11,760
It means I've made a vow.
That's what it means.

2026
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:14,460
That that's what that phrase means.
I've made a vow to God,

2027
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:19,490
the possessor of heaven and earth,
that I will not take anything from a 

2028
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:22,500
thread even to a shoelace.
I won't take anything that's yours.

2029
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:25,320
Less you should say,
I've made a broom.

2030
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:30,321
Rich.
I'll take only that which my young men 

2031
01:47:30,321 --> 01:47:33,471
have eaten and the portion of men that 
went with me and Aner Eshkol and let 

2032
01:47:33,471 --> 01:47:37,830
them take their portion.
And so Abraham decides here he's,

2033
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:43,050
he's made this immense sacrifice and in 
and done this incredibly brave act and 

2034
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:43,800
rescued his nephew.

2035
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:48,570
And rescued the king's goods and they 
offer him a reward and he says,

2036
01:47:48,571 --> 01:47:53,571
I'm not going to take the reward.
And the reason for that is that he 

2037
01:47:53,571 --> 01:47:54,910
doesn't want to contaminate the,
the,

2038
01:47:55,150 --> 01:47:57,570
the ethical,
purity of his actions.

2039
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:00,300
He doesn't want to be paid.
He doesn't want it.

2040
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:04,510
He doesn't want to benefit from doing.
He doesn't want to have.

2041
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,000
What is it exactly.
He doesn't want to benefit 

2042
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:10,000
inappropriately from doing the right 
thing.

2043
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,060
It's something like that.
And so it's another testament to his 

2044
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:14,160
character in a very complex testament,
right?

2045
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:18,150
Because he's not a CEO.
He's not a good man in any simple sense.

2046
01:48:18,151 --> 01:48:19,380
I mean,
look what's just happened.

2047
01:48:19,381 --> 01:48:21,150
He's,
he's mounted and armed.

2048
01:48:21,690 --> 01:48:24,660
He's mounted in armed.
Uh,

2049
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:25,860
he,
he's,

2050
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:28,440
he's led an army into battle and park 
and,

2051
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:33,470
and participated in a slaughter.
He refuses to benefit from it except to 

2052
01:48:33,901 --> 01:48:35,250
get back.
What was his.

2053
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:40,310
That's it.
He refuses to benefit from it except to 

2054
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:41,850
get back what was rightfully his.
And in that way,

2055
01:48:41,851 --> 01:48:43,710
he maintains his covenant with God

2056
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:51,060
even to a shoe latchet I anything don't 
ever so smaller mean less dao should 

2057
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:53,050
claim a share with God and the honor due
to him.

2058
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:59,190
This is from Matthew Pool,
who was an English nonconformists 

2059
01:48:59,190 --> 01:48:59,620
theologian commenting on that line even 
to a shoe latchet.

2060
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,470
Anything they'll never saw,
meaner,

2061
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:04,060
small,
lest thou should claim a share with God.

2062
01:49:04,061 --> 01:49:06,450
And the honor due to him to his blessing
alone,

2063
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:09,070
I do.
And I will own my riches or less,

2064
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:11,470
thou should say,
Abraham is enriched with my spoils.

2065
01:49:11,471 --> 01:49:13,930
And however he pretended kindness and 
charity,

2066
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:17,860
yet indeed it was his covetousness that 
put them upon this work.

2067
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:24,420
After these things,
the word of the Lord came unto Abraham 

2068
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:24,420
and division saying,
fear not Abraham.

2069
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:29,350
I'm a shield and die exceedingly.
I exceeding great reward the vision 

2070
01:49:29,361 --> 01:49:34,140
issue again.
Well,

2071
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:39,141
we went through that last week.
Fear Not Abraham,

2072
01:49:39,371 --> 01:49:41,270
I am Thy Shield and thy exceeding great 
reward.

2073
01:49:41,271 --> 01:49:42,940
And Abraham said,
Lord God,

2074
01:49:42,941 --> 01:49:46,950
what can you give me?
Seeing as I'm childless tagless?

2075
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:50,050
And that's the only thing that matters 
table at this point,

2076
01:49:50,051 --> 01:49:53,080
and the steward of my house is this is 
easier of Dem Damascus,

2077
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:55,330
no kin,
and Abraham said,

2078
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:56,920
Abraham said,
behold to me,

2079
01:49:56,921 --> 01:50:01,150
thou has given no seed,
and Lo one born in my house is mine.

2080
01:50:01,151 --> 01:50:04,210
Air and behold,
the word of the Lord came unto him

2081
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:08,420
saying,
this shall not be there in heir,

2082
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:11,840
but he that shall come forth out of 
known bottle should be nine here.

2083
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:14,990
So he gets promised the impossible once 
again,

2084
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:17,750
and he brought him forth abroad and 
said,

2085
01:50:17,751 --> 01:50:22,751
now look towards the heaven and tell the
stars if that will be able to number 

2086
01:50:22,751 --> 01:50:22,751
them.
And he said unto him,

2087
01:50:22,751 --> 01:50:27,640
so shall thy seed be,
and he believed in the Lord and he 

2088
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:30,670
counted to him for righteousness.
Seeing that this,

2089
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:34,030
this,
this is the covenant idea,

2090
01:50:34,031 --> 01:50:36,340
this belief,
because here's the belief.

2091
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:45,360
It's the willingness to act as if the 
world is constructed so that if you do 

2092
01:50:45,821 --> 01:50:50,490
the right thing,
the best possible outcome will occur.

2093
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:53,070
It's a decision.
That's the covenant,

2094
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,140
right?
It's a decision about how to live in the

2095
01:50:55,141 --> 01:50:58,560
world because the evidence can't be 
there before you make the decision.

2096
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,260
Right,
and so you might hedge your bets,

2097
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:06,300
you know when,
when Christ comes back in the book of 

2098
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:08,661
revelation to judge people because he 
comes back as a judge and virtually 

2099
01:51:08,661 --> 01:51:12,111
everyone gets cast out with the chaff 
and not saved with the wheat and he,

2100
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:18,890
he says something very interesting.
He appears in the vision with a sword 

2101
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:21,731
coming out of his mouth.
It's a horrifying vision and he divides 

2102
01:51:21,731 --> 01:51:24,530
the.
He divides humanity into the damned,

2103
01:51:24,531 --> 01:51:25,910
in the safe or the day.
Yes,

2104
01:51:25,911 --> 01:51:29,120
the damned and the saved.
He says something very interesting.

2105
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:30,260
He says

2106
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:37,100
to those who were neither hot nor cold,
I will spew you out of my mouth.

2107
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:38,670
And,
and it's,

2108
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,590
it's a,
it's a,

2109
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:41,780
it's a disgust metaphor,
right?

2110
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:47,200
T?
And what it says is that the worst 

2111
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,781
punishment isn't waiting for those who 
committed to something and did wrong.

2112
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,880
The worst punishment is reserved for 
those who committed to nothing and 

2113
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,440
stayed on the fence.
And that's really something to.

2114
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:03,880
That's really something to think about 
it.

2115
01:52:03,881 --> 01:52:07,810
And it's also something that I believe 
to be true because I see that stacy,

2116
01:52:07,811 --> 01:52:09,070
this is

2117
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:13,370
utterly destructive because there's no 
progress.

2118
01:52:13,371 --> 01:52:18,371
All the resist movement backwards,
there's aging and suffering and no 

2119
01:52:18,371 --> 01:52:21,851
progress,
and so to not commit to anything is the 

2120
01:52:21,851 --> 01:52:24,851
worst of all.
Transgressions to commit means to put 

2121
01:52:24,851 --> 01:52:29,231
your body and soul into something.
To offer your life as a sacrifice means 

2122
01:52:29,231 --> 01:52:32,561
that you're willing to make a bargain 
with fate and the bargain is I'm going 

2123
01:52:32,561 --> 01:52:36,281
to act as if if I give it my all,
then the best possible thing will happen

2124
01:52:36,561 --> 01:52:41,561
because of that and to to not see the 
analogy between that and the act of 

2125
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:45,860
faith in God is to misunderstand the 
completely.

2126
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:49,250
And it has to be an act of faith because
how are you going to know?

2127
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:53,440
You can look at other people,
but that isn't going to do it.

2128
01:52:53,441 --> 01:52:56,050
It's Kierkegaard was very clear about 
this sort of thing.

2129
01:52:56,051 --> 01:53:01,051
There's certain sorts of truths that you
can only learn for yourself through 

2130
01:53:01,051 --> 01:53:04,321
experience.
And that's of course why Abraham also 

2131
01:53:04,321 --> 01:53:04,321
has to go out alone,
right?

2132
01:53:04,321 --> 01:53:05,080
He has to leave this candidates.
It's an individual.

2133
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:08,800
It's the individuation process like 
dying.

2134
01:53:08,801 --> 01:53:13,801
It's something that you do alone.
There's no way you can tell what is 

2135
01:53:13,801 --> 01:53:14,200
within your grasp,
let's say,

2136
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:19,350
unless you make the ultimate sacrifice 
and there's no way of finding out 

2137
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:21,940
without actually making it,
and so that's the sacrificial act,

2138
01:53:21,941 --> 01:53:22,750
right?
That's,

2139
01:53:22,751 --> 01:53:26,260
that's really emphasized in the active 
Abraham

2140
01:53:27,450 --> 01:53:30,630
being called upon to sacrifice Isaac.
You think about that is Abraham,

2141
01:53:30,631 --> 01:53:35,631
he's been doing.
He's been like breaking himself into 

2142
01:53:35,631 --> 01:53:38,571
pieces,
trying to progress forward through 

2143
01:53:38,571 --> 01:53:41,271
starvation and tyranny and war and 
deceit and the potential loss of his 

2144
01:53:41,271 --> 01:53:45,171
wife and childlessness and like 
everything that can really be following 

2145
01:53:45,171 --> 01:53:46,470
you in some sense.
And finally God grants them.

2146
01:53:46,471 --> 01:53:47,610
Isaac,
when he's old,

2147
01:53:47,611 --> 01:53:49,050
it's impossible.
He gets Isaac,

2148
01:53:49,051 --> 01:53:51,510
his son,
and then what does he do next is say,

2149
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:52,290
well,
you know,

2150
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:55,590
that son that you've been waiting for.
So for so long it's like,

2151
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:58,110
I'd like to see just exactly what you're
made of.

2152
01:53:58,111 --> 01:54:00,750
So I think you should offer him up as a 
sacrifice.

2153
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:05,550
And I mean it's a very barbaric story in
a sense,

2154
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:10,910
and maybe in more than just the sense,
but Abraham does maintain his covenant.

2155
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:16,500
He's willing to make the sacrifice he's 
willing to make.

2156
01:54:16,530 --> 01:54:21,530
This is the thing he's willing to make 
whatever sacrifices necessary to keep 

2157
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:23,130
his covenant with God intact,
and that's that,

2158
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:27,080
and that's the decision.
Well,

2159
01:54:27,081 --> 01:54:29,120
maybe it's no surprise that people don't
do that,

2160
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:36,490
and he believed in the Lord and he 
counted it to him for righteousness and 

2161
01:54:36,490 --> 01:54:38,420
he said unto him,
I am the Lord that brought the out of Ur

2162
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:41,420
of the Chaldees to give this land to you
to inherit it.

2163
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:43,250
And he said,
Lord God,

2164
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:45,380
whereby shall I know that I show 
inherited?

2165
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:49,160
And he said to him,
this is a sacrificial story.

2166
01:54:49,161 --> 01:54:50,040
Again,
take an F.

2167
01:54:50,110 --> 01:54:54,860
I have for three years and a goat of 
three years in a realm of three years in

2168
01:54:54,861 --> 01:54:59,861
a turtle.
Dove and a young pigeon is fairly 

2169
01:54:59,861 --> 01:55:01,811
specific actually,
and he took all of these and divided 

2170
01:55:01,811 --> 01:55:02,930
them and laid each piece one against 
another,

2171
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:05,000
but the birds divided,
he not.

2172
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:07,730
Now there's a reason for that and I 
don't know the reason for it.

2173
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:10,190
And when the walls came down upon the 
carcasses,

2174
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:13,850
Abraham drove them away and when the sun
was going down,

2175
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:19,090
a deep sleep fell upon Abraham and low,
a horror of great darkness fell upon him

2176
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:21,530
had didn't mean he was afraid of the 
dark,

2177
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:23,750
which is what I thought it meant when I 
first read it.

2178
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:28,930
It isn't what it means.
It means that he fell into a trance or 

2179
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:32,261
something like that.
And then he was enveloped by absolute 

2180
01:55:32,261 --> 01:55:34,190
horror.
So that's how this story begins.

2181
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:40,180
And here's the commentary from Joseph 
Benson who was an English methodist 

2182
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:40,910
minister who lived in 17,
49,

2183
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:42,560
was born in 17,
49,

2184
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:46,290
and the sun was going down about the 
time of the evening,

2185
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:49,560
evening ablation,
the washing for he abode by them praying

2186
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:53,390
and waiting till toward evening a deep 
sleep fell upon Abraham.

2187
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:59,090
Well,
this was not a common sleep through 

2188
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:00,651
weariness or carelessness.
Don't know what a sloop is that's 

2189
01:56:00,651 --> 01:56:04,701
supposed to be asleep.
Not a common sleep through weariness or 

2190
01:56:04,701 --> 01:56:07,900
Carolyn carelessness,
but a divine ecstasy that being wholly 

2191
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:12,741
taken off from things sensible,
he might be wholly taken up with the 

2192
01:56:12,741 --> 01:56:16,251
contemplation of things spiritual well,
it really makes you wonder what Abraham 

2193
01:56:16,251 --> 01:56:18,300
was up to in his campsite,
so

2194
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:27,620
he was participating in something that 
enabled this experience and low or a 

2195
01:56:28,341 --> 01:56:31,830
horror of great darkness fell upon him.
This was designed to strike all upon the

2196
01:56:31,831 --> 01:56:34,170
spirit of Abraham and to possess them 
with a holy reverence.

2197
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:37,200
Holy fear prepares the soul for holy 
joy.

2198
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:42,410
God humbles first and then lifts up 
echoes of Psychedelic Experience,

2199
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:48,470
and he said unto Abraham,
no of assurity that thy seed shall be a 

2200
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:52,521
stranger in a land that is not theirs 
and she'll serve them and they shall 

2201
01:56:52,521 --> 01:56:54,510
afflict them 400 years and also that 
nation whom they shall serve.

2202
01:56:54,511 --> 01:56:59,511
I will judge and afterwards shall they 
come out with great substance and now 

2203
01:56:59,511 --> 01:57:00,360
shall go to vi.
Fathers in peace,

2204
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:02,460
thou shalt be buried in the good old 
age,

2205
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:05,370
but in the fourth generation,
they shall come hither again.

2206
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:08,220
For the inequity of the Amorites is not 
yet full

2207
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:12,570
commentaries of Joseph Benson.
Once again,

2208
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:16,950
they shall come hither again.
Hither to the land of Canaan.

2209
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,140
We're in vow note art.
Now art.

2210
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:24,350
The reason why they must not have the 
land of promise in possession until the 

2211
01:57:24,350 --> 01:57:28,011
fourth generation is because the 
iniquity of the amorites was not yet 

2212
01:57:28,011 --> 01:57:31,881
full.
The righteous God has determined that 

2213
01:57:31,881 --> 01:57:34,821
the Amorites shall not be cut off until 
they arrived at such a pitch of 

2214
01:57:34,821 --> 01:57:38,510
wickedness and therefore till it come to
that the seed of Abraham must be kept 

2215
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:42,171
out of possession.
So the interpretation of the story 

2216
01:57:42,171 --> 01:57:44,511
essentially is that Abraham's 
descendants will end up in slave in 

2217
01:57:44,511 --> 01:57:47,541
Egypt for a long,
lengthy period of time and eventually 

2218
01:57:47,541 --> 01:57:49,350
come back to the land of Canaan.
And it's interesting too because this is

2219
01:57:49,351 --> 01:57:52,470
part of Abram's bargain with God and in 
this divine vision.

2220
01:57:52,471 --> 01:57:54,780
I mean,
he's been promised everything,

2221
01:57:54,781 --> 01:57:58,020
but it's a pretty tough bargain because 
you know when,

2222
01:57:58,021 --> 01:58:00,450
when,
when God is pushed or reveals himself,

2223
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:01,140
let's say,
he says,

2224
01:58:01,141 --> 01:58:06,141
look,
you're going to get your damn 

2225
01:58:06,141 --> 01:58:06,141
descendants.

2226
01:58:06,141 --> 01:58:06,240
You know,
but it's not going to be our.

2227
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,030
It's,
it's,

2228
01:58:07,150 --> 01:58:11,400
it's going to be a tough journey.
They're going to be slaves and slave for

2229
01:58:11,401 --> 01:58:14,850
a very long time and eventually come 
back and you won't see it.

2230
01:58:14,851 --> 01:58:19,851
You'll be dead long before then.
And so it's a realistic promise in a 

2231
01:58:19,851 --> 01:58:20,430
sense.
And you might say,

2232
01:58:20,431 --> 01:58:21,630
well,
Abraham is so dated,

2233
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:26,660
desperate to keep the faith that he's 
willing to read good into what isn't 

2234
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:26,660
good.
But I think,

2235
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:31,280
I think,
I don't think that's the right way to 

2236
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,291
look at it.
I think the right way to look at it is 

2237
01:58:33,291 --> 01:58:35,190
the people who wrote these stories for 
very realistic and they knew that even 

2238
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:36,960
if things turned out well for you,
I mean it was still going to be real.

2239
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:38,730
You know,
it wasn't going to be some fantasy.

2240
01:58:38,731 --> 01:58:43,731
It's like,
let's say you have a family that 

2241
01:58:43,731 --> 01:58:43,731
flourishes.
People are still going to die,

2242
01:58:43,731 --> 01:58:45,040
there's still going to get sick,
they're still gonna have,

2243
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:46,510
they're still going to be alive,
you know,

2244
01:58:46,511 --> 01:58:48,760
with all of it's suffering,
but it'll be,

2245
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:54,500
but it'll be a life that's rich enough 
and complete enough so that it'll 

2246
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:55,270
justify its,
its nature essentially.

2247
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:56,380
And so,

2248
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:02,040
and it came to pass that when the sun 
went down and it was dark,

2249
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:06,480
behold a smoking furnace and a burning 
lamp that passed between the pieces.

2250
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:10,470
Albert Barnes,
American theologian commented on this,

2251
01:59:10,650 --> 01:59:15,650
the oven of smoke and lamp of flame 
symbolize the smoke of destruction in 

2252
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:16,890
the light of salvation,
they're passing,

2253
01:59:16,891 --> 01:59:19,530
passing through the pieces of the 
sacrificial victims,

2254
01:59:19,710 --> 01:59:22,530
and probably consuming the mess and 
accepted sacrifice,

2255
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:27,740
or the ratification of the Covenant on 
the part of God as the dividing and 

2256
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:28,470
presenting of them were on the part of 
Abraham.

2257
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:35,360
In the same day,
the Lord made a covenant with Abraham 

2258
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:35,550
saying unto thy seed,
I haven't given this land from the river

2259
01:59:35,551 --> 01:59:38,340
of Egypt unto the great river,
the River Euphrates,

2260
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,560
the Canaanites and the Kennedys sites 
and the cadman nights,

2261
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:44,000
et cetera.
Now Cri.

2262
01:59:44,001 --> 01:59:45,930
Abram's wife bear him,
no children.

2263
01:59:46,530 --> 01:59:48,690
And she had a handmade.
Wait a second.

2264
01:59:49,590 --> 01:59:52,230
I think we'll stop there.
I'm tiring out.

2265
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:54,680
And it's just.
And it's 9:29.

2266
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:57,600
So that's a very good place to stop.
So yes.

2267
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:03,400
Thank you.
So I should,

2268
02:00:07,890 --> 02:00:12,890
I should close properly and just sum up.
So what happens here is that that 

2269
02:00:13,890 --> 02:00:17,400
Abraham enters into a covenant with God 
to act in the world,

2270
02:00:18,150 --> 02:00:21,480
and the action is an adventure story 
essentially,

2271
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:26,780
and the adventures repeat and their and 
their punctuated by success and sat and 

2272
02:00:29,281 --> 02:00:31,410
sacrifice and re contemplation.
Right?

2273
02:00:31,411 --> 02:00:32,250
And it's so.
It's this,

2274
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:33,780
it's this journey.
It's the,

2275
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:36,810
it's the hero's journey uphill.
I'm here,

2276
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:39,420
there's a crisis.
I collapsed,

2277
02:00:39,570 --> 02:00:43,320
I reconstruct myself to a higher place,
and life is like that continually.

2278
02:00:43,321 --> 02:00:46,200
And that's the story of Abraham and 
that's all contained though.

2279
02:00:46,201 --> 02:00:49,290
It's all contained and this is the thing
that's so cool because that is what your

2280
02:00:49,291 --> 02:00:52,170
life is going to be like.
Whether you plan out your life or not,

2281
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:55,710
it's going to be punctuated like that.
Maybe it won't go up,

2282
02:00:55,711 --> 02:00:57,180
maybe it'll go down.
And the question is,

2283
02:00:57,181 --> 02:01:02,181
what sort of container do you need to be
in in order to tolerate the movement up 

2284
02:01:02,181 --> 02:01:06,891
and down?
And that's what the story of Abraham 

2285
02:01:06,891 --> 02:01:06,891
provides.
It provides a,

2286
02:01:06,891 --> 02:01:10,790
it provides a description of the 
covenant that's like the Ark of the 

2287
02:01:10,790 --> 02:01:11,350
covenant and the Ark or the same thing,
right?

2288
02:01:11,370 --> 02:01:16,020
Except the covenant is the psychological
equivalent of the Ark of the covenant is

2289
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:22,350
have faith in the structure of existence
and go forth.

2290
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:26,250
That's the covenant and that and this 
story is,

2291
02:01:27,510 --> 02:01:31,020
that's the best possible solution that 
you have at hand.

2292
02:01:33,410 --> 02:01:38,410
Alright,
so I'm going to make a request with 

2293
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:41,180
regards to the questions which may mean 
have to reorient yourself in the line.

2294
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:46,510
I would like the first two questions on 
each side if possible to relate 

2295
02:01:47,751 --> 02:01:52,751
specifically to tonight's lecture and 
then I can and then I can address more 

2296
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:57,980
general issues if that's,
if that's okay.

2297
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:00,710
So,
and I again,

2298
02:02:00,711 --> 02:02:05,711
I would like you to carefully speak into
the mic so that the people who are 

2299
02:02:05,711 --> 02:02:07,040
watching can hear.
Can you hear me?

2300
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:07,820
Yeah.
I can.

2301
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:14,820
The story about Abraham saying his wife 
was his sister.

2302
02:02:14,821 --> 02:02:17,580
You referred to that as him making a 
mistake.

2303
02:02:17,581 --> 02:02:22,581
I'm not quite sure I understand how 
you're reading that does a mistake 

2304
02:02:22,581 --> 02:02:26,151
seeing as it was a very deliberate 
decision and it had a pretty good 

2305
02:02:26,151 --> 02:02:28,830
outcome for him and he does the same 
thing a few chapters later.

2306
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:30,750
Yes.
This is true.

2307
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:31,860
You see,
I don't,

2308
02:02:31,861 --> 02:02:36,861
I don't,
I don't feel that I've cracked out part 

2309
02:02:36,861 --> 02:02:36,861
of that story properly.
Now,

2310
02:02:36,861 --> 02:02:41,541
the reason I said it was a mistake is 
because it's clearly an act of deceit 

2311
02:02:41,541 --> 02:02:45,700
and it and it,
and it does put the Pharaoh in a very 

2312
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:45,900
awkward position.
Not to mention survived by the way,

2313
02:02:45,901 --> 02:02:48,570
or how do you say that?
I don't know how to say that.

2314
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:51,120
Surrey,
Surrey.

2315
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:52,800
It's sariah to begin with.
Yes.

2316
02:02:52,801 --> 02:02:53,680
Is that right?
Surgery?

2317
02:02:54,570 --> 02:02:55,140
Yes.
Okay.

2318
02:02:55,141 --> 02:02:59,430
And then it's Sarah and Abraham means 
high king,

2319
02:02:59,431 --> 02:03:04,431
something like that.
And Abraham means father of the people 

2320
02:03:04,431 --> 02:03:06,220
in Surrey means Princess and Sarah means
mother of the people.

2321
02:03:06,221 --> 02:03:07,860
It's some,
I haven't exactly right.

2322
02:03:07,861 --> 02:03:12,861
I'll tell you next week,
but that's part of the name 

2323
02:03:12,861 --> 02:03:12,861
transformation,
the,

2324
02:03:12,861 --> 02:03:16,770
it seems to me that at least in part 
it's an indication of Abraham Abraham's 

2325
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:23,660
willingness to use a sub optimal 
solution when driven to it by necessity.

2326
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:28,260
I don't think it's a heroic act to 
pretend that your wife is your sister.

2327
02:03:28,530 --> 02:03:29,840
Now you know,
and,

2328
02:03:29,841 --> 02:03:31,530
and,
and maybe you might say,

2329
02:03:31,531 --> 02:03:36,531
well,
under the circumstances there was 

2330
02:03:36,531 --> 02:03:36,531
nothing else he could have done,
but it does seem it.

2331
02:03:36,531 --> 02:03:41,360
I can't see how you can interpret it 
other than as a departure from the 

2332
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:44,871
truth,
but I know that that's not all there is 

2333
02:03:44,871 --> 02:03:48,180
to it and it does seem to work out well 
for him and my interpretation is that,

2334
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:53,720
well,
if you're oriented properly in the 

2335
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:55,491
world,
the grace of God allows you a few 

2336
02:03:55,491 --> 02:03:56,310
necessary mistakes,
something like that.

2337
02:03:56,620 --> 02:04:01,620
Do you have an alternative idea?
Well why not?

2338
02:04:04,261 --> 02:04:09,261
What is it about that,
that that means it because it's Abraham 

2339
02:04:09,261 --> 02:04:10,830
and it isn't reasonable to attribute 
mistakes to him or what is it?

2340
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:16,110
Because at least I think it says in the 
text that he's looking to get out of a 

2341
02:04:16,321 --> 02:04:21,321
bad situation and he does whatever is 
the best thing that's available to him 

2342
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:24,750
and not dimension.
As I said,

2343
02:04:24,751 --> 02:04:27,750
he does the same trick a few chapters 
later.

2344
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:28,760
Yeah,
well maybe.

2345
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:31,880
Maybe it is the case that,
you know,

2346
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:33,960
it's like a white lie issue.
You know,

2347
02:04:34,380 --> 02:04:35,720
you say,
well there's a white lie.

2348
02:04:35,730 --> 02:04:37,800
Acceptable.
I would say,

2349
02:04:37,801 --> 02:04:42,801
well,
the best that you can come up with is 

2350
02:04:42,801 --> 02:04:42,801
acceptable.
That that doesn't mean it's.

2351
02:04:42,801 --> 02:04:43,260
It's optimal though,
right?

2352
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:48,290
Like all right,
I'll give you a foolish example because 

2353
02:04:48,571 --> 02:04:50,130
it's the best that I could do at the 
moment,

2354
02:04:50,131 --> 02:04:53,160
but know if you.
If you have a loved one who says,

2355
02:04:53,190 --> 02:04:58,190
does this dress make me look fat?
The answer to that question is I don't 

2356
02:04:59,311 --> 02:05:02,010
answer questions like that.
That's the answer,

2357
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:07,011
right?
Because the other answer is the white 

2358
02:05:07,011 --> 02:05:08,931
lie.
That would mean at least in this 

2359
02:05:08,931 --> 02:05:10,851
context,
and that means that on the one hand 

2360
02:05:10,851 --> 02:05:13,881
you're maintaining the positive contract
between you and the person who's asking 

2361
02:05:14,881 --> 02:05:19,881
the question,
but then you're still sacrificing the 

2362
02:05:19,881 --> 02:05:19,881
truth within that.

2363
02:05:19,881 --> 02:05:19,920
So you're,
you're,

2364
02:05:20,010 --> 02:05:25,010
you're maintaining your relationship 
with the higher order truth but 

2365
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:28,611
sacrificing a lower order truth and,
and that would be better than the 

2366
02:05:28,611 --> 02:05:32,211
reverse,
but it's not as good as not sacrificing 

2367
02:05:32,211 --> 02:05:35,181
the truth at all.
And I would say that if you're maybe 

2368
02:05:35,181 --> 02:05:37,410
fortunate because sometimes it's a 
matter because you can be in a situation

2369
02:05:37,411 --> 02:05:42,411
where all your choices are bad.
I've seen people in situations like 

2370
02:05:42,411 --> 02:05:46,161
that.
I've probably been in situations like 

2371
02:05:46,161 --> 02:05:46,161
that and maybe that is what's happening 
in that story is every choice,

2372
02:05:46,161 --> 02:05:50,871
Abraham is in front of him is bad,
but I can't help but think that it's 

2373
02:05:50,871 --> 02:05:54,531
more than that.
It means that if you're doing the best 

2374
02:05:54,531 --> 02:05:57,690
you can and it's not perfect,
it can still be good enough.

2375
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:01,650
That's how it looks to me.
Thank you.

2376
02:06:06,130 --> 02:06:11,130
Hello Dr Peterson,
you mentioned earlier there's been a 

2377
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:13,000
pervasive problem of nihilism and moral 
relativism,

2378
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:14,080
uh,
and that,

2379
02:06:14,110 --> 02:06:19,110
that can kind of be cured with a novice,
naive optimism that's grounded in fact,

2380
02:06:19,450 --> 02:06:22,480
and what can actually be done to improve
situations.

2381
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:26,610
Is there a way to communicate that 
message to a younger audience?

2382
02:06:26,611 --> 02:06:28,300
They teenagers in high school 
environment,

2383
02:06:28,301 --> 02:06:31,240
which is nowadays a hotbed for this kind
of nihilistic,

2384
02:06:31,241 --> 02:06:32,170
morally relativist thinking.

2385
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:35,260
Great.
I'm glad you asked that.

2386
02:06:36,690 --> 02:06:41,690
So I'm going to tell you,
I was thinking about saying this at the 

2387
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:41,690
beginning,
but I decided not to,

2388
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:43,770
but now I get to say it because I got 
this question.

2389
02:06:43,771 --> 02:06:45,730
So that's so cool.
Um,

2390
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:51,980
I have plans and so plan number one,
I have worked with some people to design

2391
02:06:56,221 --> 02:07:01,221
a website that will enable high 
university students to enter their 

2392
02:07:01,221 --> 02:07:03,330
course descriptions,
their professor's name,

2393
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:08,480
the subdiscipline,
and the university and an artificial 

2394
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:10,710
intelligence agent will tell them if the
course is postmodern,

2395
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:12,390
neo,
Marxist indoctrination.

2396
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:17,540
No,
not only,

2397
02:07:18,580 --> 02:07:23,580
and I have made tentative arrangements 
with someone to finance a advertising 

2398
02:07:25,571 --> 02:07:30,571
campaign for that site.
And so the goal is well to inform the 

2399
02:07:31,841 --> 02:07:36,841
consumer,
do you want to be educated or do you 

2400
02:07:36,841 --> 02:07:37,210
want to be?
And happily you'll build,

2401
02:07:37,211 --> 02:07:40,030
use the site equally for both purposes,
right?

2402
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:43,520
Because if you want,
if you want to take the,

2403
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:49,440
the,
the courses that I would regard as 

2404
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:51,991
indoctrination,
then this will give you a way of 

2405
02:07:51,991 --> 02:07:53,860
ensuring that nothing that you get 
exposed to won't be of that sort.

2406
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:59,310
So,
and then I'm going to make a video to 

2407
02:07:59,310 --> 02:08:02,550
introduce that to university students 
and their parents and I'm going to 

2408
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:04,840
outline what I think the universities 
are doing wrong.

2409
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:10,260
There's about 20 things they're doing 
wrong and they're seriously wrong 

2410
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:13,840
things.
And I'm going to start by describing the

2411
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:18,841
utility of a university education in 
humanities education because the 

2412
02:08:18,841 --> 02:08:21,871
humanities education makes you into the 
kind of autonomous individual that can 

2413
02:08:21,871 --> 02:08:25,981
go away from,
that can be independent and can 

2414
02:08:25,981 --> 02:08:28,330
communicate and think,
and that has immense economic value,

2415
02:08:28,870 --> 02:08:29,210
right?
Not,

2416
02:08:29,211 --> 02:08:31,600
not just spiritual value and cultural 
value,

2417
02:08:31,601 --> 02:08:33,970
but economic value.
And so there's,

2418
02:08:34,450 --> 02:08:36,610
I don't want to tell people not to go to
university,

2419
02:08:36,611 --> 02:08:41,611
I want to tell them to go to university 
and grow the hell up and learn to 

2420
02:08:41,611 --> 02:08:44,881
communicate and think and I want them to
avoid the people who will take the 

2421
02:08:44,881 --> 02:08:46,480
spirit away from them.
And so that's what that website is going

2422
02:08:46,481 --> 02:08:47,590
to do,
I hope.

2423
02:08:47,860 --> 02:08:52,860
And the goal is to drop the enrollment 
in the indoctrination courses across the

2424
02:08:53,021 --> 02:08:56,590
English speaking world by 75 percent 
within five years.

2425
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:57,580
That's the goal.

2426
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:08,440
And then you ask that,
you ask more specifically about high 

2427
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:08,870
school students.
Well,

2428
02:09:09,530 --> 02:09:14,530
we have this future authoring program 
that has been used for university 

2429
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:17,120
students and it produces about a 30 
percent improvement in retention.

2430
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:20,000
And we've tested several thousand 
university students.

2431
02:09:20,001 --> 02:09:22,760
Anyone can use it by the way,
it's not for university students,

2432
02:09:22,761 --> 02:09:25,670
but it was easy for us to test its 
beneficial impact.

2433
02:09:25,671 --> 02:09:28,670
Even if people only spend under 90 
minutes on it,

2434
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:33,380
it still has approximately that effect,
especially on young men,

2435
02:09:34,820 --> 02:09:39,820
especially if they're ethnic minorities,
especially if they're not oriented 

2436
02:09:40,011 --> 02:09:45,011
towards a career and didn't do very well
in school and so that's really cool 

2437
02:09:45,011 --> 02:09:48,671
because it's really hard to design a 
psychological intervention that helps 

2438
02:09:48,671 --> 02:09:50,900
the people who are doing the worst,
most psychological intervention.

2439
02:09:50,901 --> 02:09:55,901
So imagine there are people who are 
doing not so well and people who are 

2440
02:09:55,901 --> 02:09:56,090
doing well and you produce a 
psychological intervention.

2441
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:00,140
What usually happens is the people who 
are doing well benefit even more.

2442
02:10:00,530 --> 02:10:05,530
Right,
but this seems to work for the 

2443
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:05,990
disenfranchised.
So we're thrilled about that really.

2444
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:09,170
And so we produced a version for high 
school students.

2445
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:10,850
Yes.
And so,

2446
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:15,970
but we don't have them look three to 
five years out into the future because 

2447
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:16,850
they can't and they don't know enough.
You know,

2448
02:10:17,180 --> 02:10:18,800
it's hard for full,
full,

2449
02:10:18,830 --> 02:10:22,040
fully mature adults to look that far 
into the future.

2450
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:27,310
High school kids can probably manage 
three to six months and so we're going 

2451
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:30,831
to have them concentrated on character 
development and and what they want for 

2452
02:10:30,831 --> 02:10:35,351
their from their friendships and how 
they would like orient themselves in 

2453
02:10:35,351 --> 02:10:38,981
school and to start thinking about the 
sorts of person that they would like to 

2454
02:10:38,981 --> 02:10:40,520
be and that never happens in schools.
Weirdly enough.

2455
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:45,700
There's a guy named John Gatto who won 
the teacher of the year award in New 

2456
02:10:45,830 --> 02:10:48,320
York City and then in New York state and
then it stopped being a teacher.

2457
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:53,320
By the way.
He wrote a series of books about the 

2458
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:56,471
education system that explain why 
students in pre university education 

2459
02:10:57,801 --> 02:11:00,710
aren't taught to be autonomous 
individuals.

2460
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:04,430
It's very interesting what he's 
discovered historically,

2461
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:09,730
but anyways,
we're going to market that probably two 

2462
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:13,151
parents and two university students 
themselves rather than to the schools 

2463
02:11:13,151 --> 02:11:15,950
because our experience has been that 
producing this sort of material directly

2464
02:11:15,951 --> 02:11:20,951
for individuals works much better.
It's much more efficient and so then 

2465
02:11:20,951 --> 02:11:24,611
students will be able to,
or their parents will be able to 

2466
02:11:24,611 --> 02:11:27,941
purchase the program and the students 
will be able to use it to design their 

2467
02:11:27,941 --> 02:11:32,861
own personality in a manner that would 
make them thrilled to be alive.

2468
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:35,690
Let's say that would be the goal,
right?

2469
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:42,880
Yes.
I'm going to get you to turn it to put 

2470
02:11:54,391 --> 02:11:56,190
it down a little more either.
Excellent.

2471
02:11:56,220 --> 02:11:59,100
Perfect.
Yes,

2472
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:05,760
yes.
And I,

2473
02:12:09,251 --> 02:12:10,120
I think,
um,

2474
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:13,500
especially the literature in 
Developmental Psychology,

2475
02:12:13,501 --> 02:12:18,501
I think bears this out,
but I think a huge part of learning is 

2476
02:12:18,501 --> 02:12:21,411
interaction and discourse and that seems
very difficult in an online setting,

2477
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:23,520
even if it's through text.
I don't,

2478
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:28,700
I don't quite see it as the same thing.
And additionally I think there's a huge 

2479
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:30,510
motivational factor that's a difficult 
to.

2480
02:12:31,590 --> 02:12:36,590
It's difficult to keep motivated when 
you're isolated and nobody else around 

2481
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:38,370
us pursuing the same goal.
So how would you dress?

2482
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:43,520
You're absolutely right on both counts.
I would say that the idea of an online 

2483
02:12:45,091 --> 02:12:49,320
humanities university is grandiose and 
it may not be possible.

2484
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:53,160
And the reason for that is that,
and as you're alluding to,

2485
02:12:53,370 --> 02:12:56,430
we actually don't understand what the 
university is.

2486
02:12:57,060 --> 02:13:01,080
We think it's lectures and exams,
but it's probably not.

2487
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:06,480
It's certainly being together with 
people of your own age.

2488
02:13:06,481 --> 02:13:10,590
As you start your life,
it's moving away from your household.

2489
02:13:11,130 --> 02:13:14,490
It's establishing yourself as a credible
intellect,

2490
02:13:14,550 --> 02:13:15,540
right?
It's,

2491
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:20,600
it's picking a new group of peers.
It's all of those things and it isn't 

2492
02:13:21,241 --> 02:13:24,360
clear how that can be replicated online.
Now.

2493
02:13:24,750 --> 02:13:29,750
The people that I'm talking to are 
sophisticated enough to understand 

2494
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:33,080
Marshall McLuhan's dictum that the 
medium is the message and so I think it 

2495
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:37,971
would be a mistake to attempt to 
duplicate the university online because 

2496
02:13:37,971 --> 02:13:41,160
you can't.
But so what we're concentrating on right

2497
02:13:41,161 --> 02:13:43,710
now is not so much content but 
infrastructure.

2498
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:49,010
The question is we want to set up an egg
and a system of education online that 

2499
02:13:49,291 --> 02:13:54,291
will be autonomously self-governing and 
self improving and the content in some 

2500
02:13:55,171 --> 02:14:00,171
sense,
we're not so much interested in the 

2501
02:14:00,171 --> 02:14:02,211
content as we are interested in the 
process by which people who generate 

2502
02:14:02,211 --> 02:14:04,200
good content might be optimally 
rewarded.

2503
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:06,150
And that's what we want to get,
right.

2504
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:11,390
And that's probably a discussion that 
will take a year or two years to flesh 

2505
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:16,341
out.
We started to conceptualize what the 

2506
02:14:16,341 --> 02:14:16,341
system might look like,
but,

2507
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:19,350
but to your point,
it isn't.

2508
02:14:20,130 --> 02:14:22,540
We're not taking lectures and putting 
them online,

2509
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:24,810
although obviously that's what I'm doing
that,

2510
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:29,870
that isn't going to make an online 
humanities university and we know that 

2511
02:14:29,870 --> 02:14:30,730
and I think everything you said is,
is,

2512
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:35,830
is very accurate and also indicative of 
the high probability that something like

2513
02:14:35,941 --> 02:14:37,980
this would fail.
So,

2514
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:39,150
but you know,
we're,

2515
02:14:39,151 --> 02:14:44,151
we're,
we're going to try to be aware of the 

2516
02:14:44,151 --> 02:14:44,151
pitfalls.
We're also going to.

2517
02:14:44,151 --> 02:14:45,450
I read this great book,
I would recommend this book.

2518
02:14:45,451 --> 02:14:50,451
It's,
it's a very funny book by a guy named 

2519
02:14:50,451 --> 02:14:52,401
John Gaul.
It's called system antics and it's a 

2520
02:14:52,401 --> 02:14:55,341
cult classic system antics.
And it's about how systems really work 

2521
02:14:55,341 --> 02:14:55,440
and how they fail.

2522
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:58,440
And it's a work of ironic comedy,
but it's quite brilliant.

2523
02:14:58,950 --> 02:15:01,160
And one of the things,
one line he,

2524
02:15:01,161 --> 02:15:02,730
it's,
it's made of a bunch of axioms.

2525
02:15:02,731 --> 02:15:06,960
And here's one axiom I just love.
This is the system does not do what it's

2526
02:15:06,961 --> 02:15:11,961
name says it does,
and so I worked in Alberta social 

2527
02:15:11,961 --> 02:15:15,891
services when I was a kid about 18 or so
and I worked as a consultant and I I 

2528
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:20,250
wanted and I got involved in projects 
that were above my pay grade,

2529
02:15:20,251 --> 02:15:25,251
I would say,
and I learned a lot about how how large 

2530
02:15:25,251 --> 02:15:28,911
bureaucracies functioned and I was asked
at one point to update a report that had

2531
02:15:29,101 --> 02:15:32,970
been made the year before about what 
percentage of the spending of the social

2532
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:37,971
services department actually went to the
recipients of welfare and social aid in 

2533
02:15:38,461 --> 02:15:43,461
general.
And the answer was the system did not 

2534
02:15:43,461 --> 02:15:44,310
know and could not find out.

2535
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:49,260
And they had hired a very expensive 
consulting firms to answer that question

2536
02:15:49,261 --> 02:15:51,540
the year before and I was asked to 
update it,

2537
02:15:51,541 --> 02:15:54,030
which was quite odd to begin with.
But then I did.

2538
02:15:54,031 --> 02:15:57,540
I went and looked at the consulting 
report and I went into the data and what

2539
02:15:57,541 --> 02:16:01,980
I found was that none of it was real,
but even more importantly,

2540
02:16:01,981 --> 02:16:04,140
there was no way of knowing whether it 
was true or false.

2541
02:16:04,141 --> 02:16:09,141
Because the system had never been set up
to calculate what percentage of its 

2542
02:16:09,141 --> 02:16:12,120
total spending actually went to the 
recipients of social aid.

2543
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:13,800
It just blew me away.
And then I thought,

2544
02:16:13,801 --> 02:16:15,870
and I was reading this book at the same 
time and I thought,

2545
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:21,500
oh,
the purpose of the social services 

2546
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:22,710
department is to employ people in the 
social services department.

2547
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:25,140
And I mean I wasn't being cynical about 
that.

2548
02:16:25,410 --> 02:16:27,240
It's like charity.
Most charities,

2549
02:16:27,241 --> 02:16:29,410
you know,
it's like 90 percent overhead.

2550
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:33,250
So what does the charity do?
It runs itself now.

2551
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:38,700
You don't want to be cynical about that 
because big businesses are the same and 

2552
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:38,740
most like even if they're running at a 
profit,

2553
02:16:38,741 --> 02:16:42,730
the profit is like five percent.
So the business spends 95 percent of its

2554
02:16:42,970 --> 02:16:44,610
time maintaining itself,
you know?

2555
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:47,320
And it makes a bit of product and it 
makes a bit of profit.

2556
02:16:47,321 --> 02:16:49,180
But most of what it does is maintain 
itself.

2557
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:54,630
So anyways,
one of the axioms in that book that was 

2558
02:16:54,630 --> 02:16:56,770
one of them is the system does not do 
what it says it does.

2559
02:16:56,771 --> 02:17:01,771
So that's [inaudible].
Then you can face the system with a 

2560
02:17:01,771 --> 02:17:01,771
clear head.
And say,

2561
02:17:01,771 --> 02:17:03,220
okay,
well this thing isn't doing what it says

2562
02:17:03,221 --> 02:17:08,221
it's doing,
but it's probably doing something and 

2563
02:17:08,221 --> 02:17:08,221
the thing is doing might be useful,
but we should figure out what that thing

2564
02:17:08,221 --> 02:17:12,871
is.
So that's been really useful to me as a 

2565
02:17:12,871 --> 02:17:12,871
guide to thinking.

2566
02:17:12,871 --> 02:17:14,140
But the other thing he said was if you 
want to build a big system that works,

2567
02:17:14,141 --> 02:17:17,680
start with by building a small system 
that works and scale it,

2568
02:17:17,681 --> 02:17:19,270
and we've done that.
For example,

2569
02:17:19,271 --> 02:17:20,990
with the self authoring programs,
you know,

2570
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:26,000
is built small scale systems that are 
very robust with the hope that they'll 

2571
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:26,000
scale.
And that's the same.

2572
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,990
We'll do the same thing here is start 
with a small amount of content.

2573
02:17:31,690 --> 02:17:33,280
See if we can reward.
See,

2574
02:17:33,281 --> 02:17:35,080
what I would like to have happened is,
you know,

2575
02:17:35,081 --> 02:17:40,081
there's a lot of people out there who 
are pretty intensely educated and some 

2576
02:17:40,081 --> 02:17:42,400
of them are really creative and so 
imagine that there's a timeline.

2577
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:46,270
Imagine you could do a humanities.
As you imagine there's a timeline say of

2578
02:17:46,271 --> 02:17:49,880
a thousand years that's scalable.
Then imagine that,

2579
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:54,250
that there would be lectures associated 
with the timeline at different levels of

2580
02:17:54,251 --> 02:17:57,930
resolution,
so we might call for a lecture on this.

2581
02:17:57,930 --> 02:18:01,600
The third century had what happened in 
the third century.

2582
02:18:01,601 --> 02:18:03,490
80.
You've got half an hour to explain it.

2583
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:06,280
You can explain it any way you want.
You can use animation,

2584
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:08,410
you can use lecture,
you can use text,

2585
02:18:08,590 --> 02:18:10,480
you can make a movie.
We don't care.

2586
02:18:10,690 --> 02:18:14,170
What you have to do is that's the topic.
That's the time span.

2587
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:19,260
That's the amount of time and then you 
can post it and so we could generate 

2588
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:23,820
content that way and let people 
experiment and then we can have people 

2589
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:25,780
review the content as part of their 
education,

2590
02:18:26,380 --> 02:18:29,590
generate questions about the content as 
part of their assignments,

2591
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:34,060
rate the questions as part of their 
assignments and rate the content,

2592
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:39,480
and then if we charged people,
imagine you had to pay $50 a month to 

2593
02:18:39,480 --> 02:18:39,480
enroll,
something like that.

2594
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:43,250
Maybe we would allow you when you first 
enroll,

2595
02:18:43,251 --> 02:18:47,890
maybe you get to use $5 of it as 
disposable income.

2596
02:18:47,890 --> 02:18:49,750
You can award that to any creator you 
want,

2597
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:54,990
but as you progress through the courses,
you're right to determine where your 

2598
02:18:54,990 --> 02:18:58,060
money goes would increase as you became 
more and more educated.

2599
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:00,820
Hopefully that way we would get some 
quality control built into it.

2600
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,740
So those are some of the ideas that 
were,

2601
02:19:03,070 --> 02:19:06,830
that were starting to play around with.
So that's the only one I'm considered.

2602
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,620
Modista motivation.
What's that?

2603
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:12,280
The motivation issue for individuals?
Well,

2604
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:16,210
I'm not going to go into that because it
would take too long,

2605
02:19:16,211 --> 02:19:21,211
but,
but rest assured that we are thinking 

2606
02:19:21,211 --> 02:19:23,581
about that very hard as well.
We're going to build competition into 

2607
02:19:23,581 --> 02:19:26,971
it.
We're going to build cooperation into 

2608
02:19:26,971 --> 02:19:26,971
it.
We hope to build peer interrelationships

2609
02:19:26,971 --> 02:19:28,400
into it.
I all that's possible but,

2610
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:29,750
but complex,
right?

2611
02:19:29,751 --> 02:19:34,751
Because it's.
We don't know how to build an online 

2612
02:19:34,751 --> 02:19:34,990
education system really.
And,

2613
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:38,480
but it would be fun to experiment and 
see if we can figure out how to do it.

2614
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:40,650
So thank you.

2615
02:19:46,130 --> 02:19:47,500
Hi.
Uh,

2616
02:19:47,501 --> 02:19:52,501
so I,
I couldn't really zero in on any 

2617
02:19:52,501 --> 02:19:56,491
particular question.
So it's more of a family questions that 

2618
02:19:56,491 --> 02:19:56,980
I have about the nature and cultivation 
of conscience,

2619
02:19:57,340 --> 02:20:01,510
which was in a sense of what the story a
exemplified about Abraham.

2620
02:20:01,930 --> 02:20:02,590
What,
why do you

2621
02:20:02,670 --> 02:20:07,670
say that?
Why do you think that the story 

2622
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:08,460
exemplified the development of conscious
of conscience specific specifically?

2623
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:11,100
Well,
going back to the Zig Zag,

2624
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:12,590
right?
And the star.

2625
02:20:12,591 --> 02:20:13,630
How you have to keep.
Okay.

2626
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:18,640
So that's what you were referring to.
Orienting yourself completely 

2627
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:20,080
autonomously on your own terms.
Right.

2628
02:20:20,550 --> 02:20:21,410
A toe.

2629
02:20:21,860 --> 02:20:22,470
See,
okay.

2630
02:20:22,530 --> 02:20:24,390
So you,
you hit on some great there.

2631
02:20:24,391 --> 02:20:25,170
I think,
you know,

2632
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:30,620
this is something weirdly enough that I 
learned most particularly from the 

2633
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:35,180
Pinocchio Movie,
which I spent a lot of time studying is 

2634
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:37,310
because in the Pinocchio movie,
Jimminy Cricket is an Avatar of Christ 

2635
02:20:37,310 --> 02:20:42,081
essentially.
But it's very strange because he's a 

2636
02:20:42,081 --> 02:20:44,301
bug.
That's the first thing that's kind of 

2637
02:20:44,301 --> 02:20:45,210
weird because Jimminy cricket is 
southern US slang for Jesus Christ among

2638
02:20:45,211 --> 02:20:48,480
other things.
But these things get aggregated in,

2639
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:51,900
in great mythic dramas like that.
And that's a great mythic drama.

2640
02:20:52,230 --> 02:20:57,230
But you know,
one of the things that really makes 

2641
02:20:57,230 --> 02:20:57,840
jimminy cricket different from Christ,
apart from the fact that Christ wasn't a

2642
02:20:57,841 --> 02:21:02,460
cricket is that created the cricket 
learns as he progresses,

2643
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:04,590
right?
Even though he's the conscience.

2644
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:07,200
And so you'd think that he would be the 
infallible guide.

2645
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:08,940
That isn't how the movie makers set it 
up.

2646
02:21:08,940 --> 02:21:13,940
And that's so cool is that he's just as 
muddle headed as Pinocchio at the 

2647
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:15,810
beginning and he's a bit arrogant,
puffed up to.

2648
02:21:16,170 --> 02:21:19,440
And so it took me a long time to think 
that through.

2649
02:21:19,441 --> 02:21:20,700
And then I realized that,
well,

2650
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:25,590
you have the voice of the voice of 
culture in you.

2651
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:27,720
You have the voice of culture within 
you,

2652
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:32,790
but it's old and dead and out of date 
and it's not fully articulated.

2653
02:21:32,791 --> 02:21:37,791
An updated.
And then what happens is that if you 

2654
02:21:37,791 --> 02:21:39,801
enter into a dialogue with it and you 
hammer yourself against the world,

2655
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:43,260
then you get hammered into shape and so 
does your conscience.

2656
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:47,270
And so you both become elevated and so 
well.

2657
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:48,610
So anyways,
I think that's,

2658
02:21:49,050 --> 02:21:52,440
that's ridiculously cool because it 
means that your conscience,

2659
02:21:52,470 --> 02:21:57,470
you don't have an infallible guide,
but you have something within you that 

2660
02:21:57,470 --> 02:22:00,231
you could build into an infallible guide
if you cooperated with it and fed it so 

2661
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:03,540
well.
So I think that's very interesting.

2662
02:22:03,790 --> 02:22:08,790
So that being said,
the picture that I have in my mind of 

2663
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:11,440
the cultivation of virtue in general,
it's kind of like taking a,

2664
02:22:11,610 --> 02:22:14,800
a block of wood and trying to carve out 
a sphere out of it.

2665
02:22:15,010 --> 02:22:17,560
It'll never be perfectly round.
But the more you carve,

2666
02:22:17,561 --> 02:22:18,980
right?
The rounder and Roderick,

2667
02:22:19,390 --> 02:22:21,550
that successive approximation.
Yeah.

2668
02:22:21,551 --> 02:22:23,640
Well one of it's also like,
um,

2669
02:22:24,460 --> 02:22:26,520
what do you call compound interest?

2670
02:22:26,940 --> 02:22:31,940
This is one of the things that's also,
and I think this puts you on the to 

2671
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:34,080
those who more shall be given part of 
the curve.

2672
02:22:34,470 --> 02:22:36,030
It's like,
you know,

2673
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:41,260
you don't have to improve yourself very 
much each week to really improve 

2674
02:22:41,641 --> 02:22:44,040
yourself on a ridiculous amount in a 
year.

2675
02:22:44,330 --> 02:22:45,390
You know,
so you could make,

2676
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,220
you could,
you could,

2677
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:51,470
you could vow to make your day one 100th
of a percent better than the day before,

2678
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:57,180
and that would do the trick if you were,
if you were constant about that,

2679
02:22:57,540 --> 02:22:59,250
that would do the trick.
So that,

2680
02:22:59,251 --> 02:23:04,251
that's the success of approximation is 
you don't want to underestimate the 

2681
02:23:04,251 --> 02:23:05,190
utility of incremental progress.
Man,

2682
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:08,580
it's really kids deadly powerful.
So,

2683
02:23:09,130 --> 02:23:11,680
so let's say you get to the,
you know,

2684
02:23:11,681 --> 02:23:13,150
the,
the higher ends of the curve,

2685
02:23:13,151 --> 02:23:15,310
right?
You're like a pretty virtuous person.

2686
02:23:16,330 --> 02:23:19,510
Let's say you even become a sage or 
something of the sort,

2687
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:24,960
and I mean one,
should you doubt your conscience,

2688
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:29,640
like what are the things that we should 
watch out for even when we got some.

2689
02:23:29,710 --> 02:23:34,710
Great.
Well that's okay just to get out of the 

2690
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:34,710
way,
right?

2691
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:37,810
Yeah.
I don't know how much this relates.

2692
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:39,790
Well,
it does relate,

2693
02:23:39,791 --> 02:23:41,830
but psychopaths,
for example,

2694
02:23:41,860 --> 02:23:44,890
the entire idea that they lack a 
conscience and that's why,

2695
02:23:45,070 --> 02:23:47,110
right?
That's what psychopathy is.

2696
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:50,830
Whether or not you agree with that 
definition,

2697
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:52,690
right?
But there's an issue of conscience,

2698
02:23:52,691 --> 02:23:54,490
again,
a play with psychopathy.

2699
02:23:55,750 --> 02:24:00,750
How can we the first question,
doubt ourselves in a way that's 

2700
02:24:01,931 --> 02:24:02,920
warranted,
right?

2701
02:24:02,921 --> 02:24:07,921
Regardless of how virtuous we've become.
And can you treat a psychopath?

2702
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:11,680
Could they cultivate a conscience?

2703
02:24:11,790 --> 02:24:12,540
Okay,
so let's,

2704
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,500
we'll start with the first one.
Part of the reason that,

2705
02:24:15,570 --> 02:24:20,130
that I believe that freedom of speech is
the canonical,

2706
02:24:21,150 --> 02:24:23,100
right?
That's an obligation,

2707
02:24:23,101 --> 02:24:24,150
right?
More importantly,

2708
02:24:24,151 --> 02:24:28,650
even obligation is that that's how you 
figure out if you're wrong,

2709
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:31,030
you know,
because.

2710
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:32,590
So I sit home and I think,
and I think,

2711
02:24:32,591 --> 02:24:34,600
and I think let's say,
but I'm like,

2712
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:37,690
who am I to think?
There's so many things.

2713
02:24:37,691 --> 02:24:42,691
I don't know that it's just,
there's the one I know compared to what 

2714
02:24:42,691 --> 02:24:47,191
I don't know is so minuscule that it's a
preposterous act just to say something.

2715
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:51,700
Okay.
So,

2716
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:54,610
so no matter how much I sit at home and 
think I'm not going to fix that,

2717
02:24:54,611 --> 02:24:56,320
I'm going to be fun.
And then I have biases,

2718
02:24:56,321 --> 02:25:01,321
but my temperament and I have biases 
because of my malevolence and I have 

2719
02:25:01,321 --> 02:25:03,400
biases because of my gender,
my sex,

2720
02:25:03,401 --> 02:25:06,130
let's say,
since we're not so fond of that word.

2721
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:13,500
So Eva,
no matter how much I sit home and think 

2722
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:13,770
I'm still going to be wrong and 
malevolent,

2723
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:19,560
so then whenever I have to do is I have 
to talk to some other people and I have 

2724
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:22,771
to say this is what I think,
and it's going to be ugly,

2725
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:28,480
you know,
because what the hell do I know?

2726
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:30,490
But then if I listen,

2727
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:37,680
people will tell me why I'm wrong and 
lots of people have been telling me why 

2728
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:39,610
I'm wrong like a lot and it's hard,
you know,

2729
02:25:39,970 --> 02:25:41,500
it's hard,
but it's.

2730
02:25:41,770 --> 02:25:44,680
But I've learned something from it like 
I had this

2731
02:25:45,990 --> 02:25:50,990
revelation,
let's say about being yelled at by your 

2732
02:25:50,990 --> 02:25:51,510
father.
Now I know that you can be yelled at too

2733
02:25:51,511 --> 02:25:55,710
much by your father,
but it's like you're wrong man.

2734
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:59,790
And so someone's yelling at you and 
maybe they're only 10 percent right?

2735
02:26:00,330 --> 02:26:05,330
But if you shut the hell up and listen,
then you can figure out where you're 

2736
02:26:05,330 --> 02:26:09,411
wrong.
And then maybe you can be thankful for 

2737
02:26:09,411 --> 02:26:12,051
that.
And then maybe if you shut up and 

2738
02:26:12,051 --> 02:26:12,051
listened,
your father would quit yelling at you.

2739
02:26:12,051 --> 02:26:13,290
You know,
because he's wrong too.

2740
02:26:13,291 --> 02:26:16,230
What the hell does he know?
He knows how to yell at you and tell you

2741
02:26:16,231 --> 02:26:18,330
how you're wrong,
and he's throwing things out.

2742
02:26:18,331 --> 02:26:23,331
You add you that are probably not true,
but some of it's true and you know,

2743
02:26:23,851 --> 02:26:25,500
if someone can tell you why you're 
wrong,

2744
02:26:25,501 --> 02:26:29,880
they've given you a great gift because 
then you don't have to be wrong anymore.

2745
02:26:29,881 --> 02:26:31,560
And you might think,
well who cares if you're wrong,

2746
02:26:31,561 --> 02:26:34,470
but you know there's a line in the new 
testament too,

2747
02:26:34,471 --> 02:26:37,770
is if the blind lead the blind,
won't they fall in?

2748
02:26:37,890 --> 02:26:42,890
Won't they fall into a ditch?
And the answer to that question by the 

2749
02:26:42,890 --> 02:26:42,890
way,
is yes,

2750
02:26:42,890 --> 02:26:45,030
they will.
And so the reason that you want to think

2751
02:26:45,031 --> 02:26:46,950
is because thinking is how you.

2752
02:26:47,890 --> 02:26:52,890
It like when you think you created a 
fictional world that's,

2753
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:58,110
that's an analog of the world.
And then you make an Avatar of yourself 

2754
02:26:58,110 --> 02:26:58,850
to act in that world.
And then if the Avatar dies,

2755
02:26:58,851 --> 02:27:01,010
you don't act out those actions.
Right?

2756
02:27:01,460 --> 02:27:04,340
Well,
so if you think properly,

2757
02:27:04,910 --> 02:27:08,540
then you don't have to suffer and die.
And so if you can say what you think and

2758
02:27:08,541 --> 02:27:13,541
people can tell you why you're wrong and
you know to say what you think under 

2759
02:27:13,541 --> 02:27:15,680
extreme circumstances means that you're 
going to say things that no one wants to

2760
02:27:15,681 --> 02:27:18,080
hear because those are the things you 
don't know about.

2761
02:27:18,081 --> 02:27:20,760
Those are the things that are 
conflictual and difficult it,

2762
02:27:20,770 --> 02:27:22,400
those are going to be hard 
conversations,

2763
02:27:22,401 --> 02:27:27,401
man.
And you're going to be wrong about them 

2764
02:27:27,401 --> 02:27:27,401
a lot.
If you don't get to stumble forward with

2765
02:27:27,401 --> 02:27:30,230
your stupidity,
then you can't be corrected.

2766
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:35,920
And so,
so there is no distinction between free 

2767
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:38,771
speech and thinking and there's no 
distinction between thinking and 

2768
02:27:38,771 --> 02:27:41,771
thriving.
And so those who want to inhibit free 

2769
02:27:41,771 --> 02:27:44,291
speech do not wish for people to thrive.
And I believe that.

2770
02:27:45,810 --> 02:27:46,350
So

2771
02:27:48,860 --> 02:27:51,170
thinking does not happen inside your 
head.

2772
02:27:51,860 --> 02:27:53,510
That's the only the beginnings of 
thinking.

2773
02:27:53,660 --> 02:27:56,390
And it's this,
that we're doing here that's thinking,

2774
02:27:56,420 --> 02:27:59,660
you know,
so we have to protect that.

2775
02:27:59,930 --> 02:28:02,870
Psychopaths,
I don't,

2776
02:28:04,180 --> 02:28:06,280
I say this,
I hope non naively

2777
02:28:07,290 --> 02:28:12,290
also having dealt with psychopaths in my
clinical practice and I would say now 

2778
02:28:12,290 --> 02:28:15,000
and then in my life,
I don't believe in psychopaths.

2779
02:28:16,350 --> 02:28:20,760
I don't believe that we know enough to 
say there are people born without,

2780
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:27,250
um,
I don't think the psychometric 

2781
02:28:27,250 --> 02:28:28,340
measurement of psychopathy is everything
that it should be.

2782
02:28:28,580 --> 02:28:31,250
I've been trying to model it in the big 
five domain.

2783
02:28:31,251 --> 02:28:35,210
I think now it's complicated because.
So I would say a psychopath,

2784
02:28:35,211 --> 02:28:37,340
a classic psychopath is likely 
extroverted,

2785
02:28:37,341 --> 02:28:42,341
especially assertive,
disagreeable and unconscientious and 

2786
02:28:42,341 --> 02:28:45,710
maybe extremely low in neuroticism,
so you can't frighten them.

2787
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:51,400
But.
So that's a rare combination because 

2788
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:51,400
it's extreme on many traits,
right?

2789
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:56,560
But that,
I don't believe that that means that 

2790
02:28:56,560 --> 02:28:59,231
someone with that personality 
configuration is doomed from birth to a 

2791
02:28:59,231 --> 02:29:02,030
pathological existence because there's 
things about psychopathy that,

2792
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:05,150
that the,
that the classifiers,

2793
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:10,180
those who claim like clinically that the
psychopath is born in some sense can't 

2794
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:10,700
explain.
It's like,

2795
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:13,490
well,
what about the cruelty?

2796
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:16,800
It seems to be a motive there,
you know,

2797
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:19,570
with are passionless and they lack,
they lack emotion.

2798
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:24,580
Well,
why are they cruel then for 

2799
02:29:24,580 --> 02:29:24,770
entertainment?
Well,

2800
02:29:25,330 --> 02:29:28,160
but then you have to explain the 
entertainment motivation.

2801
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:33,520
Like there's a failure in some sense 
with the classic psychopathy theorists 

2802
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:34,850
to come to grips with the problem of 
malevolence.

2803
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:38,810
It's skirted over and you can't do that 
if you're talking about psychopathy,

2804
02:29:38,811 --> 02:29:40,910
it's like malevolence is the bloody 
issue here,

2805
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:41,900
and so

2806
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:46,830
the other issue with this psychopath is 
that he's irredeemable,

2807
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:47,970
right?
That's the idea.

2808
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:53,810
I don't think we know enough to make 
such claims now and that doesn't.

2809
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:59,040
I know the psychopathy literature quite 
well and I have great respect for their 

2810
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:00,410
primary research is in the field.
I want to make that perfectly clear,

2811
02:30:00,710 --> 02:30:02,690
but we're talking at a different.
We're talking,

2812
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:05,750
we're approaching the problem from a 
different level of analysis here.

2813
02:30:05,751 --> 02:30:10,751
Something like a spiritual level of 
analysis and I don't think that there's 

2814
02:30:10,751 --> 02:30:14,411
an easy easy translation from the 
descriptive psychometric psychiatric 

2815
02:30:14,411 --> 02:30:19,181
approach to the spiritual level.
They don't match and I'm more likely to 

2816
02:30:20,091 --> 02:30:23,930
say let's not assume the soul is doomed 
from birth.

2817
02:30:24,020 --> 02:30:29,020
Right.
And I'm loath to think that there are 

2818
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:33,341
people born irredeemable.
Although I do think there are 

2819
02:30:33,341 --> 02:30:37,211
irredeemable.
People knew that the death penalty 

2820
02:30:37,211 --> 02:30:37,211
issues.
Interesting in that regard.

2821
02:30:37,211 --> 02:30:42,131
You know,
because I've read a lot about really 

2822
02:30:42,131 --> 02:30:44,531
terrible people and I've also read a lot
about what really terrible people said 

2823
02:30:44,531 --> 02:30:49,481
about themselves and many of them wished
for the death penalty and so it's 

2824
02:30:49,481 --> 02:30:54,281
absolutely clear that there are things 
that you can do that deserved the death 

2825
02:30:54,281 --> 02:30:58,571
penalty,
but that doesn't mean that the state 

2826
02:30:58,571 --> 02:30:58,571
should have the right to impose it.

2827
02:30:58,571 --> 02:31:02,720
That's a different question.
So yeah,

2828
02:31:03,550 --> 02:31:08,550
thank you.

2829
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:14,520
In the previous lecture,
you mentioned the 2008 economic crisis 

2830
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:17,821
and one of the very interesting themes 
that's emerged at many levels be at 

2831
02:31:17,821 --> 02:31:19,090
universities or economic policy is this 
perceived culture war,

2832
02:31:19,230 --> 02:31:24,230
specifically the idea of Mark's versus 
mill and you've criticized postmodern 

2833
02:31:24,230 --> 02:31:26,150
and neo Marxist thought very frequently.
One interesting critic of,

2834
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:27,780
uh,
policies of the EU,

2835
02:31:27,781 --> 02:31:29,700
specifically ECB,
ECB,

2836
02:31:29,701 --> 02:31:32,910
and IMF during the Greek debt crisis was
Yanis Varoufakis,

2837
02:31:32,911 --> 02:31:36,720
the former Greek finance minister and 
his criticism of mill was the,

2838
02:31:36,850 --> 02:31:41,850
was mills alleged contempt for the 
population and verify has comments on 

2839
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:43,920
the type of capitalism that results in 
too big to fail.

2840
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:46,470
He described themselves as an erratic 
Marxist.

2841
02:31:46,530 --> 02:31:51,530
To me personally is an example of 
someone whose position on the 

2842
02:31:51,530 --> 02:31:53,250
philosophical moring of policy is 
interesting to compare and contrast with

2843
02:31:53,251 --> 02:31:55,890
yours.
He's certainly not your typical Marxist,

2844
02:31:55,891 --> 02:32:00,891
so postmodernist,
even though I'm not really sure what 

2845
02:32:00,891 --> 02:32:02,481
that means,
but if you look at his work during the 

2846
02:32:02,481 --> 02:32:02,481
Greek debt crisis and his current work 
with [inaudible],

2847
02:32:02,481 --> 02:32:05,760
he seems to be well reasoned,
well positioned and and articulate.

2848
02:32:05,790 --> 02:32:10,790
Now I wanted to know if you had an 
opinion on that type of criticism of 

2849
02:32:10,790 --> 02:32:11,730
mill or is taking of a position as an 
erratic Marxist.

2850
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:17,210
Okay.
I would say I would say no to the 

2851
02:32:17,210 --> 02:32:22,041
specifics of the question.
I don't think that I have that detailed 

2852
02:32:22,291 --> 02:32:27,291
expertise in order to answer the 
question at the level of analysis that 

2853
02:32:27,291 --> 02:32:28,740
you were.
You formulated it,

2854
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:34,640
but I.
I have something to say that's more 

2855
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:34,640
general about the set of phenomena that 
you described.

2856
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:40,010
There is no doubt that distribution is a
major problem that capitalism contends 

2857
02:32:41,221 --> 02:32:46,221
with imperfectly at best and the 
distribution problem is the prieto 

2858
02:32:47,101 --> 02:32:50,160
distribution problem right in,
and something that marks commented on,

2859
02:32:50,161 --> 02:32:55,161
which mostly in the monetary sphere is 
that money tends to accumulate in the 

2860
02:32:55,161 --> 02:32:57,300
hands of very few people.
It's like there's no doubt about that.

2861
02:32:57,360 --> 02:32:59,190
Now,
as we've discussed before,

2862
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:04,230
the people in whom hands the money 
accumulates do turnover more than people

2863
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:06,510
think,
especially in,

2864
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:11,560
in,
in countries that are functioning 

2865
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:14,300
reasonably well.
And it's really important that that 

2866
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:14,300
happens.

2867
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:14,300
Yes,
yes,

2868
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:15,840
yes.
But that doesn't,

2869
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:21,920
that doesn't solve the problem of the 
fact that produced goods gravitate 

2870
02:33:23,821 --> 02:33:28,821
towards an extreme minority.
Now there are also produced often by 

2871
02:33:28,821 --> 02:33:28,860
extreme minority,
which is also a problem.

2872
02:33:29,530 --> 02:33:34,530
Um,
I would say then that the idea that 

2873
02:33:34,891 --> 02:33:39,891
capitalism is more prone to that 
distribution problem than any other 

2874
02:33:40,981 --> 02:33:45,981
system,
I don't believe that to have been 

2875
02:33:45,981 --> 02:33:48,771
demonstrated at all.
And I think that capitalism is actually 

2876
02:33:48,771 --> 02:33:51,480
pretty good at self destruction except 
when that's interfered with.

2877
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:56,870
And I think that's particularly the case
in the United States were generally the 

2878
02:33:56,911 --> 02:34:00,960
policy has been,
if you're an idol with feet of clay,

2879
02:34:00,961 --> 02:34:03,870
no matter how big you are,
you get to fail now.

2880
02:34:03,871 --> 02:34:08,871
That's been compromised severely in the 
last 20 years and we're probably going 

2881
02:34:10,591 --> 02:34:15,591
to pay for that.
I think they really paid for that in 

2882
02:34:15,591 --> 02:34:15,591
Japan,
right?

2883
02:34:15,591 --> 02:34:19,870
Where there was every attempt to prop 
out the gods that should have died.

2884
02:34:20,590 --> 02:34:21,160
So.

2885
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:27,070
So fair enough for the critique of 
capitalism.

2886
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:32,560
That's not the issue.
The issue is do you have a better idea?

2887
02:34:33,190 --> 02:34:37,000
And if the idea is well,
we could kind of do it,

2888
02:34:37,001 --> 02:34:42,001
mark suggested,
then you don't get to have that position

2889
02:34:42,820 --> 02:34:47,710
and claim.
What should I say?

2890
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I haven't seen any evidence that systems
predicated on that set of axioms have 

2891
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:58,741
done anything but more harm than good.
And when will you be announcing the 

2892
02:34:59,291 --> 02:35:00,850
monthly extension to this?
The series?

2893
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:04,870
As soon as I find out whether or not I 
can rent this theater in the fall.

2894
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:05,990
Yeah,

2895
02:35:07,490 --> 02:35:09,710
thank you.
We'll see you next week.
