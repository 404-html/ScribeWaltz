1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,490
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,680
I'm really looking forward to this 
lecture,

3
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:13,930
not like I wasn't looking forward to the
other ones,

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,990
but the stories that I want to cover 
tonight,

5
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:21,991
I.
One of the things that just absolutely 

6
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:21,991
staggers me about them,
especially the story of Cain and Abel,

7
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:24,280
which I hope to get to is like,
it's so short.

8
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:25,780
It's unbelievable.
It's like 10,

9
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:30,781
11 lines.
There's nothing to it at all and I've 

10
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,451
found that it's essentially 
inexhaustible in its capacity to reveal 

11
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,960
meaning and I don't exactly know what to
make of that.

12
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:36,040
I mean I do.
I think,

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,090
you know,
because I said I was going to take as 

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,260
rational approach to this issue as I 
possibly could.

15
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:46,261
I think it has something to do with this
intense process of condensation across 

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,250
very long periods of time.
That's the simplest explanation,

17
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:50,410
but I'll tell you the information in 
there,

18
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:52,240
it's so densely packed that it really 
is.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,720
It's really,
it's not that easy to come up with an 

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,270
explanation for that.
Not one that I find compelling.

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,970
I mean,
I do think that the really old stories,

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,050
and we've been covering the really 
archaic stories in the Bible so far,

23
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,710
I think that one of the things that you 
can be virtually certain about is that 

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,260
everything about them that was memorable
was remembered,

25
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,790
right?
And so in some sense,

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,090
and this is kind of like the idea of 
Richard Dawkins ideas of means,

27
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:17,980
which is often why I thought that 
Richard Dawkins,

28
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,860
he was a little bit more,
uh,

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,180
mystically inclined,
he would have become Carl you because 

30
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,180
there are theories are unbelievably 
similar.

31
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,910
The similar of meme in the similar of 
the idea of archetypes of the collective

32
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:32,911
unconscious are very,
very similar ideas except the union 

33
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:34,540
ideas far more profound in my 
estimation.

34
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,020
Well,
it,

35
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:35,630
it just is.

36
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,350
He thought it through so much better,
you know,

37
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,820
um,
because darkens,

38
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:42,310
tended to think of me.
Ms Dot is sort of like a mind where,

39
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,590
you know,
something that would infest the mind and

40
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:46,630
maybe multiple minds,
but he never really took.

41
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,840
I don't think he really ever took the 
idea with the seriousness that deserved.

42
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:54,841
And I did hear him actually make a joke 
with Sam Harris the last time they 

43
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:56,220
talked about the fact that,
that,

44
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,280
uh,
there was some possibility that the,

45
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,670
the production of meme say religious 
means could alter evolutionary history 

46
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,230
and they both avoided that topic 
instantly.

47
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:10,231
They had a big laugh about it.
Men decided they weren't going to go 

48
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:10,231
down that road.
And so that wasn't fair.

49
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,320
That was quite interesting to me.
But,

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,510
um,
these,

51
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,190
these,
the,

52
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,910
the,
the,

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,670
the density of these stories I do really
think still is a,

54
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,510
is a mystery.

55
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,930
It's,
it certainly has something to do with 

56
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,851
their absolute.
They're in the impossibility to be 

57
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:26,851
forgotten,
you know?

58
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:29,080
And that's actually something that could
be tested empirically.

59
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:32,710
I don't know if anybody has ever done 
that because you could tell naive people

60
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,090
to stories,
even equal length,

61
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:39,091
right?
One that had an archetypal team and the 

62
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:39,091
other that didn't.
And then wait three months and see which

63
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:41,470
ones people remembered better be.
It'd be relatively straightforward thing

64
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:43,300
to test.
I haven't tested it,

65
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,400
but maybe I will at some point.
But anyways,

66
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,550
that's all to say that I'm very excited 
about this lecture because I get an 

67
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:56,251
opportunity to go over to the story of 
Adam and eve and the story of Cain and 

68
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,071
Abel and I hope we manage both of those 
today and maybe we'll get to the story 

69
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:00,220
of Noah and the Tower of Babel as.
But I wouldn't count on it.

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,610
Not at the rate we'd been.
Not at the rate we'd been progressing,

71
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,320
but that's okay.
That's no problem.

72
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,540
It's,
there is no sense rushing this.

73
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,460
Alright,
so we're going to go.

74
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,550
Before we go that before we do that,
I want to finish my discussion of the 

75
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,580
idea of the psychological significance 
of the idea of God.

76
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,200
And I've been thinking about this a lot 
more,

77
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,920
you know,
because of course this lecture series 

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:25,920
gives me the opportunity on the 
necessity to continue to think.

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,080
And you know,
it,

80
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,150
it certainly is the case.
So the hypothesis that I've been 

81
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,910
developing with the trinitarian idea,
something like that,

82
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,940
the trinitarian idea is the earliest 
emergence in image of the idea that 

83
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:44,851
there has to be an underlying cognitive 
structure that gives rise to 

84
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:45,160
consciousness as well as consciousness 
itself.

85
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:48,340
And so what I was suggesting was that 
the idea of God,

86
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,740
the father is something akin to the idea
of the,

87
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:54,610
a priority structure that,
that gives rise to consciousness.

88
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,580
That's an inbuilt part of us.
So that's our structure.

89
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,940
You could think about that as something 
that's been produced over a vast 

90
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,911
evolutionary time span.
And I don't think that's completely out 

91
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:05,911
of keeping with the,
with the,

92
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:10,381
uh,
with the ideas that are laid forth in 

93
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:12,871
genesis one,
at least if you think about them from a 

94
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:15,421
metaphorical perspective.
And it's hard to read them literally 

95
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:15,421
because I don't know what,
you know,

96
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,650
there's an emphasis on day and night.
But the idea of day and night as a 24 

97
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,340
hour diurnal,
you know,

98
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,540
a daytime and nighttime interchanges 
with are based on the claw on the 

99
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:32,761
earthly clock.
Seems to be a bit absurd when you first 

100
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:32,761
start to think about the construction of
the cosmos,

101
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:37,741
so just doesn't seem to me that a 
literal interpretation is appropriate 

102
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:38,860
and it's another thing that you might 
not know,

103
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,840
but you know,
many of the early church fathers,

104
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,840
one of them,
origin in particular stated very clearly

105
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:48,841
this was in 300 and that these ancient 
stories were to be taken as as as wise 

106
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:50,320
metaphors and not to be taken.

107
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,440
Literally like the idea that the people 
who established Christianity,

108
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:58,441
for example,
we're all the sorts of people who were 

109
00:04:58,441 --> 00:04:59,560
biblical literalists.
It's just absolutely historically wrong.

110
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,750
I mean some of them were and some of 
them still are.

111
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,780
That's not the point.
Many of them weren't and it's not like 

112
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,230
people who lived 2000 years ago were 
stupid by any stretch of the imagination

113
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:11,620
and so they were perfectly capable of 
understanding what you know,

114
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,200
what constituted something approximating
a metaphor,

115
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,030
and also knew that fiction in some sense
considered as an abstraction,

116
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:21,730
could tell you truths at that nonfiction
wasn't able,

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
wasn't able to get at lest.
You think that fiction is only for 

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
entertainment and I think that's a very,
that's a,

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,740
that's a big mistake to think that.
So.

120
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,570
Alright.
So here we go.

121
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,320
So yeah.
So with regards to the idea of,

122
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,320
of God the father.

123
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,380
So the idea is that in order to make 
sense out of the world,

124
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,490
you have to have an,
a priori cognitive structure.

125
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,040
And that was something that Emmanuel 
Kant,

126
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,570
as I,
as I said last time,

127
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,690
um,
uh,

128
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,450
put forward as an argument against the 
idea that all of the information that we

129
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,050
acquire during our lifetime as a 
consequence of incoming sensor data.

130
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:54,790
And the reason that con objective to 
that,

131
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:59,791
and he was absolutely right about this,
is you can't make sense of sense data 

132
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:04,061
without any prior restructure.
You can't extract from census data the 

133
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:05,810
structure that enables you to make sense
of sense data.

134
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,050
It's not possible.
And that's really been demonstrated,

135
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,290
I would say,
beyond a shadow of a doubt since the 19 

136
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,411
sixties.
And the best demonstration of that was 

137
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,170
actually the initial failure of 
artificial intelligence because when the

138
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:23,171
ai people started promising that we 
would have fully functional autonomous 

139
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:25,550
robots and artificial intelligence back 
in the 19 sixties,

140
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,030
um,
what they didn't understand and what 

141
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,420
stalled them terribly until about the 
early 19 nineties was that it was almost

142
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,570
that the problem of perception was a 
much deeper problem than anybody ever 

143
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:37,570
recognized.

144
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,180
Because like when you look at the world,
you just see,

145
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,710
well look,
there's objects out there.

146
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,900
And by the way,
you don't see objects.

147
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,830
You see tools.
Just so you know,

148
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:45,560
in the neurobiology of that's quite 
clear.

149
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,710
You don't see objects and infer utility.
You see useful things and infer object.

150
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,420
So it's actually the reverse of what 
people generally think.

151
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,720
But the point is,
is that regardless of whether you see 

152
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,790
objects or useful things,
when you look at the world,

153
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,140
you just see it and you think,
well,

154
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,090
seeing as easy because they're,
the things are no,

155
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,790
you have to do is turn your head and 
they appear.

156
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:09,791
And that's just so wrong that it's,
it's almost impossible to overstate the 

157
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:14,240
problem of perception is staggeringly 
difficult and one of the primary reasons

158
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:16,550
that we still don't really have 
autonomous robot,

159
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:21,551
so there were a lot closer to it than we
were in the 19 sixties is because it 

160
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:21,830
turned out that you actually have to 
have an a body.

161
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,590
You have to have a body before you can 
think,

162
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:29,591
and even more importantly,
you have to have a body before you can 

163
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:32,030
see because the act of seeing is 
actually the act of mapping the patterns

164
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,190
of the world onto the patterns of the 
body.

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,210
It's not things are out there.
You see them,

166
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,440
then you think about them,
then you evaluate them.

167
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,570
Then you decide to act on them and then 
you act.

168
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,670
I mean that,
that you could call that a folk idea of 

169
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,930
psychological processing or perception.
It's not.

170
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,600
That is not how it works.
Like your eyes for example,

171
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:55,601
map.
One of the things they do is map right 

172
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:55,601
onto your spinal cord.
For example,

173
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,990
they might write onto your emotional 
system,

174
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,240
so it's actually possible,
for example,

175
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,070
for people to be blind and still be able
to detect facial expressions,

176
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,340
which is to say you can put someone 
who's cortically blind,

177
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,340
so they've had their visual cortex 
destroyed often by a stroke.

178
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,380
They will tell you that they can't see 
anything,

179
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,320
but they can guess which hand you put up
if you ask them to.

180
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,530
And if you flash them pictures of angry 
or fearful faces,

181
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,040
they show skin conductance responses to 
the more emotion laden faces.

182
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:26,000
And it's because imagine that the world 
is made out of patterns which it is.

183
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Now.
Imagine that those patterns are 

184
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,280
transmitted to you electromagnetically 
you'd have through light.

185
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,561
And then imagine that the pattern is 
duplicated on the retina and then that 

186
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:36,140
pattern is propagated along the optic 
nerve.

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,840
And then the pattern is distributed 
throughout your brain.

188
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,800
And some of that pattern makes up what 
you call it,

189
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:44,720
conscious vision,
but other parts of it just activate your

190
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,310
body.
And so for example,

191
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,470
when I look at this,
when I look at this,

192
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:49,220
uh,
this,

193
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,340
uh,
whatever,

194
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,580
whatever it is,
a battle,

195
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,500
that's the word,
you know,

196
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,230
when I look at it,
especially with intent in mind,

197
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,590
as soon as I look at it,
the pattern of the bottom of the bottle 

198
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,750
activates the gripping mechanism of my 
hand and part of the action of,

199
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,920
or the,
the active perception is to adjust my 

200
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,111
bodily posture,
including my hand grip to be of the 

201
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:15,111
optimal size to pick that up.

202
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:19,760
And it's not that I see the bottle and 
then think about how to move my hand as 

203
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,920
too slow.
It's that I use my motor motor cortex to

204
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:25,410
perceive the bottle.
And that's actually somewhat independent

205
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:28,440
of actually seeing the bottle as a 
conscious experience.

206
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,480
So anyways,
the reason that I'm telling you that,

207
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:38,481
all of that,
and there's much more about that that 

208
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:39,150
can be told Rodney Brooks,
he's someone to know about.

209
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:44,151
He's a robotics engineer who worked in 
the 19 nineties and he invented the 

210
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,600
Roomba among many other things.
So he's a real genius,

211
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:46,740
that guy.
And,

212
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,140
uh,
he brooks was one of the first people to

213
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:51,490
really point out that,
uh,

214
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,910
to have,
to be able to have a,

215
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:58,911
an n,
a machine that perceived well enough to 

216
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:01,851
work in the world that you had to give 
it a body and that the perception would 

217
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,630
actually be built from the body up 
rather than the,

218
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:08,631
from the abstract cognitive perceptions 
down and so well that,

219
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,050
that turned out to be the case.

220
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,050
And Brooks boiled all sorts of weird 
little machines in the 19 nineties that 

221
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,090
didn't even really have any central 
brain,

222
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:20,091
but they could do things like run away 
from light and so they could perceive 

223
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:23,901
light,
but their perception was the act of 

224
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,890
running away from light.
And so perception perception is very,

225
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,440
very,
very tightly tied to action in ways that

226
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,200
people don't normally perceive.
Anyways,

227
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,230
that's all to say that you cannot 
perceive the world without being 

228
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,200
embodied.
And you know,

229
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:42,201
you're embodied in a manner that's taken
you roughly three and a half billion 

230
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:42,201
years to pull off.
Right?

231
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:47,061
There's been a lot of death as a 
prerequisite to the embodied form that 

232
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:51,261
you take.
And so it's taken all that trial and 

233
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:53,811
error to produce something like you that
can interact with the complexity of the 

234
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:57,591
world well enough to last the relatively
poultry 80 or so years that you can 

235
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:57,591
last.

236
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,870
And so I think about that as,
this may be wrong,

237
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:04,890
but I think it's a useful,
at least it's a useful a hypothesis.

238
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:09,891
I think the idea of God the father is 
something like the birth of the idea 

239
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,900
that there has to be an internal 
structure that I would've wished 

240
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,280
consciousness itself arises that gives 
form to things.

241
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:20,940
And well if that's the case and perhaps 
it's not,

242
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,980
but if it's the case,
it's certainly reflection.

243
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,150
It's a reflection of the kind of factual
truth that I've been describing now.

244
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,660
And then like I also mentioned that I 
kind of see the,

245
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,680
the idea of both the Holy Spirit also of
Christ and most specifically of Christ 

246
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,760
in the form of the word as the act of 
consciousness.

247
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:45,351
That that structure produces and uses 
not only to to formulate the world 

248
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:48,790
because we formulate the world,
at least the world that we experience.

249
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,760
We formulate,
but also to change.

250
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:55,761
And modify that world because there's 
absolutely no doubt that we do that 

251
00:11:55,761 --> 00:11:58,120
partly with our bodies which are 
optimally evolved to do that,

252
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:03,121
which is why we have hands on like 
dolphins that have very large brains 

253
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:03,550
like us,
but can't really change the world.

254
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,940
We're really adapted and evolved to 
change the world.

255
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,380
And the world in our speech is really,
uh,

256
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,190
an extension of our ability to use our 
hands.

257
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,310
So the speech systems that we use are 
very well developed motor,

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
a very well developed motor skill and 
generally speaking,

259
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,670
you're your dominant linguistic 
hemisphere,

260
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,560
the same as your dominant hand and 
people talk with their hands like me,

261
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:34,561
he has,
you may have noticed and we use sign 

262
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:35,080
language and there's a tight 
relationship between the use of the hand

263
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:40,081
and the use of language.
And that's partly because language is a 

264
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:40,960
productive force and the hand is part of
it,

265
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,280
part of what changes the world.

266
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,650
And so all those things are tied 
together in a very,

267
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:47,560
very complex way with this a priori 
structure.

268
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:52,561
And also with the embodied structure.
And I also think that's part of the 

269
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:55,921
reason why classical Christianity put 
such an emphasis not only on the 

270
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:58,210
divinity of the spirit,
but also on the divinity of the body,

271
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,970
which is a harder thing to grapple with.
You know,

272
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,660
it's easier for people to think if you 
think in religious terms at all,

273
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:09,661
but you have some sort of transcendent 
spirit that somehow detached from the 

274
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:10,450
body that might have some life after 
death,

275
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:15,451
something like that.
But the Christian Christianity in 

276
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:15,940
particular really insists on the 
divinity of the body.

277
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,390
So the idea is that there's an 
underlying structure that's got this 

278
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,240
clause,
I patriarchal nature,

279
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:27,241
partly because it's for complex reasons,
but partly because it's a reflection of 

280
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,720
the social structure as well as other 
things.

281
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,920
And then that uses consciousness in the 
form particularly of language,

282
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:37,921
but most particularly in the form of 
truthful language in order to produce 

283
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:41,860
the world in a manner that's good.
And I think that's a walloping powerful,

284
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:46,861
powerful idea.
Especially the relationship between the 

285
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:47,500
idea that it's truthful speech that 
gives rise to the good.

286
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,510
Because that's a really fundamental 
moral.

287
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,030
And I think that's a tough one to beat 
man,

288
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,430
because one of the things I've really 
noticed is,

289
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,000
and this isn't just me,
that's for sure,

290
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,740
is that,
you know,

291
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:02,620
there's a lot of tragedy in life.
There is no doubt about that.

292
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,650
And lots of people that I see,
for example in my clinical practice are 

293
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,120
laid low by the tragedy of life.
But I also see very,

294
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:12,730
very frequently that people get tangled 
up in deceit,

295
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,420
in webs of deceit that are often 
multiple generations long.

296
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,670
And that just takes them out,
you know,

297
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:23,671
and so that.
So deceit can produce extraordinary 

298
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:25,090
levels of suffering that,
that last for very,

299
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:28,780
very long periods of time.
And that's really a clinical truism,

300
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,870
you know,
because Freud of course identified one 

301
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,370
of the problems that contributed to the 
suffering we might associate with mental

302
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:37,960
illness,
with repression,

303
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,290
which is kind of like a lie of omission.
That's a perfectly reasonable way to 

304
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,951
think about it.
And you stated straight out that there 

305
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:48,010
was no difference between the 
Psychotherapeutic,

306
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:51,890
the curative psychotherapeutic effort 
and supreme moral effort,

307
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,350
including truth.
That those were the same thing as far as

308
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:59,351
he was concerned and Carl Rogers and 
other great clinician who was at one 

309
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,610
point at Christian missionary before he 
became a more,

310
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,740
more,
more strictly scientific,

311
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,100
he believed that it was in truthful 
dialogue that that,

312
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,780
that a clinical transformation took 
place and you know it,

313
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,280
it,
it,

314
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,580
and of course one of the prerequisites 
for genuine transformation in the 

315
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,610
clinical setting is that the therapist 
tells the truth and the client tells the

316
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:24,611
truth because otherwise,
how in the world do you know what's 

317
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:24,611
going on now?

318
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:27,310
Can you solve a problem when you don't 
even know what the problem is and you 

319
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,010
don't know what the problem is unless 
the person tells you the truth.

320
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,310
That's something really to think about 
in light of your own relationships 

321
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,461
because you know if you don't tell the 
people around you the truth and they 

322
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:36,800
don't know who you are,
and maybe that's a good thing,

323
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,860
you know,
because while seriously people have 

324
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:41,860
reasons to lie,
right?

325
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,611
I mean that aren't trivial,
but it's really worth knowing that you 

326
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,271
can't even get your hands on the problem
unless you formulate it truthfully and 

327
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:49,790
if you can't get your hands on the 
problem,

328
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,640
the probability that you're going to 
solve it is just so low.

329
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And so then I'd been thinking about as 
well the this,

330
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:03,011
this,
and this idea has become more credible 

331
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:03,620
to me.
The longer I've developed it,

332
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,780
the longer I've thought about it,
you know,

333
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:10,450
the idea that there's,
I'll go back.

334
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,180
It's partly the idea that,
well,

335
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,240
let me,
let me figure out how to start this 

336
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,240
property.
Friend of mine,

337
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,290
business partner and guide that I've 
written scientific papers with very 

338
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,591
smart guy.
Took me to task and I think I told you 

339
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:27,890
this a little bit about using the term 
dominance hierarchy,

340
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:33,490
which might be fine for like chimpanzees
and for lobsters and for creatures like 

341
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,190
that,
but not,

342
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,930
not,
not,

343
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,110
not for chimpanzees even so much.
And,

344
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,240
and he said something very interesting.
He thought that the idea of dominance 

345
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,061
hierarchy was actually a projection of 
early 20th century Marxist hypothesis 

346
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,150
onto the animal kingdom that was being 
observed.

347
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,390
And the notion that the hierarchical 
structure that you see that 

348
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:55,390
characterize,
say mating hierarchies in,

349
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,900
in chimps,
for example,

350
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,230
the idea that that was predicated on 
power was actually a projection of a 

351
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,861
kind of political ideology.
And I thought that really bugged me for 

352
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:06,290
a long time when he said that because 
like,

353
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,990
because I agree to be used to using the 
term dominance higher can,

354
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:11,050
I thought he told me all that I thought,
oh,

355
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,900
that's so annoying,
so annoying because it might be right.

356
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,940
And then it took me months to think 
about it.

357
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,150
And then I,
and then I was also reading friends to 

358
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,191
wall at the same time.
And he's a primatologist and also Jaak 

359
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:28,450
Panksepp who was a brilliant,
brilliant affective neuroscientist who 

360
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,271
unfortunately just died.
He wrote a great book called affective 

361
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:31,520
neuroscience.
And for rats to play,

362
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,860
they have to play fair or they won't 
play with each other.

363
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,990
And that's,
that's a staggering discovery,

364
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,120
right?
Because anything that helps,

365
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,400
um,
instantiate the,

366
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,490
uh,
the emergence of ethical behavior in 

367
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,910
animals and that associates it with an 
evolutionary process,

368
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,230
which is essentially what,
what,

369
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,130
what Panksepp was doing gives credence 
to the notion that the ethics that guide

370
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:57,870
us are not mere social logical EPA,
phenomenal constructs.

371
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,400
They're deep,
deeply rooted.

372
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,330
If rats ended their rats for God's sake,
you can't trust them and they still play

373
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,170
fair,
you know,

374
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,530
and the well notice that the chimp 
troops that he studied like that,

375
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,560
it wasn't,
it wasn't the barbaric barbaric chimp 

376
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560
that ruled with an iron fist.

377
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,070
That was the successful ruler because he
kept getting torn to shreds by his,

378
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,830
by the compatriots that he ignored and 
stomped on.

379
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,110
Susie showed some weakness.
They just tear them into pieces.

380
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,140
The chimp leaders that were stable,
you know,

381
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,960
that had a stable kingdom,
let's say.

382
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,080
We're very reciprocal in terms of their 
interactions with their friends and 

383
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,620
chimps have friends and they asked.
They actually last for a very long time.

384
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:39,621
Chimp friendships and they're also very 
reciprocal in the ranch or interactions 

385
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,080
with the females and with the infants.
And I thought that's,

386
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,140
that's a friends to wall is a very smart
guy and I thought that was also 

387
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,751
foundational science because it's really
something to note that the attributes 

388
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:56,121
that give rise to dominance in a male 
dominance hierarchy sort of use that 

389
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:56,490
word,
let's call it authority.

390
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,490
That might be better or even shutter 
competence,

391
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:01,290
which I think is a better way of 
thinking about it,

392
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,160
is that that's not predicated purely on 
anything that's,

393
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,630
that's,
that's as simple as brute power.

394
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,310
And I think too,
you know,

395
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,430
I think as well that the idea,
and this is a deeply devious and 

396
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,680
dangerous political idea in my 
estimation,

397
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,930
the idea that male dominance 
hierarchies,

398
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,990
sorry,
male hierarchies are fundamentally 

399
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,841
predicated on power in a,
in a law abiding in a law abiding 

400
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:23,841
society,
I think is.

401
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,210
I think all you have to do is think 
about that for like a month.

402
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,290
Say she isn't that long.
To understand how observed that is.

403
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,050
Because most people who are in positions
of authority,

404
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:39,051
let's say are just as him then by 
ethical responsibility or even more so 

405
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,910
than people at the other levels of the,
of the hierarchy.

406
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,030
And we know this even in the managerial 
literature because we know generally 

407
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,361
speaking that managers are more stressed
by their subordinates than the 

408
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:51,210
subordinates are stressed by their 
managers.

409
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,580
And that's not surprising.
Yeah,

410
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,350
you want to be responsible for like 200 
people.

411
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,420
You really want that.
That's hard work,

412
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:02,421
man.
And I mean I know it's a pain to have a 

413
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:04,371
boss because you have to care about what
the boss thinks and maybe the person is 

414
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:08,481
arbitrary,
in which case they're not going to be 

415
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:10,311
particularly successful,
but it's no joke to be responsible for 

416
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:13,551
200 people and you have to behave very 
carefully when you're in a position of 

417
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:17,301
responsibility and authority like that 
because you will get called out if you 

418
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:18,090
make mistakes constantly.
So it's not like you're.

419
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,630
It's not like because you have a 
position that's higher up in the 

420
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,710
hierarchy that you're less constrained 
by ethical necessity.

421
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,090
Now,
if you're a psychopath,

422
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:32,091
while that's a whole different story,
but psychopaths have to move pretty 

423
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:32,280
rapidly from hierarchy to hierarchy,
right?

424
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:37,281
Because they get found out quite quickly
and as soon as their reputation is 

425
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:40,761
shattered,
then they can't get away with their 

426
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:40,761
shenanigans anymore.

427
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:44,270
So okay.
So all of this is to say that there is 

428
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,800
something very interesting about the 
pattern of behavior,

429
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,650
so imagine that.
Imagine that sexual selection is working

430
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:54,280
something like this and we know that 
sexual selection is a very,

431
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:55,030
very,
very,

432
00:20:55,031 --> 00:21:00,031
very powerful biological force even 
though biologists ignored it for almost 

433
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,050
a hundred years after Charles Darwin 
originally wrote about it,

434
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,260
thinking mostly about natural selection.
They didn't like the idea of sexual 

435
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,531
selection because it tended to introduce
the notion of mind into the process of 

436
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:12,200
evolution because it deals with choice,
you know,

437
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,820
but so imagine on the one hand that you 
have a male hierarchy.

438
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,120
We know that the men at the top of the 
hierarchy are much more likely to be 

439
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,120
reproductively successful then the men 
at the bottom.

440
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,150
And it's particularly true of men.
So you have twice as many female 

441
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,380
ancestors as you have male ancestors.

442
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,910
Not going to do the math,
but,

443
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,930
and I know it doesn't sound plausible,
but you could look it up and figure it 

444
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,911
out.
It's perfectly reasonable fact that 

445
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:38,071
actually happens to be true.
So there's twice as you have twice as 

446
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:41,191
many female ancestors because females 
are twice as likely on average to leave 

447
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:44,380
offspring as men.
Now what happens is any man,

448
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,410
man who does reproduce,
tends to reproduce more than once,

449
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,620
but a bunch of the reproduce zero.
Whereas so would be the average man who 

450
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,521
reproduces has two children.
And the average man who doesn't 

451
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:59,800
reproduce has zero obviously.
And the average woman who reproduces has

452
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,760
one shop.
So that means that there's twice as many

453
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,580
females in your life as there is males,
so that,

454
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:09,490
that's a big deal.
And so imagine that it works.

455
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:14,020
Something like this.
So the men who elect the dough,

456
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,660
the,
the competent men who were,

457
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:20,300
are admired and who are and who are,
uh,

458
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,620
I can't say dominant,
who are,

459
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,850
who are given positions of authority and
respect,

460
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,870
let's put it that way.

461
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:31,050
And it's like an election now.
It could be an actual democratic 

462
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,471
election,
but it's at least an election of 

463
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,950
consensus or it's at least an election 
of while we're not going to kill him for

464
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:38,050
now,
which is also a form of the election,

465
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:39,560
right?
It's a form of tolerance,

466
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,780
you know,
so,

467
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,900
so,
and then what happens is the women for 

468
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:45,900
their part peel from the top of the male
hierarchy.

469
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,700
And so you've got two factors that are 
driving human sexual selection across 

470
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,681
vast stretches of evolutionary time.
One is the election of men by men to 

471
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:57,400
positions where they're much more likely
to reproduce.

472
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,550
And the second is the tendency of women 
to peel off the top of male dominance 

473
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,541
hierarchies,
which is extraordinarily well 

474
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,131
established cross culturally.
Even if you flat out a socioeconomic 

475
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:13,650
disparity,
say between men and women like they've 

476
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:13,650
done in Scandinavia,
you don't,

477
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:13,650
you don't,
ah,

478
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,550
reduce the tendency of women to peel off
the top of the male hierarchy by much.

479
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,870
And why?
Why would you,

480
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:21,010
I mean,
women are smart.

481
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,350
Why in the world wouldn't they go for 
four?

482
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,380
Why wouldn't they strive to make 
relationships with men who are 

483
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,621
relatively successful?
And why wouldn't they let the men 

484
00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:33,550
themselves define why that,
how that constitutes success.

485
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,060
It makes sense.
Like if you want to figure out who the 

486
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,831
best man is,
why not let the men compete and let the 

487
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:44,551
man,
the man who wins whatever the 

488
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:44,551
competition is,
is the best man by definition.

489
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:47,390
How else would you it?
So okay,

490
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,280
so why am I telling you all that?
Well,

491
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,150
the reason is is because it seems to me 
that there's this comp,

492
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,270
there's been this complex interplay 
across human evolution between the 

493
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,880
election of the male dominance hierarchy
and sexual success.

494
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,860
And that's a big deal.
If it's true,

495
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,330
it could be because what would happen 
you see is that as men evolved,

496
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,800
they would evolve to be better and 
better at climbing up the male hierarchy

497
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,280
because the ones who weren't good at 
that wouldn't reproduce.

498
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:20,000
So obviously that's going to happen.
But then it wouldn't just be a hierarchy

499
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,010
because there's a whole bunch of 
different hierarchies.

500
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,300
And so then you might say,
well,

501
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,060
are there commonalities across 
hierarchies?

502
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,850
That's a reasonable thing to propose it.
I mean,

503
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:30,650
they're not completely opposed to one 
another.

504
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:35,651
At least if you're more successful,
relatively more successful in one 

505
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:37,940
hierarchy,
then you're more probable,

506
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:40,370
it's more probable that you'll be 
successful in another,

507
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,520
and that's actually a really good 
definition of general intelligence or 

508
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,001
Iq.
And that's actually one of the things 

509
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:49,160
that women select men for now.
Men also select women for that,

510
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:51,950
but the selection pressure is even 
higher from women to men.

511
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,540
And General Iq is one of the things that
propels you across dominance hierarchies

512
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,790
because it's a general problem solving 
mechanism.

513
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,030
And the other thing that seems to do 
that to some degree is conscientiousness

514
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:05,120
and there's also some evidence that 
women prefer conscientious men.

515
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,160
So and of course,
why wouldn't they?

516
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:09,140
Because you can trust them and,
and,

517
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,000
and,
and,

518
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:12,170
and they work.
And so those are both good things.

519
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,190
So then you think,
okay,

520
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:17,120
so men have adapted to start to climb 
the male dominance hierarchy,

521
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:22,121
but it's the set of all possible 
hierarchies that they're adapted to 

522
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:22,600
climb.
And so then you think there's,

523
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,720
there's a set of attributes that can be 
acted out that and that can be embodied,

524
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:32,801
that will increase the probability that 
you're going to rise to the top of any 

525
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:33,020
given hierarchy.
And then you could say,

526
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:38,021
well then as you adapt to that fact,
then you start to develop an 

527
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:39,950
understanding of what that pattern 
constitutes.

528
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,160
And so that starts to become the 
abstract representation of something 

529
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,391
like multidimensional competence.
And that's like the abstraction of 

530
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:49,930
virtue itself.
Well the and the,

531
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,840
none of that has been.

532
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,840
None of that's arbitrary now.
Not as bloody well grounded in biology 

533
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,501
as anything could be.
And I think that's a really hard 

534
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:00,020
argument to refute.
And like one of the things I should tell

535
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:02,930
you about how I think is that when I 
think something,

536
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:05,390
I spend a long time trying to figure out
if it's wrong,

537
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,420
you know,
because I like to hack at it from every 

538
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:10,420
possible direction to see if it's a weak
idea.

539
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,161
Because if it's a weak idea then I'd 
rather just dispense with it and find 

540
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:18,281
something better.
And I've had a real hard time trying to 

541
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:18,960
figure out what's wrong with that idea I
had.

542
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,260
It's,
it seems to me that it's pretty damn 

543
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,260
solid.
And then the idea that,

544
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,880
you know,
if you watch what people do in movies 

545
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:29,880
and so on,
and when they're reading fiction,

546
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,460
it's obvious that they're very good at 
identifying both the hero and the anti 

547
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:33,460
hero.

548
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,700
We could say the Antihero,
generally speaking,

549
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:37,640
the bad guy is someone who strives for,
for,

550
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,270
for authority and position but fails 
generally speaking,

551
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,690
not always,
but sales.

552
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,250
So he's a good,
bad example.

553
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,100
A kid,
you take a kid to a,

554
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,990
a good guy,
bad guy movie the kid figures out pretty

555
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:51,390
fast that he's not supposed to be the 
bad guy and,

556
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,930
and fingers out very quickly to zero in 
on the good guy.

557
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:00,140
And that means that there's,
there's an affinity between the pattern 

558
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,861
of good guy that's being played out in 
the fiction and the perceptual capacity 

559
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:04,320
of the child.
You know,

560
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,450
and one of the things I told my son when
he was a kid,

561
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,660
I used to take them to movies that were 
sometimes more frightening than they 

562
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,661
should've been,
but one of the things I always told him 

563
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:17,661
was I'd never said,
don't be afraid because I think that's 

564
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:17,661
bad advice for kids.

565
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:19,200
What I said was,
keep your eye on the hero,

566
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,480
right?
Keep your eye on the hero.

567
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,320
And the Nike was gripped by the movie 
and often quite afraid of them,

568
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:27,110
you know,
because movies can be very frightened.

569
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,890
So he just like zero in on that guy and 
helping him.

570
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,910
Do you know what it's like in a movie?
You hope that the good guy wins 

571
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:34,910
generally speaking.
And I mean,

572
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,450
why do you do that?
Where does that,

573
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,380
where does that come from?
You see how deeply rooted that is inside

574
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,600
you.
You're bloody well go line up and pay to

575
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:45,870
watch that happen.
It's not an easy thing to understand and

576
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:50,871
it's,
it's so self evident to people that we 

577
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:50,871
don't even notice that.
It's a tremendous mystery.

578
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And so why is it so unreasonable to 
think that we would have actually over 

579
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,170
the millennia come to some sort of 
collective conclusion about what the 

580
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,611
best of the best guys are,
best of the good guys are and what the 

581
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:05,760
worst of the bad guys are.

582
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,940
And to me architecturally speaking,
thinking of that as the the hostile 

583
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,871
brothers.
So that's Christ and Satan or Cain and 

584
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:14,871
Abel,
for example.

585
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:16,200
Very common mythological motif.
The hostile brothers.

586
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:18,780
It's like those are.
Those are archetypes.

587
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,390
It's like the.
The Satan for example,

588
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:25,200
is by definition the worst that a person
can be.

589
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,410
And Christ by definition,
this is independent of anything but 

590
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,401
conceptualization is by definition the 
best that a that a man can be.

591
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,410
Now,
as I said,

592
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm speaking psychologically and 
conceptually,

593
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:44,301
but given our capacity for imagination 
and our ability to engage in fiction and

594
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:49,180
our love for fiction and our capacity to
dramatize and our love for the story,

595
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:52,740
stories of heroism and catastrophe and 
good and evil,

596
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:56,490
I can't see how it could be any other 
way like so.

597
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,210
Well,
so.

598
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:02,390
So that's part of the idea that's 
driving the notion of the evolution of 

599
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,350
the idea of God and even more 
specifically,

600
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:07,680
he driving the evolution of the idea,
at least in part of the trinity.

601
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,980
So God is an abstracted ideal,
formulated in large part to dissociate 

602
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:17,280
the ideal from any particular 
incarnation or man or any ruler.

603
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:19,830
And there's another rule in the biblical
stories,

604
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,280
which is that when the actual ruler,
I mentioned this before,

605
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:28,281
when the actual ruler becomes confused 
with the abstracted ideal than the state

606
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:32,040
immediately turns into a tyranny and the
whole bloody thing collapses.

607
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,860
So the idea is so sophisticated,
you don't.

608
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:37,920
One of the things that we figured out,
and this was a hard thing to figure out,

609
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:42,921
was that you had to take the abstraction
and divorce it from any particular power

610
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:49,171
structure and then think about it as 
something that existed as an 

611
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:49,810
abstraction,
but a real thing,

612
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,840
right?
Real limited governed your behavior it 

613
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,480
in everyone's behavior,
including the damn king.

614
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,980
The king was responsible to the abstract
ideal man.

615
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,620
That's an impossible.
That is such an impossible ideal.

616
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,250
If you know,
why would,

617
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,350
if they agreed to that 5,000
years ago,

618
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,650
but one of the things that you see 
continually happening in the old 

619
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:10,650
testament is that as soon as the 
Israelite,

620
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,980
for example,
the Israelite Kings Become Almighty,

621
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,780
the rear guard comes along,
it just cuts them into pieces and then 

622
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,030
the whole bloody stayed,
falls apart for hundreds of years.

623
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,100
So like,
I think that's a lesson that,

624
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,750
that we have not thoroughly,
consciously yet learn.

625
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,780
It's still implicit in the narratives.
We still haven't figured out why that's 

626
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:33,780
the case.
Again,

627
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,890
I think that's a real hard argument to,
to,

628
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:37,600
uh,
to dispense with.

629
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,450
So.
All right,

630
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,940
so we looked at this a little bit.
The trinitarian idea is that there's a,

631
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,500
there's a,
a father,

632
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,400
uh,
that's maybe the,

633
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:50,020
the,
the,

634
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:55,021
uh,
the dramatic representation of the 

635
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,331
structures that underlie consciousness,
the embodied structures that underlie 

636
00:30:57,331 --> 00:31:00,460
consciousness.
And then there's the sun and that's 

637
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:00,460
that.

638
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,930
That's consciousness,
but in its particular historical form,

639
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:04,270
that's the thing that's so interesting 
about the figure of the sun.

640
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,570
And then there's consciousness as such.
And that seems to be something like the 

641
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,780
indwelling spirit had.
So I'm mean,

642
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:12,820
these psychological ideas came from 
somewhere,

643
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:17,821
right,
that they have a history they didn't 

644
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:17,821
just spring out of nowhere and they 
emerged from,

645
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:22,020
from dreams and hypothesis and artistic 
visions and all of that over a long 

646
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,071
time.
And maybe they get clarified into 

647
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:27,430
something like consciousness.
But it takes a long time to get from,

648
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,310
to get from watching,
you know,

649
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,800
from two chimpanzees watching each other
to a human being saying,

650
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:36,280
well,
we're,

651
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,310
we all,
we all exhibit this faculty called 

652
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,310
consciousness.
I mean,

653
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,500
man,
that's a long journey.

654
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,150
You know,
that's a really long journey and there's

655
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:48,151
going to be plenty of stages in between.
One of the things I really like about 

656
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:49,390
John Piaget,
the developmental psychologist,

657
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:54,391
was that he was so insistent that 
children act out and dramatize ideas 

658
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:56,380
before they understand them.

659
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,570
And,
and I,

660
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,730
and Merlin Donald who is a psychologist 
at Queen's university,

661
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:03,820
wrote a couple of interesting books 
along those lines at all as well.

662
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:08,821
Looking at the importance of invitation 
for the development of higher cognition 

663
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:12,031
and human beings.
And so the notion that we embody ideas 

664
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:14,410
before we abstract them out and then 
represent them in an articulated way,

665
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:19,411
I think is an extraordinarily solid idea
and I really can't see how it could be 

666
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:20,290
any other way.
And if you watch children,

667
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:25,291
you see that like think about what a 
child is doing when he plays house or 

668
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,970
she plays house,
you know the,

669
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,630
the,
the,

670
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:30,100
the child acts out the father or the 
mother.

671
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,230
But what's so interesting about new 
think,

672
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:33,940
well look,
isn't that cute?

673
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:35,590
She's imitating her mother.
It's like,

674
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:36,640
no,
she's not.

675
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,460
That's not what happens because when 
you're a child imitates you,

676
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:44,480
it's very annoying because you move your
arm and then they move their arm and you

677
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:46,490
know that you move your head,
the copy you.

678
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,910
No one likes that.
It's direct direct invitation.

679
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,680
That's not what a child is doing.
When the child is playing,

680
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
what the child is doing is watching the 
mother over multiple instantiations and 

681
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:04,721
then extracting out the spirit called 
mother and that's whatever his mother 

682
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:07,550
like across all those multiple 
manifestations.

683
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,730
And then laying out that pattern 
internally and manifesting itself in an 

684
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,080
abstract world,
it's so sophisticated,

685
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:20,081
it's just I'm,
that's what you're doing when you're 

686
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:20,360
playing house or having a tea partier or
taking care of a doll.

687
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,510
It's not like you've seen your mother 
take care of a doll,

688
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,750
you haven't seen that.
It's that you're smart enough to pull 

689
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,961
out the abstraction and then embody it.
And certainly the child is attempting to

690
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:34,370
strive towards an ideal at that point,
you know,

691
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:37,120
she's not lighting her doll on fire,
you know,

692
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:42,130
or well with certain exceptions,
but generally ones that we try to not 

693
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:43,910
encourage.

694
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,170
Right?
So,

695
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,630
so you see that capacity and,
and children and,

696
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:50,990
and it's something we also know that if 
children don't,

697
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:56,020
don't engage in that sort of dramatic 
and pretend play to a tremendous degree 

698
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,610
that they don't,
they don't get properly socialized.

699
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:03,611
It's really a critical element of,
of developing self understanding and 

700
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:06,560
then also developing the capability of,
of being with others.

701
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:09,680
Because what you do when you're a child,
especially around the age of four,

702
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:15,010
you jointly construct a shared fictional
world will play host together,

703
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:18,930
let's say.
And then you act out your,

704
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,560
your joint rules within that shared 
fictional world,

705
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,010
you know,
and,

706
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,860
and that's a form of eggs at a very 
advanced cognition.

707
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:28,250
It's very sophisticated and I see that 
and Piaget did as well.

708
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:31,570
And so did you and sorted Freud,
these brilliant observers and,

709
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,670
and also Merlin Donald,
these brilliant observers of the manner 

710
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,661
in which condition came to be,
they noted very clearly that embodied 

711
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:44,741
imitation and dramatic abstraction 
constituted the ground out of which 

712
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:47,150
higher abstract cognition emerged.

713
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:52,390
And how could it not be,
because obviously we were mostly bodies 

714
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:57,101
before we were mines clearly.
And so we were acting out things way 

715
00:34:57,101 --> 00:35:01,571
before we understood them.
Just like the chimpanzees act out the 

716
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:05,021
idea that you know,
you have to act reasonably sensibly if 

717
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,390
your head chimpanzee or you're going to 
get yourself rip,

718
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,960
rip apart.
And you see that role.

719
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,120
Because when wolves have a dominance 
dispute,

720
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,520
you know,
they puff up their hair at each other to

721
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:16,430
look big and they growl and bark and 
they,

722
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,690
you know,
they're very menacing.

723
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:20,720
And one wolf chickens out,
rules over puts up his neck.

724
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,610
And basically what he's saying is,
yeah,

725
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:24,860
I'm pretty useless so you can kill me if
I want to,

726
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,130
if you want to.
And the other wolf says,

727
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,750
yeah,
you know,

728
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,550
you're pretty useless and I could tear 
out your throat,

729
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:33,710
but tomorrow we might need to bring down
a wolf so,

730
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,470
or a moose,
so I'll keep you out.

731
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,120
And it's sort of like they think that 
because they don't know,

732
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,150
they don't think that they acted out as 
a behavioral pattern.

733
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,160
Then if you're an anthropologist and 
aura,

734
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,430
I'm not an ecologist and you went and 
watched the wolves,

735
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:54,840
you'd say it's as if they were acting 
according to the following rule.

736
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,910
And that often confused me because I 
thought,

737
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:57,510
well,
the wolves,

738
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,750
wolves act out rules.
And I thought,

739
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:01,110
no,
no,

740
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:06,111
no.
A rule is what we construct when we 

741
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:07,320
articulate a behavioral pattern,
right?

742
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:10,470
We observe a stable behavioral pattern 
and when we articulate it,

743
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:12,450
we can call it a rule,
but for the walls,

744
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:15,630
it's not a rule,
it's just a stable behavioral pattern.

745
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,680
And so we acted like wolf troops or 
chimpanzee troops,

746
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,890
all of that as well.
And for for untold,

747
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:27,240
really untold tens and perhaps hundreds 
of millions of years before we were able

748
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:32,241
to formulate that pattern of behavior in
anything approximating a story or an 

749
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:36,030
image and an even longer before we could
articulate it as a set of,

750
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,900
of,
of,

751
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,300
of,
of ethical rules.

752
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,220
And I'm dwelling on this.
I know I've repeated this,

753
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:47,230
some of this before,
but it's so important because you know 

754
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,590
there's this tremendous push,
especially from the social,

755
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,740
the social constructionists,
to make the case that ethics is 

756
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,090
arbitrary and ethics or morality is 
relative.

757
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:02,180
There's no fundamental biological 
grounding in relationship to human 

758
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,180
behavior,
especially in the,

759
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,680
in the category of ethics.
And I think that that's.

760
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,520
Well,
first of all,

761
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:10,521
it's dangerous because that means that 
people are anything you want to turn 

762
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,210
them into and you bloody well better be 
careful of people who think that.

763
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,420
And second,
I just think that the evidence that 

764
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,660
that's wrong is so overwhelming that we 
should just stop thinking that way.

765
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,050
I mean the.
And that's partly why I'm also attacking

766
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:27,051
this from an evolutionary perspective.
There's lots of converging lines of 

767
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:28,830
evidence that ethic ethical standards 
of,

768
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:29,450
of,
of,

769
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:34,490
at least of the most of the most crucial
store sort not only evolved but also 

770
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,320
spontaneously reemerge,
for example,

771
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:42,321
in the dramatic play of children.
So we need to take that seriously and 

772
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:46,551
so,
well that's partly what we're doing 

773
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:46,551
here.
Trying to take that seriously.

774
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:46,580
So

775
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,950
okay,
so the idea there,

776
00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:00,070
at least in part was that the father 
employed the sun to generate habitable 

777
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,110
order out of chaos.

778
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:07,450
I also think there might be something 
more approximately true about that as 

779
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:07,610
well too,
because one of the things we do know,

780
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,300
here's something that's cool about men.
Men are much more criminal than women 

781
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:19,390
and that by the way,
that does not look like it's 

782
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:19,390
sociocultural,
partly because it peaks.

783
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,810
When testosterone kicks in around 14,
I could just spikes the hell up and then

784
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,000
it really,
it,

785
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,010
it stays pretty high until about 27.
And so standard peanut logical theory 

786
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,780
for those of you who don't know this,
is that if you have a repeat offender,

787
00:38:32,781 --> 00:38:34,580
you know a guy,
he just won't stop getting in trouble.

788
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,700
He has throw them in prison until he's 
28 and it isn't like you're 

789
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,601
rehabilitating and or anything.
It's like by 28 he's done with his 

790
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:46,651
criminal career because the crime curve 
is peaks at 15 and then falls down 

791
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,010
around 27 or so.

792
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,140
It burns out and that's often,
by the way,

793
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:51,200
that's often,
that's.

794
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,610
That's often when men get married and 
settle down and stabilize.

795
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,880
One of the things that's one of the 
things that's cool about that is the 

796
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,780
creativity curve for men and is almost 
exactly the same thing.

797
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,160
It ramps up when testosterone kicks in 
and then it starts to flatten out around

798
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,580
27 that the curves match very,
very closely so that.

799
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:14,581
So that's quite cool.
At least the creativity element of it 

800
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:18,160
that I'm particularly interested in 
because their creativity is in many ways

801
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,500
had attribute of youth and that's.
Look,

802
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:20,980
I mean

803
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,850
if you look at that sentence and you 
stripped it of its religious context,

804
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:32,510
what you would say is that the older 
people use the younger people to 

805
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,130
generate creative ideas and renew the 
world.

806
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:35,610
It's like,
yeah,

807
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:36,600
that's,
that's what happens.

808
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:41,630
And you know,
we also have no idea how many of the 

809
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,930
things that we discovered or invented as
human beings,

810
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:45,720
we're stumbled across by children and 
adolescents,

811
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,310
you know,
because they're,

812
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,560
well,
they're much more exploratory.

813
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,610
There are less constrained by their,
by their already extend knowledge 

814
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,350
structures and they're less 
conservative.

815
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,740
So yeah,
that seems right to me.

816
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,770
So right in an extraordinarily important
way,

817
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,900
[inaudible].
It also means that if,

818
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:11,930
like if you're an actual father,
one of the things that it means is that 

819
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,410
that's part of what you should be 
encouraging your son to do,

820
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,760
right?
Which is,

821
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:19,500
which is because the role of a father is
to encourage that is clearly the role.

822
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,630
And to encourage just to say,
well go out there,

823
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,900
confront the chaos of,
of the unknown and the chaos that 

824
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,170
underlies everything and grappled with 
it.

825
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,670
You know,
because you can do it.

826
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,330
You're as big as the chaos itself and 
you know,

827
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:37,340
do something useful as a consequence and
make your life better and make everyone 

828
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:37,370
else's life better.
And you know,

829
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,820
you can do it.
And Man,

830
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:41,430
that's the right thing to tell.
That's the right thing to tell.

831
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:45,270
Young men and talking to young women is 
more complicated because they have more,

832
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,300
more let's say,
issues to deal with because their lives 

833
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,140
are more complicated in some ways,
but that's definitely the right thing to

834
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:56,370
be to be telling your,
your son and one of the things that I've

835
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,590
really noticed recently since I've been 
lecturing,

836
00:40:58,591 --> 00:41:00,270
especially in the last seven or eight 
months,

837
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:04,580
most of my audiences being young man and
and I've talked a lot of them too,

838
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,100
a lot.

839
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:10,250
I've talked a lot to them about both 
truth and responsibility and I think 

840
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:14,421
that those,
those are the two things that underlie 

841
00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:16,641
this capacity and it seems to me to be a
tremendous hunger for that idea.

842
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,800
It's not the same idea as rights,
you know,

843
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,110
it's a very different idea.
It's,

844
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,640
it's the counterpart to rights and so 
it's,

845
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,400
you know,
life is hard.

846
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,960
It's chaotic,
it's difficult.

847
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:32,961
It's really definitely a challenge.
And so you can either shrink from that 

848
00:41:32,961 --> 00:41:34,730
and no bloody wonder because you know 
what's going to kill you.

849
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,800
It's not,
it's no joke,

850
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,830
man,
or you can forthrightly confronted and 

851
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:41,830
try to do something about it.
Well,

852
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,180
what's better?
And then you say to the person,

853
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:46,130
look man,
you could do it like that's what a human

854
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:51,131
being is like,
and if you just stood up and get 

855
00:41:51,131 --> 00:41:52,940
yourself together and you'd find out by 
trying that,

856
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:56,050
you can in fact do that.
And I do think that that's,

857
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:01,190
that's a great core religious message as
far as I can tell and I think that's 

858
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,050
deeply embedded in this sort of,
in this sort of idea.

859
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,930
So.
Alright,

860
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:09,970
so this is what I've been telling you.
This is something like how knowledge 

861
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:10,100
itself is generated.

862
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,360
First of all,
there's the unknown as such,

863
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:16,520
and that's really what you don't know 
anything about.

864
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,420
And generally when you encounter that 
you don't encounter it with thought.

865
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,480
You encounter it like this,
right?

866
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,230
And that that's the first representation
of the absolutely unknown.

867
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:32,590
It's something that is beyond your 
comprehension and it's terrifying and 

868
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,440
because it's beyond your comprehension,
you cannot perceive it.

869
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:35,810
You can not understand it,
but you still have to deal with it.

870
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,090
And the way you deal with it is that you
freeze.

871
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,540
That's what the.
That's what a Bassa lisc does say to 

872
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:43,540
the,
to the kids in Harry Potter,

873
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,690
right?
They take a look at it and they freeze.

874
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:50,010
That's the snake,
the terrible snake of chaos that leaves 

875
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:50,600
underneath everything you see that that 
thing freezes you,

876
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,810
and that's because you're a prey animal.
But at the same time it makes you 

877
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:55,810
curious.

878
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,470
And so that's the first level of contact
with the absolute unknown is the 

879
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,010
emotional combination of freezing and 
curiosity.

880
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,890
And that's reflected,
I think in the dragon stories.

881
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:12,070
The dragon is the terrible thing that 
lives underground the hordes gold or 

882
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,070
hoards virgin.
Very,

883
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,570
very strange behavior for a reptile,
as we pointed out before.

884
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,900
But the idea is that it's a symbolic 
representation of the predatory quality 

885
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:25,961
of the unknown,
combined with the capacity of the 

886
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:27,890
unknown to generate nothing but novel 
information.

887
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,950
And it's very.
You can see that as very characteristic 

888
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:32,960
of human beings because we are prey 
animals,

889
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,160
but we're also unbelievably exploratory 
and we're pretty damn good predators.

890
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,440
And we occupied this weird cognitive 
niche.

891
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:44,441
And so one of the things we've learned 
is that if we forthrightly confront the 

892
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:45,680
unknown,
terrifying as it is,

893
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,890
there's a massive prize to be gained 
continually.

894
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,030
And so that seems to be true,
right?

895
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,230
It's true as anything is.
And then I would also say that that 

896
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,181
idea,
now we know that one of the metaphors 

897
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,331
that underlies God's extraction of 
habitable order out of chaos at the 

898
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:08,951
beginning of time is an older idea and 
more archaic idea that God confronted 

899
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:15,011
something like the Leviathan.
That's one of the words for this 

900
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:15,830
serpent,
like chaos creature that's often used in

901
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:20,831
the old testament or the a leviathan and
the Ba,

902
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,010
Bam off.
Yeah,

903
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:27,011
that's the other thing.
And so there's this idea that I think 

904
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:29,420
came probably came from the 
Mesopotamians that the god either in the

905
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:31,890
sunlight aspect or in the farther aspect

906
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,100
is the thing that confronts this 
terrible beast that represents the 

907
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,371
chaotic unknown and cuts it into pieces.
And then sometimes give the body parts 

908
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:45,171
to the populace in order to feed them.
So you can see a hunting metaphor there 

909
00:44:45,171 --> 00:44:45,240
as well.
But it's deeper than that.

910
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,340
And so,
all right,

911
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:52,341
so,
so the first thing is that there's the 

912
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:53,040
absolute unknown and the unknown is what
you do not understand.

913
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:56,640
It's what's beyond the campfire.
Maybe it's what's beyond the tree.

914
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,420
Even more anciently,
you know,

915
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,120
when we,
when we lived in trees,

916
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,420
it's out there,
they were,

917
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,060
you don't know,
and what's out there,

918
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,180
crocodiles and snakes and birds of prey 
and cats and all sorts of things like 

919
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,840
predatory cats and they will eat you,
but there's utility and going out there 

920
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,370
to find out what's there.
Like maybe you go and you don't kill the

921
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:14,670
snake.

922
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:19,670
You killed the damn nest of snakes and 
that makes you pretty popular just as 

923
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,270
you should be,
not accelerates your,

924
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:21,920
your,
uh,

925
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,390
reproductive potential,
let's say.

926
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,760
And we're descended from people who did 
that.

927
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:29,880
And so we have this notion about how the
world is structured,

928
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:32,460
this deeply embedded in our psyche,
like really,

929
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:33,690
really deeply,
way,

930
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:37,530
way down,
way below the surface cognition way down

931
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:42,531
in the limbic system.
And these ancient parts of the brain 

932
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,261
that are like $60,
million years old or 100 million years 

933
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:45,261
old or older than that.
Ancient,

934
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:50,000
ancient brain structures and so the 
first thing we do is we act out our 

935
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,220
encounter with the unknown world and we 
act that out in the same way,

936
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:58,221
in a manner that's analogous to the 
manor that's presented as a description 

937
00:45:58,221 --> 00:45:59,910
of what it is,
but God does at the beginning of time to

938
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:03,580
extract habitable order out of chaos and
and I,

939
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,730
I will tell you about the other part of 
that for now.

940
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:10,970
So you act it out first.
And then the second thing is you watch 

941
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,660
people who acted out and you start to 
make representations of that.

942
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:19,661
That story's right and maybe you admire 
them and then after a long time you 

943
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:21,960
collect a bunch of those stories and 
then you can say what that is.

944
00:46:21,961 --> 00:46:26,961
You can articulate it as a pattern.
And so this is something needs shift 

945
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:30,770
also figured out to begin with because 
prior to Nisha I would say he did so 

946
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,820
many things.
First it was quite remarkable.

947
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,120
You know,
there was an idea that you first think 

948
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,710
and then you act and people like to 
think that,

949
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:43,711
but of course you do it complete bloody 
rubbish because you're in as impulsive 

950
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,661
as you can possibly imagine.
You're always doing things before you 

951
00:46:47,661 --> 00:46:48,150
think and sometimes that's a really good
idea.

952
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,270
So the idea that you see things and then
think and then act,

953
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:52,350
it's like,
really?

954
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,410
No,
I'm sorry I don't do that.

955
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,160
No one I know I know does that.
And they certainly do that.

956
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,750
Don't do that.
When they're emotional,

957
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,220
you know,
you act first.

958
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:07,370
And one of the things that Nisha said 
very clearly was that our ideas emerged 

959
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,500
out of the ground of our action over 
over thousands and thousands of years.

960
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:13,740
And then when philosophers were putting 
forward those ideas,

961
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:17,160
what they were doing wasn't generating 
creative ideas,

962
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:22,161
they were just telling the story of 
humanity and it's already there.

963
00:47:22,471 --> 00:47:27,471
It's already in us.
It's already in our patterns of 

964
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:27,471
behavior.
And,

965
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:30,190
and it strikes me that that's.
Well,

966
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,410
he was a genius and that was one of the 
genius,

967
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,340
one of his

968
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:36,470
many,
many observations of pure genius.

969
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,040
And so you can think about it,
you know,

970
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,050
you can think about it like this too,
is that there's the unknown and then you

971
00:47:42,051 --> 00:47:47,051
act in the face of the unknown and then 
you dream about the action and that's 

972
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:50,210
what you're doing in a movie theater.
And then you speak about it.

973
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,740
And so,
you know,

974
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:53,210
and of course,
once you speak about it,

975
00:47:53,211 --> 00:47:55,970
that effects how you dream and how you 
dream affects how you act.

976
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,270
It's not like the,
all of the causal direction is,

977
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,300
is one way because it's not these things
loop,

978
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:05,450
but it's still from the unknown,
through the body,

979
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,850
through the imagination,
into articulation.

980
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,070
That's the primary mode of the 
generation of,

981
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,420
of wisdom,
let's say.

982
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,630
And you can easily map that onto an 
evolutionary explanation because the 

983
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,390
body comes first,
right?

984
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,640
And they,
the imagination,

985
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:23,120
which is the body in abstraction and 
only then the word.

986
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:28,270
And of course,
that's exactly how things did evolve 

987
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:29,600
because we could imagine things long 
before we could speak,

988
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,490
at least that's the theory.
So,

989
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,120
and I represented that this is a,
uh,

990
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:39,450
a image from my book maps of meaning.
And so,

991
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:44,950
so the idea is that this is the 
fundamental representation of the 

992
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,801
unknown as such,
it's half spirit because it partakes of 

993
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,420
the air like a bird and it's half matter
because it's on the ground like a,

994
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,100
like a,
like a snake.

995
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:58,370
And,
and that's what you think is there when 

996
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:01,641
you don't know what is there.
That's how your body reacts to what's 

997
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:01,641
there.
When you don't know what is there,

998
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:04,320
you know that too.
Because if you're alone at night,

999
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,780
you know,
and maybe you're a little rattled up for

1000
00:49:06,781 --> 00:49:07,410
one reason,
another,

1001
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:12,411
maybe you watched a horror movie and you
know there's some weird noise in the 

1002
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:13,540
other room.
It's dark and you can just try this one.

1003
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,420
So it's like,
so you're on edge,

1004
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:18,690
you think you want to turn the light on 
and go in the room and see,

1005
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,530
don't do that.

1006
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:24,530
Just opened the door a little bit and 
sneak your hand in and just watch what 

1007
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,980
your imagination fills that room with,
right?

1008
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,220
And then,
then you remember what it's like to be 

1009
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:31,220
three years old in bed and afraid of the
dark.

1010
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:36,040
Right?
And I read a good book on dragons 

1011
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,040
lately,
recently that,

1012
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,040
that,
that had a very interesting hypothesis 

1013
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,291
about the bi thought.
One of the things the guy did was a 

1014
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:42,291
track,
I can't remember his name,

1015
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:45,900
unfortunately track how common the image
of the dragon was worldwide.

1016
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:47,790
It's unbelievably what?
Widespread.

1017
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:52,791
It's crazily widespread.
And he thought that this was actually 

1018
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:56,541
the category of a primate Predator and 
the Predator was.

1019
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,650
So Predator is a weird category,
right?

1020
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:04,651
Because like there's,
there's crocodiles in it and there's 

1021
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:04,651
lions and they don't have much in common
except they eat you.

1022
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:07,300
So it's a functional category.
And so this is the,

1023
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,320
this is the images stick representation 
of the functional category of Predator.

1024
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,450
And his Predator theory was,
well,

1025
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:16,570
if you're a monkey than a bird would 
pick you off like an eagle.

1026
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,860
And so that's this.

1027
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:19,560
Right?

1028
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:25,650
And then if it wasn't illegal,
it was a cat because they clump cherry 

1029
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,010
trees and give you a good chomping.
And then if it wasn't a cat,

1030
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,270
you go down to the ground and a snake 
would get you.

1031
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:30,740
Or maybe a snake would climb up the 
tree.

1032
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,420
Cause snakes.
Like do that and get you,

1033
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,600
and so that's a.
that's a tree cat,

1034
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,090
snake,
basically free cap,

1035
00:50:39,091 --> 00:50:40,490
snake bird,
and that's the thing.

1036
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:45,491
You really,
that's the thing you really want to 

1037
00:50:45,491 --> 00:50:47,861
avoid.
You don't want to come across one of 

1038
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:49,541
those and so.
And then the other thing it does is 

1039
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:52,091
breathe fire,
which is quite interesting because 

1040
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,190
obviously fire was both greatest friend 
in greatest enemy of humanity and we've 

1041
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:59,111
mastered fire for a long time.
It might be as long as two or 3 billion 

1042
00:50:59,111 --> 00:51:00,330
years.
That's what Richard Wrangham,

1043
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,320
I think it's rang him.
He wrote a book recently on,

1044
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,850
I think it was random who wrote a book 
on when human beings learn to cook.

1045
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:13,230
That was about 2 million years ago.
And cooking increase the increase the 

1046
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:18,610
availability of calories.
You know how chimpanzees are sort of 

1047
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:18,610
shaped like a big,
like they're ugly.

1048
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,270
They're shaped like a big bowling ball.
You know,

1049
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,340
they're really,
they look really fat and it's.

1050
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:27,580
And they're short and they're wide and 
that's because they have intestinal 

1051
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,031
tracts that are like 300 miles long.
And the reason for that is because they 

1052
00:51:31,031 --> 00:51:33,710
have to digest leaves and so you go out 
in the forest and like sit there and eat

1053
00:51:33,711 --> 00:51:35,840
leaves for a whole day and see how that 
works out for you.

1054
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:38,240
You know,
they have no calories in them.

1055
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,550
So chimps spend to bite,
I think it was,

1056
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:46,930
I think it's eight hours a day chewing 
and it's because what they eat has no 

1057
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:51,701
nutritional value and then they have to 
have this tremendous got to in order to 

1058
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:51,701
extract anything at all out of it.

1059
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,360
And human beings at some point just 
thought,

1060
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:54,890
oh to hell with that,
we'll cook something.

1061
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:57,590
And then we traded our gut for brain,
which,

1062
00:51:57,591 --> 00:51:59,660
you know,
more or less has worked and I think it's

1063
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:03,140
made us a lot more attractive as well.
So.

1064
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:03,680
Okay,
well,

1065
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:08,681
so the idea here was that,
well that's the basic archetype of the 

1066
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:12,461
unknown as such.
And then I liked the St George version 

1067
00:52:12,461 --> 00:52:14,030
of this.
It's so cool because St George,

1068
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:17,180
it lives in a castle and the castle is 
partly falling down.

1069
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:19,610
And it's partly because there's a dragon
that's come up too,

1070
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,760
like it's an eternal dragon.
It's come back to give her two in a 

1071
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,240
rough time,
which always happens because there is an

1072
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,580
eternal dragon is always given,
giving our fallen down,

1073
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:30,680
castle's a rough time.
Oh.

1074
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:36,310
And so then St George is the hero who 
goes out to confront the dragon and he 

1075
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,160
frees the virgin from its grasp.

1076
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,220
And I would say that's a pretty 
straightforward story about the sexual 

1077
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,130
attractiveness of the masculine spirit 
that's willing to forthrightly encounter

1078
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,210
the unknown.
That's.

1079
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:51,230
It looks just straight.
It looks like a straight biological 

1080
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:51,710
representation to be.
And it's a really,

1081
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:53,510
really old story,
right?

1082
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:58,511
It's the oldest written story we have.
And that's basically the Mesopotamian 

1083
00:52:58,511 --> 00:52:58,511
creation myth,
the Enuma Elish,

1084
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:03,371
which,
which basically lays out precisely that 

1085
00:53:03,371 --> 00:53:03,371
story.
And so,

1086
00:53:03,371 --> 00:53:04,130
and it's replayed,
I mean,

1087
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:09,131
I bet you the movie goers among you,
especially the ones that are more 

1088
00:53:09,131 --> 00:53:09,860
attracted to the superhero,
you know,

1089
00:53:09,861 --> 00:53:12,470
they're really flashy,
sort of superhero type movies.

1090
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,940
You've probably seen the St George story
like 150 times in the last 10 years.

1091
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:20,360
You never get tired of it because it's 
the central story of mankind,

1092
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:25,630
so you've got the unknown as such,
and that is what you react to with your 

1093
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:31,011
body.
Then in the existential terror and 

1094
00:53:31,011 --> 00:53:33,861
extraordinary curiosity or gripping you,
and then it's like the unknown unknowns 

1095
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:35,490
that,
uh,

1096
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:39,720
who's the politician under Bush 
Rumsfeld.

1097
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,720
Yeah.
I think the reason that that phrase 

1098
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:44,720
caught on so well is because he nailed 
an archetype.

1099
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,450
There's unknown unknowns and there's 
known unknowns and the unknown unknown.

1100
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,410
And you have to be able to react to an 
unknown unknown because they can get you

1101
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,340
and you can't just plead ignorance 
because then your dad that doesn't work.

1102
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,730
Like human beings are the sort of 
creature who has to know what to do when

1103
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:02,700
they don't know what to do.
And that's very paradoxical.

1104
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:05,340
And what we do is we prepare to do 
everything that's right.

1105
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:07,410
We're on guard.
We prepared to do everything very,

1106
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:10,740
very stressful and,
but also very engaging and very,

1107
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:15,770
very much something that heightened 
consciousness and maybe those circuits 

1108
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,951
are tr permanently turned on in human 
beings because we also know that we're 

1109
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:19,380
going to die and no other animal knows 
that.

1110
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,700
And so sometimes I think that our,
that our stress circuits are just on all

1111
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:28,701
the time and that's part of what 
accounts for our heightened 

1112
00:54:28,701 --> 00:54:28,701
consciousness.

1113
00:54:28,701 --> 00:54:31,140
So you have your unknown unknowns and 
then you have your relatively,

1114
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,470
you have the unknowns that you actually 
encounter in the world,

1115
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,690
like the mystery of your,
of your,

1116
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:39,600
uh,
a romantic partner when you have a fight

1117
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:40,320
with them.
It's like,

1118
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,170
what?
We're having a fight?

1119
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:46,210
Who the hell are you mean you're not the
absolute unknown because I know 

1120
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:50,001
something about you,
but you're the unknown as it's 

1121
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:50,070
manifesting itself to me right now.
Right?

1122
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:50,840
And,
and,

1123
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:54,960
and then there's the known that we 
inhabit and then there's the knower.

1124
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:59,961
And the known is given symbolic 
representation as far as I've been able 

1125
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:02,940
to tell in patriarchal form,
in the form of a male deities.

1126
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,390
And the unknown as you encountered is 
given feminine form,

1127
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,680
so we won't get into that too much,
but if you're interested in that,

1128
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,420
you could look at my maps of meetings,
lectures,

1129
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:13,620
or maybe take a look at the book.

1130
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,630
But I think it's a good.
I think it's a good schema for religious

1131
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:19,430
archetypes.
I've,

1132
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,590
I've worked on a long time.
It seems to fit the union criteria quite

1133
00:55:22,591 --> 00:55:27,591
nicely.
It maps nicely on to Joseph Campbell's 

1134
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:27,591
ideas.
He got almost all his ideas from you,

1135
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,940
however.
Um,

1136
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:35,180
and it also makes sense from a 
biological and evolutionary perspective 

1137
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,810
as far as I can tell that's a lot of 
cross validation,

1138
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,690
at least in my estimation.
So.

1139
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:41,760
Okay.
So back to the hierarchy of dominance.

1140
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:43,530
Well,
let's take a look at it a little bit.

1141
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:48,531
So I'm quite enamored of lobsters as 
some of you might know because I found 

1142
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:52,050
out this just blew me away when I found 
it out.

1143
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:54,900
I mean I've done a lot of work in 
neurochemistry,

1144
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,730
functional neurochemistry,
chemistry,

1145
00:55:56,731 --> 00:56:01,731
because I used to study alcoholism and 
drug abuse and alcoholism to study 

1146
00:56:01,731 --> 00:56:06,441
alcohol.
You have to know a lot about the brain 

1147
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:06,441
because alcohol goes to everywhere in 
the brain.

1148
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:08,340
It affects every neurochemical system 
and so if you're going to study alcohol,

1149
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,550
you kind of have to study neurochemistry
in general,

1150
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:14,380
and so I did that for quite a long time.
I really got a narrative,

1151
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,850
a book called the neuropsychology of 
anxiety by Jeffrey Gray,

1152
00:56:17,851 --> 00:56:21,230
which is an absolute work of genius,
although extraordinary diff like it.

1153
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,290
I don't know how many references that 
book has.

1154
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:28,291
It's like must be a thousand and gray 
actually read them and worse he 

1155
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:33,430
understood them and then he and then he 
integrated them into this book and so to

1156
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:38,431
read it you have to really master 
functional neurochemistry and animal 

1157
00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:42,181
behaviorism and and motivation and 
emotion and neuroanatomy like it's a 

1158
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:42,850
killer book,
but man,

1159
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:47,851
it's really rich and it's taken 
psychologists about 40 years to really 

1160
00:56:47,851 --> 00:56:51,601
unpack that book,
but one of the things I learned about 

1161
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:55,051
that was just exactly how much 
continuity there was in the 

1162
00:56:55,051 --> 00:56:55,570
neurochemistry of human beings and the 
neurochemistry of animals.

1163
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,540
It's absolutely staggering.
It's,

1164
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,760
it's the sort of thing that makes the 
fact of evolution.

1165
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:05,820
Something like self evident.
I do think it's self evident for other 

1166
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:06,610
reasons that I'll,
I'll tell you about later.

1167
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,100
I think evolution or I think natural 
selection,

1168
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:14,610
random mutation and natural selection is
the only way you can solve the problem 

1169
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:19,770
of how to deal with an environment 
that's complex beyond your ability to 

1170
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:23,250
comprehend.
I think what you do is you generate 

1171
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:23,950
endless variants because God only knows 
what the Hell is gonna happen next.

1172
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,540
They own almost all of them die because 
their failures and a couple of propagate

1173
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,120
and you know,
the environment keeps moving around like

1174
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:36,121
a giant snake.
You never know what it's going to do 

1175
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:36,121
next.
And so the best you can do is say,

1176
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:37,990
well,
here's 30 things that might work and you

1177
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:39,700
know,
28 of them are going to perish.

1178
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,380
Or if you're.
Or if you're an insect,

1179
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:43,660
it's like the ratio is way,
way higher than that.

1180
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,830
So anyways,
back to the lobsters and all of these.

1181
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,420
So these creatures engaging in dominance
disputes and,

1182
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:57,470
and I think dominance is the right way 
to think about it because lobsters 

1183
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:57,470
aren't very empathic and they're not 
very social.

1184
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,770
And so it really is the toughest lobster
that wins,

1185
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:05,100
you know,
and what's so cool about the lobster is 

1186
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:05,100
that when,
when a lobster winds,

1187
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:09,870
he flexes and gets bigger,
so he looks bigger because he's a 

1188
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:13,621
winner.
It's like he's advertising that in the 

1189
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:16,080
biological,
the neurochemical system that makes him 

1190
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,210
flex is Sarah to Nirjah and you think,
well,

1191
00:58:16,211 --> 00:58:17,620
who cares?
What the hell does that mean?

1192
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,850
Well,
tell you what it means.

1193
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:22,480
It's the same chemical that's affected 
by antidepressants and human beings.

1194
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:23,980
And so like,
if you're depressed,

1195
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:25,330
you're defeated lobster.

1196
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,360
Like you're like this.
I'm small,

1197
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,120
I'm not,
you know,

1198
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,310
things are dangerous.
I don't want to fight.

1199
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,270
You give someone a united depressants 
like cup,

1200
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,860
they stretch and then they're ready to 
like take on the world again.

1201
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:41,190
Well,
if you give lobsters who just got 

1202
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:41,190
defeated in a fight,
Serotonin,

1203
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:41,950
then they stretch out and they'll fight 
again.

1204
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,330
And that's like we separated from those 
creatures on the evolutionary timescale.

1205
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:50,650
Somewhere between 350 and 600 million 
years ago and the damn neurochemistry is

1206
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:53,980
the same,
and so that's another indication of just

1207
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,430
how important hierarchies of authority 
are.

1208
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:00,160
I mean,
they've been conserved since the time of

1209
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,040
lobsters,
right?

1210
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:05,860
There were trees around with lobsters 
first first manifested themselves on the

1211
00:59:05,861 --> 00:59:10,861
planet.
And so what that means is these 

1212
00:59:10,861 --> 00:59:10,861
hierarchies that I've been talking 
about,

1213
00:59:10,861 --> 00:59:14,940
those things are older than trees.
And so one of the truisms for what 

1214
00:59:15,671 --> 00:59:20,110
constitutes real from a Darwinian 
perspective is that,

1215
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:22,880
which has been around the longest period
of time,

1216
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:23,210
right?

1217
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:26,540
Because it's had the longest period of 
time to exert selection pressure.

1218
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,780
Well,
we know we evolved and lived in trees,

1219
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,120
something on the order of 60 million 
years ago.

1220
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:36,410
We're talking 10 times as far back as 
that for the hierarchy.

1221
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:41,710
And so the idea that human beings that 
the hierarchy is something that has 

1222
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:45,461
exerted selection pressure on human 
beings is I don't think that's a 

1223
00:59:45,461 --> 00:59:47,300
disputable.
That's not a disputable issue.

1224
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,720
How it's done at an exactly what that 
means we can argue about,

1225
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:55,721
but like that sort of biological 
continuity is just absolutely 

1226
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:55,721
unbelievable.
I,

1227
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,940
it was funny because I revealed this 
finding,

1228
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,650
you know,
I didn't discover this,

1229
01:00:00,651 --> 01:00:05,651
I read about it,
but I talked to my graduate students 

1230
01:00:05,651 --> 01:00:05,651
about it.
I used to take them out for breakfast,

1231
01:00:05,651 --> 01:00:06,530
you know,
and they were very contentious,

1232
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:10,100
snappy bunch and uh,
and they're always trying to one up each

1233
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:15,101
other and they were quite witty and for 
like six months until it got very 

1234
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:15,101
annoying.

1235
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:15,560
Every time one of them went up the 
other,

1236
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,810
they'd stretch themselves out,
like snap their hands.

1237
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:20,690
Like.
So that was,

1238
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,940
that was very funny.
It was,

1239
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,800
it was really very funny.
So you'll see this in lobsters.

1240
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:26,930
And so that's pretty amazing.
So,

1241
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,390
you know,
and one of the other thing that's really

1242
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:31,440
cool about lobsters is that,
um,

1243
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,070
let's say you've been like top lobster 
for a long time,

1244
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:37,430
but you're getting kind of old and some 
young lobster just,

1245
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,080
you know,
whales the hell out of you.

1246
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,890
And so you're all depressed,
but thing is your brain is dominant,

1247
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,650
but you don't have much of a brain 
because you're a lobster.

1248
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:48,080
And so now what are you going to do?
Because you just lost.

1249
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:53,260
And the answer is while your brain will 
dissolve and then you'll grow a 

1250
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:54,140
subordinate brain.
Yeah.

1251
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:57,170
And so that's where thinking about too 
right here for a couple of reasons.

1252
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:00,020
First of all,
if any of you who've ever been seriously

1253
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:03,380
defeated in life,
you know what that's like.

1254
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:05,750
It's like it's a death,
a descent,

1255
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,150
a dissolution,
and if you're lucky,

1256
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,120
a regrowth and and maybe not as the same
person,

1257
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:13,550
that's what happens to people with 
posttraumatic stress disorder,

1258
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:18,551
right?
Their brains undergo permanent 

1259
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:20,351
neurological transformation and,
and they then inhabit a world that's 

1260
01:01:20,351 --> 01:01:21,830
much more dangerous than the world that 
they inhabited to begin with.

1261
01:01:21,831 --> 01:01:26,831
But we also know too,
if you have posttraumatic stress 

1262
01:01:26,831 --> 01:01:28,550
disorder or depression,
that your hippocampus shrinks or he dies

1263
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,340
and shrinks and you can sometimes get it
to grow back.

1264
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:36,341
Your hippocampus shrinks and your 
amygdala grows and the Amygdala 

1265
01:01:36,341 --> 01:01:39,970
increases emotional sensitivity and the 
hippocampus inhibits emotional 

1266
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:40,760
sensitivity.
And so if you've been badly defeated,

1267
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:42,830
the hippocampus shrinks and the amygdala
grows.

1268
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,880
Now if you recover,
the hippocampus will regrow.

1269
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,130
And antidepressants actually seemed to 
help that.

1270
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:50,990
But the damn Amygdala never shrinks 
again.

1271
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:56,800
And so well.
So that's another lesson from the 

1272
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:56,800
lobster.
It's quite a terrifying one,

1273
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,890
but,
but it's one like,

1274
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,260
it's so interesting that you can relate 
to that.

1275
01:02:00,261 --> 01:02:05,261
Right now.
It's like I get what that poor 

1276
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:05,261
crustaceans going through.

1277
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:06,000
No.
So,

1278
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,720
okay,
here's the rats and this is from Yak 

1279
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:12,720
Panksepp's work,
right?

1280
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:12,820
He was the first guy who figured out 
that rats giggle

1281
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,580
and you might think,
well,

1282
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:17,110
what kind of stupid thing is that to 
study?

1283
01:02:17,111 --> 01:02:19,980
It's like $50,000
research grant giggling rats,

1284
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:20,690
you know?
And so.

1285
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:25,170
But he discovered the place circuitry 
and mammals.

1286
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,970
That's a big deal,
right?

1287
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:28,560
It's like discovering a whole new 
continent.

1288
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:31,710
There's a place circuit in mammals.
It's built right in.

1289
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:34,110
So it's not socially constructed.
There's a,

1290
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,000
there's a biological platform for that.
And so what?

1291
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:39,180
What,
what panksepp would do with rats,

1292
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:44,420
he found out if rats,
if you take a rat pup away from its 

1293
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:44,420
mother,
it dies.

1294
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,810
Even if you feed it,
even if it keep it warm,

1295
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:48,600
it dies.
Now you can stop it from dying by taking

1296
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:52,560
a pencil with an eraser on the end and 
massaging it right?

1297
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:57,000
Because rats won't live without love and
the same thing happens to human babies,

1298
01:02:57,001 --> 01:03:00,930
and we saw that in Romania when there 
was that catastrophe after Cho Chesko in

1299
01:03:00,931 --> 01:03:05,931
the orphanages were the orphanages were 
full of unwanted babies because 

1300
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:07,320
Ceausescu insisted that every Romanian 
women was constantly pregnant,

1301
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:12,620
so the orphanage just stacked up with 
unwanted babies and lots of them didn't 

1302
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:12,840
even have names and they were 
warehoused.

1303
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,090
Warmth,
shelter,

1304
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,190
food,
devastating.

1305
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:22,280
Lots of them died.
Most of them died before the first year 

1306
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,280
and the ones that didn't die,
we're permanently dysfunctional because 

1307
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,090
you have to be touched.
If you're a human being,

1308
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:29,400
it's not an option you have to be played
with.

1309
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,460
It's not an option.
It's part of neurodevelopmental 

1310
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:34,460
necessity.
And,

1311
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:39,170
and you have to also play fair,
so because otherwise you produce a very 

1312
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:43,730
disjointed child who isn't able to 
engage in the niceties of social 

1313
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,090
interaction,
which is continual play in some sense in

1314
01:03:45,091 --> 01:03:48,150
reciprocity.
So what Panksepp did with his wrath,

1315
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:53,570
he noticed the male rats,
juveniles really liked to wrestle and 

1316
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,220
they wrestle just like humans beings 
wrestle.

1317
01:03:55,221 --> 01:03:57,360
They pin each other for crying out loud.
It's like that,

1318
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,850
that have just lost,
he's down for a 10 count,

1319
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,110
right?
And so,

1320
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,440
so what you do is you take juvenile 
routes and you can find out that they 

1321
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,411
want to play because you can attach a 
spring to them and then they'll try to 

1322
01:04:10,531 --> 01:04:12,930
run and you can measure how hard they're
running by,

1323
01:04:12,931 --> 01:04:17,931
how hard they're pulling on the spring 
and then you can estimate how motivated 

1324
01:04:17,931 --> 01:04:17,931
they are.

1325
01:04:17,931 --> 01:04:21,470
And so you can find out that a nice,
well fed rat who doesn't have anything 

1326
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:24,450
on his mind was still work hard to play 
if it,

1327
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:27,690
to enter an arena where he's been 
allowed to play before,

1328
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,720
he'll work for that.
So that you think while the rats 

1329
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,641
motivated.
So the two rats go out there and they 

1330
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:34,641
play and,
and so they're,

1331
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:37,320
they're playing like dogs play and 
everyone knows what that looks like.

1332
01:04:37,321 --> 01:04:38,360
If you're,
you know,

1333
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:43,370
if you have any sense about dogs that 
kind of go like this and kids do that 

1334
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:47,451
and maybe you do that with your wife if 
you're going to play with her a little 

1335
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:48,390
bit.
My poor wife man,

1336
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,080
when she,
she was,

1337
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:52,910
uh,
she was uh,

1338
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,540
uh,
a young,

1339
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,840
she had older siblings and so she wasn't
played with as much when she was little,

1340
01:04:57,841 --> 01:04:59,280
as she might've been in,
um,

1341
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,400
I used to like,
you know,

1342
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:03,960
if you take a pillow and he'd go like 
this three times,

1343
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:04,970
right.
That means lookout,

1344
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,710
a pillow is coming your way.
So I go one,

1345
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:08,550
two,
three.

1346
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:10,070
Wow.
She,

1347
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:15,130
she looked,
she was completely dismayed at and he's 

1348
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:15,130
like,
what do you do that for?

1349
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:15,130
And I thought,
well,

1350
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,540
I eventually tartar that rule.
The other thing I used to,

1351
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:20,800
yeah,

1352
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,650
the other thing I used to do,
you know,

1353
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:30,770
is sometimes she'd come out and be like 
this when we were playing around and I 

1354
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:34,681
grabbed her wrist and I know Parker her 
hands through her knuckles together and 

1355
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:39,961
she used to just get completely annoyed 
about that and I thought that's what you

1356
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,790
do.
You just open your hands.

1357
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:47,791
While she didn't know that either.
So she hadn't been played with enough 

1358
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:47,791
when she was a little rat.

1359
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:47,850
So

1360
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,450
anyways.
Anyways,

1361
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,870
so you let the wrap the little rats go 
out there.

1362
01:05:54,871 --> 01:05:59,871
Right.
And so let's imagine one of them is 10 

1363
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:01,701
percent bigger than the other,
and so that the 10 percent bigger wins 

1364
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:06,350
because 10 percent is enough in route 
wait to ensure that you're going to be 

1365
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:07,290
the pinner rather than the pity.
Okay?

1366
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,730
So.
So that's fine.

1367
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,670
So when the rat,
the rat pins the pins,

1368
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:15,420
the little route and now the big rat is 
the is the authority rat.

1369
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:18,900
And so then the next time that the rats 
play,

1370
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,390
the little rat has to invite the big rat
to play.

1371
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:24,650
So the big rats out there being cool and
the little rat pops up and you know,

1372
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,460
does the whole will you play with me 
thing?

1373
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,590
And the big rat will deign to play with 
them.

1374
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,920
But if you pair them repeatedly,
unless the big rat lets the little rat 

1375
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,461
win,
30 percent of the time the little rack 

1376
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:37,461
will not invite him to play.

1377
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:38,370
And panksepp discovered that.
It's like,

1378
01:06:38,371 --> 01:06:40,170
I read that.
That just blew me away.

1379
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,690
It's like,
that is so amazing because you see walls

1380
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:48,700
first of there.
There's an analogy to Piaget's ideas 

1381
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,470
about the emergence of morality out of 
play in human beings,

1382
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:54,471
so that was very cool,
but the notion that that was built into 

1383
01:06:54,471 --> 01:06:55,730
rats at the level of wrestling was,
and they're social,

1384
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,210
they're deeply social animals,
right?

1385
01:06:57,211 --> 01:07:02,211
They have to know how to get along with 
one another and most of their authority 

1386
01:07:02,211 --> 01:07:02,850
disputes,
dominance disputes.

1387
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:06,540
You don't want them to end in bloodshed 
and combat because you know,

1388
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:11,541
if you're a rat one and I'm rat to and 
we tear each other just threat shreds 

1389
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:13,410
and the dominance dispute.
Rats three is just going to move in.

1390
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:18,470
It's really not a great strategy and so 
it'd be better if we could settle our 

1391
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:18,690
differences,
you know,

1392
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,760
somewhat peacefully and so.

1393
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:21,660
Wow.
So rats.

1394
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:25,590
Anyways,
panksepp figured out that rats plan,

1395
01:07:25,591 --> 01:07:30,591
not only do they play,
they play fair and they seem to enjoy 

1396
01:07:30,591 --> 01:07:30,591
it.
He also figured out,

1397
01:07:30,591 --> 01:07:32,400
this was really cool too,
that if you give juvenile rats,

1398
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:37,860
attention deficit disorder drugs,
Ritalin suppresses,

1399
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:38,880
pray,
play.

1400
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,640
So that's worth thinking about.
It's like,

1401
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:46,641
well,
why do you have to give juvenile human 

1402
01:07:46,641 --> 01:07:49,200
beings amphetamines in school?
Well,

1403
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,110
because they need to play.
Well you don't,

1404
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,730
you don't get to play.
They don't get to wrestle around.

1405
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:55,770
I mean,
that's oppression as far as I can tell.

1406
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,990
They don't get to wrestle around.
That's fine.

1407
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:59,790
Feed him some amphetamines,
man.

1408
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,680
That'll shut down the old place 
circuits.

1409
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:06,800
Well,
here's the other problem is Panksepp 

1410
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,421
found out that if you don't let juvenile
male rats play their prefrontal cortexes

1411
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,280
don't develop properly.
Surprise,

1412
01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:12,840
surprise.
You're not letting them mature.

1413
01:08:12,841 --> 01:08:14,310
It's like,
what else would you expect?

1414
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:19,310
So you know,
that's something to think about really 

1415
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:19,310
hard.
I would say so.

1416
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,450
Well also there's some wolves going at 
it and we're not exactly.

1417
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:28,570
There are some wolves having authority 
dispute,

1418
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:34,871
but more technically speaking and a lot 
of it's posturing.

1419
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:36,650
You know,
they,

1420
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:38,300
they tend,
they tend not.

1421
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:42,380
Well socialized wolves tend not to hurt 
each other during the authority disputes

1422
01:08:42,381 --> 01:08:47,381
because,
well for obvious reasons it's too 

1423
01:08:47,381 --> 01:08:49,721
dangerous.
And so they have other ways of 

1424
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:51,360
demonstrating who should be listened to 
authorities and there's chimps doing and

1425
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:55,250
now this particular,
I think if I remember correctly,

1426
01:08:55,850 --> 01:09:00,850
I think it's right.
This is a really cool picture because I 

1427
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:00,850
think this chimp chimps don't like 
snakes by the way.

1428
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:06,040
So for example,
if you take a chimp that's never seen a 

1429
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:06,040
snake and you showed a snake,
it is not happy,

1430
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,550
it will get the hell away from that 
snake.

1431
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,350
If you bring a chimp anesthetized into a
room full of chimps,

1432
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,850
chimps,
we'll all get away from that.

1433
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:15,080
And then look at the body.
They don't,

1434
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:20,110
they don't like that either.
And if you bring a big snake into a 

1435
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:20,270
chimp cage,
even if the chimps have never seen it,

1436
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:22,730
like they'll get away from it and then 
stare at it.

1437
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:26,450
And chimps out in the wild,
if they see a big snake,

1438
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:31,650
they'll,
they'll stand there and they have a 

1439
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:31,650
noise that means something like,
holy crap,

1440
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:32,100
that's a big steak,
you know?

1441
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,880
Um,
it actually means that technically,

1442
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:37,860
I'll tell you why in a minute.
I'm a.

1443
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,500
But they get,
they stand away from it.

1444
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:42,170
And then they make this,
this noise,

1445
01:09:42,171 --> 01:09:43,130
which means,
oh my God,

1446
01:09:43,131 --> 01:09:45,590
look at the snake.
And then they'll stand there for like 24

1447
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:48,530
hours looking at the snake.
And so the snakes are really,

1448
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:51,380
really,
they're super stimuli for chimpanzees.

1449
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:56,380
So that's pretty interesting in this 
champ theme to learn how to take a dead 

1450
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:56,810
snake and goes,
she's scare other chips with it.

1451
01:09:56,811 --> 01:10:01,811
And that was,
that was partly how he established 

1452
01:10:01,811 --> 01:10:03,200
authority and you know,
and while there there's a,

1453
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:05,030
there's a,
there's a threat to you,

1454
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:06,980
like if I was you and I was around that 
chip,

1455
01:10:06,981 --> 01:10:09,860
I would take that threat seriously 
because those things are no joke man.

1456
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,520
And you see the same thing here with 
the,

1457
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,250
I don't remember what kind of monkey 
that is,

1458
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,560
but they're engaged in agonistic 
behavior.

1459
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:18,120
And so,
so.

1460
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,430
And there has been,
by the way,

1461
01:10:19,431 --> 01:10:24,230
there has been recent research showing 
that in higher order primates that there

1462
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:26,570
is snake detection circuitry that's 
built into them.

1463
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:28,520
Right?
So it's not learned,

1464
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:31,040
not learned steeper than that.
Now,

1465
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,390
for a long time,
psychologists,

1466
01:10:32,391 --> 01:10:37,391
psychologist knew for a long time that I
could make you afraid in a conditioning 

1467
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:41,381
experience,
experiment much faster using a snake or 

1468
01:10:41,381 --> 01:10:43,700
a picture of a snake than a gun or a 
picture of a gun.

1469
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,000
So we can learn fear to snakes very 
rapidly,

1470
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:49,340
spiders as well.
And so then people thought,

1471
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:54,341
well,
maybe we were prepared to develop fear 

1472
01:10:54,341 --> 01:10:54,341
of snakes or spiders,
that sort of thing.

1473
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:59,740
But the more recent research has 
indicated that it's more than just 

1474
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:03,310
prepared,
is that we have the detection circuitry 

1475
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,670
built right into us.
And that well is because,

1476
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,600
well,
why wouldn't we?

1477
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:07,550
That's,
that's really the issue.

1478
01:11:07,551 --> 01:11:12,551
It's like,
it's not really that much of a surprise 

1479
01:11:12,551 --> 01:11:12,551
unless you think of human beings as a 
blank slate.

1480
01:11:12,551 --> 01:11:13,100
And if you think that,
then,

1481
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:14,970
um,
I don't know,

1482
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:17,100
you should crawl out of the 16th 
century.

1483
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:19,860
That's how I would look at it because I 
mean,

1484
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:20,330
that's,
that's,

1485
01:11:20,331 --> 01:11:21,930
that's just gone,
that idea.

1486
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:23,640
It's,
it's,

1487
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,830
it's so wrong.
So,

1488
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,300
so maybe you can think about this as a 
dominance hierarchy,

1489
01:11:30,301 --> 01:11:32,730
but wolves,
look for wolves,

1490
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:36,450
look for credibility and competence as 
well.

1491
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:41,660
And,
and chimpanzees don't like brutal 

1492
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:42,210
tyrants and so we'll talk about it as 
the hierarchy of authority.

1493
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:45,510
And so while this is kind of how it,
it starts to develop,

1494
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:46,170
you know,
who you see.

1495
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:48,900
Well,
these girls are negotiating the domestic

1496
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:53,930
environment here and how to behave 
properly and how to share and all that 

1497
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:57,410
and and take turns and so they're 
negotiating the hierarchy of authority 

1498
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:01,700
and if you're good at reciprocity at 
sometimes you're the authority and 

1499
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:01,740
sometimes the other person is the 
authority.

1500
01:12:01,741 --> 01:12:03,030
That's fair play.
Right?

1501
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:08,270
And so these boys are doing the same 
thing and you see they're all smiling 

1502
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,391
away and so it looks like aggressive 
behavior and people who are not very 

1503
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:17,090
attentive and who are paranoid and who 
don't like human beings can confuse this

1504
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,740
with aggression and they forbid it at 
schools,

1505
01:12:22,741 --> 01:12:23,400
which is,
you know,

1506
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:24,150
I know it wouldn't.

1507
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:26,160
When my kids were going to school,
for example,

1508
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:31,190
this was quite awhile ago now,
they were forbidden to pick up snow on 

1509
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:36,261
the off chance.
They might throw a snowball and we know 

1510
01:12:36,261 --> 01:12:36,990
how terrible that is.
So what I told my son was is that he was

1511
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:41,080
perfectly welcome to pelt any teacher he
wanted to in the back of the head with a

1512
01:12:41,081 --> 01:12:46,081
snowball,
as long as he was willing to suffer the 

1513
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:47,760
consequences of doing it.
And I don't know if he ever did,

1514
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:52,761
but he was happy,
he was certainly happy with the idea 

1515
01:12:52,761 --> 01:12:55,020
which may be very happy about him.
So yeah,

1516
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:56,370
so,
so you know,

1517
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:58,290
kids need to do this,
they really,

1518
01:12:58,410 --> 01:13:03,410
really seriously need to do this.
It's what civilizes them and they know 

1519
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:08,460
that needs to happen between the ages of
two and four because if they're not 

1520
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,331
civilized by the time,
therefore then you might as well just 

1521
01:13:11,331 --> 01:13:11,331
forget it.

1522
01:13:11,331 --> 01:13:11,520
And that's a,
that's a horrible statistic.

1523
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:14,970
But it's unbelievably well born out in 
the relevant developmental literature.

1524
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,920
Like there's lots of aggressive two year
olds,

1525
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:20,550
most of them are male and if they stay 
aggressive past the age of four,

1526
01:13:20,551 --> 01:13:23,490
they tend to be lifetime aggressive.
They make no friends,

1527
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:28,580
they're outcasts,
they're much more likely to end up anti 

1528
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:28,580
social,
criminal delinquent and in jail.

1529
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:32,700
And so your kids need to be socialized 
between the ages of two and four.

1530
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:35,640
And that's particularly true for the 
more aggressive males.

1531
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,760
And most of them are aggressive.
Two year olds are male and that isn't 

1532
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,000
socialization by the way.
So there's more,

1533
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,130
you know,
more abstract representation of the same

1534
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:46,530
sort of thing and I'm,
I'm trying to make the case that this,

1535
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:51,680
that the,
that the hierarchy of authority emerges 

1536
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,950
out of a game like Matrix and underlying
game like Matrix.

1537
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:57,950
And that's one of the things that is one
of the things that's so brilliant about 

1538
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:57,950
John Piaget,
he figured that out,

1539
01:13:57,950 --> 01:14:02,781
it's so smart and he was interested in 
the biological origin of morality and he

1540
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:04,290
identified he,
he,

1541
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,430
he,
he,

1542
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:10,550
he traced the origin to play and the 
emergence of morality out of play and 

1543
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,100
it's so,
it's just,

1544
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:17,101
I just can't believe how smart an idea 
that was because it's the bottom up 

1545
01:14:17,101 --> 01:14:18,160
construction of,
of,

1546
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,700
of morality don't.
Piaget was a constructionist and to some

1547
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:25,810
degree of social constructionist,
he underestimated the role of biology,

1548
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:31,110
but that doesn't invalidate his theory.
It's really easy to put a biological 

1549
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:32,230
underpinning underneath,
underneath Piaget's theory.

1550
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:34,900
We know the biology well enough to do it
quite quite nicely now.

1551
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:40,090
So I mean we.
Well the fact that Panksepp for example,

1552
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:42,880
could identify the play circuit is a 
really good start with that,

1553
01:14:42,881 --> 01:14:47,881
right?
Because play has been around so long 

1554
01:14:47,881 --> 01:14:49,360
that we have a circuit that's dedicated 
to it and so that's,

1555
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,770
that's a very,
very ancient.

1556
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,930
That's a very ancient issue and so you 
know,

1557
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:55,480
this is,
this is very much of an abstraction of a

1558
01:14:55,481 --> 01:15:00,481
game here and then of course you get the
ultimate abstraction and representation 

1559
01:15:00,481 --> 01:15:01,630
in a representation like

1560
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:05,070
like that where

1561
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:10,200
even the,
even the landscape of the game is 

1562
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,601
fictional and of course we've migrated 
to a large degree into those sorts of 

1563
01:15:12,601 --> 01:15:14,080
fiction landscapes,
fictional books,

1564
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,810
movies,
video games.

1565
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,990
So it's the same.
It's an extension of the same thing.

1566
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:23,500
So practice for practice,
for real life.

1567
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:25,840
The shades in some cases into real life 
itself.

1568
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,070
So.

1569
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,000
Alright,
more representations of God the father.

1570
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:37,870
I liked these representations.
I like the triangle idea.

1571
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,780
I mean I don't know why God is wearing a
triangular hat.

1572
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:45,810
It's kind of a strange fashion choice,
but I think it's associated with the 

1573
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:49,021
idea of the pyramid and I think that's 
associated with the idea of the 

1574
01:15:49,021 --> 01:15:50,110
hierarchy of authority.
And I think that's why the Egyptians put

1575
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:53,200
their pharaohs inside pyramids.
I know there's more to it than that,

1576
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:58,380
but I think some of that has to do with 
the notion of this hierarchical 

1577
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,670
structure and you see this on the now 
that's speculative obviously,

1578
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:02,230
and I don't want to make too much of it,
but.

1579
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,650
But I can't help but think that there's 
something to that through that.

1580
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,560
On the back of the American dollar bill,
I liked that a lot.

1581
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:13,620
That's like the eye of horus from the 
Egyptians and so the idea here is 

1582
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,790
something like at the top of the 
hierarchy is something that is no longer

1583
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:16,780
part of the hierarchy.

1584
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,810
Right?
So if you move up the hierarchy enough,

1585
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:24,960
what happens is that you develop the 
ability as a consequence of moving up 

1586
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,531
that hierarchy to be detached enough 
from the hierarchy so you're no longer 

1587
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:31,981
really part of it and so that you can 
move in all sorts of different 

1588
01:16:31,981 --> 01:16:31,981
hierarchies.
And the thing,

1589
01:16:31,981 --> 01:16:34,720
the idea here is that the thing that 
you're really developing is the capacity

1590
01:16:34,721 --> 01:16:37,960
to pay attention.
And I would say from a,

1591
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:43,240
from a mythological perspective,
the one thing that seems to compete with

1592
01:16:43,241 --> 01:16:48,241
the idea of the spoken word as the,
as the source of the extraction of 

1593
01:16:48,881 --> 01:16:52,570
habitable order from chaos is the eye is
the capacity to pay attention.

1594
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:53,950
So Martin,
for example,

1595
01:16:53,951 --> 01:16:56,520
the Mesopotamian Creator,
God who,

1596
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:01,540
who,
who emerged in the hierarchy of 

1597
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:01,540
Mesopotamian gods and came out at the 
top right,

1598
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,650
he was the victor of the gods.

1599
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,950
He had eyes all the way around his head 
and he could speak magic words.

1600
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:08,830
And I really liked that.
I really liked that idea.

1601
01:17:08,831 --> 01:17:11,270
And Egyptians developed that idea too 
because they're god.

1602
01:17:11,271 --> 01:17:14,130
Horus was the eye.
Everyone knows the eye of horus that,

1603
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:18,050
that that image is so compelling that we
still know about.

1604
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:21,650
Everybody has seen the eye of horus with
a really open pupil.

1605
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:25,580
And what the Egyptians learned was that 
the open I was,

1606
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:29,390
what revivified the dead society.
It's so smart.

1607
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:31,220
So what do you do if your life isn't in 
order?

1608
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:34,490
Bloody well pay attention.
And that isn't the same as thinking.

1609
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:36,740
It's a different process.
Paying attention,

1610
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:40,070
thinking is like the imposition of 
structure in some sense.

1611
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:45,580
I know I'm over simplifying,
but paying attention to something like 

1612
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:48,611
watching for what you don't know and so 
like one of the things that I often 

1613
01:17:48,611 --> 01:17:52,391
recommend to my clinical clients if 
they're having trouble with a family 

1614
01:17:52,391 --> 01:17:52,640
member is number one,
shut up.

1615
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:56,810
Don't tell them anything about yourself.
Just and I don't mean in a rude way.

1616
01:17:56,811 --> 01:17:59,210
It's just like no more personal 
information.

1617
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,020
Number two,
watch them like a hawk and listen,

1618
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:08,200
and if you do that long enough,
they will tell you exactly what they're 

1619
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,201
up to and they will also tell you who 
they think you are and then you'll be 

1620
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:12,290
shocked because they think you're 
something.

1621
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:17,320
Generally speaking.
That's not like what you are at all and 

1622
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:17,900
when they tell you,
it's like a revelation to both of you,

1623
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:23,170
but attention is an unbelievably 
powerful for us and you see this in 

1624
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:26,981
psychotherapy to because a lot of what 
you do and in any repairative 

1625
01:18:26,981 --> 01:18:28,460
relationship is really pay attention to 
the other person.

1626
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:34,030
Pay attention and listen,
and you would not believe what people 

1627
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:37,631
will tell you or revealed to you if you 
watch them as if you want to know 

1628
01:18:37,631 --> 01:18:41,510
instead of watching them so that you'll 
have your prejudices reinforced.

1629
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:44,000
That's usually how people interact.
It's like,

1630
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:49,060
I want to keep thinking about you the 
way I'm thinking about you and so I'm 

1631
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,840
going to filter out anything that just 
proves my theory now.

1632
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:54,290
It's not what I'm talking about at all.
It's like I'm gonna Watch you and figure

1633
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:56,240
out what you're up to.
Not in a rude way.

1634
01:18:56,241 --> 01:19:01,241
None of that.
I just want to see what's there and 

1635
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:03,110
that'll be good for you probably and 
also be good for me.

1636
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,230
And so well.
So that's the idea that,

1637
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:08,600
you know,
climbing up a hierarchy of authority can

1638
01:19:08,601 --> 01:19:12,770
give you vision and that vision can 
transcend the actual hierarchy.

1639
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,770
And I think that's also the.
I think that's also the,

1640
01:19:15,771 --> 01:19:20,771
uh,
that's the metaphysical space that an 

1641
01:19:20,771 --> 01:19:23,891
artist occupies because artists really 
aren't in a hierarchy there outside of 

1642
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:24,890
hierarchies.
You've watched the lion king,

1643
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,470
most of you.
Yeah.

1644
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:29,300
That's a zoo.
You know the little bird.

1645
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:31,790
That's the eye of the king and it's the 
same thing there.

1646
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,760
So and that's,
that's echoed in this idea as well,

1647
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:37,550
so,
so well that some more,

1648
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,330
more ideas of hierarchy.
Same idea.

1649
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:43,550
This is great.
Gold,

1650
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,350
silver,
bronze.

1651
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,470
Why gold gold is the sun.
Gold is pure,

1652
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:52,040
right?
And so the idea is that the thing that's

1653
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:57,041
at the top of the hierarchy is 
incorruptible because gold doesn't mix 

1654
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:57,041
with anything else,
right?

1655
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:58,610
It's this sort of metal that doesn't 
ever become corrupted.

1656
01:19:58,611 --> 01:20:03,611
It's a noble metal,
it doesn't become corrupted and so it 

1657
01:20:03,611 --> 01:20:06,371
shines like the sun and it's associated 
with what's ever at the top of the 

1658
01:20:06,371 --> 01:20:09,701
hierarchy and the gold,
the medal is a disc like the sun and 

1659
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:13,290
it's awarded to those people who've,
who've occupied the top position and who

1660
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:15,300
are manifestations of the ideal.

1661
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,040
And here here's,
here's,

1662
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,710
I got to tell you a quick story.
So imagine that you're watching.

1663
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:24,711
And Olympic contest.
I found this happens to me very often 

1664
01:20:24,711 --> 01:20:24,711
with gymnastics because the gymnast or 
so,

1665
01:20:24,711 --> 01:20:26,060
absolutely unbelievable.
You know,

1666
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:31,340
so you go watch a gymnastic performance 
and the person's out there bouncing 

1667
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:34,190
around like,
you know,

1668
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:37,110
you can't even imagine doing it.
There are so perfect at it.

1669
01:20:37,111 --> 01:20:39,240
So you see this person,
they're going through this routine.

1670
01:20:39,241 --> 01:20:42,360
They're just absolutely spectacular and 
flawless at it.

1671
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,790
You know,
at the end they stop and everybody claps

1672
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:49,791
and they were all excited to see what a 
human being can do and that's why we're 

1673
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,670
in the audience watching because we want
to see what a human being can do.

1674
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,370
And the judges go like nine point eight,
nine point eight,

1675
01:20:53,371 --> 01:20:54,840
nine point eight.
Everybody's thrilled.

1676
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:57,390
And then the next contestant comes out 
and it's like,

1677
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:59,070
well,
they're just basically screwed,

1678
01:20:59,071 --> 01:20:59,250
right?

1679
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,320
It's like this person came out there and
was perfect.

1680
01:21:01,321 --> 01:21:06,321
How are you going to top that?
That's an interesting question because 

1681
01:21:06,321 --> 01:21:10,280
this is a representation of what you do 
to top perfection itself and you can do 

1682
01:21:11,941 --> 01:21:15,390
it and here's how you do it and you know
this even though you don't know you know

1683
01:21:15,391 --> 01:21:20,391
it.
So let's say the next contestant comes 

1684
01:21:20,391 --> 01:21:20,391
out and they're kind of shaky because 
it's like,

1685
01:21:20,391 --> 01:21:21,270
oh man,
the bar has been raised high.

1686
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:26,570
So what they do is they put themselves 
right on the edge of chaos and you can 

1687
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:32,421
tell by watching them that they are one 
bloody fraction of a second from 

1688
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:37,100
catastrophe.
There are pushing themselves farther 

1689
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:37,100
than they've ever gone in the direction 
of their perfection.

1690
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,020
And everyone in the room is so tense,
they can hardly stand it,

1691
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:45,021
right?
You could hear a pin drop and that 

1692
01:21:45,021 --> 01:21:45,021
person is flipping around and they're 
just,

1693
01:21:45,021 --> 01:21:46,380
it's just right on the edge of 
catastrophe.

1694
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:48,330
And at the end they go like this,
you know?

1695
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:53,510
And there's that gesture that the 
triumph that goes along with that and 

1696
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,050
everybody rises in one instant and just 
collapsed,

1697
01:21:55,051 --> 01:21:56,100
like mad.
It's like,

1698
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:56,850
well,
why?

1699
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,880
What are you doing?
What are you doing when you're doing 

1700
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:01,880
that?
Right?

1701
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,121
You can't even help it.
It grabs you right in the core of your 

1702
01:22:05,121 --> 01:22:06,570
being and you stand up and it's an act 
of worship.

1703
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:11,571
That's what it is.
And you saw someone go beyond their 

1704
01:22:11,571 --> 01:22:15,081
perfection into the domain of chaos and 
establish order right in front of your 

1705
01:22:15,081 --> 01:22:19,641
eyes and you're so thrilled about that.
You know you're happy to be alive and 

1706
01:22:19,641 --> 01:22:23,010
everyone's celebrating it all at the 
same time and it's an absolutely amazing

1707
01:22:23,011 --> 01:22:24,630
thing.
And that's what,

1708
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,550
well,
sometimes that's what this represents.

1709
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:31,551
And sometimes that's what this 
represents and that's what we're trying 

1710
01:22:31,551 --> 01:22:32,220
to get at that because that's the 
pinnacle of the hierarchy,

1711
01:22:32,221 --> 01:22:37,221
right?
Not only are you doing what you should 

1712
01:22:37,221 --> 01:22:39,381
be doing,
but you're doing it in a way that 

1713
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:40,080
increases the probability that you'll do
it better the next time you do it,

1714
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,560
and then you could say,
here's another thing to think about 

1715
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,321
along the same lines,
and I know we haven't got Adam and eve 

1716
01:22:48,321 --> 01:22:48,321
yet.

1717
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:53,400
You tell your kids to play fair,
right?

1718
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:55,530
You say it's not him.
It's not whether or not you win.

1719
01:22:55,531 --> 01:23:00,531
It's how you play the game and you say 
that you don't really know what you 

1720
01:23:00,531 --> 01:23:03,921
mean.
You feel kind of stupid saying it even 

1721
01:23:03,921 --> 01:23:05,751
though you know it's true and your kid 
looks at you like there's something 

1722
01:23:05,751 --> 01:23:05,751
wrong with you because he doesn't know 
what you're talking about either,

1723
01:23:05,751 --> 01:23:08,500
but you know it's true,
and so here's why.

1724
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:12,850
It's true.
Life isn't a game.

1725
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:18,540
It's a set of games and the rule is 
never sacrificed victory across the set 

1726
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:22,180
of games for victory in one game.
Right?

1727
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:24,490
And that's what it means to play 
properly.

1728
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,880
You want to play so that people keep 
inviting you to play because that's how 

1729
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:29,880
you win,
right?

1730
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:34,770
You win by being invited to play the 
largest possible array of games and the 

1731
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:39,421
way you do that is by manifesting the 
fact that you can play in a reciprocal 

1732
01:23:39,421 --> 01:23:42,841
manner every time you play,
even if there's victory at stake and 

1733
01:23:42,841 --> 01:23:43,570
that's what makes you successful across 
time.

1734
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:46,000
And we all know that and we even tell 
our kids that,

1735
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:51,001
but we don't know that we know it.
And so we're not adapting ourselves to 

1736
01:23:51,001 --> 01:23:54,520
the game and victory in the game.
We're adapting ourselves to the metagame

1737
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,100
and victory across the set of all 
possible games.

1738
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:58,930
And that's what that.
Well,

1739
01:23:58,931 --> 01:24:01,060
that's exactly what,
as far as I can tell,

1740
01:24:01,061 --> 01:24:03,100
that's exactly what this is aiming at to
that.

1741
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:06,310
That's the same idea that there's,
that there's a transcendent,

1742
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:10,360
there's a mode of being that transcends 
the particularities of this,

1743
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,450
of the localized contest.
That's the other way to think about it.

1744
01:24:13,451 --> 01:24:18,451
And to act morally is not to win today's
contest at the expense of the rest of 

1745
01:24:19,571 --> 01:24:22,270
possible contests.
And again,

1746
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:23,980
I don't see that as something that's 
arbitrary.

1747
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:28,981
It's not relativistic.
There's an absolute moral does an 

1748
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,000
absolute moral stance there and everyone
recognizes it.

1749
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:36,160
And,
and I also think it's the key to 

1750
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:36,420
success.
And I would also say it's very much a,

1751
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,330
in his strange way,
like the,

1752
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:38,840
uh,
the,

1753
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:43,900
the person who is the master at being 
invited to play the largest possible 

1754
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:48,901
games,
number of games is also the same person 

1755
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:52,290
I haven't quite figured out.
The precise relationship between these 

1756
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:55,591
two is also the same person that goes 
out forthrightly to conquer the unknown 

1757
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:59,020
before it presents itself as the enemy 
at the door.

1758
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,120
They're the same thing.
Now I don't,

1759
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:02,030
I can't have,
haven't figured,

1760
01:25:02,031 --> 01:25:03,820
well why that is exactly,
but,

1761
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:07,000
but well,
I'll figure it out eventually when I do.

1762
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:11,530
I'll tell you if you're interested,
so okay,

1763
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:14,170
so here's some other ideas of,
of,

1764
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,700
of God as,
as,

1765
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:20,880
as hierarchical authority figure.
So strip the religious preconceptions 

1766
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,780
off what you observe and just look at 
what you see.

1767
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:27,780
Well look,
there's primate looking upward at 

1768
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:29,080
dominant figure that that's what you see
there.

1769
01:25:29,081 --> 01:25:34,081
Now it's very interestingly symbolically
represented because you have God the 

1770
01:25:34,081 --> 01:25:38,161
father there with the cross and I think 
what that means as far as I can tell is 

1771
01:25:38,161 --> 01:25:42,031
that there's a recognition there in the 
image that the person who's most 

1772
01:25:42,031 --> 01:25:44,050
dominant is the one who's or the most 
has the most authority,

1773
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,650
is the one who's voluntarily accepted 
the suffering.

1774
01:25:47,651 --> 01:25:50,620
That's part of being and that's what 
that picture represents.

1775
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:55,650
It's like the authority holes that says 
this is what you have to accept and 

1776
01:25:55,661 --> 01:25:56,260
that,
that,

1777
01:25:56,340 --> 01:26:01,340
that,
that transfixed as the viewer because 

1778
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:04,711
of,
because of the fact that it's true and 

1779
01:26:04,711 --> 01:26:04,711
you think,
well,

1780
01:26:04,711 --> 01:26:04,711
is that true?
Okay,

1781
01:26:04,711 --> 01:26:07,651
well think about it this way.
Do you like brave people or do you like 

1782
01:26:07,651 --> 01:26:07,651
cowards?
Well,

1783
01:26:07,651 --> 01:26:10,520
that that's pretty straightforward and 
what's the ultimate act of bravery.

1784
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:15,720
It's to come to terms with the fact that
you're mortal and limited and to live 

1785
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,120
forthrightly regardless.
Well,

1786
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:22,121
obviously that's at the core of what's 
of what's admirable and why would we 

1787
01:26:22,121 --> 01:26:25,220
presume that that's not the case.
We act as if that's the case.

1788
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:27,740
It's what everyone dreams and wishes 
that they could.

1789
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,110
They could do.
I mean assuming that you know,

1790
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:33,500
you've dispensed with the idea that 
you're going to be a mortal,

1791
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:38,501
I suppose that might be worth wishing 
for it to or or perhaps not immortal is 

1792
01:26:38,501 --> 01:26:42,791
a very long time,
but you certainly want this and that 

1793
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:42,791
image says,
well,

1794
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:47,090
this is what you should be and you know,
we've got that same opening into the sky

1795
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,040
going on in that image that I showed you
before.

1796
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:51,290
It's like this is a transcendent truth.
It constantly,

1797
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:56,270
we manifest self across time and space 
and young would say it's built into your

1798
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:58,400
psyche that image.
Now you know,

1799
01:26:58,401 --> 01:27:01,160
there are elements of it that are 
culturally constructed.

1800
01:27:01,161 --> 01:27:03,770
It wouldn't necessarily have to be the 
cross,

1801
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,920
although the cross is a very old symbol.
It's far older than than its use in 

1802
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:12,610
Christianity and it's been used in many,
many religious representations,

1803
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:15,860
but that echoes the sole echoes with 
that

1804
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:16,850
no and

1805
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:24,300
well,
and then there's Moses on the mountain 

1806
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:24,500
receiving the,
the,

1807
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:25,870
the,
the law.

1808
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:28,420
And so we'll talk a lot more about that 
when we get the exodus.

1809
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:33,520
But if.
Yeah,

1810
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:34,450
yeah,
yeah.

1811
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,760
If we get to exodus,
so.

1812
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:39,490
Well look,
where does it happen?

1813
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:41,300
Well,
on a mountain.

1814
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:43,660
Well that's a pyramid.
That's op,

1815
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,040
right?
That's off the top.

1816
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:47,290
It's up in the stratosphere,
it's up in the sky.

1817
01:27:47,291 --> 01:27:49,710
We're where you'll look upward.
Okay.

1818
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,000
And then so what's happening to Moses?
Well,

1819
01:27:52,001 --> 01:27:57,001
here,
here's a bit of a clue as far as I can 

1820
01:27:57,001 --> 01:27:59,221
tell.
I figured this out partly again by 

1821
01:27:59,221 --> 01:28:01,771
reading jumped piaget,
because one of the things that Piaget 

1822
01:28:01,771 --> 01:28:02,350
said about kids was that they first 
learned to play a game,

1823
01:28:02,351 --> 01:28:06,070
but they don't know what the rules are.
Meaning that if you have a bunch of kids

1824
01:28:06,071 --> 01:28:07,660
together,
they can play a game,

1825
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:10,120
but if you take one of the kids out of 
the game when they're young,

1826
01:28:10,121 --> 01:28:13,090
say six and you say what the rules are,
what are the rules,

1827
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:18,210
they can only sort of give you a 
representation so you take 60 year old 

1828
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:21,751
one and he'll tell you some of the rules
and six year old to will tell you 

1829
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:24,811
different rules and and you know,
six year old three will tell you 

1830
01:28:24,811 --> 01:28:28,231
different rules,
but if you put them all together they 

1831
01:28:28,231 --> 01:28:28,231
can play.

1832
01:28:28,231 --> 01:28:30,940
So they have the knowledge embodied 
either individually or in the group.

1833
01:28:30,941 --> 01:28:34,540
The knowledge is there to be extracted.
Well then they get a little older,

1834
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:38,650
they can extract the rules and then they
start to play by the rules.

1835
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:43,830
And then the last step was,
well it isn't just the kids play by the 

1836
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:47,341
rules,
is that they learned that they can make 

1837
01:28:47,341 --> 01:28:47,341
the rules and he thought about that as 
moral progression.

1838
01:28:47,341 --> 01:28:49,210
First you can play,
then you can play by the rules.

1839
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,210
Then you learn maybe because he didn't 
think everyone learned this,

1840
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:54,310
that you're actually the master of the 
rules.

1841
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:56,200
That doesn't mean the rules are 
arbitrary,

1842
01:28:56,770 --> 01:29:01,380
but it means that you can be the 
generator of the rules assuming you knew

1843
01:29:01,381 --> 01:29:06,381
how to play the game,
and he thought about that as a moral 

1844
01:29:06,381 --> 01:29:08,780
moral progression and then I thought,
well that's exactly what happened to 

1845
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:11,631
Moses and in the story of exodus,
because Moses is out there leading all 

1846
01:29:11,631 --> 01:29:13,530
those Israelites around and like they 
don't have a law,

1847
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:14,670
they don't have a law giver.

1848
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:19,730
They have a tradition and they're all 
like crabby because while they're in a 

1849
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:20,880
desert,
it's like they were in a tyranny,

1850
01:29:20,881 --> 01:29:23,760
but now they're in a desert.
It's like that's no improvement.

1851
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:27,300
So they're really getting pretty bitchy 
about it and so they're worshiping false

1852
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:32,301
idols and having one catastrophe after 
another and they get Moses to judge 

1853
01:29:32,301 --> 01:29:36,750
their conflicts and so he does that for 
God only knows how long forever crabby 

1854
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:40,350
Israelites come to Moses and bitch at 
them.

1855
01:29:40,351 --> 01:29:40,830
It's like,
wow,

1856
01:29:40,831 --> 01:29:45,831
he did this and she did that and and so 
then he has to figure out how to make 

1857
01:29:45,831 --> 01:29:48,600
peace and he does that so long that one 
of his,

1858
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:53,690
I think it's his father in law,
tells him he has to stop doing it 

1859
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:53,690
because he's gonna exhaust himself.
Well then you think,

1860
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:54,240
well,
what's happening?

1861
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,500
Well,
and I'm not assuming that this is a like

1862
01:29:58,501 --> 01:30:00,570
a literal historical story.

1863
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:02,970
I think again,
it's a condensation well,

1864
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:08,010
any group has a set of customs just like
a wolf pack does,

1865
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:13,480
and so then the customers are being 
manifest in someone who's a genius is 

1866
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:13,480
watching and thinking,
okay,

1867
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,610
well what's the rule in this situation?
What's the rule of this situation?

1868
01:30:17,611 --> 01:30:20,850
What's the rule in this situation?
And then in his imagination,

1869
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:26,030
the rules turned into a hierarchy and 
then he goes up on the mountain and it 

1870
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:26,030
goes bang,
and he thinks,

1871
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:31,010
oh my God,
here's the rules that we've been living 

1872
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:33,651
by all this time.
And that's the revelation of the 

1873
01:30:33,651 --> 01:30:33,651
commandments.
Well,

1874
01:30:33,651 --> 01:30:33,651
and you think,
well,

1875
01:30:33,651 --> 01:30:38,151
how else could it be?
I think that rules came first and 

1876
01:30:38,151 --> 01:30:39,720
obeying them came second.
So like know the rules come first,

1877
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:42,450
sorry,
the actions come first,

1878
01:30:42,451 --> 01:30:47,451
the the old obeying them comes first and
then you figure out what everybody's up 

1879
01:30:47,451 --> 01:30:47,451
to and you say,
hey look,

1880
01:30:47,451 --> 01:30:48,520
this is what you've been up to all 
along.

1881
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,010
And everybody goes,
Oh yeah,

1882
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,560
that seems to make sense.
And if it didn't,

1883
01:30:52,561 --> 01:30:55,560
who would follow them?
No one was going to follow them.

1884
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:57,600
If they don't match what's already 
there,

1885
01:30:57,690 --> 01:31:00,600
you just think about that is unjust and 
so that's,

1886
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:04,830
that's portrayed here as a cataclysmic 
human event.

1887
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,300
It's like,
Oh my God,

1888
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:11,780
we've been chimpanzees.
We've been in this hierarchy of 

1889
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:14,121
authority for so long.
We have no idea what we were doing and 

1890
01:31:14,121 --> 01:31:16,611
all of a sudden poof.
It burst into revelatory consciousness 

1891
01:31:16,611 --> 01:31:18,900
and we could say,
here is the law.

1892
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:19,830
And you say,
well,

1893
01:31:19,831 --> 01:31:21,600
is it given by God?
Well,

1894
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,030
hey,
it depends on what you mean by God.

1895
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:29,090
We could start with that presupposition,
but it's not like it just came out of 

1896
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:29,090
nowhere.
It took.

1897
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:31,080
And this is something else nature 
observed.

1898
01:31:31,081 --> 01:31:32,610
So interestingly,
and he said,

1899
01:31:32,611 --> 01:31:37,611
you know that a moral revelation was the
consequence of a tremendously long 

1900
01:31:38,281 --> 01:31:43,281
process of initial construction and then
formulation thousands and thousands and 

1901
01:31:44,221 --> 01:31:49,221
thousands and thousands of years of 
custom of building custom before you get

1902
01:31:49,411 --> 01:31:54,411
the revelation of the articulated law 
and that's a description of the pattern 

1903
01:31:54,511 --> 01:31:55,830
that works and let's say,
well,

1904
01:31:55,831 --> 01:31:57,240
what's the pattern that works?

1905
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,840
It's the game that you can with 
everybody else day after day with no 

1906
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,650
degeneration and that's another thing 
piaget figured out.

1907
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:08,600
That's so brilliant and that's his idea 
of the equilibrated state.

1908
01:32:08,601 --> 01:32:13,601
It's,
it's an extension of a manual counts 

1909
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:16,320
idea about the universal maximum right 
act in a way so that each action could 

1910
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,900
become a universal rule.
That was fundamental moral maximum.

1911
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:21,850
And Piaget put a twist on that.
He said,

1912
01:32:21,851 --> 01:32:22,300
no,
no,

1913
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:26,620
that's not exactly yet.
It's act in such a way that it works for

1914
01:32:26,621 --> 01:32:31,621
you now and next week and next month and
next year and 10 years from now,

1915
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:37,080
and so that while it's working for you,
it's also working for the people around 

1916
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,370
you and for the broader society and,
and,

1917
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:43,400
and that's the braided state and you 
could think about that as an intimation 

1918
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,100
of the Kingdom of the city,
of God on earth.

1919
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:50,101
It's something like that and it's based 
on this idea that a morality has to be 

1920
01:32:50,101 --> 01:32:50,920
interoperable and you know,
there's lots of,

1921
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:53,560
there's been lots of simulations online 
already,

1922
01:32:53,561 --> 01:32:56,710
artificial intelligence,
simulations of trading gapes,

1923
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:57,340
right?

1924
01:32:57,340 --> 01:33:02,340
I mean,
the people who've been studying the 

1925
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,771
emergence of moral behavior say an 
artificial intelligence systems have 

1926
01:33:04,771 --> 01:33:07,921
already caught onto the idea that one of
the crucial elements to the analysis of 

1927
01:33:07,921 --> 01:33:12,361
morality is interability.
You can't play a degenerating game 

1928
01:33:12,361 --> 01:33:14,080
because.
Because it degenerates,

1929
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:19,290
like obviously you want to play a game 
that had least remained stable across 

1930
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:23,281
time and God,
if you could really get your act 

1931
01:33:23,281 --> 01:33:23,440
together,
maybe it would slowly get better.

1932
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:25,540
And of course that's what you'd hope for
your family.

1933
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:30,541
Right?
That's what you're always trying to do 

1934
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:32,490
and let,
unless you're completely hell bent on 

1935
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:32,490
revenge and destruction.
It's like,

1936
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:36,720
is there a way that we can continue to 
play together that will make playing 

1937
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,830
together even better the next day?
That's what you're up to and

1938
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:42,460
well,
I don't see anything arbitrary both that

1939
01:33:42,461 --> 01:33:44,710
and part of it,
and this is also why I think that bloody

1940
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:47,340
postmodernists are so incorrect because 
you know,

1941
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:52,350
they say something like there's an 
infinite number of interpretations of 

1942
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:56,161
the world and that's actually true,
but then they make a mistake and they 

1943
01:33:56,161 --> 01:34:00,241
say,
well no interpretation is to be 

1944
01:34:00,241 --> 01:34:00,241
privileged over any other 
interpretation.

1945
01:34:00,241 --> 01:34:02,500
It's like wrong,
wrong.

1946
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:05,260
That's,
that's where things go seriously off the

1947
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:07,960
rails because the interpretation has to 
be,

1948
01:34:07,961 --> 01:34:12,961
and this is the psg and objection is 
like if you and I are going to play a 

1949
01:34:12,961 --> 01:34:15,991
game.
Rule one is we both have to want to 

1950
01:34:15,991 --> 01:34:18,001
play.
Rule two is other people are going to 

1951
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:20,551
let us play.
Rule three is we should be able to play 

1952
01:34:20,551 --> 01:34:23,221
it across a pretty long period of time 
without it degenerating and maybe rule 

1953
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:23,290
four is,
well,

1954
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:25,630
we're playing,
the world shouldn't kill us.

1955
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:31,230
It's like there are not very many games 
like you don't send your kids out to 

1956
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:31,230
play on the super highway.
Right?

1957
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:36,030
So they're not playing hockey on the 
superhighway because the world kills 

1958
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:38,500
them and so there there's an infinite 
number of interpretations,

1959
01:34:38,501 --> 01:34:43,501
but there is not an infinite number of 
solutions and the solutions are 

1960
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:45,820
constrained by the fact of the world and
are suffering in the world and then also

1961
01:34:45,821 --> 01:34:48,310
constrained by the fact that we 
constrain each other.

1962
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:53,640
And so that's,
that's where I think that's gone 

1963
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:53,640
dreadfully,
dreadfully wrong.

1964
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:54,840
So.
All right,

1965
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:07,920
it's really fun to look at these old 
pictures once you kind of know what they

1966
01:35:07,921 --> 01:35:09,040
mean.
You know,

1967
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:14,180
the delayed.
At least that's what I've discovered is 

1968
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,930
that once I kind of understand the 
underlying rationale for.

1969
01:35:15,931 --> 01:35:18,330
I mean someone worked hard on that.
That's an engraving,

1970
01:35:18,331 --> 01:35:19,680
right?
They took a long time.

1971
01:35:19,681 --> 01:35:23,130
Making that picture there are serious 
about it and when you understand what it

1972
01:35:23,131 --> 01:35:23,640
means,

1973
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:26,920
you know,
all those people there,

1974
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:29,190
their prostate,
prostrate at the,

1975
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:30,990
um,
at the,

1976
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,120
at the revelation of the law.
It's like,

1977
01:35:33,121 --> 01:35:38,121
well,
no wonder it's like break the law and 

1978
01:35:38,121 --> 01:35:40,071
see what happens.
Break the universal moral law man and 

1979
01:35:40,071 --> 01:35:40,071
see what happens.
You know,

1980
01:35:40,071 --> 01:35:41,460
I see people in that situation.
We'll ask you all,

1981
01:35:41,461 --> 01:35:45,330
do all the time perhaps me more than you
because I'm a clinical psychologist,

1982
01:35:45,331 --> 01:35:50,331
you know,
and if the people I'm seeing having 

1983
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:52,641
broken the universal law,
then you can bloody well be sure that 

1984
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:53,370
people around them have.
It's no joke,

1985
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:57,360
like you make a mistake and things will 
go seriously wrong for you.

1986
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:02,720
And so it's no wonder that you'd be 
terrified at the revelation of the 

1987
01:36:03,421 --> 01:36:08,421
structure that governs our big.
One of the things that's so remarkable 

1988
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:08,550
about the old testament,
this is another thing,

1989
01:36:08,551 --> 01:36:11,610
nature commented or he was a real 
admirer of the Old Testament,

1990
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,110
not so much of the New Testament.

1991
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:18,110
He thought it was a sin for Europe to 
have glued the new testament onto the 

1992
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:22,491
old testament because he thought the old
testament was a really accurate 

1993
01:36:22,491 --> 01:36:24,210
representation of the phenomenology of 
Ba.

1994
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:27,780
It's like stay awake,
speak property,

1995
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:32,900
be honest or watch the hell out because 
things will come your way that you just 

1996
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,670
do not want to see at all and it might 
not just be you.

1997
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:40,671
It might be everyone you know in 
everything about your culture that is 

1998
01:36:40,671 --> 01:36:42,300
demolished for,
for generation after generation.

1999
01:36:42,301 --> 01:36:46,040
It's like stay awake and be careful.
And I like.

2000
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:50,970
I think that people only don't believe 
that when they're being hubris stick.

2001
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,760
And I think that most people know that 
deep in their hearts.

2002
01:36:53,761 --> 01:36:55,710
You know when you get high on your 
horse,

2003
01:36:55,770 --> 01:36:57,990
that happens fairly often.
If you have any sense,

2004
01:36:57,991 --> 01:36:58,500
you think,
Geez,

2005
01:36:58,501 --> 01:37:03,501
I better be careful.
Tap myself down a fair bit because if I 

2006
01:37:03,501 --> 01:37:03,501
get too puffed up,
man,

2007
01:37:03,501 --> 01:37:08,160
something's going to come along and take
me out at the knees and everyone knows 

2008
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:08,670
that pride comes before a fall.

2009
01:37:08,670 --> 01:37:13,670
It's like if you have any.
That's why it says in the Old Testament 

2010
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:13,670
that fear of God is the beginning of 
wisdom.

2011
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:17,310
It's like I've never in all my years as 
a clinical psychologist,

2012
01:37:17,311 --> 01:37:19,230
and this is something that really does 
terrify me.

2013
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:24,430
I as I have never seen anyone ever get 
away with anything at all.

2014
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:29,780
Even once you know,
there's that old idea that God has a 

2015
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:29,780
book,
you know,

2016
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:30,510
and it keeps track of everything in 
heaven.

2017
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:31,410
It's like,
okay,

2018
01:37:31,411 --> 01:37:32,160
okay.
You know,

2019
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:34,830
maybe it's not a book,
fine,

2020
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:40,430
but that is a really useful thing to 
think about because while I'd maybe you 

2021
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:44,601
disagree,
maybe you think people get away with 

2022
01:37:44,601 --> 01:37:44,601
things all the time.
I tell you,

2023
01:37:44,601 --> 01:37:47,751
I've never seen it.
What I see instead is that thing 

2024
01:37:47,751 --> 01:37:47,751
happens,
right?

2025
01:37:47,751 --> 01:37:51,950
Someone twists the fabric of reality and
they do it successfully because it 

2026
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:53,580
doesn't snap back at them that moment.

2027
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,750
And then like two years later unraveled 
and they get walloped and they think,

2028
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:59,520
oh my God,
that's so unfair.

2029
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,140
And then we track it.
It's like,

2030
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,880
well,
what happened before that?

2031
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:04,330
This one,
then what?

2032
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:06,560
This,
and then what this,

2033
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,610
and then what?
Oh,

2034
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:09,960
oh,
this,

2035
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:11,850
oh,
that's where it went wrong.

2036
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:12,510
It's,
yeah,

2037
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:17,490
because you can't twist the fabric of 
reality without having it snapped back.

2038
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:19,980
It doesn't work that way.
And why would it?

2039
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:22,710
Because what are you going to do twist 
the fabric of reality?

2040
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,510
I don't think so.
I think it's bigger than you.

2041
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:30,670
You know,
and I think one of the things that 

2042
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:30,670
really temps people is the idea that,
well I can get away with it.

2043
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:31,620
It's like,
yeah,

2044
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:33,630
you try,
you see how well that works.

2045
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,960
So like you,
you get away with nothing and that is 

2046
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,081
the beginning of wisdom and I had 
something that deeply terrifies me and 

2047
01:38:42,081 --> 01:38:43,950
you know,
ever since last September when I came to

2048
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:48,951
more like broader public attention,
one of the things I'd be terrified of 

2049
01:38:48,951 --> 01:38:52,431
making a mistake because I certainly 
know I'm more than capable of making a 

2050
01:38:52,431 --> 01:38:52,470
mistake and thank God so far.

2051
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:55,200
Either I haven't made one or no one's 
found out about it.

2052
01:38:55,590 --> 01:38:57,870
So.
But it's like,

2053
01:38:57,930 --> 01:39:02,930
you know,
we walk on a very thin and narrow edge 

2054
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:06,350
and we're very lucky when things aren't 
degenerating into chaos around us or 

2055
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:10,400
rapidly moving too far,
too much order and it's not an easy 

2056
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,870
thing to stay on that line and you can 
tell when you stay,

2057
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:16,900
you're on that line because the things 
are deeply meaningful and engaging when 

2058
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:20,571
you're on that line.
But if you're not existentially 

2059
01:39:20,571 --> 01:39:21,720
terrified about the consequences of 
wavering off that,

2060
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:24,690
then you are truly not awake.
So.

2061
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:26,740
And that's what I see in this picture,
you know,

2062
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,760
it's like look out man,
because there are rules and if you break

2063
01:39:31,921 --> 01:39:33,750
them,
God help you.

2064
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:43,430
Thank you.

2065
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,250
So one of the things that seems to be 
the case with regard,

2066
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:48,510
I mentioned this in the question period 
a bit last time,

2067
01:39:48,511 --> 01:39:53,511
is that one of the things that seems to 
be actually one of the advantages to 

2068
01:39:53,511 --> 01:39:57,621
gluing the new testament onto the old 
testament is the idea of a 

2069
01:39:57,621 --> 01:40:01,010
transformation and morality that is 
analogous to the Piagetian idea that 

2070
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:04,350
after you learn to play by the rules,
you can learn to make the rules.

2071
01:40:04,351 --> 01:40:07,590
Because I think that's actually what 
happens to some degree in the transition

2072
01:40:07,591 --> 01:40:09,960
between the Old Testament and the new 
testament,

2073
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:13,140
because in the Old Testament,
most morality is prohibition.

2074
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:15,220
Here are things you shouldn't do.
It's like,

2075
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:20,590
fair enough.
Now it's a lot of what you do with your 

2076
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:20,590
kids.
Don't do this.

2077
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:20,590
Don't do this.
Do it.

2078
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:25,580
Especially when they're happy,
you're always going around and telling 

2079
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:25,620
them to stop being so happy because all 
they're doing is causing trouble.

2080
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:27,840
It's quite painful if you're a parent 
and you noticed that,

2081
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,030
but the first morality is prohibition,
right?

2082
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,050
Control yourself so you don't cause too 
much trouble.

2083
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:36,630
And then maybe if you get that down and 
you're good at it,

2084
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:37,620
then the next thing is,
well,

2085
01:40:37,621 --> 01:40:42,621
once you're disciplined,
then you can start working towards 

2086
01:40:42,621 --> 01:40:44,190
something that's a positive good.
And that's the transformation that seems

2087
01:40:44,191 --> 01:40:49,191
to me to be fundamentally characteristic
of the juxtaposition of the new 

2088
01:40:49,191 --> 01:40:50,610
testament onto the old testament.
But in these images,

2089
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:53,160
it's still something like serve 
tradition.

2090
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:57,910
Serve the father,
psychologically speaking,

2091
01:40:58,090 --> 01:41:02,250
support the tradition because you live 
on it there.

2092
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:04,610
In the old Mesopotamian story,
um,

2093
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:06,000
the Enuma Elish,
which you can,

2094
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:11,100
which you can read about if you're 
interested in the original gods who are 

2095
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,310
really badly behaved,
they're like two year olds.

2096
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:14,110
In fact,
there are a lot like two year olds,

2097
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:19,870
they kill the primordial God absolute 
who's the Patriarchal God,

2098
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:21,550
to kill them and try to live on his 
corpse.

2099
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:23,350
Well,
that's what we all do,

2100
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:28,410
right?
Because we live on a corpse of our 

2101
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:30,031
ancestors.
You could say we live in the Corpus of 

2102
01:41:30,031 --> 01:41:31,881
our culture.
It's dead and that's not a great place 

2103
01:41:31,881 --> 01:41:31,881
to live.
So you have to keep reinventing it.

2104
01:41:31,881 --> 01:41:35,110
So the damn thing you know,
stays active and awake.

2105
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:40,190
You,
you stay on the carbs for too long and 

2106
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:40,810
then the devil of or the demon of chaos 
comes back.

2107
01:41:40,811 --> 01:41:42,700
And that's what happens in the 
Mesopotamian story.

2108
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:47,701
It's like,
don't be thinking that you can stay on 

2109
01:41:47,701 --> 01:41:50,671
the core of your ancestors for too long 
without contributing to the 

2110
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:54,580
revivification of the system because the
chaos that all of that holds,

2111
01:41:54,581 --> 01:41:59,581
that all of that holds,
that Bay will definitely come and visit 

2112
01:41:59,581 --> 01:42:03,121
you.
And you'll see that in stories like a 

2113
01:42:03,121 --> 01:42:03,121
Hobbit,
you know,

2114
01:42:03,121 --> 01:42:04,090
hobbits,
they're nice,

2115
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:05,330
they like to eat,
they're kind of fat,

2116
01:42:05,331 --> 01:42:06,670
they're short,
they're not very bright,

2117
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:07,990
you know,
they're a hubris stick.

2118
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:10,660
They have no idea what's out there in 
the broader world.

2119
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:15,720
They're protected.
If you remember by the striders who are 

2120
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:16,090
the sons of great kings who look like 
tramps,

2121
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:21,240
they have nothing but contempt for them.
They patrol the borders and keep the 

2122
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:21,850
bloody harbored safe.
But I would.

2123
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:26,140
They're it out there in the periphery.
All Hell is brewing and chaos is,

2124
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,420
is,
is generating and forming.

2125
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:33,780
And that's an archetypal story.
And that's why people liked that story 

2126
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,700
so much because that's exactly right.
Like we're the hobbits and there are,

2127
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:40,810
we are protected from chaos by the 
spirits of our data ancestors and we're 

2128
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:42,220
too damn stupid to know it.
And we think,

2129
01:42:42,221 --> 01:42:43,960
oh well we don't need them anymore.
And that,

2130
01:42:43,961 --> 01:42:45,370
to me,
that's postmodernism.

2131
01:42:45,371 --> 01:42:50,371
That's what the bloody universities are 
doing with the humanities to absolutely 

2132
01:42:50,371 --> 01:42:50,890
appalling.
And we will pay for it.

2133
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:56,310
So unless we wake up and hopefully we'll
wake up because that would be better 

2134
01:42:56,310 --> 01:42:58,270
than paying for it even though being 
awake is rather painful.

2135
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:02,470
So.
So then I had this vision one time and I

2136
01:43:02,471 --> 01:43:05,550
kind of portrayed in this,
in this image of,

2137
01:43:05,551 --> 01:43:07,780
of what the world was like.
And I thought,

2138
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:09,190
well,
it's not a pyramid.

2139
01:43:09,191 --> 01:43:11,530
It's not a single hierarchy of 
authority.

2140
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:12,820
That's not what it is.
It's,

2141
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:17,970
it's an array of hierarchy of authority.
So you imagine this sort of infinite 

2142
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:21,991
plane and in the infinite plane there's 
nothing but pyramids and inside the 

2143
01:43:21,991 --> 01:43:24,240
Pyramids there are strata of people 
everywhere,

2144
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:26,770
far as you can look.
Some of the pyramids are tall,

2145
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:28,810
some of them are short,
they overlap there.

2146
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:33,830
It's endless.
The plane is endless and those are all 

2147
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:36,361
the positions to which you could rise 
and everybody's inside the pyramid sort 

2148
01:43:36,361 --> 01:43:38,530
of crammed up trying to move towards the
top.

2149
01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:43,650
And then there's the possibility of 
sailing across overtop of all of them 

2150
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:44,920
and seeing how the structure itself 
works.

2151
01:43:44,921 --> 01:43:49,921
And that's.
And that's the I that floats above the 

2152
01:43:49,921 --> 01:43:51,650
pyramid and the sees the structure 
itself and the highest order of being is

2153
01:43:51,651 --> 01:43:56,651
not to be at the top of the pyramid,
it's to use the discipline that you 

2154
01:43:56,651 --> 01:44:00,560
attained by striving towards the top of 
the pyramid to release yourself from the

2155
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:03,170
pyramid and move one step up.
And that's,

2156
01:44:03,171 --> 01:44:06,200
I think that's one of the things that's 
instantiated in the idea of the,

2157
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,970
for example,
of the Holy Ghost.

2158
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:09,050
So,

2159
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:17,020
and I think that's a kin to that that 
says office and need you to set of 

2160
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:17,020
Sisyphus,
if I remember correctly,

2161
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:21,461
that one has to imagine him happy.
Well if there's a rock at the bottom of 

2162
01:44:21,461 --> 01:44:26,081
the hill,
then you might as well push it up the 

2163
01:44:26,081 --> 01:44:26,081
hill.
And if it rolls back down,

2164
01:44:26,081 --> 01:44:26,081
well then you've got something else to 
do.

2165
01:44:26,081 --> 01:44:31,001
Don't you can push the damn rock back up
the hill and there's no shortage of 

2166
01:44:31,001 --> 01:44:33,230
rocks to put up to push up the hill.
And that's what we're built for anyways.

2167
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:35,900
And so let's go out and like push them 
down,

2168
01:44:35,901 --> 01:44:38,510
boulders up the hill,
and then maybe we could have enough self

2169
01:44:38,511 --> 01:44:43,511
confidence and enough enough respect for
ourselves that we wouldn't have to turn 

2170
01:44:43,511 --> 01:44:47,501
to hatred and revenge and try to take 
everything down because I think that's 

2171
01:44:47,501 --> 01:44:49,610
the alternative.
So he's not weak.

2172
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,260
That's one thing you can say about them.

2173
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,620
Yeah,
same idea represented there,

2174
01:44:55,621 --> 01:44:56,520
right?
That's atlas.

2175
01:44:56,521 --> 01:44:58,650
Who voluntarily takes the world on his 
shoulders.

2176
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,370
It's like the idea of Christ taking the 
sins of the world on his shoulders.

2177
01:45:02,490 --> 01:45:07,490
It's exactly the same notion,
which is the notion that you should be 

2178
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:10,791
able to recognize in yourself all the 
horror of humanity and take 

2179
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:12,750
responsibility for it because that's 
what that means.

2180
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:17,900
And the thing that's so interesting 
about that is that if you can recognize 

2181
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:18,660
yourself in yourself,
all the horror of humanity,

2182
01:45:18,930 --> 01:45:23,930
you will instantly have a hell of a lot 
more respect for yourself than you did 

2183
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:27,051
before you did that.
Because there's some real utility in 

2184
01:45:27,051 --> 01:45:29,841
knowing that you're a monster now,
and just because you're a monster 

2185
01:45:29,841 --> 01:45:32,901
doesn't mean you have to be a monster,
but it's really useful to know that you 

2186
01:45:32,901 --> 01:45:35,880
are one.
So one of the things that you knew,

2187
01:45:35,881 --> 01:45:38,800
and this is something that I find so 
amazing about his writing,

2188
01:45:38,801 --> 01:45:40,950
is I think something that really 
distinguishes him,

2189
01:45:41,010 --> 01:45:46,010
for example,
from Joseph Campbell who talked about 

2190
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:46,010
following your bliss,
is like you said,

2191
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:50,331
very clearly that the first step to 
enlightenment is the encounter with the 

2192
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:54,021
shadow and what he meant by that was 
everything horrible that human beings 

2193
01:45:54,021 --> 01:45:58,500
have done was done by human beings and 
your one of the.

2194
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:04,080
And so if you don't understand that,
and to understand that really means to 

2195
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,490
know how it was that you could have done
it,

2196
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:08,400
and that's a shattering thing.
To try to imagine that.

2197
01:46:08,401 --> 01:46:12,690
To try to imagine yourself as someone 
who's engaged in medieval torture,

2198
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:17,840
to see how you could in fact do that.
You're never the same after you learned 

2199
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:21,551
that,
but being never the same after learning 

2200
01:46:21,551 --> 01:46:22,650
that is unbelievably useful.
Because when you understand that,

2201
01:46:22,651 --> 01:46:26,040
that's what you're like,
then your whole different creature and I

2202
01:46:26,041 --> 01:46:31,041
don't think,
and this is something I did learn from 

2203
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:32,841
young,
is that you cannot be a good person 

2204
01:46:32,841 --> 01:46:33,990
until you know how much evil you contain
within you.

2205
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:37,650
It is not possible and it's partly 
because you just don't have any potency.

2206
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,040
Like if you're just naive,
if you're just nice,

2207
01:46:41,041 --> 01:46:43,180
if you'd never hurt anyone,
you'd never heard of fly.

2208
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,880
You don't have the capability for any of
that.

2209
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,340
Why would anyone ever take you?
Seriously?

2210
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:48,780
You're,
you're just,

2211
01:46:48,781 --> 01:46:51,090
you're a animal at best,
you know,

2212
01:46:51,091 --> 01:46:52,770
and uh,
rather contemptible one at that.

2213
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:57,950
And it's a very strange thing because 
you wouldn't think that the revelation 

2214
01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:02,031
of the capacity for evil is a 
precondition for the realization of 

2215
01:47:02,031 --> 01:47:02,031
good.
But I believe that,

2216
01:47:02,031 --> 01:47:06,950
first of all,
why would you be serious enough to even 

2217
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:09,741
attempt to pursue the good?
Unless you had some sense of what the 

2218
01:47:09,741 --> 01:47:11,500
consequences of not doing it,
you,

2219
01:47:11,501 --> 01:47:13,710
you,
you have to be serious about these sorts

2220
01:47:13,711 --> 01:47:14,490
of things.
It's not a,

2221
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,710
it's not a,
it's not the game of a child,

2222
01:47:16,711 --> 01:47:19,260
right?
It's the game of a fully developed adult

2223
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,410
and you have learned this in part when I
had little kids,

2224
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:26,310
I wrote a chapter for my new book called
never let your children do anything that

2225
01:47:26,311 --> 01:47:27,210
makes you dislike them.

2226
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:29,580
And why was that?
And I read,

2227
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:34,610
I read that,
wrote that after I knew I was a monster 

2228
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:35,910
and I thought I'm going to make sure I 
like my kids.

2229
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:41,860
I'm going to make sure that they behave 
around me so that I liked them because 

2230
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:45,201
I'm way bigger than them and I'm way 
more cruel than they are and I've got 

2231
01:47:45,201 --> 01:47:47,670
tricks up my sleeve that they cannot 
even possibly imagine.

2232
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:50,610
And if,
if they irritate me,

2233
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:56,480
I will absolutely take it out on them.
And if you don't think that you're the 

2234
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,291
sort of person that would do that,
then you are the sort of person who is 

2235
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:00,570
doing it.

2236
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:17,580
You know,
we're not going to get to Adam and eve.

2237
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:22,610
Haha.
I watched this great documentary once a 

2238
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:25,480
called Hitman Hart and was about Bret 
Hart,

2239
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:29,050
who was the most famous Canadian in the 
world for awhile and he was,

2240
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:31,950
he was a world wide wrestling federation
wrestler,

2241
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:34,700
you know,
and he was a good guy and uh,

2242
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:38,460
he came from this famous family of 
wrestlers who all came from Alberta,

2243
01:48:38,461 --> 01:48:41,840
I think there were seven brothers who 
were wrestlers and seven sisters and all

2244
01:48:41,841 --> 01:48:45,510
of the sisters married wrestlers and 
they were all offspring.

2245
01:48:45,511 --> 01:48:47,010
Children of Stu Hart,
who,

2246
01:48:47,011 --> 01:48:47,610
who,
who,

2247
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:50,730
who was wrestling impresario like 40 
years ago.

2248
01:48:51,090 --> 01:48:54,360
And it was,
it was such a cool documentary because I

2249
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:58,770
was always wondering why in the world do
people watch wrestling and,

2250
01:48:58,870 --> 01:48:59,850
and,
and believe it,

2251
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,320
you know,
believe it.

2252
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:03,900
Do you believe movies when you go watch 
them?

2253
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:08,990
It's like,
that's a hard question to answer while 

2254
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:08,990
you're there.

2255
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:12,170
You do.
And so if you're watching wrestling and 

2256
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:12,170
you're a wrestling fan,
do you believe it?

2257
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:12,810
Well,
it isn't a matter of belief.

2258
01:49:12,811 --> 01:49:17,811
It's a matter of being engaged in a 
drama and there are different levels of 

2259
01:49:17,811 --> 01:49:17,811
drama.
Right?

2260
01:49:17,811 --> 01:49:22,611
So let's say worldwide Wrestling 
Federation drama is not the most 

2261
01:49:22,611 --> 01:49:26,391
sophisticated form of drama,
but I'm not being not being assessed 

2262
01:49:26,391 --> 01:49:31,071
smart Alec when I'm saying that there 
was drama of different sophistication 

2263
01:49:31,071 --> 01:49:35,571
for different people and that's also why
religious truths exists at multiple 

2264
01:49:35,571 --> 01:49:35,571
levels simultaneously.
Right?

2265
01:49:35,571 --> 01:49:40,460
There's gotta be something in it for 
everyone and that's a hard belief 

2266
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:40,560
system.
That's a hard system to put together.

2267
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:45,710
Something for the unbelievably 
sophisticated and something for the 

2268
01:49:45,710 --> 01:49:45,840
common person.
Okay.

2269
01:49:45,841 --> 01:49:48,100
So we have wrestling and Brett Hart was 
a good guy and

2270
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:51,730
he fell into the archetype of being a 
good guy and that's partly what the.

2271
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:54,010
What the story's about.
It was a bit too much for him,

2272
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:59,460
but one of the things that he he laid 
out so carefully was because he figured 

2273
01:49:59,621 --> 01:50:04,621
that a 120 million people knew him,
something like that and that everywhere 

2274
01:50:04,621 --> 01:50:08,371
he went,
he was treated like a hero and he found 

2275
01:50:08,371 --> 01:50:10,471
that quite a bit of quite a burden,
as you can imagine if you think about 

2276
01:50:10,471 --> 01:50:14,071
it,
but he portrayed what was happening in 

2277
01:50:14,071 --> 01:50:16,171
the wrestling ring as classic good 
against evil but not conceptualized in 

2278
01:50:16,241 --> 01:50:17,440
discussed,
right.

2279
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,150
Embodied,
fought out,

2280
01:50:19,151 --> 01:50:20,120
act it out,
you know,

2281
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:20,950
like,
like,

2282
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:24,340
like thor and the hulk,
except like right in front of you.

2283
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:29,230
And so.
Well that's exactly this sort of thing.

2284
01:50:29,231 --> 01:50:34,231
I mean,
we could consider hockey more 

2285
01:50:34,231 --> 01:50:34,231
sophisticated than wrestling,
perhaps not.

2286
01:50:34,231 --> 01:50:35,950
As I said,
I'm not being a critic of these.

2287
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:38,980
I am not being critically minded about 
these things.

2288
01:50:38,981 --> 01:50:42,310
I understand their purpose and I would 
highly recommend that documentary.

2289
01:50:42,311 --> 01:50:44,470
It's a brilliant documentary,
but this is,

2290
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,420
it's the same thing.
It's a Silver Cup,

2291
01:50:46,421 --> 01:50:51,421
right?
It's like there's the hero of the team 

2292
01:50:51,421 --> 01:50:51,640
that's the hero of the teams,
you know,

2293
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:56,730
here's something cool.
If you're the fan of the Toronto Blue 

2294
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:02,730
Jays are the Toronto Maple leafs,
of course this hardly ever happens to 

2295
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:02,950
you if you're a fan of the Toronto Maple
leafs because they always lose,

2296
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,960
but,
but,

2297
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:10,110
but if you're watching a game and your 
team wins and we take your testosterone 

2298
01:51:11,201 --> 01:51:15,250
levels,
then they went up and if you watched the

2299
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:17,260
Toronto Maple leafs and they lost and 
you're a fan,

2300
01:51:17,261 --> 01:51:20,860
then your testosterone levels go down.
So that's pretty damn funny,

2301
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:26,130
you know,
I mean really don't you see how deeply 

2302
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:26,130
instantiated this as in people.
I mean,

2303
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:28,640
it bloody well alters your biochemistry,
like your,

2304
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:30,580
your,
your testosterone levels.

2305
01:51:30,581 --> 01:51:34,810
It's all more my team lost know there'll
be no.

2306
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:36,850
There'll be nothing in it for the wife 
tonight.

2307
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:43,380
Yeah,

2308
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:57,210
well this is the cosmos.
I think from,

2309
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:00,430
from the phenomenological perspective,
and one of the things that,

2310
01:52:00,830 --> 01:52:05,830
that,
that has come to my realization is that 

2311
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:08,310
this is real.
This is real.

2312
01:52:08,311 --> 01:52:11,460
It's not a metaphor.
It's way deeper than a metaphor.

2313
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:17,060
The most real things about life are the 
place you don't know and the place you 

2314
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:18,150
know.
And you could say,

2315
01:52:18,151 --> 01:52:20,100
well,
that's explored territory and unexplored

2316
01:52:20,101 --> 01:52:23,370
territory that's real,
and it's been around forever.

2317
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:26,040
Back to the lobsters,
lobsters in a new place.

2318
01:52:26,041 --> 01:52:28,170
The first thing they do is go around 
their territory,

2319
01:52:28,171 --> 01:52:30,960
finding places to hide,
and also making a burrow.

2320
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:36,140
So the first thing they do is establish 
what they know against what they don't 

2321
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,200
know.
And that's real.

2322
01:52:37,201 --> 01:52:39,420
It's real from the Darwinian 
perspective.

2323
01:52:39,421 --> 01:52:42,570
And we're going to say that what's real 
from the Darwinian perspective is plenty

2324
01:52:42,571 --> 01:52:44,760
real enough because we're alive and 
everything.

2325
01:52:44,761 --> 01:52:46,100
And so sort of thing matters.

2326
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:46,940
It's like,
well,

2327
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:52,000
that's what this is the dallas symbol.
That's what it says is that what's Wade 

2328
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,961
says,
what is experienced made of eternally 

2329
01:52:55,961 --> 01:52:55,961
outs.
Easy.

2330
01:52:56,490 --> 01:52:57,740
Okay,
off in order.

2331
01:52:58,490 --> 01:53:03,490
And in every bit of chaos,
there's the possibility of order and 

2332
01:53:03,490 --> 01:53:03,560
every bit of order there's the 
possibility of chaos.

2333
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:05,060
And that's the way,
right?

2334
01:53:05,061 --> 01:53:07,460
That's the path of life,
that's life itself.

2335
01:53:07,461 --> 01:53:10,280
And where you're supposed to be is right
on the border between the two of those.

2336
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:14,420
And why is that stable enough?
Engaged enough,

2337
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:19,840
right?
So not only are you doing what you 

2338
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,241
should be doing,
you're doing it in a way that increases 

2339
01:53:22,241 --> 01:53:22,241
the probability that you'll do it better
tomorrow,

2340
01:53:22,241 --> 01:53:25,460
and you can tell when you're doing that 
because you're engaged,

2341
01:53:25,461 --> 01:53:28,660
you're in the right time and place,
and your,

2342
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:31,250
your,
your neurology tells you that.

2343
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:35,000
That's what meaning is.
That's what transcendent meaning is.

2344
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:39,350
And that's so cool because I also think 
that that is the antidote to existential

2345
01:53:39,351 --> 01:53:42,290
suffering.
The antidote to existential suffering is

2346
01:53:42,291 --> 01:53:47,291
to be at the right place at the right 
time and you know you want to get 

2347
01:53:47,291 --> 01:53:47,780
technical about it.
Okay?

2348
01:53:47,781 --> 01:53:50,030
Anxiety and pain,
that that's the key.

2349
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:52,940
That's the reality of existential 
suffering.

2350
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:58,390
Okay?
So let's say you're in the right place 

2351
01:53:58,390 --> 01:54:00,521
at the right time.
What happens to biochemically 

2352
01:54:00,521 --> 01:54:00,890
dopaminergic activation?
What does that do?

2353
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:04,420
Suppress this anxiety and it's 
analgesic.

2354
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:08,060
Now it's more than that because it also 
produces positive emotion and the desire

2355
01:54:08,061 --> 01:54:11,370
to move forward and it underlies 
creativity and,

2356
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:16,380
and so,
so not only do you get the positive 

2357
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:16,380
engagement from a neurochemical 
perspective,

2358
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:20,591
you get the Analgesia and you get the 
ante and you get the reduction of 

2359
01:54:20,591 --> 01:54:22,760
anxiety.
So it's not hypothetical,

2360
01:54:22,761 --> 01:54:25,130
it's an.
And it is the case that the dopaminergic

2361
01:54:25,131 --> 01:54:26,990
systems,
those are the exploratory systems,

2362
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:32,020
unbelievably ancient and archaic are 
activated when you're optimally 

2363
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:33,790
positioned to be,
to be,

2364
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:36,860
um,
what incorporating new information,

2365
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:41,920
which is what human beings do because 
we're information foragers and so we 

2366
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,910
want to be secure,
but building on our security at the same

2367
01:54:43,911 --> 01:54:44,210
time.

2368
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:48,170
And then we want to do it for ourselves.
We want to do it for other people.

2369
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:51,080
We want to do it for our families,
we want to do it for broader society.

2370
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:54,650
We want to bring the whole world 
together in alignment to do that.

2371
01:54:54,651 --> 01:54:59,651
And that's meaningful and God only knows
what we could do about the suffering of 

2372
01:54:59,651 --> 01:54:59,651
the world.
If we did that,

2373
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:04,740
you know,
we have no idea what we could do if we 

2374
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:07,841
started doing things properly and maybe 
so many of the things that dismay us 

2375
01:55:07,841 --> 01:55:07,841
about life.
We could,

2376
01:55:07,841 --> 01:55:09,140
we could stop.
I mean,

2377
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:11,330
we stopped a lot of them in the last 
hundred years.

2378
01:55:11,630 --> 01:55:14,210
You know,
things are a lot better than they were a

2379
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:15,890
hundred years ago.
Obviously they're not perfect,

2380
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,800
but 100 years ago,
120 years ago,

2381
01:55:18,801 --> 01:55:19,280
man,
you know,

2382
01:55:19,281 --> 01:55:24,281
the average person in the western world 
lived on less than a dollar a day in 

2383
01:55:24,281 --> 01:55:28,151
today's dollars.
It's like he just try that for a week 

2384
01:55:28,151 --> 01:55:30,770
and see how much fun that is.
So the daoists wow,

2385
01:55:30,771 --> 01:55:31,580
what is this?
Well,

2386
01:55:31,581 --> 01:55:36,581
this is the pre caused chaos out of 
which the word of God extracted 

2387
01:55:36,581 --> 01:55:37,700
habitable order at the beginning of 
time.

2388
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:41,590
It's the same thing.
It's the same thing and that chaos.

2389
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:47,380
We'll talk a bit more about that later I
guess because it's a very complicated 

2390
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:47,380
thing to,
to describe,

2391
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:52,311
but it's certainly the thing that when 
you encounter the chaos is what you 

2392
01:55:52,311 --> 01:55:52,770
encounter when the twin towers fall.

2393
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:55,870
Right.
Do you remember what that was like?

2394
01:55:55,871 --> 01:55:57,940
Right,
so it was.

2395
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,730
It was September 10th.
While that was the World Cup.

2396
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:05,850
Everyone knew what the world was like 
and then it was September 11th and 

2397
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:08,791
everyone walked around days for three 
days because the building's felt,

2398
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:13,540
but so what?
You can see a building fall.

2399
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:16,660
You can understand what it's.
What happens when a building falls,

2400
01:56:16,661 --> 01:56:21,661
so then what's going on with the being 
dazed while it's the chaos that 

2401
01:56:21,661 --> 01:56:25,441
underlies or how to bill order 
manifested itself in those buildings 

2402
01:56:25,441 --> 01:56:28,501
collapsed.
It was a brilliant act of terrorism and 

2403
01:56:28,501 --> 01:56:31,081
everyone was frozen and curious because 
that's how we react to that sort of 

2404
01:56:31,081 --> 01:56:31,570
thing.
The,

2405
01:56:31,630 --> 01:56:32,710
the.
It's like,

2406
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:34,960
it's like the shark.
You don't remember that famous,

2407
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:40,520
that famous movie poster for jaws with 
the woman's swimming on the top of the 

2408
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:43,290
water in that terrible leviathan shark 
underneath coming up too,

2409
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:44,770
to take her out.
Well,

2410
01:56:44,771 --> 01:56:45,760
that's life,
man.

2411
01:56:45,761 --> 01:56:50,761
That's the world.
And now and then you see that and when 

2412
01:56:50,761 --> 01:56:50,830
something falls like the twin towers 
fall,

2413
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:53,740
you remember that?
The ocean below you the abyss,

2414
01:56:53,741 --> 01:56:55,090
right?
The primordial best.

2415
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:56,950
That bloody thing is deep.

2416
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:02,280
And the end,
you're a fragile and that happens when 

2417
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:02,280
someone betrays you and it's happened.
It happens to you.

2418
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:07,201
When your dreams fall apart,
you encounter that chaos again from 

2419
01:57:07,201 --> 01:57:10,441
which the world is extracted.
And then you're called upon to act out 

2420
01:57:10,441 --> 01:57:13,300
attention and the word in order to bring
the world back into order.

2421
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,980
And none of that is,
none of that is superstitious.

2422
01:57:18,010 --> 01:57:21,010
None of that is superstitious.
None of that's even metaphorical.

2423
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,180
It's real,
it's real.

2424
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:28,200
It's more real than anything else.
And I think the reason for that in part 

2425
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,160
is that this has been.
It's been this way forever,

2426
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:32,890
right?
As long as there's been life,

2427
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:37,990
this has been the rule of life.
And that's the cosmos.

2428
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:40,090
That's reality.
That's what we inhabit.

2429
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:42,190
And so one of the things,
you know,

2430
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:44,960
the,
the so called new atheists tonight,

2431
01:57:44,961 --> 01:57:48,790
I don't want to go on a tangent about 
new atheist because I think atheists are

2432
01:57:48,791 --> 01:57:52,210
often remarkably honest and very 
consistent in their analysis.

2433
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:57,540
So,
but I just don't think they're taking 

2434
01:57:57,540 --> 01:57:58,270
the problem seriously.
They're like,

2435
01:57:58,290 --> 01:58:03,290
I don't think they take their 
evolutionary theorizing nearly with the 

2436
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:05,700
seriousness that it that it 
necessitates,

2437
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:07,710
and I don't think that.

2438
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:16,220
I don't think that you can dispute the 
proposition that the longer something 

2439
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:20,781
has had a selection effect on life,
the more real it is.

2440
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:27,170
It's the fundamental axiom of Darwinian 
biology and I think the Darwinian world 

2441
01:58:28,021 --> 01:58:33,021
is more real than the physical world.
That was the argument that I was trying 

2442
01:58:33,021 --> 01:58:34,140
to have with,
with with Sam Harris and I didn't do the

2443
01:58:34,141 --> 01:58:39,141
world's best job of that.
Although it went not too bad the second 

2444
01:58:39,141 --> 01:58:39,141
time,
but it's.

2445
01:58:39,141 --> 01:58:43,270
It's not something to be taken lightly.
It's a very serious,

2446
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:48,300
profound and meaningful proposition and 
people acted out and want to act it out 

2447
01:58:48,611 --> 01:58:52,210
whether they know it or not.
That's Martin.

2448
01:58:54,450 --> 01:58:57,690
So the story of Martin,
I'll just give it to you very briefly.

2449
01:58:59,450 --> 01:59:02,600
Time out and aps who are locked in 
embrace at the beginning of time.

2450
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:06,350
God is of salt water garden,
fresh water together,

2451
01:59:06,530 --> 01:59:08,240
chaos and order,
right?

2452
01:59:08,570 --> 01:59:10,640
They give rise masculine,
feminine.

2453
01:59:10,641 --> 01:59:13,220
They give rise to the world of the elder
gods and those are,

2454
01:59:13,221 --> 01:59:18,221
to me,
they're primordial motivational forces 

2455
01:59:18,221 --> 01:59:20,380
or something like that and their rage 
and their lust and their love and all 

2456
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:25,181
these things that possess us that are 
there forever and they're out in the 

2457
01:59:25,181 --> 01:59:28,481
world acting and they carelessly slay 
appsu their father and their making a 

2458
01:59:29,451 --> 01:59:32,940
rocket and then they collapse zoo and 
then tie them out,

2459
01:59:33,530 --> 01:59:35,780
gets wind of that,
and that's time out right there.

2460
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:40,840
By the way,
she's kind of a rough looking creature 

2461
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:43,960
and she's the mother of all things and 
so she's not very happy about this 

2462
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:48,060
though.
Her children have destroyed structure 

2463
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:51,461
itself,
plus they're noisy and careless and so 

2464
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:51,461
she thinks all right,
just like Noah,

2465
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:55,520
just like the God that brings the flood 
to know what exactly the same idea.

2466
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:57,190
Time Matt comes back and says,
you know,

2467
01:59:57,191 --> 01:59:58,760
okay,
enough is enough.

2468
01:59:59,030 --> 02:00:03,140
I'm going to take you out,
and she makes this battalion of monsters

2469
02:00:03,141 --> 02:00:06,650
and puts the worst monster there.
Is that the head of the battalion,

2470
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:07,820
his name is king.
Knew.

2471
02:00:07,850 --> 02:00:12,410
He's like a precursor to the idea of 
Satan and she lets the gods know,

2472
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:14,720
hey,
I'm coming for you,

2473
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,210
and so they're not very happy about this
because their gods,

2474
02:00:17,211 --> 02:00:18,380
but like,
yeah,

2475
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:20,450
she's chaos itself.
Right?

2476
02:00:20,451 --> 02:00:22,970
She gave birth to everything.
This is no joke,

2477
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:28,210
and so they send one got out after 
another to confront her and they all 

2478
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:28,460
come back with their tails between their
legs.

2479
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:33,720
There is no hope and then one day 
there's a new God that emerges and 

2480
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,000
that's Marduk and the gods know,
as soon as he pops up,

2481
02:00:35,001 --> 02:00:36,930
they know he's something new.
Remember,

2482
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:41,940
and this is happening while the 
Mesopotamians are assembling themselves 

2483
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:43,100
into one of the world's first great 
civilizations.

2484
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:48,250
So all the gods of all of those tribes 
are coming together to organize 

2485
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,750
themselves into a hierarchy to figure 
out what proposition rules,

2486
02:00:50,751 --> 02:00:54,110
everything.
And so Marta has elected by all the gods

2487
02:00:54,111 --> 02:00:55,220
and he says,
look,

2488
02:00:55,221 --> 02:00:57,350
I'll go out there and I'll take on time 
map,

2489
02:00:57,351 --> 02:01:00,290
but here's the rule from here on,
you follow me.

2490
02:01:00,350 --> 02:01:03,050
I determined destiny.
I'm the top God.

2491
02:01:03,051 --> 02:01:06,110
I'm the thing at the top of the 
hierarchy and all the other gods say,

2492
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:07,550
hey look,
no problem.

2493
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:11,630
You get rid of chaos.
We do exactly what you say.

2494
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:14,150
Now Martin,
his eyes all the way around his head and

2495
02:01:14,151 --> 02:01:19,151
he speaks magic words.
Those are his primary attributes and so 

2496
02:01:19,151 --> 02:01:22,331
he takes a net and he goes out to 
confront time at and and he,

2497
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:23,240
he,
he,

2498
02:01:23,330 --> 02:01:26,420
he encloses her in the neck,
which I think is so cool because it's an

2499
02:01:26,421 --> 02:01:27,500
encapsulation,
right?

2500
02:01:27,501 --> 02:01:32,030
It's a conceptual encapsulation.
He encloses chaos itself in a conceptual

2501
02:01:32,031 --> 02:01:37,031
structure.
He puts it in the net and then he cuts 

2502
02:01:37,031 --> 02:01:38,750
her into pieces and he makes the world 
and then

2503
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:47,860
that he creates human beings to inhabit 
that world and to serve the gods and he 

2504
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:48,280
creates human beings out of the blood of
king,

2505
02:01:48,281 --> 02:01:52,520
of the worst of the demons.
And that took me a call.

2506
02:01:52,521 --> 02:01:57,521
Andy Young,
who was a student of mine helped me 

2507
02:01:57,521 --> 02:01:57,521
figure that out.
He thought,

2508
02:01:57,521 --> 02:01:57,521
because that's pretty damn pessimistic.
It's like,

2509
02:01:57,521 --> 02:02:00,590
you know what exactly?
It sounds like a fall metaphor.

2510
02:02:00,591 --> 02:02:02,390
It's like the idea of original sin,
but,

2511
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:07,680
but our joint conclusion with regards to
that was that human beings are the only 

2512
02:02:09,501 --> 02:02:13,610
creatures in creation that can truly 
deceive,

2513
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:15,830
right?
We have the capacity for evil,

2514
02:02:15,831 --> 02:02:17,720
just like it says in the Adam and Eve 
story.

2515
02:02:17,721 --> 02:02:20,460
We can actually do that and that's why 
we're made out of the blood of King,

2516
02:02:20,461 --> 02:02:24,830
knew the king of the demons,
the we are that thing that can deceive,

2517
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:27,500
that can twist the structure of reality.
Well,

2518
02:02:27,501 --> 02:02:31,460
so Marduk now the massive team has had 
an emperor,

2519
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:33,620
right?
And the emperor was the

2520
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:37,370
Avatar of Marta.
That's what made him emperor.

2521
02:02:37,371 --> 02:02:39,490
He was only at Emperor.
If he was going to be Murdoch,

2522
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,190
he had to be a good duck.
Which man,

2523
02:02:41,191 --> 02:02:43,030
he.
I do confront time,

2524
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:47,630
chaos and cut her up and make order out 
of her pieces and what the Mesopotamians

2525
02:02:47,631 --> 02:02:49,760
used to do.
After New Year's celebration,

2526
02:02:49,761 --> 02:02:54,761
they'd go outside their walled city and 
that's explored territory versus 

2527
02:02:54,761 --> 02:02:58,661
unexplored territory.
They go outside their world's citi into 

2528
02:02:58,661 --> 02:03:01,181
chaos,
and they bring all the statutes that 

2529
02:03:01,181 --> 02:03:03,311
represented the gods and they'd act this
out because they're trying to figure 

2530
02:03:03,311 --> 02:03:03,311
something out,
right?

2531
02:03:03,311 --> 02:03:04,370
You're trying to figure out what this 
means.

2532
02:03:04,371 --> 02:03:09,371
They're acting it out,
and then they'd take their emperor and 

2533
02:03:09,371 --> 02:03:10,040
the priest would make them kneel and 
they take all his king,

2534
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:16,060
all his king uniform off is emperor 
uniform off and make them Neil and 

2535
02:03:16,060 --> 02:03:17,900
humiliate them and nail them with a 
glove and say,

2536
02:03:17,901 --> 02:03:22,901
okay,
how were you not a good Martech this 

2537
02:03:22,901 --> 02:03:22,901
year?

2538
02:03:22,901 --> 02:03:26,410
Right?
And then he'd recount all the ways that 

2539
02:03:26,410 --> 02:03:28,931
he was inadequate in confronting chaos,
and then they'd do the celebration and 

2540
02:03:28,931 --> 02:03:32,030
Martech would win and the king would go 
sleep with a royal prostitute.

2541
02:03:32,031 --> 02:03:37,031
And the reason for that was it's the 
same idea as St George pulling the 

2542
02:03:37,031 --> 02:03:41,291
Virgin from the Dragon.
It's exactly the same idea that if you 

2543
02:03:41,291 --> 02:03:42,200
call,
if you encounter the reptilian chaos,

2544
02:03:42,201 --> 02:03:46,190
you can extract something out of it with
which if you unite,

2545
02:03:46,191 --> 02:03:51,191
you produce creative order.
That's what they were acting out and 

2546
02:03:51,191 --> 02:03:52,970
that was the basis for the Mesopotamian 
idea of sovereignty.

2547
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:56,000
It's so smart,
it's so unbelievably smart,

2548
02:03:56,270 --> 02:04:01,270
and you know,
the Mesopotamians had a massive 

2549
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:01,640
influence on the civilizations that then
had a massive influence on us.

2550
02:04:01,641 --> 02:04:05,780
It's one of the stories of how the 
notion of sovereignty itself came to be.

2551
02:04:05,990 --> 02:04:09,770
It's the evolution of the idea of God.
That's one way of thinking about it,

2552
02:04:09,771 --> 02:04:14,771
but even more importantly,
it's the evolution of the idea of the 

2553
02:04:14,771 --> 02:04:15,530
redemptive human being.
Right,

2554
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:18,710
and that's taken to.
It's one of its conclusions while in the

2555
02:04:18,711 --> 02:04:20,870
story of Buddha,
but also in the story of Christ,

2556
02:04:20,871 --> 02:04:23,420
the idea of the perfect individual and 
the notion is,

2557
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:28,660
well,
that's the word that speaks truth into 

2558
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:29,030
chaos at the beginning of time to 
generate habitable order.

2559
02:04:29,031 --> 02:04:31,430
That is good.
That's the story.

2560
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:33,170
And so with that,

2561
02:04:38,030 --> 02:04:38,970
let's see.

2562
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:44,880
Oh sure.
I'll just show you these pictures 

2563
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:44,880
because they're so interesting once you 
know what they mean.

2564
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,570
They're so cool.
That's a symbol of infinity.

2565
02:04:47,090 --> 02:04:48,920
That's Hercules and the hydro.
Well,

2566
02:04:48,921 --> 02:04:51,220
what's life like?
It cut off one head.

2567
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:53,740
What happens?
Seven more grow,

2568
02:04:53,980 --> 02:04:54,970
right?
What do you do?

2569
02:04:54,971 --> 02:04:56,110
Run whole.
Well,

2570
02:04:56,111 --> 02:04:57,700
no,
that's not what you do it.

2571
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:00,160
This is what you do.
You fight it.

2572
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:06,180
It's the.
It's the chaos that generates partial 

2573
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:10,581
chaos.
It's the ultimate chaos that generates 

2574
02:05:10,581 --> 02:05:12,591
partial chaos,
but that also is what revivified his 

2575
02:05:12,591 --> 02:05:12,591
life because otherwise it would just be 
static.

2576
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:21,600
Mercury headed Hydra,
right?

2577
02:05:21,730 --> 02:05:23,920
Freezes.
You have St George.

2578
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:26,380
He's doing it peacefully,
which is so interesting,

2579
02:05:26,381 --> 02:05:28,240
right?
There's got to be a terrific look on his

2580
02:05:28,241 --> 02:05:31,090
face and that particular representation.
Another St George,

2581
02:05:31,091 --> 02:05:32,710
right?
The Virgin in the background.

2582
02:05:32,711 --> 02:05:34,750
I think that's safe and if I remember 
correctly,

2583
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:41,480
St George,
he's the patron saint of England.

2584
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:42,660
Okay.

2585
02:05:43,690 --> 02:05:46,050
Here's an interesting one.
This actually sheds light on,

2586
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,940
on the human proclivity for warfare.
Say George,

2587
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:54,180
that's a Muslim soldier.
It's really easy to transform the enemy 

2588
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:55,060
into the Dragon,
right?

2589
02:05:55,061 --> 02:05:58,000
Because the enemy is often the Predator 
and we do that instantaneously,

2590
02:05:58,020 --> 02:05:59,500
right?
With without a second thought,

2591
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:03,730
and so then we can go to war morally 
because why not take out the snakes?

2592
02:06:04,330 --> 02:06:04,990
Well,
you know,

2593
02:06:05,020 --> 02:06:07,360
the problem is where are the snakes?
Well,

2594
02:06:07,361 --> 02:06:09,550
maybe they're outside and maybe they're 
not.

2595
02:06:09,610 --> 02:06:11,590
Maybe they're in this room and even 
worse,

2596
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:13,720
maybe they were in you and that's 
wisdom.

2597
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:18,870
When you know that they're renew,
why wouldn't she be happy about that?

2598
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:24,620
Especially if she had a.
especially if she had a child right?

2599
02:06:24,650 --> 02:06:29,650
Seriously,
and that's horace,

2600
02:06:34,261 --> 02:06:35,820
right?
The God of vision,

2601
02:06:36,150 --> 02:06:41,150
and he was a.
He was a can because falcons have great 

2602
02:06:41,150 --> 02:06:45,621
vision.
They fly above everything and they can 

2603
02:06:45,621 --> 02:06:45,840
see everything and so that was the 
Egyptian creative God,

2604
02:06:45,841 --> 02:06:47,670
Horus,
and I'll tell you the story about horace

2605
02:06:47,671 --> 02:06:52,671
at some points as well.
Now here's some pictures that 

2606
02:06:53,751 --> 02:06:58,751
demonstrate what I had described as the 
emergence of let's say the Metta hero 

2607
02:06:58,751 --> 02:07:03,611
out of the hero,
so there's the person you admire and 

2608
02:07:03,611 --> 02:07:06,341
then there's the set of people that you 
admire and then there's the set of 

2609
02:07:06,341 --> 02:07:08,330
admirable people and the extraction of 
that ideal.

2610
02:07:08,510 --> 02:07:13,510
As far as I can tell,
that's just what's portrayed in these 

2611
02:07:13,510 --> 02:07:13,510
images.

2612
02:07:20,910 --> 02:07:23,370
That's a great one.
It's very sophisticated image.

2613
02:07:23,371 --> 02:07:26,160
You see the two sides of Christ's face 
or not.

2614
02:07:26,310 --> 02:07:30,560
Oh,
symmetrical one's garden ones,

2615
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:32,580
man.
That's what that icon means,

2616
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:34,770
and so the fully developed person in 
this,

2617
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:39,280
it's one of the oldest representations 
of of this sort that we know.

2618
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:40,420
The idea is that

2619
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:43,280
there's a,
there's the human person

2620
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:47,600
in his ordinariness let's say,
and then there's this,

2621
02:07:48,020 --> 02:07:53,020
this kinship with the divine that's 
associated with the willing adoption of 

2622
02:07:53,121 --> 02:07:58,121
the responsibility of moral mortal being
and that produces this union and then 

2623
02:07:58,121 --> 02:08:00,140
it's manifest in a book,
right?

2624
02:08:00,141 --> 02:08:02,720
Because that speech and it's associated 
with the sun,

2625
02:08:03,230 --> 02:08:04,970
right?
It's the proper way of being.

2626
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:15,790
And that's a perfect example,
I think of the emergence of the 

2627
02:08:15,790 --> 02:08:17,390
archetype of the multitude.
That's what it looks like to me.

2628
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:32,610
And so I guess now we're done with 
genesis one and that took three 

2629
02:08:32,610 --> 02:08:34,130
lectures,
but God is complicated,

2630
02:08:34,131 --> 02:08:35,150
you know,
that's the thing.

2631
02:08:35,820 --> 02:08:36,070
So

2632
02:08:40,790 --> 02:08:45,790
thank you.
So thank you.

2633
02:08:50,830 --> 02:08:52,450
Next week.
By all appearances,

2634
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:57,310
that's where we are.
So we've got 20 minutes

2635
02:08:57,470 --> 02:08:59,270
questions.
So,

2636
02:08:59,271 --> 02:09:01,520
um,
in the past I've done some work with big

2637
02:09:01,521 --> 02:09:02,780
brother,
big sister and whatever.

2638
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:07,970
Um,
that being said that the most common 

2639
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:07,970
story I tend to hear from the youth is 
that they read,

2640
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:10,760
they're raising a single family home,
usually with a mom,

2641
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:13,190
daddy's there on the picture and 
alcoholic,

2642
02:09:13,191 --> 02:09:14,150
whatever,
whatever that brought her.

2643
02:09:14,450 --> 02:09:19,450
So we have this child who is trying to 
seek ways to make himself healthy and 

2644
02:09:21,231 --> 02:09:23,900
empower himself in ways that a healthy 
father should have done.

2645
02:09:23,901 --> 02:09:24,710
So,
you know,

2646
02:09:24,711 --> 02:09:26,480
between the formative years of like one 
to four.

2647
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:27,410
So I think,
you know,

2648
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:28,550
ongoing with this,
um,

2649
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:34,150
how,
let's say for someone who born without 

2650
02:09:34,150 --> 02:09:34,150
like a good father figure,
where would they go out in the world and

2651
02:09:34,150 --> 02:09:37,450
like what four spheres of influence 
where they try to expose themselves to,

2652
02:09:37,451 --> 02:09:42,451
to like gain access to that Fountain of 
Health and knowledge at a father or a 

2653
02:09:43,851 --> 02:09:46,310
good father figures should have provided
them to in the first place.

2654
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:47,280
Okay.
Well partly,

2655
02:09:47,281 --> 02:09:50,490
I mean certainly to some degree a good 
mother can provide that,

2656
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:52,140
right?
To some degree,

2657
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:54,780
although it's hard for one person to be 
everything right.

2658
02:09:54,890 --> 02:09:59,890
You know,
and I think one of the conundrums that 

2659
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:01,701
face women,
and this is a tough one and this is why 

2660
02:10:01,701 --> 02:10:03,771
I think women are higher in trait 
agreeableness and higher in trait 

2661
02:10:03,771 --> 02:10:03,771
negative emotion is that,
you know,

2662
02:10:03,771 --> 02:10:07,950
the primary problem that a woman has 
with an infant is why not throw it out a

2663
02:10:07,951 --> 02:10:09,660
window?
Because it's very annoying,

2664
02:10:09,930 --> 02:10:12,450
I mean it's there all the time.
It's constant demand.

2665
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:17,480
It's absolutely constant man,
tremendous dependency and so a woman has

2666
02:10:17,521 --> 02:10:21,540
to be tilted towards mercy.
That's how it looks to me and especially

2667
02:10:21,541 --> 02:10:23,370
during.
It's so important during the.

2668
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:28,460
Especially the first year when children 
are so unbelievably vulnerable and so I 

2669
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:32,181
think it's very difficult for women to 
be merciful like that and to make the 

2670
02:10:32,181 --> 02:10:33,030
shift to encouraging.

2671
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:37,910
I think that's a very difficult thing 
for people to do simultaneously.

2672
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:40,040
Although you know,
people,

2673
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:45,190
people.
I'm not saying that women are always 

2674
02:10:45,190 --> 02:10:45,370
only merciful and men are always only 
encouraging disciplinarians,

2675
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:50,400
but things do sort themselves out to 
some degree like that and I think also 

2676
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:54,491
the biochemical transformations that 
accompany pregnancy and childbirth and 

2677
02:10:54,491 --> 02:10:58,781
lactation also tilt mother towards that 
as well because he has to really love 

2678
02:10:58,781 --> 02:10:59,000
that little thing.
Right?

2679
02:10:59,001 --> 02:11:00,620
It's,
it's number one,

2680
02:11:00,621 --> 02:11:05,621
no matter what it demands and then 
telling it what to do and making sure 

2681
02:11:05,621 --> 02:11:05,840
it's behaving properly.
That's,

2682
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:07,760
that's a whole different issue.
No,

2683
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:10,250
but the kids who lacked fathers,
I mean,

2684
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:15,880
first of all,
they can find that to some degree in 

2685
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:15,880
their friends and that's often look for 
the boys do in particular they,

2686
02:11:15,881 --> 02:11:19,310
they,
they go into gangs and they generate the

2687
02:11:19,311 --> 02:11:21,410
missing men masculinity in the game.

2688
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:24,500
Well that's not so good because like 
what the hell do they know it?

2689
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:25,880
Well,
they don't know anything,

2690
02:11:25,881 --> 02:11:30,881
right?
They're just stupid kids and they're 

2691
02:11:30,881 --> 02:11:31,040
like 15 years old and their testosterone
is pumping and they're trying to get the

2692
02:11:31,041 --> 02:11:33,890
hell away from their mother,
which is what they're supposed to do and

2693
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:38,030
they're not in the right position to 
exercise any authority over themselves.

2694
02:11:38,031 --> 02:11:41,060
So that's not good.
They can find it in education.

2695
02:11:41,061 --> 02:11:42,670
They can find it in books,
they can find it.

2696
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:45,470
Movies,
they can find it in sports heroes and so

2697
02:11:45,471 --> 02:11:50,471
forth because the image of the father is
fragmented and distributed among the 

2698
02:11:50,471 --> 02:11:50,900
community,
but it's very,

2699
02:11:50,901 --> 02:11:53,800
very difficult to not have a father.
And you know,

2700
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:55,550
one of the things that we're doing in 
our society,

2701
02:11:55,551 --> 02:11:58,430
which I think is,
I think it's absolutely appalling,

2702
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:01,940
is that we're making the case that all 
families are equal.

2703
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:03,200
It's like,
sorry,

2704
02:12:03,350 --> 02:12:06,980
no wrong.
And there's no empirical data supporting

2705
02:12:06,981 --> 02:12:08,120
that proposition.
By the way.

2706
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:11,600
It's much better for kids to have two 
parents who those parents are.

2707
02:12:11,601 --> 02:12:16,601
That's a whole different issue.
And if I could just to add one more 

2708
02:12:16,601 --> 02:12:16,730
thing,
how would you ask that question too?

2709
02:12:16,731 --> 02:12:19,160
Let's see.
A daughter who is her father because she

2710
02:12:19,161 --> 02:12:24,161
would often see how different ways to 
find those fragments of her missing 

2711
02:12:24,161 --> 02:12:26,891
father then like a boy wouldn't said 
because obviously they're raised 

2712
02:12:26,891 --> 02:12:26,891
differently or at least they should have
been.

2713
02:12:26,891 --> 02:12:28,070
Well,
I think it's the same issue.

2714
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:28,820
You know?
I mean,

2715
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:34,170
I think,
I think that another danger that 

2716
02:12:34,170 --> 02:12:34,170
emerges,
Mrs Freud's of course famous observation

2717
02:12:34,170 --> 02:12:34,880
is that,
you know,

2718
02:12:34,881 --> 02:12:39,881
if,
if there's mum and child or father and 

2719
02:12:39,881 --> 02:12:41,210
child relationship can get a little 
closer than it should.

2720
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:46,540
And then the lines get blurry and mixed.
And I'm not saying that that happens to 

2721
02:12:46,540 --> 02:12:46,920
everyone obviously,
but,

2722
02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:50,300
but it's still a danger that that's 
inherent in the situation.

2723
02:12:50,450 --> 02:12:54,470
They're thrust together too tightly 
without sufficient resources.

2724
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:57,890
And so the responsibility has to be 
distributed more and like,

2725
02:12:57,891 --> 02:13:02,891
I really do think that it's the sign of 
the degeneration of the society when 

2726
02:13:02,891 --> 02:13:02,990
the,
when,

2727
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:07,040
when single parenthood becomes anything 
approximating the norm,

2728
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:09,470
it's not a good idea.
Then the,

2729
02:13:09,471 --> 02:13:11,090
I.
part of the reason I believe that,

2730
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:16,080
and I think this has to do with the 
overwhelming selfishness of,

2731
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:18,020
of,
of modern life,

2732
02:13:18,050 --> 02:13:20,210
is that marriage isn't for the people 
who are married.

2733
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:25,010
It's for the children obviously.
And like if you can't handle that,

2734
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:26,840
grow the hell up Sarah.
No,

2735
02:13:26,841 --> 02:13:27,740
I mean seriously,

2736
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:28,910
seriously,

2737
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:33,930
once you,
once you have kids,

2738
02:13:34,580 --> 02:13:37,430
it is not about you,
period.

2739
02:13:38,150 --> 02:13:40,220
Now that doesn't mean it isn't about you
at all,

2740
02:13:40,730 --> 02:13:45,730
but it just seems so self evident to me.
I can't believe that anybody would even 

2741
02:13:46,130 --> 02:13:47,580
would even question it.
Oh,

2742
02:13:47,830 --> 02:13:48,800
question.
Oh yes.

2743
02:13:48,801 --> 02:13:50,150
Well,
I'm certainly aware of that.

2744
02:13:50,151 --> 02:13:51,470
Yes.
It's questioned.

2745
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:53,920
It's almost illegal to question it now,
you know,

2746
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:57,860
to to or illegal to make the set of 
propositions that I'm making,

2747
02:13:58,370 --> 02:14:03,090
so that's the best I can do.
That's excellent.

2748
02:14:03,091 --> 02:14:03,570
Thank you.

2749
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:13,990
Going to the first part of first year 
lecture,

2750
02:14:13,991 --> 02:14:18,991
but it's also something that's been on 
my mind listening to lectures or the 

2751
02:14:18,991 --> 02:14:23,640
past few months and that's when we 
talked about the psychological truth or 

2752
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:27,100
significance of the Bible.
To what extent does that psychological,

2753
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:32,160
psychological truth has to be embodied 
in specific historical events or people 

2754
02:14:32,860 --> 02:14:36,060
and so for instance,
the thing that's sort of been bugging on

2755
02:14:36,070 --> 02:14:41,070
my mind is there's a.
there's a part that St Paul's talking 

2756
02:14:41,070 --> 02:14:43,920
about in the new testament somewhere in 
one of his letters and he.

2757
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:46,630
He's talking about the resurrection and 
he says,

2758
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:48,690
if it didn't happen,
then it.

2759
02:14:48,910 --> 02:14:51,190
This whole thing is just meaning the 
faith is meaningless.

2760
02:14:51,710 --> 02:14:56,710
Like for him,
there had to be that embodiment of that 

2761
02:14:56,710 --> 02:14:56,710
historical person or event in that case.

2762
02:14:56,940 --> 02:15:01,940
Well,
the best answer I have to that at the 

2763
02:15:01,940 --> 02:15:04,551
moment is that I'm really happy that I'm
not at that point yet in this lecture 

2764
02:15:04,551 --> 02:15:07,881
series because I know because that is a 
crucial issue there and I don't know 

2765
02:15:10,471 --> 02:15:15,240
exactly what to make of it and my 
approach at the moment as I said,

2766
02:15:15,241 --> 02:15:18,810
is to approach this as rationally as I 
possibly can and I hope I know a hell of

2767
02:15:18,811 --> 02:15:23,340
a lot more about what I'm doing by the 
time I get to that particular question.

2768
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:25,680
Um,
and I,

2769
02:15:25,681 --> 02:15:29,160
I do have the beginnings of ways to 
answer that,

2770
02:15:29,161 --> 02:15:34,161
but I'm not going to answer that at all 
right now because it's so bloody 

2771
02:15:34,161 --> 02:15:38,151
complicated.
It would just burn me to a frazzle and 

2772
02:15:38,151 --> 02:15:38,280
I'm already mostly bird to a frazzle 
after that lecture.

2773
02:15:38,281 --> 02:15:43,281
So I,
I couldn't attempt to even start to 

2774
02:15:43,281 --> 02:15:43,281
sketch it out.

2775
02:15:43,281 --> 02:15:43,680
I don't know.
I mean,

2776
02:15:43,710 --> 02:15:46,740
part of it is to be just rational about 
it,

2777
02:15:46,741 --> 02:15:51,741
just to be rational about it.
There is something about the idea that 

2778
02:15:51,741 --> 02:15:55,401
continual death and rebirth is a 
necessary precondition to proper human 

2779
02:15:55,401 --> 02:15:58,761
adaptation.
Like every time you learn something new 

2780
02:15:58,761 --> 02:16:01,461
that's important,
part of the stupid old you has to die 

2781
02:16:01,461 --> 02:16:05,900
and sometimes that can be an awful lot 
of you and in fact in can be so much of 

2782
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:06,120
you.
Sometimes you just die,

2783
02:16:06,490 --> 02:16:07,830
right?
You just can't handle it.

2784
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:13,100
And so there is,
there is a real idea that you have to 

2785
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:15,750
identify with the part of yourself that 
transcends your current personality that

2786
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:18,390
can constantly die and be reborn.
Now.

2787
02:16:18,391 --> 02:16:19,260
Then I could say,
well,

2788
02:16:19,261 --> 02:16:24,261
that means that all of this is 
psychological and symbolic and that's 

2789
02:16:24,261 --> 02:16:28,611
the simplest answer.
But I'm not satisfied with that answer 

2790
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:34,020
even though I think it's coherent and 
complete because the world's a very 

2791
02:16:34,020 --> 02:16:35,590
weird place and there are things about 
it that we don't understand.

2792
02:16:35,950 --> 02:16:37,690
So,
so I,

2793
02:16:37,691 --> 02:16:42,691
I can't go.
I can't go any farther than that at the 

2794
02:16:42,691 --> 02:16:42,691
moment.
So that.

2795
02:16:42,691 --> 02:16:42,691
Yep.

2796
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:49,210
I got to Peterson.
Um,

2797
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:54,720
I just recently watched one of your 
videos of you debating with 

2798
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:58,420
transgendered protesters at uft,
a free speech rally in October.

2799
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:02,680
And one of the protesters,
one of the comments,

2800
02:17:02,681 --> 02:17:06,370
one of the protests are said to you,
which was in particularly very,

2801
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:07,750
very chilling,
was,

2802
02:17:07,751 --> 02:17:12,751
um,
why do you have the right to determine 

2803
02:17:12,751 --> 02:17:14,230
whether an individual is worthy of you 
using their pronouns?

2804
02:17:14,260 --> 02:17:19,260
I'm the scary thing to me is how common 
this type of view is among radical left 

2805
02:17:19,871 --> 02:17:24,871
wing protesters on university campuses 
who feel they have the right to tell 

2806
02:17:24,871 --> 02:17:28,831
other people what they can think,
what words they can use and what 

2807
02:17:29,111 --> 02:17:32,580
speakers they can or cannot listen to.
Um,

2808
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:38,040
the scarier part is that our government 
is creating legislation to backup their 

2809
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:39,460
Adl ideologies,
uh,

2810
02:17:39,461 --> 02:17:44,461
which is evident through bill.
See 16 and one slash three and bill 89.

2811
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:49,870
So my question is,
what do you think the end game is in all

2812
02:17:49,871 --> 02:17:52,870
of this because it seems every year or 
we're

2813
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:55,700
in the process of finding that out.
You know,

2814
02:17:55,710 --> 02:17:57,050
and I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

2815
02:17:58,570 --> 02:18:00,430
We're in the process of finding that 
out.

2816
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:01,900
Um,
I don't,

2817
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:07,080
I mean,
I think the end game that underlies all 

2818
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:07,990
of that,
in my estimation,

2819
02:18:07,991 --> 02:18:12,991
is best summed up by Jacques Derrida's 
Christian or her criticism of Western 

2820
02:18:13,211 --> 02:18:16,090
civilization.
It's fell logo centric.

2821
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:18,370
Now we've already talked about what the 
logos means,

2822
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:19,750
right?
And so,

2823
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:21,850
and so for,
for decorative,

2824
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:24,380
that was a sign of,
it's after a,

2825
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:26,410
what would you call it,
utter despair,

2826
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:30,520
the utterly despicable dominant nature 
of western culture.

2827
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:31,980
Well,
that,

2828
02:18:31,981 --> 02:18:36,981
that's what animates the postmodernists.
Now they may not know that because I 

2829
02:18:37,211 --> 02:18:41,170
need the,
gets fragmented across its adherence and

2830
02:18:41,171 --> 02:18:46,171
then it only access the coherent 
ideology wouldn't hold those adherence 

2831
02:18:46,171 --> 02:18:47,800
come together in a mall.
And then you see the animating spirit.

2832
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:53,340
So I said,
I think that there's a battle going on 

2833
02:18:53,681 --> 02:18:57,480
that's a battle exactly at the level 
that Derrida described,

2834
02:18:57,510 --> 02:19:01,030
and that's a theological battle with a 
philosophical,

2835
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,270
uh,
with a,

2836
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:08,280
with a philosophical implications and 
out of those philosophical implications,

2837
02:19:09,130 --> 02:19:14,130
political implications,
but it's not primarily political and 

2838
02:19:14,130 --> 02:19:15,340
it's not primarily philosophical,
it's deeper than that.

2839
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:20,760
And the postmodernist out there,
their criticism was designed to be 

2840
02:19:21,970 --> 02:19:26,970
fundamental and it also emerged out of 
Marxism and let's not forget that the 

2841
02:19:26,970 --> 02:19:31,741
Marxist criticism was not only 
fundamental but just about resulted in 

2842
02:19:31,741 --> 02:19:35,651
the nuclear annihilation of the world.
These are not trivial issues and we're 

2843
02:19:35,651 --> 02:19:39,461
back in the same insane boat.
And so what do I think should be done 

2844
02:19:40,161 --> 02:19:41,540
about that?
Well,

2845
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:46,840
I thought about that way before any of 
this happened and I think that what we 

2846
02:19:47,061 --> 02:19:52,061
should do about it is we should tell the
truth because there isn't anything more 

2847
02:19:52,061 --> 02:19:56,381
powerful than that.
And that's the right theological answer 

2848
02:19:56,381 --> 02:19:59,240
because the spoken truth brings good 
into Ba.

2849
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:03,400
While that's the foul logo centric idea,
and I've,

2850
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:08,760
I'm trying to revisit that to explain to
people what it means and to see if they 

2851
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:12,700
think that's a good idea.
I mean that's what we have to figure out

2852
02:20:12,701 --> 02:20:17,701
is,
is that an idea worth adhering to or 

2853
02:20:17,701 --> 02:20:20,221
not?
The alternative is the see for the 

2854
02:20:20,221 --> 02:20:24,661
postmodernists.
The world is that landscape of pyramids 

2855
02:20:24,661 --> 02:20:28,230
that I described,
but there's no transcendent vision 

2856
02:20:28,230 --> 02:20:31,981
that's over above that.
And all of those pyramids are equally 

2857
02:20:31,981 --> 02:20:34,150
valid and it's a war of everyone against
everyone.

2858
02:20:34,450 --> 02:20:36,790
It's like,
it's like the nightmare of Hobbs,

2859
02:20:36,820 --> 02:20:37,950
Thomas Hobbes,
excepted.

2860
02:20:37,990 --> 02:20:39,580
It's not individuals,
it's groups.

2861
02:20:39,970 --> 02:20:43,180
And everyone said group your group,
your whatever your group is.

2862
02:20:43,181 --> 02:20:46,090
It's like,
that's death as far as I'm concerned.

2863
02:20:46,450 --> 02:20:47,290
It's,
it's,

2864
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:50,230
it's utterly reprehensible

2865
02:20:50,930 --> 02:20:51,350
and,

2866
02:20:52,570 --> 02:20:57,570
and we better sorted out because if we 
don't sort it out we are bloody well 

2867
02:20:57,570 --> 02:20:59,140
going to pay for it.
So thank you.

2868
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:07,200
Hey,
how's it going?

2869
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:09,870
I just want to say thank you for doing 
all this.

2870
02:21:09,871 --> 02:21:10,460
And I really.

2871
02:21:10,830 --> 02:21:12,580
That was bob and Doug Mackenzie,
right?

2872
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:13,300
Yeah.
Hey,

2873
02:21:13,301 --> 02:21:16,030
how's it going?
I'm glad you caught that.

2874
02:21:16,031 --> 02:21:16,690
Yeah,
yeah,

2875
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:18,600
yeah.
I knew the facebook

2876
02:21:18,650 --> 02:21:22,290
pull some people who are familiar with 
your work and uh,

2877
02:21:22,291 --> 02:21:25,870
a question kind of rose to the top,
like just right out of the blue.

2878
02:21:25,871 --> 02:21:27,700
It was spectacular.
And uh,

2879
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:29,810
what it was you,
you didn't really touch it here.

2880
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:35,210
I'll,
but you touched a little bit in your 

2881
02:21:35,210 --> 02:21:36,431
lectures.
It was about integrating the shadow and 

2882
02:21:36,431 --> 02:21:38,810
one of the main questions was,
how does one go about that?

2883
02:21:38,811 --> 02:21:40,490
Especially in the modern world?
You know,

2884
02:21:40,491 --> 02:21:41,250
like,
uh,

2885
02:21:41,630 --> 02:21:44,990
usually sheltered from anything 
resembling that kind of concept.

2886
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:47,600
You know,
we don't engage like the unknown.

2887
02:21:47,601 --> 02:21:50,600
We don't come into life or death 
situations.

2888
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:53,210
Most of us actually work is like an 
ambulance,

2889
02:21:53,230 --> 02:21:54,270
you know?
Um,

2890
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:56,390
well that's one thing you can do 
without,

2891
02:21:56,450 --> 02:21:58,740
is the one thing you can do.
Well,

2892
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:03,840
yeah,
you can search out experiences that put 

2893
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,280
you there because while you can do that 
as a volunteer for example,

2894
02:22:06,281 --> 02:22:07,240
I mean,
you can.

2895
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:11,290
One of the things I saw once I was in 
Montreal,

2896
02:22:11,291 --> 02:22:13,750
I was in this outdoor mall in Montreal 
on Saint Hubert.

2897
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:17,470
And I saw this great big 17 year old 
kid,

2898
02:22:17,471 --> 02:22:18,940
you know,
and uh,

2899
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:23,030
he had a Mohawk and he was dressed in 
leather and studs and like he,

2900
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:24,220
he was,
he was,

2901
02:22:24,221 --> 02:22:29,221
uh,
he was doing modern barbarian thing and 

2902
02:22:29,221 --> 02:22:30,330
he had it really down and you know,
his standing in the corner with two pink

2903
02:22:30,331 --> 02:22:33,870
shopping bags.
So I was looking at him and I thought,

2904
02:22:33,930 --> 02:22:35,470
you know,
if someone offered him the,

2905
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:40,690
the,
the opportunity to drop those God damn 

2906
02:22:40,690 --> 02:22:42,810
sleeping bags or shopping bags and go 
fight with Isis.

2907
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:44,880
He'd be there in a second.
Yeah,

2908
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:50,600
right.
Because what the hell is some monster 

2909
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:52,581
like that doing,
standing on the corner of St Hubert 

2910
02:22:52,581 --> 02:22:52,581
holding two pink shopping bags.

2911
02:22:53,810 --> 02:22:56,470
So I mean,
so some of it is that you need the,

2912
02:22:56,471 --> 02:23:01,471
you need to find out where you can push,
where you need to find out that edge 

2913
02:23:01,471 --> 02:23:04,200
that you can push yourself against it.
It's going to be different for different

2914
02:23:04,201 --> 02:23:05,570
people.
But there's,

2915
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:08,820
there's the call to adventure and 
heroism in the EU.

2916
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:12,150
There are life and death situations 
everywhere around you.

2917
02:23:12,151 --> 02:23:14,590
If you want to involve yourself in them,
you know,

2918
02:23:14,890 --> 02:23:19,890
and it,
it sometimes that might be like two to 

2919
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:21,540
put yourself together to the degree that
you can say physically or spiritually or

2920
02:23:21,541 --> 02:23:23,490
intellectually.
It could be an intellectual battle.

2921
02:23:23,491 --> 02:23:27,270
It could be a moral battle.
Like the frontier is everywhere.

2922
02:23:27,480 --> 02:23:31,170
The frontier is just the edge between 
what you know and what you don't know.

2923
02:23:31,171 --> 02:23:36,171
You want to put yourself on that damn 
edge and make yourself into something 

2924
02:23:36,171 --> 02:23:38,300
and you can retreat into comfort in the 
modern world.

2925
02:23:38,390 --> 02:23:40,540
And I think that is a problem.
You know,

2926
02:23:40,541 --> 02:23:41,910
I mean,
I've noticed that,

2927
02:23:42,590 --> 02:23:47,590
um,
it's one of the pathologies of wealth I 

2928
02:23:47,590 --> 02:23:50,121
would say because one of the problems 
with being relatively wealthy if you're 

2929
02:23:50,121 --> 02:23:52,710
a parent is that you cannot provide your
children with necessity and that's a big

2930
02:23:52,711 --> 02:23:56,140
problem because they need necessity to 
call them into being.

2931
02:23:56,460 --> 02:24:01,300
And we know if you don't have a lot of 
material resources and your children ask

2932
02:24:01,301 --> 02:24:04,290
you for something,
you can say no because no is the answer.

2933
02:24:04,291 --> 02:24:04,830
It's like,
no,

2934
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:07,470
we can't do that.
But if you can say yes,

2935
02:24:07,471 --> 02:24:10,440
then it's really hard to say no because 
then you're just arbitrary.

2936
02:24:10,890 --> 02:24:11,880
Well,
I don't know.

2937
02:24:12,090 --> 02:24:13,410
It's like character guard said,
you know,

2938
02:24:13,411 --> 02:24:18,411
there will come a time when we have so 
much security and comfort that what 

2939
02:24:18,411 --> 02:24:20,340
we'll want more than anything else is 
deprivation and challenge.

2940
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:25,700
And I think,
I think that's particularly what young 

2941
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:27,330
men want now.
I think that that's partly because young

2942
02:24:27,331 --> 02:24:32,331
women there,
they're stuck without anyways because 

2943
02:24:32,331 --> 02:24:32,331
they have to.
It's,

2944
02:24:32,331 --> 02:24:36,461
it's,
it's the necessity of living in the 

2945
02:24:36,461 --> 02:24:38,721
world and the responsibility of infant 
care in particular like that occupies 

2946
02:24:39,241 --> 02:24:41,190
them.
Men have to do it voluntarily.

2947
02:24:41,850 --> 02:24:43,740
Women now too,
because of the birth control pill.

2948
02:24:43,741 --> 02:24:45,810
But you know,
that's 30 years ago.

2949
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:47,600
We hardly have to talk about that at all
yet.

2950
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:50,130
So it's just so much.

2951
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:56,270
Thank you.

2952
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:57,820
Hi,
Dr Peterson.

2953
02:24:57,821 --> 02:25:00,100
So I'm actually a Coptic Orthodox and 
Egyptian.

2954
02:25:00,101 --> 02:25:02,410
So I found your talk today incredibly 
interesting.

2955
02:25:02,830 --> 02:25:07,830
I've also taken a deep interest in the 
early church fathers and as you you're 

2956
02:25:07,830 --> 02:25:10,581
talking about hierarchies.
I Harken back to St Athanasius in the 

2957
02:25:10,581 --> 02:25:13,420
idea of theosis that you brought up last
time that God became man so that man can

2958
02:25:13,421 --> 02:25:15,790
become like God.
So I was thinking about this in terms of

2959
02:25:15,791 --> 02:25:19,180
the hierarchies and is that an example 
of how the top of the pyramid,

2960
02:25:19,181 --> 02:25:23,590
the hierarchy sort of gets inverted or 
descends to the bottom and brings it up

2961
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,090
to the top.
And that sort of an attraction to,

2962
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:29,140
of Christianity that's sort of make 
Christiana such a powerful idea.

2963
02:25:29,141 --> 02:25:31,030
What are your thoughts on that?
Oh,

2964
02:25:31,031 --> 02:25:31,990
well,
it certainly one of the.

2965
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:34,330
I mean,
it certainly one of the things that made

2966
02:25:34,450 --> 02:25:38,350
not just Christianity a powerful idea 
because one of the things that happened,

2967
02:25:38,351 --> 02:25:41,260
this was called the democratization of 
Cyrus,

2968
02:25:41,710 --> 02:25:44,110
if I remember correctly,
like what happened,

2969
02:25:44,590 --> 02:25:47,800
see if I can answer this question using 
this approach for a sec.

2970
02:25:47,801 --> 02:25:48,580
Is that to work?

2971
02:25:59,730 --> 02:26:00,230
Hmm.

2972
02:26:02,490 --> 02:26:04,410
I don't know if I can answer that 
question that way.

2973
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:05,610
The,
the,

2974
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:08,670
the part of the attraction of 
Christianity.

2975
02:26:08,671 --> 02:26:13,671
But this was something that emerged 
across time was the notion that even if 

2976
02:26:13,671 --> 02:26:17,631
you were in a lowly position,
that there was something about you that 

2977
02:26:17,631 --> 02:26:18,870
was akin to the divine.
And now you might say,

2978
02:26:18,871 --> 02:26:20,220
well,
that's just wish fulfillment.

2979
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:22,380
That's what Freud would say.
That's what Marx would say.

2980
02:26:22,381 --> 02:26:23,790
Right?
The opiate of the masses.

2981
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:26,250
I tweeted yesterday something I thought 
was pretty funny,

2982
02:26:26,251 --> 02:26:27,500
which was that,
um,

2983
02:26:28,460 --> 02:26:30,480
like religion was the opiate of the 
masses.

2984
02:26:30,481 --> 02:26:33,030
But that Marxism with the meth 
amphetamine,

2985
02:26:33,031 --> 02:26:35,220
if the Max of the masses.
So,

2986
02:26:35,460 --> 02:26:39,230
so,
so I think the attraction was that it,

2987
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:40,100
it,
it,

2988
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:44,280
it allowed people to recognize their 
intrinsic dignity.

2989
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:49,400
And one of the things I'd been thinking 
about is the juxtaposition between 

2990
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:49,470
genesis one and genesis two.

2991
02:26:49,470 --> 02:26:52,710
Because what happens in genesis two is 
that human beings collapse and fall,

2992
02:26:53,010 --> 02:26:58,010
right?
And then were these fallen creatures 

2993
02:26:58,010 --> 02:26:58,010
that no evil,
but in,

2994
02:26:58,010 --> 02:26:58,290
in the beginning,
in genesis one,

2995
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:00,630
it's really an optimistic story because 
it says,

2996
02:27:00,631 --> 02:27:05,631
well,
what are the sorts of creatures that 

2997
02:27:05,631 --> 02:27:05,631
partake in the calling forth of being 
from chaos?

2998
02:27:05,631 --> 02:27:07,830
And that's in our essential nature.
And to some degree,

2999
02:27:07,831 --> 02:27:10,110
if you juxtapose both of those,
it says,

3000
02:27:10,111 --> 02:27:15,111
if that's the entire biblical story,
Ram together in the first two chapters,

3001
02:27:15,181 --> 02:27:17,430
which is partly why we're taking so long
to get through this.

3002
02:27:17,431 --> 02:27:22,431
By the way,
is that to there to return to genesis 

3003
02:27:22,431 --> 02:27:25,881
one is the antidote to genesis two,
is to continue to act out the doctrine 

3004
02:27:26,431 --> 02:27:30,210
that you're made in God's image.
And that means that you're,

3005
02:27:30,350 --> 02:27:34,860
you're capable of speaking good being 
into existence through truth.

3006
02:27:34,980 --> 02:27:37,080
And that that's also the antidote to the
fall,

3007
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:42,081
which I think is actually the 
fundamental narrative message of the 

3008
02:27:42,081 --> 02:27:44,550
entire biblical structure.
And I also think of Western civilization

3009
02:27:44,551 --> 02:27:48,180
for that matter.
So there's a nobility,

3010
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:53,300
and this is also why think Nietzsche was
fundamentally wrong in his criticism of 

3011
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:54,210
Christianity because he thought about it
as slave morality.

3012
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:57,210
The vengeance of the bottom against the 
top,

3013
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:02,940
that's more historical than theological.
It's like it gives dignity it,

3014
02:28:03,010 --> 02:28:07,180
it illuminates the dignity of the human 
being and,

3015
02:28:08,950 --> 02:28:11,910
and it requires responsibility.
So it's not just wish fulfillment.

3016
02:28:11,911 --> 02:28:14,440
It's not Friday and wish fulfillment.
The Freudian theory,

3017
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:18,430
which I thought about a lot,
is not tenable in my estimation.

3018
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:21,650
It also doesn't account for the 
existence of hell because it's only wish

3019
02:28:21,651 --> 02:28:23,810
fulfillment.
Why bother with hell?

3020
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:29,380
I mean,
it's a lot more if you're really going 

3021
02:28:29,380 --> 02:28:31,431
to just fulfill a wish,
just like everybody gets to go to 

3022
02:28:31,431 --> 02:28:31,431
heaven,
no matter what they do,

3023
02:28:31,431 --> 02:28:32,390
you don't have hell,
which was of course something absolutely

3024
02:28:32,391 --> 02:28:37,391
terrifying to medieval Christians.
And then to plenty of people now for 

3025
02:28:37,391 --> 02:28:39,980
that matter.
So it's the nobility.

3026
02:28:39,981 --> 02:28:44,981
It's the idea of the nobility that I 
think steeply attractive to people and 

3027
02:28:44,981 --> 02:28:45,200
that's all there is.
I mean,

3028
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:48,130
what do you have to fight against your 
worm?

3029
02:28:48,131 --> 02:28:53,131
Like fragile,
mortal existence is the possibility of 

3030
02:28:53,131 --> 02:28:56,340
transcending that with nobility of 
speech and act.

3031
02:28:56,600 --> 02:29:01,600
That's what you have and who can hear 
that without feeling ennoble by that.

3032
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:03,800
Now you might say,
well,

3033
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:05,090
you might say,
well,

3034
02:29:05,091 --> 02:29:07,220
I don't,
I can't bear the responsibility.

3035
02:29:07,221 --> 02:29:07,700
It's like,
well,

3036
02:29:07,701 --> 02:29:08,480
fair enough,
man.

3037
02:29:08,481 --> 02:29:09,600
You know what I mean?
That,

3038
02:29:09,980 --> 02:29:14,980
that's a reasonable criticism,
but the consequences of not bearing the 

3039
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:16,640
responsibility is.
That's help really.

3040
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,350
So thank you.

3041
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:26,590
And thank you very much.
If you had told him,

3042
02:29:26,710 --> 02:29:29,150
um,
I don't know if you're familiar with the

3043
02:29:29,151 --> 02:29:30,840
works of Nassim Taleb,
I'm,

3044
02:29:31,210 --> 02:29:36,210
I'm reasonably familiar with,
so I think it's fair to say that he has,

3045
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:42,760
he talks about the idea that people in 
especially modern people have a failure 

3046
02:29:43,551 --> 02:29:48,260
to recognize the unknown's unknowns as 
such.

3047
02:29:48,390 --> 02:29:49,230
Yes.
Right.

3048
02:29:49,530 --> 02:29:54,530
That's a good way of thinking about it.
Can you move the mic up a bit so that 

3049
02:29:54,530 --> 02:29:54,530
people can hear you a little better?
Thanks.

3050
02:29:54,530 --> 02:29:55,310
Can you?
Yes.

3051
02:29:55,810 --> 02:29:58,310
Um,
well I was wondering,

3052
02:29:58,580 --> 02:30:03,580
do you think that that failure might,
might be in some way related to the way 

3053
02:30:05,391 --> 02:30:09,620
that people fail to relate to the idea 
of God,

3054
02:30:10,130 --> 02:30:15,130
so in the sense that you know,
people can't really grappled with the,

3055
02:30:18,270 --> 02:30:21,260
the notion of God either you that as 
much as you can give a rational argument

3056
02:30:21,261 --> 02:30:26,261
for it,
you can't feel God in the way that 

3057
02:30:26,261 --> 02:30:27,770
perhaps a more religious person or more,
I'm an older person,

3058
02:30:27,771 --> 02:30:32,771
might have felt God.
Do you think that that inability to 

3059
02:30:32,870 --> 02:30:37,820
recognize the unknown unknowns might 
play into that?

3060
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:38,110
No.

3061
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:41,390
Okay.
So that seems to be related to this idea

3062
02:30:41,391 --> 02:30:44,600
of the absence of necessity.
So something like that.

3063
02:30:44,601 --> 02:30:47,990
Is that because I think that I think 
that what you're,

3064
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:51,380
you're making a claim,
maybe tell me if I've got it wrong,

3065
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:55,460
that if you're sheltered too much,
then it,

3066
02:30:55,480 --> 02:31:00,480
it also,
it also separates you from anything 

3067
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:03,581
that's divine.
I guess that might be right because 

3068
02:31:03,581 --> 02:31:03,581
there's not enough intensity of 
experience at something like that.

3069
02:31:03,581 --> 02:31:04,750
Is that,
is that part of the.

3070
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:05,930
Is that part of the issue?

3071
02:31:06,250 --> 02:31:08,460
It might be more related to the idea of,
um,

3072
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:13,980
like realizing the absolute infinitude 
of what you don't know,

3073
02:31:14,010 --> 02:31:16,230
like the,
like the mysterium tremendum that,

3074
02:31:16,390 --> 02:31:18,410
that kind of,
you know,

3075
02:31:18,450 --> 02:31:20,220
if you believe through statistical

3076
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:22,680
analysis,
you can get everything under control and

3077
02:31:22,730 --> 02:31:25,400
you genuinely believe that at some point
you'll get into a wonder,

3078
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:27,720
you know,
so.

3079
02:31:27,721 --> 02:31:28,290
Okay.
So,

3080
02:31:28,291 --> 02:31:29,880
so,
well that's also,

3081
02:31:29,881 --> 02:31:34,881
I think part of the danger of 
rationality that the Catholics have been

3082
02:31:35,521 --> 02:31:40,521
implicitly warning against for forever 
is that rather the rational mind tends 

3083
02:31:40,521 --> 02:31:44,070
to fall in love with its own productions
and then to worship them as absolutes,

3084
02:31:44,310 --> 02:31:49,310
which is,
I think what Milton was trying to 

3085
02:31:49,310 --> 02:31:49,310
represent by his satanic figure in 
paradise lost.

3086
02:31:49,380 --> 02:31:54,380
I think of that as like a precursor,
a prophetic precursor to the emergence 

3087
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:54,930
of totalitarian states in the modern 
world.

3088
02:31:55,170 --> 02:32:00,170
And so yeah,
I think that you can believe that what 

3089
02:32:00,170 --> 02:32:03,810
you know is sufficient to banish 
permanently what you don't know.

3090
02:32:03,930 --> 02:32:06,870
And I do think that that does 
paradoxically,

3091
02:32:06,871 --> 02:32:08,670
although you'd think that that would 
make you secure.

3092
02:32:08,671 --> 02:32:10,980
It also does destroy your relationship 
with,

3093
02:32:11,310 --> 02:32:12,180
with,
with,

3094
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:15,060
with,
with his spirit that might help you deal

3095
02:32:15,061 --> 02:32:18,510
with what it is that you really don't 
know with the unknown unknowns.

3096
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:23,780
So yeah,
I mean we don't know to what degree 

3097
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:26,661
extreme experience is necessary to bring
forth extreme experience,

3098
02:32:27,361 --> 02:32:32,361
right?
What do you have to be through before 

3099
02:32:32,361 --> 02:32:32,361
you encounter a religious revelation?
Or people might say,

3100
02:32:32,361 --> 02:32:34,020
well,
you can't because there's no such thing.

3101
02:32:34,021 --> 02:32:34,860
It's like,
well,

3102
02:32:34,861 --> 02:32:36,990
don't be so sure about that.
I mean,

3103
02:32:36,991 --> 02:32:38,700
people have reported them throughout 
history,

3104
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:41,040
but they don't generally occur when 
you're,

3105
02:32:41,180 --> 02:32:46,180
that's my favorite trope when you're 
eating cheeses and playing on playing 

3106
02:32:46,180 --> 02:32:46,650
Mario brothers.
Right?

3107
02:32:48,050 --> 02:32:49,230
So,
yeah,

3108
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:52,590
so that's the best I can do with that.
Thank you very much.

3109
02:32:58,270 --> 02:33:00,940
This has to be the last question.
I'll make it quick.

3110
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:01,490
Yeah.
Um,

3111
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:05,270
earlier when you talked about 
criminality and creativity trends in,

3112
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:08,890
in men peaking at 14,
it reminded me of something you said.

3113
02:33:08,891 --> 02:33:13,891
I think it was Joe Rogan.
I'm talking with sjws and kind of in how

3114
02:33:14,381 --> 02:33:19,381
they create their own chaos.
Talking about how adolescents have this 

3115
02:33:19,381 --> 02:33:20,140
drive to change the world.
And I was wondering if,

3116
02:33:20,170 --> 02:33:21,640
uh,
if those three,

3117
02:33:21,641 --> 02:33:24,940
the criminality,
creativity drive to change the world are

3118
02:33:24,941 --> 02:33:26,380
linked,
and if so,

3119
02:33:26,381 --> 02:33:31,381
if they manifest differently in men and 
women and if they kind have come from 

3120
02:33:31,391 --> 02:33:31,730
the same.

3121
02:33:31,810 --> 02:33:33,200
Well,
I think they are linked,

3122
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:36,800
but I'm going to concentrate more on the
second part of your question.

3123
02:33:36,980 --> 02:33:39,560
So I'm going to ask you guys to think 
about something.

3124
02:33:39,561 --> 02:33:41,330
So I talked to a friend of mine the 
other day.

3125
02:33:41,390 --> 02:33:46,390
He's a very,
very smart guy and we'd been talking 

3126
02:33:46,390 --> 02:33:48,941
about all the sorts of things that we've
been talking about tonight for a long 

3127
02:33:48,941 --> 02:33:50,510
time.
And we were talking about the relatively

3128
02:33:50,650 --> 02:33:52,970
relative evolutionary roles of men and 
women.

3129
02:33:53,090 --> 02:33:55,400
This is speculative obviously.
And,

3130
02:33:55,490 --> 02:33:59,570
and because our research did indicate 
it's tended of research so far that,

3131
02:33:59,930 --> 02:34:01,030
that the,
the,

3132
02:34:01,090 --> 02:34:04,910
the SGS sjw sort of equality above all 
else,

3133
02:34:04,911 --> 02:34:08,120
philosophy is more prevalent among 
women.

3134
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:14,450
It's predicted by the personality 
factors that are more common among 

3135
02:34:14,450 --> 02:34:18,131
women.
So agreeableness and high negative 

3136
02:34:18,131 --> 02:34:18,131
emotion,
primarily agreeableness.

3137
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:21,160
But in addition it's also predicted by 
being female.

3138
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:26,640
And that's interesting because in most 
of the personality research that I've 

3139
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:27,490
done and as far as I know in the 
literature at,

3140
02:34:27,870 --> 02:34:30,130
you know,
in more broadly speaking,

3141
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:35,400
most of the time you can get rid of the 
attitudinal differences between men and 

3142
02:34:35,400 --> 02:34:36,640
women or at least reduced them by 
controlling for personality.

3143
02:34:36,970 --> 02:34:39,430
So if you take a feminine man in a 
masculine woman,

3144
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:43,570
then you know the,
the polls reverse.

3145
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:46,120
But that didn't seem to be the case with
political correctness.

3146
02:34:46,390 --> 02:34:49,030
And so I've been thinking about that a 
lot because,

3147
02:34:49,630 --> 02:34:53,110
well men are bailing out of the 
humanities like Matt and pretty much out

3148
02:34:53,111 --> 02:34:58,111
of the universities except for stamp.
The women are moving in like mad and 

3149
02:34:58,111 --> 02:35:00,370
they're also moving into the political 
sphere like Matt and this is new,

3150
02:35:00,371 --> 02:35:02,020
right?
We've never had this happen before.

3151
02:35:02,021 --> 02:35:02,740
And we do.
No,

3152
02:35:02,750 --> 02:35:07,750
no.
Do not know what the significance of it 

3153
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:07,750
is.
It's only 50 years old.

3154
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:11,850
And so we were thinking about this and 
so I don't know what you think about 

3155
02:35:11,850 --> 02:35:12,340
this proposition,
but imagining that,

3156
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:14,440
that,
that historically speaking,

3157
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:20,280
it's something like women were 
responsible for distribution and men 

3158
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:22,690
were responsible for production.
Something like that,

3159
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:27,900
and maybe maybe that's only the case 
really in the tight confines of the 

3160
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:31,861
immediate family,
but that doesn't matter because that's 

3161
02:35:31,861 --> 02:35:31,861
most of the evolutionary landscape for 
human beings anyways.

3162
02:35:31,861 --> 02:35:35,050
What the women does it did was make sure
that everybody got enough.

3163
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:41,100
Okay.
And that seems to me to be one of the 

3164
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:41,100
things that's driving,
at least in part,

3165
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:43,570
the sjw demand for,
for equity and equality.

3166
02:35:43,571 --> 02:35:46,330
It's like,
let's make sure everybody has enough.

3167
02:35:46,480 --> 02:35:47,080
It's like,
well look,

3168
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:47,980
fair enough.
You know,

3169
02:35:47,981 --> 02:35:48,360
I mean,
you,

3170
02:35:48,361 --> 02:35:50,110
you can't,
you can't argue with that,

3171
02:35:50,350 --> 02:35:55,350
but there's,
there's an antipathy between that and 

3172
02:35:55,350 --> 02:35:56,830
the reality of differential 
productivity,

3173
02:35:56,850 --> 02:35:58,750
you know,
because people really do differ in their

3174
02:35:58,751 --> 02:36:00,460
productivity.
So.

3175
02:36:01,390 --> 02:36:03,280
All right,
so to answer your question fully,

3176
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:09,120
I do think that the rebellious tendency 
of adolescents is associated both with 

3177
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:13,531
that criminality spike,
especially among men and with 

3178
02:36:13,531 --> 02:36:13,531
creativity.
Yes.

3179
02:36:13,531 --> 02:36:17,730
I think that the sjw phenomena is 
different and I think it is associated 

3180
02:36:17,730 --> 02:36:20,380
at least in part with the rise of women 
to political power and,

3181
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:25,500
and we don't know what women are like 
when they have political power because 

3182
02:36:25,500 --> 02:36:28,600
they've never had it.
I mean there's been queens obviously and

3183
02:36:28,601 --> 02:36:33,601
that sort of thing,
just being female authority figures and 

3184
02:36:33,601 --> 02:36:35,731
females have wielded far more power 
historically than feminists generally 

3185
02:36:35,731 --> 02:36:39,511
liked to admit,
but this is a different thing and we 

3186
02:36:39,511 --> 02:36:40,360
don't know what,
what a truly female political philosophy

3187
02:36:40,361 --> 02:36:42,580
would be like,
but it might be,

3188
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:46,060
especially if it's not been well 
examined and it isn't very sophisticated

3189
02:36:46,061 --> 02:36:47,530
conceptually.
It could easily be,

3190
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:50,380
but let's make sure things are 
distributed equally well.

3191
02:36:50,381 --> 02:36:55,381
Yeah,
but sorry that that's just not gonna 

3192
02:36:55,381 --> 02:36:55,381
fly.

3193
02:36:55,381 --> 02:36:59,000
Do you think in terms of the west with 
sjws and you talked about last lecture 

3194
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,450
as well,
creating chaos when there is none.

3195
02:37:00,451 --> 02:37:03,480
Otherwise it'd be Sadek.
Do you think there would be any validity

3196
02:37:03,481 --> 02:37:07,860
in saying that in a country like Canada 
where we're pretty gender equal,

3197
02:37:08,280 --> 02:37:13,280
is there any merit to thinking sjws are 
trying to create chaos even when they're

3198
02:37:13,501 --> 02:37:16,070
arguably is none on a level?
Obviously

3199
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:18,260
there's still problems.
Why would they do that?

3200
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:22,730
Otherwise it would be static and that 
drive it wouldn't,

3201
02:37:22,731 --> 02:37:26,080
but I'm just wondering is this.
I read this quote once and I don't.

3202
02:37:26,090 --> 02:37:28,480
Don't remember who.
Who said it.

3203
02:37:28,570 --> 02:37:33,570
It might've been Robert Heinlein for 
crying out loud starts fiction author 

3204
02:37:33,570 --> 02:37:33,570
that springs to mind,
but it probably,

3205
02:37:33,570 --> 02:37:38,471
it probably wasn't the proposition was 
that men tested ideas and that women 

3206
02:37:38,781 --> 02:37:43,250
tested men and I kinda liked that.
There's something about that,

3207
02:37:43,251 --> 02:37:48,251
you know,
and now it obviously it's an 

3208
02:37:48,251 --> 02:37:49,691
overgeneralization,
but we also don't know to what degree 

3209
02:37:49,691 --> 02:37:53,800
women test men.
Surely through provo provocation it's a 

3210
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:54,320
lot because like if you want to test 
someone,

3211
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,450
you don't have a little conversation 
with them.

3212
02:37:56,451 --> 02:37:58,160
Like you poke the hell out of them and 
you see,

3213
02:37:58,161 --> 02:38:00,680
okay,
like I'm gonna like go after you and see

3214
02:38:00,681 --> 02:38:03,710
where your weak spots are.
And it seems to me that this.

3215
02:38:04,010 --> 02:38:09,010
It seems to me that in this constant 
protest and use of shame and all of that

3216
02:38:09,381 --> 02:38:14,381
that goes along with this,
with this sort of radical movement 

3217
02:38:14,381 --> 02:38:17,861
towards egalitarianism,
that there's a tremendous amount of 

3218
02:38:17,861 --> 02:38:18,380
provocation.
And God,

3219
02:38:18,381 --> 02:38:20,240
I'm going to say this too,
even though I shouldn't,

3220
02:38:20,470 --> 02:38:22,170
but it,
but we may not.

3221
02:38:22,190 --> 02:38:24,680
I don't believe this,
but I'm trying trying to figure it out.

3222
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:27,860
You know,
I thought it was absolutely comical when

3223
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:31,970
50 shades of grey came out that just,
I just thought that was just so insanely

3224
02:38:31,971 --> 02:38:36,971
comical that at the same time there's 
this massive political demand for like 

3225
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:42,640
radical equality and and say with 
regards to sexual behavior and the 

3226
02:38:42,981 --> 02:38:47,981
fastest selling novel the world had ever
seen was snm domination.

3227
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:49,340
Right.
It's like,

3228
02:38:49,430 --> 02:38:52,160
oh well we can know where the 
unconscious is going with that one don't

3229
02:38:52,260 --> 02:38:57,260
make.
And sometimes I think like because one 

3230
02:38:57,260 --> 02:38:57,800
of the things that I've really tried to 
puzzle out,

3231
02:38:58,040 --> 02:39:00,050
and it's not like I believe this,
right.

3232
02:39:00,050 --> 02:39:05,050
I'm just telling you what were the edges
of my thinking have been going is that 

3233
02:39:05,050 --> 02:39:08,240
you have this crazy alliance between the
feminists and the radical Islamists that

3234
02:39:08,241 --> 02:39:13,241
I just do not get.
It's like the feminist is like why they 

3235
02:39:13,241 --> 02:39:16,241
aren't protesting nonstop about Saudi 
Arabia is just completely beyond me.

3236
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:19,100
Like I do not understand it in the 
least.

3237
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:22,030
And I wonder too,
I just wonder bloody wellness,

3238
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:25,160
this is the frightened me is like,
is there an attraction,

3239
02:39:25,370 --> 02:39:25,980
you know,
the.

3240
02:39:26,150 --> 02:39:29,690
Is there an attraction that's emerging 
among the female radicals?

3241
02:39:29,691 --> 02:39:34,691
For that totalitarian male dominance 
that they've chased out of the west and 

3242
02:39:35,451 --> 02:39:36,950
I mean that's a hell of a thing to 
think,

3243
02:39:36,951 --> 02:39:41,951
but I am after all,
I am a psychoanalytically minded and I 

3244
02:39:41,951 --> 02:39:44,780
do think things like that because like I
just can see no rational reason for it.

3245
02:39:45,110 --> 02:39:47,960
The only other rational reason is that,
well,

3246
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:53,020
the West needs to fall and so the enemy 
of my enemy is exactly.

3247
02:39:53,850 --> 02:39:56,060
Now what is it?
The I got that wrong,

3248
02:39:56,061 --> 02:39:58,360
but the enemy of an enemy is my friend.
Yes,

3249
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:03,400
exactly.
The elements tend to vote liberal as 

3250
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:03,400
well as well,
so that that could be the case,

3251
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:07,841
but I'm not going to shake my suspicion 
about the this unconscious balancing 

3252
02:40:08,421 --> 02:40:13,421
because as the demand for egalitarianism
and the eradication of masculinity

3253
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:19,820
accelerates,
there's going to be a longing in the 

3254
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:21,360
unconscious for the precise opposite of 
that.

3255
02:40:21,390 --> 02:40:24,540
Right?
The more you you scream for equality,

3256
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:29,490
the more your unconscious is going to 
admire dominance and so.

3257
02:40:30,060 --> 02:40:31,230
Well that's,
that's,

3258
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:33,120
that's well,
that's how you think.

3259
02:40:33,121 --> 02:40:38,121
If you're a psychoanalytically minded 
and you know I'm a great admirer of 

3260
02:40:38,121 --> 02:40:38,121
Freud,
he knew a hell of a lot more than people

3261
02:40:38,121 --> 02:40:41,250
like to think and and so,
which is partly why everyone still hates

3262
02:40:41,251 --> 02:40:43,860
him even though it's 100 years since 
he's really,

3263
02:40:44,010 --> 02:40:45,070
really been around.
So.

3264
02:40:45,300 --> 02:40:46,400
All right,
we should stop.
