1
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,190
Three difficult stories tonight and 
hopefully my plan is to get through all 

2
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:24,380
three of them,
so we'll see how that goes.

3
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,010
So we're going to talk about the story 
of Sodom and Gomorrah and then the story

4
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:35,810
of the,
the sacrifice of Isaac,

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,420
which an extremely complicated,
complicated story and so we'll try to 

6
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,541
make some headway with that.
The story of Sodom and Gomorrah is 

7
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:46,541
plenty complicated too.
Alright,

8
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,970
so what we established last week,
at least in part,

9
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:54,971
was this idea that the abrahamic 
narratives are set up as punctuated 

10
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,790
ipacs I suppose in Abraham's life and we
were hypothesizing that you know,

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,580
you set out a goal for yourself and your
life.

12
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,080
It's like a stage in your life.
You might say that and then when you run

13
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:12,260
that goal to its end,
when that stage comes to an end,

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,280
then you have to regroup and Orient 
Yourself.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Once again.
And I was making the case that that's a 

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,391
good time to make necessary sacrifices.
You know,

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,700
part of that's because as you move 
through your life,

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,480
you have to shed that which is no longer
necessary and because otherwise it 

19
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:42,161
accretes around you and holds you down 
and you perish sooner than you should 

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,270
and I think that's in large part because
if you don't dispense with your life as 

21
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:54,461
you move through it,
then the stress of all that undone 

22
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:58,061
business and all those unmade decisions 
turns into a kind of chaos around you 

23
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,220
and that chaos puts you in a state of 
psychophysiological emergency 

24
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,601
preparedness chronically and that just 
ages you and so it's necessary in some 

25
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:14,741
sense,
to stay light on your feet and also I 

26
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:17,531
think to renew your commitment to your 
aim upward.

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,310
And I believe that that's what the 
sacrificial routines in the abrahamic 

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,730
stories dramatize.

29
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,730
I said already that these things are 
often first portrayed very dramatically 

30
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:37,871
and concretely before they become 
psychologist and we'll see because one 

31
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:43,571
of the things that happens tonight as 
well in these stories is that when God 

32
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:46,160
makes his covenant with Abraham,
this is the next part of the story.

33
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,700
It's also when the idea of circa 
circumcision is introduced into ancient 

34
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:56,951
Hebrew culture.
Now there's every bit of evidence that 

35
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:58,820
other cultures,
we're utilizing circumcision beforehand,

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,300
so it wasn't necessarily a novel 
invention of the Abrahamic people,

37
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,420
but I see it's introduction as a step on
the road to this psychologist creation 

38
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,660
of the idea of of sacrifice,
right?

39
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,720
First of all,
it's giving up something concrete and 

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,001
then second,
it's signified by the sacrifice of a 

41
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,700
part of the body instead of for the sake
of the whole.

42
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:29,701
It's something like that.
It's dramatizing the idea that you have 

43
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,030
to give up a part of yourself for the 
sake of the whole and eventually well by

44
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:35,170
modern times that becomes virtually 
completely psycho psychological and it's

45
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,710
in its essence in that we all understand
perhaps not as well as we should,

46
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:45,931
but at least well enough to explain it,
that it's necessary to make sacrifices 

47
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,250
to move ahead in life.

48
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,220
One of the themes that I'd like to 
explore tonight in relationship,

49
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,860
especially to the sacrifice of Isaac,
is that,

50
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,390
you know,
once humanity had established the idea 

51
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,700
that sacrifice was necessary to move 
ahead,

52
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,570
which is really a discovery of 
incalculable magnitude,

53
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:10,150
right?
The idea that the idea that you can give

54
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:15,151
up something in the present and that 
will in some sense ensure a better 

55
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:19,861
future is an unbelievable achievement.
It's equivalent to the discovery of the 

56
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:23,911
future.
It's equivalent to the discovery of the 

57
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:26,011
utility of work.
Like it's importance cannot be 

58
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:26,011
overstated.
Okay,

59
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,940
so it took a long time for people to 
figure this out.

60
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,860
Animals haven't figured it out at all.
Right?

61
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:34,861
We've figured it out and it's hard.
It's hard for people to make sacrifices 

62
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:38,491
because of course the president has a 
major grip on you as it should because 

63
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,280
in some way you live in the present.

64
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,790
So anyways,
there's the twin problem of getting the 

65
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,211
whole idea of sacrifice up and running 
and then figuring out exactly what it 

66
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:51,391
means,
but there's a problem that branches off 

67
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,431
that tour a twofold problem.
So the hypothesis is that sacrifice is 

68
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:58,951
necessary to ensure the,
that the future is safe and secure and 

69
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:00,370
productive and positive and all of those
things.

70
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,790
Okay.
So then the question immediate two 

71
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:05,790
questions immediately rise from that 
right?

72
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,610
One is,
well,

73
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:11,611
what's the proper sacrifice?
Now we already talked about that a 

74
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,431
little bit with regards to Cain and Abel
and one of the things we saw was that 

75
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:14,920
keynes sacrifice,
whatever it was,

76
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,380
was wrong and ables was right.
No,

77
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:19,840
is seemed to be right.
Abraham seems to right.

78
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,200
There is something about a sacrifice 
that can be correct.

79
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:25,540
There's something about a sacrifice that
can be incorrect.

80
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,470
The question is what would be the 
maximally correct sacrifice?

81
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,010
So because that's an obvious question to
arise from the mere observation that 

82
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,290
sacrifice is necessary.
Okay.

83
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,300
If you're going to sacrifice and it's 
necessary,

84
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,250
well how is it that you would behave if 
you were going to do it really well?

85
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:44,380
If you're going to do it perfectly.
Okay.

86
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:48,040
So that's question number one.
And then question number two might be,

87
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,550
well,
if the future can be better because of a

88
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:56,551
sacrifice and sacrifice is can vary in 
quality than how much better could the 

89
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:58,280
future be?

90
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,100
If your sacrifice was of the highest 
quality,

91
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,130
right?
There's a limit issue there and the 

92
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,130
limit is something like,
well,

93
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,161
how good could your life be if you 
really got your act together and you 

94
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,450
gave up all the things that were 
impeding you in your movement forward.

95
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,600
If you did that forthrightly and with 
integrity and with seriousness with with

96
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:19,670
dead seriousness,
and you tried to set your life right,

97
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,060
what is the upper limit with regards to 
how your life might lay itself out?

98
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,420
And I would say,
well,

99
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,750
we don't know the answer to that,
but I think that the idea of something 

100
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,521
like the city of God or the Kingdom of 
God on Earth or the reestablishment of 

101
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,080
paradise,
something like that is the answer of the

102
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:44,081
imagination to the question,
how good could the future be if 

103
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:47,240
sacrifice was optimized?
And those are archetypical questions,

104
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,250
right?
An architectural question is a question 

105
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,720
that everyone asks whether they know it 
or not because sometimes you can act out

106
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:58,721
a question and the question is a 
question that everyone asks and an 

107
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:02,351
archetypal answer is the answer that 
can't be made any better to that 

108
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:05,090
question,
so I can give you an example of that.

109
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,090
The reason that Christ's passion is an 
archetypal story is because it's a kind 

110
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,090
of limit,
right?

111
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,070
It's the worst possible set of things 
that can happen to the best possible 

112
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,121
person,
so it's a story that constitutes a 

113
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:22,361
limit.
It has nothing to do with the factual 

114
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:22,910
reality of the story.
That's a completely independent issue.

115
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,180
I'm speaking about this psychologically 
is that certain stories can exhaust 

116
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,200
themselves in a perfect form and that 
would be the architectural form.

117
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,980
So that's the territory that we're going
to wander around in a little bit today 

118
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,851
and we'll use the stories as anchors 
been thinking a lot about the Sodom and 

119
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:44,471
Gomorrah story because it has a.
it's classically associated with a 

120
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:48,641
biblical injunction against 
homosexuality and that's often how it's 

121
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:51,911
read.
I would say in particular by the more 

122
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:51,911
fundamentalist end of the Christian 
spectrum,

123
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:56,501
and I've thought about that a lot 
because it's pretty damn clear that the 

124
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:57,800
story of Sodom and Gomorrah has 
something to do with sexual impropriety,

125
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:02,801
but I've really come to the conclusion 
that it's very little to do with 

126
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:05,771
homosexuality,
so we'll see how that interpretation 

127
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:07,040
prevails as we walked through this 
tonight.

128
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,310
Okay,
so we'll start with a bit of a recap 

129
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,310
from last week.
So Abraham's had his.

130
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,540
He had his last adventure and he's 90 
years old,

131
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:19,541
99 years old.
The Lord appeared to Abraham and said 

132
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:19,640
unto him,
I am the Almighty God.

133
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:22,160
Walk before me and be thou perfect.
Well,

134
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:25,070
that's quite the command.
Now,

135
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,390
Alexander mcclaren,
who we talked about before,

136
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,600
it's a elaborated upon this slightly and
this is what he had to say.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,470
This is not precisely walking with God,
the idea of walking before God.

138
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:44,471
It is rather that have an active life 
spent in continual consciousness of 

139
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:48,110
being naked and open before the eyes of 
him to whom we have to give an account.

140
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,400
Okay?
So that's,

141
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,460
that's an idea that's in keeping with 
the notion that what we're seeing in 

142
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,451
Abrahamic story is the call to adventure
of the,

143
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,930
of man of the typical person,
right?

144
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,450
Because your life in some sense is an 
adventure.

145
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:08,451
And I suppose the reason for that is 
that you're confronted by things that 

146
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:09,900
you cannot understand,
that you have not yet mastered.

147
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,880
There's a heavy price to be paid if you 
fail to conduct yourself appropriately,

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,440
and there's a large reward to be gained 
if you conduct yourself properly.

149
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,730
And so that pretty much defines an 
adventure story and God calls to Abraham

150
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,200
and tells him to move out into the 
world,

151
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:30,201
to leave what he's familiar with,
to go into the strange lands of famine 

152
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:34,191
and tyranny and to find his place.
And that works out quite nicely for 

153
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:40,371
Abraham.
And so what that also means is that 

154
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:40,860
because Abraham is doing that 
consciously,

155
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,290
at least according to this 
interpretation,

156
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,850
that he's not naive in his,
in his determination to move forward.

157
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,930
You know,
I mean,

158
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,360
I've dealt with lots of people who have 
anxiety disorders,

159
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:56,361
you know,
and one thing about people who have 

160
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:56,361
anxiety disorders is they are not 
mysterious to me.

161
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,630
I understand.
It's no problem for me to understand why

162
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:05,631
people have anxiety disorders or why 
they're depressed or why they have 

163
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:08,070
substance use problems.
The mystery to me is always white people

164
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:13,071
don't have all of those things at once 
because everybody has a reason to be 

165
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:13,320
anxious.
In fact,

166
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:18,321
we have the ultimate reason to be 
anxious because we know that we're 

167
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:21,501
vulnerable and we know that we're going 
to die and how you can not be anxious 

168
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,680
under those circumstances is a great 
mystery.

169
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:27,030
It's a massive mystery and that same 
thing applies with regards to depression

170
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,480
and then the same thing applies to some 
degree with regards to drug and alcohol 

171
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,480
abuse.
As I said last week,

172
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,700
there's plenty of reasons to drown your 
consciousness and alcohol.

173
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,730
That's for sure.
We could refer to the aforementioned 

174
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,340
anxiety and depression not least and so 
and the and the sorts of drugs that 

175
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:48,771
people are prone to take our chemicals 
that take the effect of edge off the 

176
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:50,400
tragedy of life,
so,

177
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,700
so back to back to the issue of of of 
fear.

178
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,410
Being Abraham is self conscious.
That's what this commentary he says,

179
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:06,411
but the thing is as he moves forward,
despite that he self conscious and he 

180
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:09,741
knows the danger,
but he moves forward despite that and 

181
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:12,410
that's actually the appropriate response
in the face of actual non naive 

182
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,361
understanding of what constitutes life.
Like if you're naive and you move 

183
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:17,361
forward,
it's like,

184
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:17,361
well,
what the hell do you know?

185
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,490
You know there's no courage and naivety 
because you don't know what there is to 

186
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,960
stop you.
You don't know what dangers you might 

187
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,911
apprehend,
but to be aware of what it is that your 

188
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:30,660
problem is.
So to be alert existentially,

189
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:32,700
let's say,
or to be fully self conscious means that

190
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:37,701
you're perfectly aware of your 
limitations and how you might be hurt 

191
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,870
and then to make the decision to move 
forward into the unknown and the land of

192
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:40,380
the stranger.

193
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,580
Anyways,
that's the.

194
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,760
I would say that's one of the secrets to
a good life and I can say that really 

195
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,280
without fear of contradiction,
I would I would say because the clinical

196
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:52,020
literature on this as very,
very,

197
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:57,021
very clear what you do with people who 
are afraid and to some degree depressed 

198
00:11:57,021 --> 00:12:00,100
but certainly anxious,
is you lay out what what they're anxious

199
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,990
about,
first of all in detail.

200
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:04,240
What is it that you're afraid of?
What might happen,

201
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,990
and then you decompose it into small 
problems,

202
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,000
hypothetically,
manageable problems,

203
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:15,210
and then you have the person expose 
themselves to the thing that they're 

204
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,721
afraid of.
And what happens isn't that they get 

205
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:21,271
less afraid.
That isn't what the clinical literature 

206
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:21,271
indicates.
Exactly.

207
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:24,100
What happens instead is they get braver 
and that's not the same thing,

208
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:25,510
right?
Because if you get less afraid,

209
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,290
it's like,
well,

210
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,270
the world isn't as dangerous as I 
thought it was.

211
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,260
You know,
silly me.

212
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,510
If you get braver,
that's not what happens.

213
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:32,260
What happens is,
yeah,

214
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:34,360
the World Damn worlds just as dangerous 
as I thought,

215
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,850
or maybe it's even more dangerous than I
thought,

216
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,810
but it turns out that there's something 
in me that responds to taking that on as

217
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:44,320
a voluntary challenge and grows and 
thrives as a consequence,

218
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:49,321
and there's no doubt about this.
Even the psychophysiological findings 

219
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:51,850
are quite clear if you,
if you can.

220
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,530
If you impose a stressor on two groups 
of people and on one group,

221
00:12:56,531 --> 00:13:00,280
the stressor is imposed in voluntarily 
and on the other group.

222
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:05,330
Destresser is picked up voluntarily.
The people who pick up the stress or 

223
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,511
voluntary voluntarily use a whole 
different cycle physiological system to 

224
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:13,471
deal with it.
They use the system that's associated 

225
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:16,021
with approach and challenge and not the 
system that's associated with defensive 

226
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:19,960
aggression and withdrawal and the system
that is associated with challenges,

227
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,990
much more associated with positive 
emotion and much less associated with 

228
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:24,990
negative emotion.

229
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,470
It's also much less hard on you because 
the defensive posturing system,

230
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,140
the prey animal system man would not 
thing kicks in.

231
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:37,141
It's all systems are go for you.
You know you're the gas is pushed down 

232
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:41,401
to the are the pedals,
pushed down to the metal and the brakes 

233
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:43,861
are on.
You're using future resources that you 

234
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:44,950
could be storing for future time right 
now in the present to ready yourself for

235
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:47,550
emergency.
So there's,

236
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,050
there's,
there's nothing simple or trivial at all

237
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:55,051
about the idea of being called to move 
forthrightly forward into this strange 

238
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:58,240
and the unknown and there's a real 
adventure that's associated with that,

239
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,100
right?
So that's an exciting thing,

240
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:02,020
which is part of the reason why people 
travel.

241
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,170
And then also to see yourself as the 
sort of creature that can do that is 

242
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,921
willing to do that on a habitual basis 
is also the right kind of tonic for,

243
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,880
I hate this word for yourself.

244
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,350
Esteem,
you know,

245
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,710
because the self esteem has nothing to 
do with feeling good about yourself.

246
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,970
As a,
as I already mentioned,

247
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,350
there isn't necessarily a reason why a 
priority you should just feel good about

248
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:26,470
yourself.
But if you can view yourself acting in a

249
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:31,471
courageous and forthright manner and 
encountering the world and trying to 

250
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:31,970
improve your lot and,
and,

251
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,670
and taking risks,
you know,

252
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:38,671
in a non naive way,
well then you have something that you 

253
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,191
can comfort yourself with at night when 
you're wondering what the whole damn 

254
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:45,151
point of view of your few tiles and 
miserable life and so and that's 

255
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:50,011
necessary because it's often the case 
that you wake up at four in the morning 

256
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:54,421
or at least sometimes the case that wake
up at four in the morning when things 

257
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:57,641
haven't been going that well and wonder 
just what the hell the point is of your 

258
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:57,641
futile and miserable life.

259
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,650
You have to have something real to set 
against that.

260
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:05,651
It can't be just rationalizations about 
how you know you're a valuable person 

261
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:06,590
among others.
Even though that's true,

262
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:11,591
that's not good enough.
You need something that's more 

263
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:14,471
realistic.
To set a against that and observing 

264
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:15,880
courage in yourself is definitely one of
the things that,

265
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,170
that,
that could help you sleep soundly at 

266
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,381
night when,
when things are destabilized a little 

267
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,550
bit around you.
So back to the Covenant,

268
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,700
God tells Abraham,
I will make my covenant between me and 

269
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,851
the and will multiply the exceedingly 
and Abraham fell on his face and God 

270
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:33,851
talked with him,
saying,

271
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,840
as for me,
behold my covenant,

272
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,870
my contract is with thee,
and thou shalt be a father of many 

273
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,570
nations.
Neither shall thy name anymore be called

274
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:45,440
Abraham name shall be called Abraham for
a father of many nations.

275
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:48,920
Have I made the and Haber means hi 
father and Abraham,

276
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:52,820
father of a multitude,
and I'll make the exceedingly fruitful.

277
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,040
I will make nations of the and kings 
shall come out of the and I will 

278
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,740
establish my covenant between me and the
anti seed after the in their generations

279
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,710
for an everlasting covenant to be a God 
unto Thee,

280
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,890
unto thy seed after Thee.
And I will give unto thee and thy seed 

281
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,350
after the the land wherein thou art a 
stranger,

282
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,500
all the land of Canaan for an 
everlasting possession.

283
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,440
And I will be their God.
I love that line.

284
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:22,400
Really the line about the land where you
are a stranger,

285
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:27,401
you know,
and everything that happens in the 

286
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:29,621
Bible.
Almost everything that happens in these 

287
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,260
more archaic stories in particular is 
laid out geographically.

288
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:35,261
The metaphor is geographic,
so you moved to a land that you haven't 

289
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,921
yet occupied.
Maybe that's full of strangers and then 

290
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:41,651
the land is what's granted to you,
but it's perfectly reasonable to think 

291
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:45,011
about this from the perspective,
from a more abstract perspective that's 

292
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:46,700
much more relevant to modern people with
are incredibly complex societies.

293
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,110
You know,
it's definitely the case that if you go 

294
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,991
into the land of the stranger,
which is exactly what you do when you 

295
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:55,991
try out any new endeavor,
right?

296
00:16:55,991 --> 00:17:00,221
When you start a new job or when you 
start a new educational enterprise and 

297
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:00,830
when you start a new relationship,
it doesn't matter.

298
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,900
You're out there and it's unexplored 
territory.

299
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,490
Like the physical geography is the same,
but we don't live in the in,

300
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,560
in,
in the spatial world only.

301
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:14,561
We live in the temporal spatial world 
and what that means is that the same 

302
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:18,371
place can be different at a different 
time and mean it can be completely 

303
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,700
different.
And so if you're in your house,

304
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:24,701
but you have a new person in your house 
while your house is new for all intents 

305
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:28,511
and purpose,
because the territory surrounding that 

306
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:29,840
new person is the territory of of the 
foreigner essentially,

307
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,200
and the same thing happens to you when 
you start a new job and you'll find that

308
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:38,201
when you start a new job,
especially if you stretched yourself a 

309
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:39,620
little bit beyond your zone of comfort,
that you very much feel like an imposter

310
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,120
right when you're first there.

311
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,500
And then the question is,
well,

312
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:45,440
how do you master that?
And the answer to that seems to be,

313
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:50,530
while it seems fairly straightforward,
if the place that you're in has degree 

314
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,960
of possibility,
if it isn't inhabited by demons,

315
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:56,961
so to speak,
the best way to act is to lift your aim 

316
00:17:56,961 --> 00:18:00,711
upward and attempt to get your act 
together and to tell the truth and to 

317
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:00,840
live a meaningful life and to do 
difficult things.

318
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:05,841
All of that,
and that is the best way of mastering a 

319
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:06,930
new territory.
And in all probability,

320
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,960
the degree to which you're able to act 
that out is precisely proportionate to 

321
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,610
the degree to which you're going to 
become a master in that territory.

322
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:17,160
And that sort of thing can happen a lot 
faster than people think.

323
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,540
You know?
It's,

324
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,320
it's really quite remarkable how fast 
you can move forward.

325
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,530
If you can establish yourself somewhere 
and prove yourself useful,

326
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,810
assuming that you're around people to 
whom proving yourself useful actually 

327
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,011
matters like I know perfectly well,
that you can end up in an employment 

328
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:37,740
situation where you're punished for your
virtues,

329
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,010
right?

330
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,170
In which case you should just get the 
hell out of there.

331
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,290
And really,
really you get out of there and you go 

332
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,080
find somewhere where if you work hard to
do what you're supposed to do,

333
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,270
you're actually going to be rewarded,
right?

334
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:51,000
Because that's not a workplace that's 
hell.

335
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:55,350
And you should just leave there.
So and God said unto Abraham,

336
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,150
Thou shall keep my covenant,
therefore,

337
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,700
Thou and thy seed after the in their 
generations,

338
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,030
this is my covenant,
which you shall keep between me and you 

339
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,230
and thy seed after the every man child 
among you shall be circumcised.

340
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,730
And it's a mystery.
They're like,

341
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,530
why that particular?
Right?

342
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:11,730
What's dramatic?
I mean,

343
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:16,731
it certainly,
it certainly effects of man where he's 

344
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:18,660
most concerned to be affected.
There's something like that.

345
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:22,320
And so it's a,
it's a sacrifice that has a certain,

346
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:24,510
I wouldn't say a certain degree of 
unforgettable it.

347
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,510
That would be the first thing and a 
certain degree of pain and threat that 

348
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,760
goes along with it.
So it's not nothing.

349
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,120
That's the thing.
Now you can argue and I think there is 

350
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,540
an argument,
a case to be made about whether or not 

351
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,160
in the modern world circumcision is a 
reasonable,

352
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,370
uh,
is something reasonable to inflict on 

353
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,921
infants.
I don't want to have that conversation 

354
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,141
at all,
but I don't think that's relevant to 

355
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:53,760
this particular issue because we're 
talking about something different.

356
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,780
We're talking about humanities attempt 
to reconcile themselves to the fact that

357
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:05,331
something has to be given up in order 
for something else to happen and to try 

358
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:08,400
to really work through that idea and to 
make it into a psychological reality and

359
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:13,401
so far what we've seen in the biblical 
stories is that when you make a 

360
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:16,731
sacrifice,
it's not really something personal or 

361
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:16,731
psychological,
right?

362
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:18,840
It's something external and dramatic.
You give up something that you own.

363
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,830
You don't give up something that you are
or that's part of you and it's.

364
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,840
It's actually more of a sacrifice to 
give up something that's a part of you 

365
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,510
or something that you are than to give 
up something that you own.

366
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,690
I mean,
it's a subtle distinction because in 

367
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:35,690
some sense,
the distinction between what you own and

368
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,740
what you are is subtle,
right?

369
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,470
I mean it's not overwhelmingly subtle 
but.

370
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,950
But people identify with their 
possessions and they need to because 

371
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,980
otherwise they wouldn't care for them 
and they need their possessions in order

372
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,990
to live.
So their possessions are in some sense 

373
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,310
integral to them.
But this transformation here have an act

374
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:59,311
that was external and associated 
essentially with possessions to 

375
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:00,940
something that was actually at least 
part of the body,

376
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,600
brings it much closer to it,
brings it much closer to the,

377
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,660
to the,
to the individual as a psychological 

378
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:09,660
reality.

379
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,480
It's something like that and you shall 
circumcise circumcised the flesh of your

380
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:17,020
for skin and it shall be a token of the 
covenant between me and you.

381
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,720
It's also a permanent marker.
You know,

382
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:24,160
and I've read a fair bit about practices
like tattooing and body scarification,

383
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:24,670
you know,
which is,

384
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,530
those are very,
very common practices,

385
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:28,480
right?
They're human universals actually,

386
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,060
no matter where you go around the world 
immediacy,

387
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,320
a couple of things.
First of all,

388
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,500
almost without exception,
people wear clothing and sometimes it's 

389
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,000
relatively minimal clothing,
but it's an often,

390
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:43,870
it's more decorative than protective,
but it's almost inevitably clothing.

391
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,350
And the other thing that you see is that
people do scar and tattoo themselves and

392
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:52,330
they do that in some manner to catalyze 
their identity,

393
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:57,331
right?
They're trying to transform themselves 

394
00:21:57,331 --> 00:22:00,091
from a generic person in some sense to a
person that's been designed by their own

395
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:01,330
hand.

396
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,130
It's something like that there.
It's a,

397
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:08,170
it's a marker of developing identity and
some of it seems to be catalyzed with 

398
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:08,530
pain.
You know,

399
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:13,531
the modern people who Tattoo,
and I'm not saying that I'm in favor of 

400
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:15,280
tattooing because actually I'm not but 
that.

401
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,150
But that's my own particular bias and if
you have a tattoo that's fine with me.

402
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm also not saying that there's 
anything wrong with it,

403
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,340
but one of the things you do see what 
the people who have a to tattoo do 

404
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,661
report is a couple of things is that the
pain is actually necessary and that the 

405
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:37,210
pain is actually something that seems to
establish something like a memory.

406
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,580
So while it's a memory,
because of the pain,

407
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:41,470
because he bloody well remember things 
that hurt,

408
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,890
but it's also a memory because it's 
actually etched on you,

409
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:49,891
right?
It's not something that you can just 

410
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:49,891
abandon and forget.

411
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:50,290
And so a circumcision is exactly the 
same thing.

412
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:55,291
It's like you don't forget it because 
it's part of you and so it makes a good 

413
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,330
token for a covenant and so that seems 
to be the rationale here from,

414
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,640
from speaking from a psychological 
perspective,

415
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,440
it's to indicate as well that the damn 
thing that's happening is serious.

416
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,230
And I think also that was the case with 
the earlier sacrifices of animals.

417
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:11,890
So it's like modern people don't do 
this.

418
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:16,891
Like you don't know how serious you 
would take a vow with you sacrifice to 

419
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:16,891
go to in your back yard.
You know,

420
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:18,910
it's actually a very dramatic thing to 
do.

421
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,270
You know,
you think about it as primitive and 

422
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,270
perhaps it is archaic and,
and,

423
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,380
and no doubt it is,
but it's also to,

424
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,760
to take the life of something and to 
spill its blood.

425
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:28,630
That's no joke.

426
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,210
That's something you remember,
especially if you haven't done it before

427
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,660
and we actually don't know what we would
need to do in order to take something 

428
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:36,940
seriously,
you know,

429
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:40,300
because we all do things like make new 
year's resolutions about how we're going

430
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:43,840
to be better people and we don't do it.
And the reason for that,

431
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:46,610
at least in part,
is because we don't know how to make the

432
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:50,150
sacrifice sufficiently bloody,
let's say,

433
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,510
so that we remember that it's necessary,
right?

434
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:58,511
We don't take it with seriousness.
We don't think I should quit smoking 

435
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:02,600
because I'm gonna die.
And we don't think through what that 

436
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:02,600
means.
Like cat coughing,

437
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,100
your lungs out for three months in a 
hotel bed.

438
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:08,210
Well,
your entire family is like half repulsed

439
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:13,211
and horrified and sorrow stricken at the
fact that this has happened far too 

440
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:13,211
early.
You know,

441
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:16,070
we won't make that real enough to make 
it serious and serious.

442
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,050
And,
and without that seriousness,

443
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:23,051
we won't do it.
So there's something to be said for 

444
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:25,190
rituals of seriousness,
and I think this is one of them,

445
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,850
and he that is eight days shall be 
circumcised among you.

446
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:33,851
Every man child in your generations.
He that is born in the house or bought 

447
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:34,880
with money of any stranger,
which is not if they seed.

448
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,020
This is from Charles John Ellicott,
who was bishop of Gloucester,

449
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,430
the fitness of circumcision.
To be a sign of entering into a covenant

450
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,970
and especially into one to which 
children were to be admitted consisted 

451
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:54,041
in.
It's being a representation of a new 

452
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,871
birth by putting off the old man and the
dedication of the new man unto holiness.

453
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,950
It's like a baptism.
That's right.

454
00:24:57,951 --> 00:24:58,820
That's.
That's what's.

455
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,060
That's what's echoed there and of course
a baptism is returned to the pre 

456
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,550
cosmogony chaos because that's what the 
water indicates and return to the source

457
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:10,430
of life and then the renewal that comes 
along with it,

458
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:10,970
so it's the.

459
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,560
It's,
it's,

460
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,590
it's a sacrificial idea in some sense 
that if there is to be a new you,

461
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:20,591
that the old you has to dissolve has to 
return to the solution from which it 

462
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:23,960
emerged initially and to reconstitute 
itself.

463
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:26,000
And so there's an echo of that idea 
here.

464
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,430
The flesh was cast away that the spirit 
might grow strong and the change of name

465
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,100
and Abraham and Sarah was typical of 
this change of condition.

466
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,280
They had been born again and so must 
again be named and the women could it 

467
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,370
need be admitted directly into the could
not indeed be admitted directly into the

468
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:48,371
covenant.
Yet they shared in its privileges by 

469
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:50,711
virtue of their concert ingenuity to the
men who were sponsors for them and 

470
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:54,851
that's sariah changes her name equally 
with your husband or you could make a 

471
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:58,331
case and and anthropological observers 
have made this case to that women 

472
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,340
undergo a sufficiently a set of 
sufficiently radical psychophysiological

473
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:06,890
transformations merely as a consequence 
of being part,

474
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:12,430
being feminine in nature,
such that the additional rituals of 

475
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:17,411
transformation that might be necessary 
for men aren't necessarily in one of 

476
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:20,921
those might be menstruation because 
that's a pretty dramatic transformation 

477
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:23,720
and there has been some indication that 
circumcision is like a male.

478
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,270
It's like the male equivalent of 
menstruation.

479
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:31,271
Something like that because of the blood
that's involved and because of the 

480
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:31,490
locale.
And then of course the same thing as the

481
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:36,491
case with women when they give birth.
Because that's a particularly dramatic 

482
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:38,720
thing as I just witnessed because my 
daughter just had a baby this week.

483
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:38,930
So

484
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,930
for that

485
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,380
recent investigation,
this is from the Cambridge Bible for 

486
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,531
school and colleges,
which if you want to read it is only 58 

487
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:01,921
volumes.
Reasoned investigation is not tended to 

488
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:06,331
support the theory that circumcision has
any connection with primitive child 

489
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:06,580
sacrifice,
nor again,

490
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:08,680
that it took its origin from hygienic 
motives.

491
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:14,010
Apparently,
it record represents the dedication of 

492
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,500
the manhood of the people to God in the 
history of Israel.

493
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:19,501
It has survived as the symbol of the 
people belonging to Jehovah through his 

494
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,700
special election.
This corporeal sacrament remained to the

495
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:25,180
Israelite when every other type of 
religion or race had been severed.

496
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,190
See,

497
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,580
the other thing that that I read about 
in relationship to this idea of the 

498
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,181
multigenerational covenant had something
to do because God told Abraham to 

499
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:49,130
include all of the people of his 
household into this covenant and and 

500
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:49,600
that,
that,

501
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,920
that really meant that he was 
establishing it,

502
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,960
a territory of ethics around them,
like the arc,

503
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,390
except the psychological equivalent of 
the arch.

504
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:57,990
Right?
So it was,

505
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,350
it was a spiritual or psychological or 
ethical territory that everyone who is 

506
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:08,091
of that household was required to occupy
or obliged or perhaps privileged to 

507
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:14,211
occupy,
and there was also an injunction to 

508
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:17,271
Abraham with regards to his children,
which was that as he had established a 

509
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:19,110
covenant with God,
which we could say is something like his

510
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:24,111
decision to to aim as high as possible 
and to live properly as a consequence.

511
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,000
It's more than that,
but it's something like that,

512
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,180
that he also was under a sub,
the supreme moral obligation to share 

513
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:35,280
that with his,
with the other men in his family,

514
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:38,010
especially as children and so and so.

515
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,330
I think there's also a call here to 
adopting a sacred,

516
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,390
the sacred responsibility in 
relationship to children that has to do 

517
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,670
with ensuring that they understand how 
to take their place in the world.

518
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,090
And I think that that's definitely 
something very much worth considering,

519
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,470
especially given the emphasis in the 
Noah story and the story of Noah,

520
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,820
that Noah had his.
That his generations were perfect.

521
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:07,650
Right?
As I said before,

522
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,890
it wasn't merely that he had walked with
God.

523
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,630
He had perfected his own relationship 
with the divine,

524
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:15,240
let's say,
with the transcendent and I want to make

525
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:20,241
that concrete,
which is a strange thing to do with the 

526
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,671
transcendent.
I mean people ask me all the time about 

527
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:25,860
what I believe and of course that's what
I'm trying to explain while I'm talking,

528
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,300
but,
but,

529
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,580
but,
and,

530
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:34,581
and many people of course are skeptical 
about the idea of anything transcendent 

531
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,780
and,
and,

532
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,840
and,
and say transcendent eternal.

533
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,110
But that can also be addressed from a 
psychological perspective because I 

534
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,110
would say,
well,

535
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,310
if you have an ideal of any sort,
how is that not transcendent?

536
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,700
It transcends you.
That's the first thing.

537
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,230
And it doesn't exist in reality.
It exists in a place of possibility.

538
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,550
And believe me,
man,

539
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,250
we treat places of possibility as if 
they're real.

540
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Because people will call on you.
You know about your possibility to your 

541
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:08,890
potential.
They'll say to you,

542
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,960
you're not manifesting your full 
potential.

543
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,310
And you might say,
well,

544
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,950
what do you mean by that?
Potential?

545
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,190
It doesn't exist.
It isn't here now.

546
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,280
You can't measure it or way it.
You can't get a grip on it.

547
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,780
And they'll say,
don't rationalize you know perfectly 

548
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,030
well what I mean when I'm talking about 
your potential and so we could.

549
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,510
Then you do and everyone does and 
everyone knows exactly what that means,

550
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:36,511
and so that's a metaphysical reality 
that will immediately accept as real and

551
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:39,900
also castigate ourselves for not 
fulfilling and others too,

552
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,640
because you're just not happy when the 
people around you,

553
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:45,460
especially if you love them,
don't fulfill their potential.

554
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,460
You really feel that something has gone 
wrong and so there's a transcendent 

555
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,791
reality and potential,
and then when you hypothesize an ideal 

556
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:54,760
that you might pursue,
which you always do,

557
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:59,761
if you pursue anything right,
because to pursue something means you 

558
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:03,661
don't already have it.
You're pursuing something that doesn't 

559
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,301
exist.
You're probably not pursuing something 

560
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:08,881
that's worse than what you already have 
because why the hell would you pursue 

561
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:08,881
it?
Right?

562
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:13,381
That's completely counterproductive.
So in the in the mere fact of your 

563
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:13,381
pursuit,
you,

564
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:17,020
you pause it at transcendent reality 
that you can,

565
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,410
that you can,
that you can journey towards,

566
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,140
that's more valuable than the reality 
that you have.

567
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:28,141
Now that's predicated in some sense on 
something like an eternal verity or an 

568
00:31:28,141 --> 00:31:32,701
eternal truth.
It partakes in the ideal and so we have 

569
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,710
an relationship with the transcendent 
and you might say,

570
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:40,711
well,
that doesn't mean you have to personify 

571
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:40,711
the transcendent,
say as Jehovah,

572
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:40,870
you know the,
the God,

573
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:45,871
the father,
but there's also some damn good reasons 

574
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,430
for doing that because one of the things
that I've realized thinking through this

575
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,060
covenant idea and also the sacrifice 
idea,

576
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:57,061
is that the idea that the future is a 
judgmental father is a really,

577
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,870
really good idea.

578
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,250
You know,
because you think about what the future 

579
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:04,250
is in part.
I mean the future is however,

580
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,491
the natural world is going to lay itself
out over the next endless amount of 

581
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:08,980
time.
That isn't what I mean.

582
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:13,981
I think more about your future now.
Mostly your future is the future that 

583
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,850
you're going to negotiate with other 
people,

584
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:20,851
but they're going to be other people in 
the future and some of those people are 

585
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,150
going to be you in the future and family
members in the future.

586
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:27,420
And so what's happening right now is 
that if you make the sacrifices 

587
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,350
properly,
then you're actually pleasing that 

588
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,711
future set of people and that future set
of people is definitely going to serve 

589
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:36,670
as a judge.
It's exactly what it does.

590
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,070
That's precisely what it does.
And so you might say,

591
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,080
well,
it was the brilliant imagination of 

592
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,511
mankind that hypothesize that the best 
way to think about the social group,

593
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:50,360
including the family,
but he also including you as your future

594
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:55,361
self,
was to consider that you live in 

595
00:32:55,361 --> 00:32:56,900
relationship with a future father who's 
a judge.

596
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,460
It's like,
yes,

597
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,340
that's exactly right.
Now is it right,

598
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,840
right?
Or is it psychologically?

599
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:03,260
Right?
Well,

600
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:05,480
it's at least psychologically,
right?

601
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:11,050
And one of the things I've learned about
the biblical stories is that to say that

602
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:16,340
they're psychologically right doesn't 
exhaust the ways in which they're right,

603
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:22,090
but it at least gives rational,
modern people who are skeptical and 

604
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:26,501
properly.
So a better way of getting a grip on 

605
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:26,501
them.
So,

606
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,040
and the uncircumcised man child whose 
flesh of his foreskin is not 

607
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,401
circumcised.
That soul shall be cut off from his 

608
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:36,401
people.
He has broken my covenant,

609
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:39,020
so it's a serious contractual array 
relationship.

610
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,470
Now I was thinking about how to 
understand this and I remember this old 

611
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,620
story which I'm going to read to you 
about a monkey.

612
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,160
So there's an old impossibly apocryphal 
story about how to catch a monkey that 

613
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,240
illustrates this set of ideas very well 
first.

614
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,620
So it goes to the story.
You have to find a large narrow neck jar

615
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,190
just barely wide enough in diameter for 
a monkey to put his hand inside.

616
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,640
And then you have to fill the jar up 
with rocks so that it's too heavy for 

617
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,841
the monkey to carry away.
And then you scatter some treats around 

618
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,880
the jar that are attractive to monkeys 
and close to the jar.

619
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,670
And then you put a few of those treats 
inside the jar.

620
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,230
And so that's the first part of the 
trick.

621
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:23,231
And then the second part of the trick is
the monkey comes along and gathers up 

622
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:26,321
the treats and then puts his hand in the
jar and grabs the treats that are in 

623
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:27,400
there.
But it's narrow necked.

624
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:31,130
And so once the monkey puts his hand in 
there and grabs the goodies and he can't

625
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:36,131
get his hand out of the damn jar,
and so then you can just come along and 

626
00:34:36,131 --> 00:34:39,521
pick up the monkey and like too bad for 
the monkey writes like he should have 

627
00:34:39,521 --> 00:34:42,140
let go of what he had so that something 
terrible didn't happen to them.

628
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,800
But that isn't what the monkey will do 
because he can't sacrifice the part for 

629
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,401
the whole.
And there's something about the 

630
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:54,610
circumcision story that's about that.
It's about sacrificing the part to save 

631
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:59,021
the whole.
And I mean there's an echo of that in 

632
00:34:59,021 --> 00:34:59,021
the New Testament,
if I remember correctly.

633
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:01,100
I believe it's.
I believe this is correct.

634
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:06,270
Although it might not be where Christ 
tells his disciples to pluck out there.

635
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:07,700
I,
if it offends them,

636
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,290
seems like a very dramatic,
you know,

637
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,480
piece of advice.
But it's partaking of the same idea,

638
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:18,320
which is that now if there's something 
holding you back,

639
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,360
we'll see this when we get to the story 
of law to if there's something holding 

640
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,480
you back,
even if it's dear to you,

641
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,380
you have to let it go.
You seriously have to let it go because 

642
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,071
there isn't anything more important than
progressing forward and and cheap 

643
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:34,430
sympathy,
cheap empathy,

644
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,980
cheap nostalgia.
None of that

645
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,040
is sufficient.
None of that will work because the 

646
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,401
consequences of not putting things 
together immediately are dire and 

647
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:47,130
there's no time to wait.

648
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,330
And God said unto Abraham,
as for my wife,

649
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:55,180
thou shalt not call her name's Sarah,
but Sarah shall be her name.

650
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,480
My princess.
That was Sarah.

651
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,720
Sarah is mother of nations,
and I will bless her and give the a son 

652
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:02,740
also have her.
Yay.

653
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:04,810
I will bless her.
She will be a mother of nations.

654
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:09,811
Kings of people shall be of her.
Then Abraham fell on his face and 

655
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:11,260
laughed and said in his heart,
show a child,

656
00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:13,360
be born unto him.
That is 100 years old.

657
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,190
He's got a lot of doll.
I would say.

658
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,230
I mean,
here's God talking to him.

659
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:18,190
Many laughs,
you know,

660
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:23,191
but that's okay.
That's he's a courageous guy and that's 

661
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:23,890
what people are like and and she'll 
Sarah,

662
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,460
that is 90 years old bear and Abraham 
said unto God,

663
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,560
Oh,
that Ishmael might live before the.

664
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,840
And God said,
Sarah,

665
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,280
thy wife shall bear the son indeed,
and thou shalt call his name Isaac,

666
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,700
and I will establish my covenant with 
him for an everlasting covenant and with

667
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:42,010
his seed after him.
And as for Ishmael,

668
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:47,370
I've heard the behold I have blessed him
and will make him fruitful and multiply 

669
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,470
him exceedingly 12 princes shall he be 
get and I will make him a great nation.

670
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,630
Now,
what does this mean?

671
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:58,060
This is.
This is a miraculous story in some 

672
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,060
sense,
right?

673
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,060
Because.
Well,

674
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,951
Sarah,
it's what Isaac want or what Abraham 

675
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,861
wants most is to have a song,
but it looks like it's pretty much 

676
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:07,321
impossible and they,
I think what the story is attempting to 

677
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:07,321
indicate is something like

678
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,170
God only knows what will happen to you 
if you put your house in order.

679
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,830
Certainly things that you do not 
currently,

680
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:22,831
regardless possible will happen.
And the more you put your house in 

681
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:28,351
order,
the more things that you regard as 

682
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:30,430
impossible will happen.
And it might be the case that if you put

683
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:35,431
your host together sufficiently,
things that were of miraculous 

684
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:39,331
impossibility would happen to you well,
and there's no way of knowing until you 

685
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:43,771
try it,
but there's no way of being sure that 

686
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:45,580
it's not the case unless you do.
And my experience has been

687
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,780
that I don't mean just personally.
I mean that

688
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:57,790
the world is a remarkable and mysterious
place and the relationship between the 

689
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:01,310
nature and structure of the world and 
your actions is indeterminant.

690
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,800
They may be more tightly related than 
you think.

691
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:09,370
And I don't know how to square that with
the fact that while you're obviously in 

692
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,460
a mortal body and constrained by all 
sorts of serious

693
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,540
constraints,

694
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,280
none of that,
none of that's true.

695
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:25,281
It can be trivially overcome.
And I don't really understand how there 

696
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:29,241
can be that seriousness of mortal 
constraint and the infinite potential 

697
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:33,450
that also seems to characterize human 
beings all at the same time.

698
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:36,550
But then I don't really understand 
anything about the nature of reality.

699
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:39,130
So that's just one more mystery to add 
to the pile.

700
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:42,790
So,
but my covenant,

701
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:46,160
I will establish this Isaac,
which share a Sarah shall bear under the

702
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:51,170
at the set time next year,
and he left off talking with them and 

703
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,300
God went up from Abraham and Abraham 
took Ishmael,

704
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:57,301
his son and all that were born in his 
house and all that were bought with his 

705
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,121
money,
every male among the men of Abraham's 

706
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,030
house and circumcised the flesh of their
forest skin in the selfsame day,

707
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:06,031
as God had said unto him,
that must have been an interesting 

708
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:08,320
conversation.
That's been really.

709
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,420
This is what God told you to do.
A.

710
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,680
It's like,
okay.

711
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,440
And Abraham was 90 years old and nine 
when he was circumcised,

712
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,450
circumcised in the flesh of his for 
skin.

713
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:24,660
And Ishmael was 13 years old when he was
circumcised in the selfsame day was 

714
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,340
Abraham circumcised and his son and all 
the men of his house,

715
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:32,430
born in the house and bought with money 
of the stranger were circumcised with 

716
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,040
him.
Alright?

717
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,210
So that's the renewal of the covenant.
That's the next part of the story.

718
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,670
That's the circumstance.
That's the circumcision story,

719
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:44,671
and as I said,
it seems to indicate to me something 

720
00:39:44,671 --> 00:39:47,941
about seriousness of intent,
something about the responsibility that 

721
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:52,810
Abraham determines to take for everyone 
that's part of his household,

722
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:58,260
these psychological,
increasing psychological transformation 

723
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,951
of the idea of sacrifice,
the necessity of doing something 

724
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:03,850
memorable,
and the the,

725
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:09,270
what would you call it,
the utility of rekindling the aims of 

726
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:13,540
your highest values when you come to the
end of an air park in your life,

727
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,150
when you have to take stock again,
right?

728
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:21,270
You take stock of yourself.
That's really what that phrase means to 

729
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,640
take stock as to take stock of yourself 
and to decide,

730
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:26,641
okay,
well what should move forward in time 

731
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:30,091
with me and what should be let go as if 
it's dead wood and the more dead wood 

732
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:33,340
that you let go of and burn off when you
have the opportunity.

733
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:38,341
The last it accretes around you here.
Here's something interesting about 

734
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:38,341
forest fires.
You know,

735
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:40,630
people have been trying to prevent 
forest fires for a long time,

736
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:42,790
especially that am bear smokey,
right?

737
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:47,791
He's trying to prevent forest fires and 
so because forest fires burn up the 

738
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:51,820
forest and that can't be good,
but here's what happens if you don't let

739
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:56,821
forest fires burn,
is that while forests collect a lot of 

740
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,210
dry branches,
right,

741
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:03,211
because tree branches die and would 
falls on the forest floor and collects,

742
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:09,031
and so the amount of flammable material 
keeps increasing with time and that's 

743
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:15,361
not so bad if it's wet,
but if the amount of flammable material 

744
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:17,890
is increasing and it gets really dry and
then it burns,

745
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,360
then you have a real problem.

746
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,080
The forest fire can burn so hot that it 
burns the topsoil right off,

747
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,300
in which case you don't have a forest at
all anymore.

748
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:33,301
You just have a desert and low.
Lots of trees are evolved to withstand 

749
00:41:33,301 --> 00:41:37,531
forest,
have a certain intensity and some won't 

750
00:41:37,531 --> 00:41:38,750
even release their seeds unless there's 
been a fire,

751
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,990
and so a little bit of fire at the right
time can stop everything from burning to

752
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:48,500
the ground,
and that's also a really useful insight,

753
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,080
metaphorical insight into the nature of 
sacrifice,

754
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:56,081
right?
It's also a lot easier to let go of 

755
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,751
something when you're deciding to let go
of it because you've decided yourself 

756
00:41:58,751 --> 00:42:00,440
that you're done with that.
It's a weak part of you.

757
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,410
It needs to disappear.
You do that yourself.

758
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:08,000
It's much better and much easier than it
is if it's taken away from you forcibly,

759
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:09,770
in which case you're very much likely to
fight it.

760
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,520
These other.
There's another interesting thing here,

761
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,190
a motif that runs through the entire 
Bible.

762
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:21,191
It's a very,
very powerful motif and it's partly 

763
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:23,741
associated with this idea of walking 
with or walking before God and in the 

764
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,660
New Testament,
Christ says something like,

765
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:32,090
my fathers will be done and he means 
that that will should be done through 

766
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,450
him,
and so I can't.

767
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,980
I won't be able to state this exactly 
right,

768
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:38,720
but it's something like this.
You know,

769
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:43,721
a lot of what people regard as their own
personalities and and are proud of about

770
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,580
their own personalities,
aren't their own personalities at all.

771
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,600
They're useless.
Idiosyncrasies that defer them,

772
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,560
differentiate them trivially from other 
people,

773
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,960
but they have no value in and of 
themselves.

774
00:42:56,961 --> 00:43:01,961
They're more like quirks.
I remember once I was trying to teach a 

775
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:05,801
particularly stubborn student about how 
to write and she had written a number of

776
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:12,641
essays in university and got universally
walloped for them and the reason for 

777
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,680
that was she couldn't write really at 
all.

778
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:20,681
She was really,
really bad at writing and so I was 

779
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,491
sitting down with her trying to explain 
to her what she was doing wrong and she 

780
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:28,490
was being very annoying about it,
very recalcitrant,

781
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:30,170
very,
very unwilling to listen.

782
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,690
That was a pearls before swine thing,
you know,

783
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,770
and at one point she said,
I can write perfectly well,

784
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:41,771
this university professors just don't 
like my style and I could feel my hands 

785
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:41,990
creep towards her neck.

786
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,980
Yeah.
Well that'd be funny if it wasn't true,

787
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:51,070
but it was also true,
you know,

788
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,760
and I thought,
what the Hell is with you?

789
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,870
You can't even write and you think you 
have a style and normally do you think.

790
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:04,710
Yeah,
no,

791
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,570
not knowing how to write is not a style.
That's the other point.

792
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,830
Right.
And so,

793
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,880
you know,
she,

794
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,810
she instead of humbling herself,
which was necessary and okay.

795
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:18,811
Right.
Because she was a new university 

796
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:18,811
students like,
of course you don't know how to write.

797
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:18,811
When were you going to learn in school?

798
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:19,430
I think so.

799
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,230
So she had this,
you know,

800
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,510
this,
this style issue in it.

801
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,970
It just,
it just didn't go anywhere at all.

802
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:38,270
And so now let's see.
I lost my train of thought and telling 

803
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:38,310
you,
telling you all those jokes,

804
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,780
don't we ask in terms of above letting 
things burn off.

805
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:43,230
Yeah.
Well,

806
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,940
so she was proud of her insufficiency 
outs.

807
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,650
Arrogance,
right?

808
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:51,651
That's not humility.
It's self deception and arrogance to be 

809
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:52,020
proud of your insufficiency.
That's a very foolish thing.

810
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,980
And that means to cling to the parts of 
you that are dead.

811
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,320
Okay.
Now there's this idea that runs through 

812
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,750
the Bible,
I think as a whole that.

813
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:09,650
Okay,
I'll tell you another little side story 

814
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:09,650
here.
I was reading about socrates today and I

815
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,860
was reading about socrates trial,
you know,

816
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:15,390
he was tried by the Athenians for 
corrupting,

817
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:20,930
for failing to worship the gods and 
corrupting the youth of Athens by like 

818
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,770
teaching them stuff and asking them 
questions,

819
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:24,840
you know,
which is great way to corrupt people.

820
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:29,841
And so he knew the trial was coming and 
Athens wasn't a very big place and only 

821
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:33,450
had about 25,000
people.

822
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:38,451
Everybody knew everybody.
Everybody knew who the powerful guys 

823
00:45:38,451 --> 00:45:38,451
were in everybody,
including socrates,

824
00:45:38,451 --> 00:45:42,330
knew that the trial was a warning to 
like,

825
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:43,340
get out of town.
Right?

826
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,510
So we're going to put you on trial in 
six months.

827
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:49,800
And the potential penalty is death.
Got that.

828
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,840
It's like,
so.

829
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,900
So socrates had a chat with his 
compatriots and they were contemplating 

830
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,821
fair means and fall to set up a defense 
for him so that he could or to leave so 

831
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:04,380
that he could not be tried and put to 
death.

832
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,920
And uh,
he decided that he wasn't going to do 

833
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,460
that.
And he also decided that he wasn't going

834
00:46:11,461 --> 00:46:14,940
to even think about his defense.
And he said,

835
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:17,070
why?
And this is quite an interesting thing.

836
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,480
He said,
why?

837
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:23,481
He told one of his friends that he had 
this voice in his head,

838
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,480
a Daemon is spirit,
something like that,

839
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,490
that he always listened to in that that 
was one of the reasons he was different 

840
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:34,490
from other people because he always 
listened to this thing.

841
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,840
It didn't tell him what to do,
but it told him what not to do.

842
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,500
It always told them what not to do and 
if it told him not to do something,

843
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:45,501
that he didn't do it.
If he was speaking and the little voice 

844
00:46:45,501 --> 00:46:48,771
came up and said no.
Then he shut up and he tried to say 

845
00:46:48,771 --> 00:46:50,520
something else.
And he was very emphatic about this.

846
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,520
And he said that when he tried to plan 
to evade the trial or even to mount his 

847
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:59,280
own defense,
the voice came up and said,

848
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,520
no,
don't bother with it.

849
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,690
And he thought,
well,

850
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:09,650
what the hell do you mean by that?
Like there's a trial coming and I'm 

851
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,001
going to be put to death.
And while he eventually concluded that 

852
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:15,620
he was an old guy,
you know,

853
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:17,790
the next 10 years he was in his 
seventies,

854
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:20,760
perhaps the next 10 years weren't going 
to be that great forum.

855
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:23,940
He got a chance,
maybe the gods were giving them a chance

856
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,320
just to bow out,
you know,

857
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,400
to put us in fares,
in order to say goodbye to everyone to 

858
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:30,400
avoid that last descent into

859
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,620
catastrophe,
which might've been particularly painful

860
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:37,621
for a philosopher and to and to walk off
the world on his own terms,

861
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:43,410
something like that.
The point I'm making with that is that 

862
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:49,431
socrates attended to this internal voice
that at least told them what not to do 

863
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:54,090
and then he didn't do it.
And of course socrates was a very 

864
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:56,611
remarkable man and we still hear about 
them today and we know that he existed 

865
00:47:56,611 --> 00:47:59,851
and all of those things.
And so back to the back to the walking 

866
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:03,790
with God idea.
You know,

867
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:09,270
as you elevate your aim,
you create a judge at the same time,

868
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:13,630
right?
Because the new ideal,

869
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:17,110
which is an ideal you,
even if it's just an ideal position that

870
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:22,111
you might occupy.
Even if it's still conceptualized in 

871
00:48:22,111 --> 00:48:24,481
that concrete way,
that becomes a judge because it's above 

872
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:24,481
you,
right,

873
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:25,930
and then you're.
You're terrified of it.

874
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:29,050
Maybe that's why you might be afraid 
when you go start a new job,

875
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:34,051
right?
Because this thing is above you and 

876
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:34,051
you're terrified of it and the judges 
you,

877
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:38,010
and that's useful because the judge that
you're creating by formulating the ideal

878
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:43,830
tells you what's useless about yourself 
and then you can dispense with it and 

879
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:49,321
you wanted to keep doing that,
and then every time you make a judge 

880
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:51,871
that's more elevated,
then there's more useless you that has 

881
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:54,421
to be dispensed with,
and then if you create an ultimate 

882
00:48:54,421 --> 00:48:58,051
judge,
which is what the architectural 

883
00:48:58,051 --> 00:48:59,080
imagination of humankind has done,
say with the figure of Christ,

884
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:04,081
because if Christ is nothing else,
he is at least the archetypical perfect 

885
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:06,220
man and therefore the judge.
You have a judge that says,

886
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:09,670
get rid of everything about yourself 
that isn't perfect.

887
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,110
Of course,
that's also what Abraham.

888
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,030
That's also what God tells Abraham,
right?

889
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,620
He says,
to be perfect,

890
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:18,130
to pick on ideal,
that's high enough and you can do this.

891
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,250
The thing that's interesting about this,
I think as you can do it more or less on

892
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:24,520
your own terms,
you have to have some collaboration from

893
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:29,521
other people,
but you don't have to pick an external 

894
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:31,951
ideal.
You can pick an ideal that fulfills the 

895
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:31,951
role of ideal for you.
You can say,

896
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:36,121
okay,
well if things could be set up for me 

897
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:37,630
the way I need them to be and if I could
be who I needed to be,

898
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:41,470
what would that look like?
And you can figure that out for yourself

899
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:46,471
and then instantly you have a judge.
And I also think that's part of the 

900
00:49:46,471 --> 00:49:46,471
reason people don't do it right?
Why don't.

901
00:49:46,471 --> 00:49:49,570
Why don't people look up and move ahead 
and answer is,

902
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:50,410
well,
you know,

903
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,210
you start formulating an ideal.

904
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:57,210
You formulate a judge.
It's pretty easy to feel intimidated in 

905
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,020
the face of your own ideal.
That's what happens to cane versus able,

906
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:04,021
for example.
Then it's really easy to destroy the 

907
00:50:04,021 --> 00:50:05,050
ideal instead of to try to pursue it 
because then you get rid of the judge,

908
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,040
but it's way better lower the damn judge
if it's too much.

909
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:11,410
Like if you're current ambition is 
crushing you,

910
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:16,650
you know,
then maybe you're playing the tyrant to 

911
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:16,650
yourself and you should tap down your 
ambitions,

912
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,910
not get rid of them by any stretch of 
imagination,

913
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:22,210
but at least put the more reasonably 
within your grasp.

914
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:25,660
You don't have to leap from point one to
point 50 in one leap,

915
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:27,440
right?
You can do it incrementally,

916
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:33,010
but I really liked this idea.
I think it's a profound idea that the 

917
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:37,541
process of recapitulating yourself 
continually is also the process of it's 

918
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,500
a phoenix like process,
right?

919
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:44,501
You're shedding all those elements of 
you that are no longer worthy of the 

920
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:47,150
pursuits that you're,
that you're valuing,

921
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,370
and then I would say the idea here is 
that as you do that,

922
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,350
you shape yourself evermore

923
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,240
precisely into something that can 
withstand the tragedy of life and that 

924
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,790
can act as a,
as a beacon to the world.

925
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:05,170
That's the right way of thinking about 
it,

926
00:51:05,171 --> 00:51:07,870
maybe first to your friends and then to 
your family.

927
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:13,170
It's like it's a hell of a finance 
ambition and there's no reason that it 

928
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:13,170
can't happen.
You know,

929
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:17,821
every one of you knows people who are 
really bloody useful in a crisis and 

930
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:17,920
people that you admire,
right?

931
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:20,080
Those are all you can think of.
All those people,

932
00:51:20,081 --> 00:51:25,081
as you admire that you admire us.
Partial incarnations of the archetypal 

933
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,580
Messiah.
That's exactly right,

934
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,480
and the more that that manifests itself 
in any given person,

935
00:51:31,481 --> 00:51:36,481
then the more generally useful and 
admirable that person is in a multitude 

936
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:38,590
of situations and we don't know the 
limit to that,

937
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,440
but people can be unbelievably good for 
things.

938
00:51:41,441 --> 00:51:43,960
You know?
It's really something to behold.

939
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,830
So that's what God tells Abraham.
Okay,

940
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:50,770
so the next story is about Abraham and 
these angels.

941
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:55,771
Angels show up on his doorstep,
and this is part of the story of Sodom 

942
00:51:55,771 --> 00:51:56,560
and Gomorrah,
but I don't think,

943
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:02,100
as I said,
this story's generally read as if it's 

944
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,710
about homosexuality,
but I don't think it is here.

945
00:52:02,711 --> 00:52:05,980
I think it's about two things primarily.
One is

946
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,040
how do you treat the strange?
So the strangest,

947
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:16,270
strange things in strange ideas and 
strange people and strangers,

948
00:52:16,271 --> 00:52:17,020
right?
It's all about.

949
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,040
It's that which is not you.
It's like the strange lands that God 

950
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:26,320
asked Abraham to move out into how do 
you interact with the strange

951
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,200
and here,
here's one part possible rule because 

952
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:32,200
you could say to yourself,
well,

953
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,310
what do I want to make friends with 
more?

954
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:39,340
Where do I want to be more comfortable?
Do I want to be more comfortable with 

955
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,671
that which I already know,
and so that would be the circumscribed 

956
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:46,571
territory that you've already mastered,
or do I want to be comfortable with all 

957
00:52:46,571 --> 00:52:50,951
those things I don't know,
and then the right answer is that you 

958
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:53,360
should want to be comfortable with all 
those things that you don't know because

959
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:58,010
there is a bloody lot of things that you
don't know and if you can be a sojourner

960
00:52:58,011 --> 00:53:01,910
among what you don't know,
well then you're so protected because,

961
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:07,270
well,
you're going to go lots of places where 

962
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:07,270
you don't know and you're going to be 
able to manage it.

963
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,691
So you want to be.
You want to be that person that can act 

964
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,991
where they don't know and so well.
So what happens with with Abraham?

965
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:20,060
Well,
he's at home and these angels show up.

966
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,350
Now

967
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,590
we don't know whether they're angels,
men,

968
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:29,280
precisely because while as this part of 
the story reads,

969
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:34,281
as the Lord appeared to him in the 
plains of camera and he sat in the tent 

970
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:36,780
door in the heat of the day,
so he's another visionary state by the,

971
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:39,420
by all appearances,
and he lifted up his eyes and looked and

972
00:53:39,421 --> 00:53:44,421
lo three men stood by him.
There's real ambivalence in the story 

973
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:47,871
about the man or the three men are the 
three angels are there to angels and 

974
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:51,981
God.
It's all mixed up in this story so we 

975
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:53,550
won't clarify that.
We'll leave it ambiguous and I think the

976
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:58,551
ambiguity is important because you don't
know who the stranger is when you 

977
00:53:58,551 --> 00:54:02,331
encounter and it depends on whether 
you're thinking about it in the 

978
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:06,150
normative manner or if you're thinking 
about it in the transcendent matter.

979
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,390
Because with each person that you meet 
while they're just a person,

980
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:13,770
that's one way of thinking about it and 
then they're the person that you know or

981
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:18,210
they're the person as they choose to 
reveal themselves to you and people keep

982
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,230
themselves shielded.

983
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,190
But then there also something of great 
metaphysical potential,

984
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,870
right?
And you might say,

985
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:27,180
well do you believe that?
And I would say,

986
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:32,181
well yes,
you believe it because you expect a lot 

987
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:33,420
from people generally speaking and are 
not happy if they betray you.

988
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:38,810
But more importantly,
our entire culture is predicated on the 

989
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,830
idea that each person has an indefinite 
intrinsic worth.

990
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:45,831
And I'm not talking about self esteem.
I'm talking about something like the 

991
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:46,640
what,
what,

992
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:50,550
what would you say it?
The implicit presupposition in our legal

993
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:54,000
structure that no matter who you are,
even if you're a murderer,

994
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:59,001
even if you're a condemned murderer,
that there's something about you that's 

995
00:54:59,001 --> 00:55:01,890
of transcendent value that has to be 
respected by the law,

996
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:03,790
by the law and by other people.
Right?

997
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,190
And so that's,
that's a remark.

998
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,750
And you might say,
well,

999
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,780
you know,
do I believe that the answer that is 

1000
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,061
well yak it out because you follow the 
law and it's not an easy thing to pull 

1001
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:14,061
out of the law.

1002
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:18,320
It's kind of the idea that you have 
intrinsic natural rights and you don't 

1003
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,311
pull that out of our law man without 
having the whole thing fall down and I 

1004
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:26,241
think the whole idea that you have 
intrinsic natural rights is predicated 

1005
00:55:26,241 --> 00:55:29,481
on something like the biblical 
hypothesis that human beings have,

1006
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:35,061
a logos nature and that we are involved 
in this speaking forth of being and as 

1007
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,170
beings who are who are involved in this 
speaking forth of being.

1008
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,370
There's something about us that has to 
be respected by,

1009
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,980
by ourselves,
in relationship to ourselves,

1010
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,050
by ourselves,
in relationship to other people,

1011
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:53,970
but even more strangely by ourselves in 
relationship to even to criminals,

1012
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:58,971
even to vicious criminals.
You can't remove that transcendent 

1013
00:55:58,971 --> 00:56:00,750
element and that's that to me,
that's also a mirror,

1014
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:04,560
a miracle of conceptualization because 
who the hell is going to think that up?

1015
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,460
Right?
Even the most vicious of murderers has a

1016
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:11,250
touch of the transcendent that needs to 
be respected.

1017
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:15,630
Of all the ideas that are unlikely,
that's got a top the list,

1018
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:19,110
and of course without that you.
You have a very barbaric legal system,

1019
00:56:19,111 --> 00:56:24,111
right?
Because no one is protected as soon as 

1020
00:56:24,111 --> 00:56:24,111
you make a mistake,
then you're in the.

1021
00:56:24,111 --> 00:56:26,740
Then you have no rights whatsoever,
and that isn't what happens in the West,

1022
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:29,710
which is an absolutely amazing thing.
So anyways,

1023
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,170
Abraham is a master of the stranger.
That's one way of thinking about it.

1024
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:42,150
He knows what to do when strangers come 
along and he opens his.

1025
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:46,060
He opens himself up to them and I would 
say he does that.

1026
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,430
We know he's not a naive guy,
Abraham,

1027
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:49,780
right?
He's no weakling.

1028
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,910
A couple of stories ago,
he took a big army and went and harassed

1029
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,460
a bunch of kings and took his nephew 
back.

1030
00:56:57,461 --> 00:56:59,230
He's,
he's a tough guy.

1031
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,620
And so if stranger show up and he 
welcomes them,

1032
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,890
it's not because he couldn't do 
otherwise.

1033
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:11,190
He could certainly do otherwise.
And it's not because he isn't aware of 

1034
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:14,670
what people can be like.
He's perfectly aware of what people can 

1035
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:17,371
be like,
but he determines to take a particular 

1036
00:57:17,371 --> 00:57:17,560
attitude towards them and that is to 
welcome them.

1037
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:19,960
And so,
and why would you do that?

1038
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:24,961
And I think the answer to that is you 
hold out your hand in trust to someone 

1039
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,510
and you evoke the best from them if 
that's there to be given.

1040
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,750
So it's an act of courage.
It's like it's.

1041
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:37,030
It isn't me meeting you.
Exactly,

1042
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,300
not exactly.
It's more like the transcendent part of 

1043
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,091
me making a gesture that allows the 
transcendent part of you to step 

1044
00:57:45,091 --> 00:57:46,870
forward.
And that happens all the time.

1045
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,020
It happens all the time in normative 
discourse.

1046
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:55,021
You know this perfectly well because 
sometimes you can have a real casual 

1047
00:57:55,021 --> 00:57:55,390
conversation with someone that just goes
nowhere,

1048
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:55,630
right?

1049
00:57:55,630 --> 00:58:00,630
It's just shallow as can be or now.
And then you can actually make contact 

1050
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:00,820
with someone.
Right?

1051
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:03,610
And you're both,
I would say enlightened down ennobled by

1052
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:08,611
the conversation and that's a deal.
We would call that a deep conversation 

1053
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:10,990
for for some reason,
because we made a deep connection.

1054
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,720
Whatever that means,
it means well,

1055
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:15,370
it certainly means that it's not 
shallow.

1056
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,620
We were not sure about what these 
metaphor means,

1057
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:19,990
but it means that it reaches deep inside
of you.

1058
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:23,320
It's something like that.
You make direct person to person contact

1059
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,560
and those sorts of conversations are,
I'm replenishing that that's the right 

1060
00:58:29,501 --> 00:58:34,501
way to think about it.
They genuinely are and I think that's 

1061
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:37,381
because they provide you with that bread
that's not material bread and that's the

1062
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:43,441
information that you need to to thrive 
and to put yourself together and so it 

1063
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:49,411
does matter how you meet someone and it 
doesn't matter how you treat them when 

1064
00:58:49,411 --> 00:58:49,600
you first meet them and it's amazing.

1065
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,940
I've learned to do this at least in 
part,

1066
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,890
partly because I'm a clinical 
psychologist.

1067
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:58,891
I've learned how to talk to people very 
rapidly and I have the most amazing 

1068
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:02,161
adventures with people in cabs and when 
I travel because all talked to them 

1069
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:06,181
directly right away and they'll tell me 
the wildest stories and show me the 

1070
00:59:06,181 --> 00:59:09,691
craziest things because I'm actually 
interested in what they have to say and 

1071
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:10,330
I'm not afraid.
Well,

1072
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:12,190
I'm somewhat afraid,
but I'm not.

1073
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:17,730
I'm not sufficiently afraid to have that
stopped me and I'm acting on the 

1074
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:21,421
presupposition that the person has 
something of great interest to reveal 

1075
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,470
and that's a very useful thing to know 
too.

1076
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:29,471
Because one of the things that's really 
cool about people that know you really 

1077
00:59:29,471 --> 00:59:30,320
learn this as a clinical psychologist is
that if you can get people talking,

1078
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,110
they're so damn interesting,
you can hardly stand it.

1079
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:38,670
You know,
because they have these idiosyncratic 

1080
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,931
experiences that are only there is right
there only there's personally no one 

1081
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:44,411
else could tell the story,
and that's the kind of stories that you 

1082
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:44,411
want to hear.
And when they tell you those stories,

1083
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:48,941
you learn something you didn't know.
And so what that means is that you can 

1084
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:52,271
treat the landscape of strangers as an 
endless vista of places to learn things 

1085
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:57,671
you didn't know.
And if you know enough so that you're 

1086
00:59:57,671 --> 01:00:00,260
satisfied with your life and everything 
has ceased to be a tragedy around you.

1087
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:04,460
Well then you can be comfortable in your
circumscribed domain of,

1088
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,190
of totalitarian knowledge,
let's say.

1089
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:12,430
But if you're,
if your life is insufficient and you're 

1090
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:13,610
suffering more than you want to and 
everything isn't what it should be,

1091
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:17,180
then you need to look where you haven't 
looked for what you don't have,

1092
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,790
and then you can look outside beyond 
you.

1093
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:22,490
And then you can make friends with what 
you don't understand,

1094
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:27,760
and that's a huge part of what this 
story's about because what happens is 

1095
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,471
that Abraham welcomes the men,
God angels and treats them very well and

1096
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:36,110
reaps a tremendous benefit as a 
consequence.

1097
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:41,111
And then,
well then the story reverses and we end 

1098
01:00:41,111 --> 01:00:44,571
up in Sodom and Gomorrah were the same 
angels sojourn and they're treated 

1099
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:47,630
terribly and all hell breaks loose.
And so that's what the story's about.

1100
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:49,780
It's fundamental.
Now there's A.

1101
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,930
There's a sexual impropriety thing going
on that I'm also going to delve into,

1102
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:56,510
but I don't think that's the critical 
issue in the story.

1103
01:00:56,511 --> 01:01:01,511
The critical issue in this story is how 
do you act in the face of the stranger?

1104
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,970
You know there's a statement in the New 
Testament,

1105
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:07,850
Christ says something like,
when you,

1106
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,850
when you do something to the least of 
people,

1107
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:14,920
you do it to me him.
Right?

1108
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:19,960
And that's a very difficult statement to
understand too,

1109
01:01:19,961 --> 01:01:24,961
but it's something like it's something 
reminiscent of the requirement to keep 

1110
01:01:27,281 --> 01:01:30,460
the idea of the transcendent reality of 
the person in mind.

1111
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:35,461
At the same time,
you keep their proximal reality in mind 

1112
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:38,610
to have to have your mind in two places 
at the same time when you're talking to 

1113
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:39,100
people,

1114
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:47,860
you know,
I learned from a friend of mine in 

1115
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,991
Montreal who's very socially 
sophisticated in some ways.

1116
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,200
Whenever,
when whenever he went into a store,

1117
01:01:53,201 --> 01:01:58,070
I always like going shopping with him 
and whenever he went into a store and he

1118
01:01:58,071 --> 01:02:00,890
talked and he had an interaction with a 
clerk,

1119
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,740
the first thing he would do is have an 
interaction with the clerk.

1120
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:04,090
You know,
he,

1121
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:06,920
he wouldn't have any interaction with 
the role of the clerk.

1122
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,400
He'd like look at the person,
sort of take stock of the fact that they

1123
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:15,401
were there and then ask them something 
genuine about their job or their store,

1124
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:20,250
how they were doing,
like go into a conversation away and

1125
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,220
he didn't get personal about it because 
that can be intrusive,

1126
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:28,221
right?
You have to be very sophisticated to do 

1127
01:02:28,221 --> 01:02:29,901
this,
but he did indicate to the person that 

1128
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,130
he was there,
at least in part for the good that could

1129
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,530
be done between them.
It's something like that.

1130
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:39,800
And then the person would be 
ridiculously helpful,

1131
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,120
you know,
and,

1132
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,780
and so then you know,
if people mistreat you,

1133
01:02:45,781 --> 01:02:50,330
you see this with anti social kids,
it's very tragic thing to see because if

1134
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:52,970
you're an antisocial child,
by the time you were about four,

1135
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,460
you're very hostile and distrustful to 
people.

1136
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:59,510
And so you'd like a growling puppy.
And if you're a growling puppy,

1137
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,360
tend not to get petted,
you're more likely to get kicked.

1138
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,720
And if you're growling puppy and you get
kicked,

1139
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:09,740
then you have even more reason to grow.
And that's sort of the story of 

1140
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:13,241
antisocial kids.
If they're not well socialized by the 

1141
01:03:13,241 --> 01:03:16,391
time they're four and they're more on 
the aggressive side than they alienate 

1142
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:20,381
themselves from the community.
And all they get is rejection while and 

1143
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:21,290
then they look at the rejection and they
think,

1144
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:22,730
well

1145
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,460
hell with humanity,
you know,

1146
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:27,260
and no wonder they think that.
But,

1147
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:32,510
but the part of the catastrophe is that 
they get what they evoke.

1148
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:37,790
And,
and I'm not saying it's their fault 

1149
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:37,790
precisely,
but it doesn't matter.

1150
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:38,840
That's still what happens.
And so you might ask yourself,

1151
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,020
if you're not getting from people what 
you need,

1152
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,590
there is some possibility that you're 
not approaching,

1153
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:48,290
especially if this happens to you 
repeatedly across people.

1154
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:53,470
And this is a virtual certainty.
If it happens to you repeatedly across 

1155
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:56,861
people,
especially if you have the same bad 

1156
01:03:56,861 --> 01:03:56,861
experience with people,
it's not them,

1157
01:03:56,861 --> 01:03:59,480
it's you.
I would say three is the limit.

1158
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,700
If something happens to you,
once

1159
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:05,550
you write it off,
if it happens to you twice,

1160
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,610
it's like you open your eyes but you 
write it off.

1161
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:12,450
But if it harms tier three times,
it's probably you.

1162
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,920
Or is the rest of the world better?
It's you because you're not going to 

1163
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,350
change the rest of the world.
And he lifted up his eyes and looked.

1164
01:04:22,351 --> 01:04:24,510
And Lo three men stood by him.
And when he saw them,

1165
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:29,511
he ran to meet them from the tent door 
and bowed himself to the ground and 

1166
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:29,511
said,
my Lord,

1167
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:31,980
if now I have found favor in thy sight,
pass,

1168
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:33,630
not away.
I pray thee from Thy Servant.

1169
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:38,631
Let a little water.
I Pray You be fetched and wash your 

1170
01:04:38,631 --> 01:04:38,631
feet.
Wash your feet.

1171
01:04:38,631 --> 01:04:42,890
Take the dust from your feet,
extract yourself out from your journey,

1172
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,670
right and sit.

1173
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,560
I'll fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
ye your hearts after that you can pass 

1174
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:58,090
on for therefore are you come to your 
servant and they said so do as thou hast

1175
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,200
said,
and Abraham hastened into the tent,

1176
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,110
into the tent under Sarah and said,
make ready quickly.

1177
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:06,350
Three measures of fine meal,
knead it and make cakes upon the earth.

1178
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,800
Powerful call to hospitality here,
and Abraham ran onto the herd and 

1179
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,350
fetched a calf tender and good and gave 
it to a young man and he hasted to dress

1180
01:05:15,351 --> 01:05:20,351
it and he took butter and milk and the 
calf which he had dressed and set it 

1181
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:23,731
before them and he stood by them under 
the tree and they did eat some 

1182
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,420
commentary from here.
Hebrews 13,

1183
01:05:27,421 --> 01:05:32,421
to be not forgetful to entertain 
strangers for thereby some have 

1184
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:37,550
entertained angels unawares.
This is a commentary from Matthew Henry,

1185
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,170
who is a nonconformist minister and 
author,

1186
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,830
cheerful and obliging.
Manners in showing kindness are great.

1187
01:05:43,831 --> 01:05:46,920
Ornaments to piety.
There are condescending,

1188
01:05:46,921 --> 01:05:48,360
Lord Vouch,
safest,

1189
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:53,360
not personal visits to us,
yet still by his spirit,

1190
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:55,880
he stands at the door and knocks.
When we're inclined to open,

1191
01:05:55,881 --> 01:05:58,610
he deigns to enter by his gracious 
constellations.

1192
01:05:58,611 --> 01:06:01,610
He provides a rich feast of which we 
partake with him.

1193
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,710
This is from revelations 3:20.
Behold,

1194
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:11,711
I stand at the door and knock.
If any man hear my voice and open the 

1195
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:15,041
door,
I will come into him and will sup with 

1196
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:15,041
him and he with me.
Well,

1197
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:19,070
the hyperlink nature of those quotes is 
quite obvious.

1198
01:06:19,071 --> 01:06:22,160
There's 10 or 15 things being said at 
the same time,

1199
01:06:22,161 --> 01:06:27,161
right?
One is a reference to the idea that if 

1200
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:27,161
you ask for something,
it will be given to you.

1201
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:28,550
Right?
It was a very strange idea,

1202
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:31,960
but I like that idea a lot and I believe
my,

1203
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,160
in my experience,
that has been true.

1204
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:39,550
If it was that I wanted what I was 
asking for because that's the real 

1205
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:39,550
issue,
right?

1206
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:42,080
Because the question is if you want 
something,

1207
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:47,290
what does it mean to want it?
And what it means is to sacrifice 

1208
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:50,480
whatever is necessary to get it because 
otherwise you don't want it.

1209
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:56,260
And so there's an equation here,
and I'm not claiming it's ultimate 

1210
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:00,341
accuracy,
but the equation is something like you 

1211
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:01,430
don't want it unless you're willing to 
sacrifice for it.

1212
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:07,210
And if you don't want it,
you're not going to get it because 

1213
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:09,911
you're scattered.
But if you do want at any make the 

1214
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:10,190
proper sacrifices,
then

1215
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,450
God only knows what might happen.
And that's a c.

1216
01:07:15,451 --> 01:07:20,451
One of the things I really like about 
the existential philosophers is their 

1217
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:25,791
emphasis on personal responsibility.
Many of them had an emphasis on the role

1218
01:07:26,551 --> 01:07:29,550
that people had in shaping their own 
destiny.

1219
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:34,730
The exits for the existentialists.
And I think this was a consequence of 

1220
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:35,190
the religious substructure,
of,

1221
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,930
of philosophical thinking.
It was self evident that life was tragic

1222
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:42,240
and bitter,
but,

1223
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,880
and then fair enough,
but that isn't where it ended.

1224
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:47,190
The next issue was,
well,

1225
01:07:47,191 --> 01:07:52,191
there are better in ways,
better and worse ways of dealing with 

1226
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:55,101
that.
And the better way of dealing with the 

1227
01:07:55,101 --> 01:07:57,110
fact that life is tragic and better is 
to pause it,

1228
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:01,940
the self you could be and live 
authentically in relationship to that.

1229
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:06,110
And then the next issue and some this is
something kierkegaard talked about,

1230
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,680
particularly when he talked about the 
necessity of being a knight of faith,

1231
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:14,681
is that the thing is,
and this is I think part of the light 

1232
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:16,580
part of life that's the intractable 
adventure.

1233
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,400
No one can take the adventure of life 
away from you,

1234
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,940
that they can't do it with good advice,
for example,

1235
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:28,210
because no one can demonstrate to you 
that if you straighten yourself out a 

1236
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:32,421
name at what you want and make the 
proper sacrifices that your life will 

1237
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:33,920
turn out in the manner that you might 
want it to turn out.

1238
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:38,120
It isn't in anyone else's purview to 
make that judgment.

1239
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:42,110
The only person that can possibly figure
that out is you.

1240
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,480
It's something that can't be stolen from
you.

1241
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:49,481
I would say it's your destiny.
It's a destiny that cannot be stolen 

1242
01:08:49,481 --> 01:08:50,540
from you and you can forgo it.
You can say,

1243
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:55,541
well,
I'm not willing to put in the effort 

1244
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:55,541
because what if I fail?
Well,

1245
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:55,820
first of all,
if you don't put in the effort,

1246
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:00,880
you will fail because life is hard and 
it takes everything out of you to do it 

1247
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:07,271
properly so you will fail and if you 
make the proper sacrifices,

1248
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:08,720
you might fail.

1249
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:13,750
That's why I like the ambiguity and the 
story of Cain and Abel because we're 

1250
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,020
never really told why God rejected 
Kane's offerings.

1251
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:18,290
There's hands that came maybe isn't 
doing as good a job as he should,

1252
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,250
and he certainly gets bitter about it,
but there's no smoking pistol.

1253
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,030
It doesn't say,
well,

1254
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:25,560
Cain is a bad guy.
He made terrible sacrifices,

1255
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,830
so god rejected him.
You never know.

1256
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:32,950
Cain might've been working pretty damn 
hard and things still didn't work out 

1257
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:35,981
for them,
and I think that ambiguity is 

1258
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:37,250
appropriate in the story because that 
ambiguity ambiguity is in life.

1259
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:42,570
You'd be.
You'd be a fool to say that everything 

1260
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:43,670
always works out for everyone if they 
just do things right.

1261
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,140
I mean,
I think that's a very.

1262
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:50,240
That's a very careless thing to say,
given how much tragedy and catastrophe 

1263
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,980
there is in the world and how much of it
seems to be undeserved,

1264
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:55,160
but that still has very little bearing I
think on,

1265
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:58,790
on,
on your own individual adventure and the

1266
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:03,791
necessity for the necessity for opening 
the door to who you could be and,

1267
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:14,190
and the necessity to do that.
Seriously.

1268
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:19,430
And I do believe and I think I,
I think that's why this most impossible 

1269
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:21,180
of versus you know,
knock and the door will open.

1270
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:26,540
Why that's believable is that I have 
never met anyone who couldn't

1271
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,700
hypothesize a better them in some 
manner.

1272
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,520
All they had to do is ask.
It's like,

1273
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:37,570
well,
how could you be better?

1274
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,390
Thank well here's three ways.
It's like,

1275
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:40,570
it's no problem,
right?

1276
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:43,270
You can think about that no time flat.
Maybe it's small ways,

1277
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:48,540
but you can almost always at least think
of something stupid that you're doing 

1278
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,310
that you could quit.
And so that means that you do have this.

1279
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:56,360
It's a strange thing in people that we 
have this built in capacity to pause it 

1280
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,301
a higher self and then to move towards 
it and maybe maybe that's part of where 

1281
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:04,891
the religious instinct really came from 
speaking like really reductionistically 

1282
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:07,240
like as a materialist.
As an evolutionary psychologist,

1283
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,210
we have this notion of the transcendent 
ideal,

1284
01:11:10,211 --> 01:11:15,211
right?
That that seems to be pervasive across 

1285
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:15,211
cultures.
Well,

1286
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:18,170
that's the ultimate manifestation of the
human proclivity to be able to pause it 

1287
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,500
an ideal at all and to move forward.

1288
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:20,550
You pause it.
An ideal,

1289
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,040
okay.
That you need that to move forward.

1290
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,090
Well,
if you can pause it,

1291
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,920
an ideal,
why can't you pause it?

1292
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,510
The ultimate ideal?
Well,

1293
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:32,511
if you can then instantly you've got a 
religious sensibility instantly and so 

1294
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:35,040
maybe that's because I'm positive like 
as a biologist,

1295
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:39,120
what the hell is the basis of the 
religious instinct because the idea that

1296
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:42,300
it's mere superstition,
like we can just dispense with that.

1297
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:44,790
That's a wrong.
It's a human universal.

1298
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,430
You can evoke religious experiences all 
sorts of ways,

1299
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,760
so we're not going to play that game.
There's some reason that that instinct 

1300
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,481
exists and the first thing to do with it
is to try to reduce it to something 

1301
01:11:56,481 --> 01:11:59,580
that's biological and leave it at that.
Not to mess with the metaphysics,

1302
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:04,850
but it certainly could be the case that 
it's the ultimate extension of our 

1303
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:06,390
capacity to pause it and ideal and we 
also might say,

1304
01:12:06,391 --> 01:12:07,740
well,
that's good enough because,

1305
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:11,000
well,
the ideal moves you forward.

1306
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:16,001
It fills your life with meaning.
There's no doubt about that because it 

1307
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:17,360
is in the movement towards your ideal 
that life's meaning is to be attained.

1308
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,640
And then the question is,
well,

1309
01:12:19,641 --> 01:12:23,240
how much meaning is there in moving 
forward towards an ultimate ideal?

1310
01:12:23,241 --> 01:12:25,460
Well more meaning,
even though it's more difficult,

1311
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,710
how much?
Well,

1312
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,440
that's the open question.
Behold,

1313
01:12:32,441 --> 01:12:37,441
I will stand at the door and knock,
and if any man hear my voice and open 

1314
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:40,351
the door,
I will come into him and will sup with 

1315
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:40,351
him and he with me.
That's a pretty good deal.

1316
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,680
And the Angel said Unto Him,
where is Sarah?

1317
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:45,480
Thy Wife?
And Abraham said,

1318
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,760
behold in the tent.
And he said,

1319
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:51,000
I will certainly return unto thee 
according to the time of life.

1320
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,190
And Lo,
Sarah,

1321
01:12:53,191 --> 01:12:56,370
thy wife shall have a son,
and Sarah heard it in the tent door,

1322
01:12:56,371 --> 01:13:01,371
which was behind him.
Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well 

1323
01:13:01,451 --> 01:13:04,810
stricken in age,
and it had ceased to be with Sarah after

1324
01:13:04,811 --> 01:13:06,220
the manner of women.
Therefore,

1325
01:13:06,221 --> 01:13:10,150
Sarah laughed within herself saying,
after I am waxed old,

1326
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:14,020
shall I also have this pleasure,
my lord being old also.

1327
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:19,440
Well,
she's kind of skeptical about the whole 

1328
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,650
Angel Man,
God having a child at 100 thing.

1329
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:21,870
And,
and,

1330
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,280
and,
and rightly so.

1331
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:29,610
Rightly so.
And the Lord said Unto Abraham,

1332
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:33,250
why did Sarah Laugh saying,
shall I have a sorority bear,

1333
01:13:33,251 --> 01:13:38,251
a child which am old,
is anything too hard for the Lord at the

1334
01:13:38,621 --> 01:13:41,050
time appointed,
I will return unto thee according to the

1335
01:13:41,051 --> 01:13:44,410
time of life and Sarah shall have a son.
Then Sarah denied saying,

1336
01:13:44,411 --> 01:13:48,520
I left not for.
She was afraid and he said Nay,

1337
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:50,230
but though did slough

1338
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,760
and the men rose up from dance and look 
toward Sodom.

1339
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,680
And Abraham went with them to bring them
on the way.

1340
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:13,690
I'm going to make a small detour and 
talk to you about this idea of potential

1341
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:16,900
again because it's really,
really thought about it a lot.

1342
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,960
I think music speaks of potential,
like I think music speaks of potential 

1343
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:22,360
bursting forward.
It's something.

1344
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:27,570
It's something like that and that's why 
it's so deeply meaningful and it's this 

1345
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:31,890
continual pattern revelation of of the 
next wonderful thing that might happen.

1346
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:37,891
It's something like that.
So there's that and people find that 

1347
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:41,701
deeply meaningful and then there's the 
idea that we all have potential that 

1348
01:14:41,701 --> 01:14:46,561
isn't realized,
but that we regard that potential even 

1349
01:14:46,561 --> 01:14:49,450
though it's not realized as real,
which I can't get my head around at all.

1350
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:52,930
It just doesn't make sense.
And then although everyone acts that way

1351
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:58,560
and everyone believes it because white,
what you act reflects what you believe 

1352
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,580
and you make judgments about yourself 
and others based on those beliefs and 

1353
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:02,580
their deep judgements.

1354
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,980
So the idea that you believe that there 
is such a thing as human potential,

1355
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:10,981
I think.
I think it's undeniable if you act at 

1356
01:15:10,981 --> 01:15:11,260
all,
if you expect things of people at all,

1357
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,710
then you're demonstrating your 
commitment to the idea of potential,

1358
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:18,310
but then I wonder if there's something 
even deeper going on because we are very

1359
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:22,300
materialistic,
modern people and there's great power in

1360
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:27,301
that.
Obviously we've obtained great control 

1361
01:15:27,301 --> 01:15:29,020
over the material world for better or 
for worse,

1362
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:34,290
but we do have a tendency to think of 
the world purely as a material structure

1363
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:39,291
and he isn't really obvious to me that 
the world is exactly a material 

1364
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:40,810
structure.
It seems to be to be something more like

1365
01:15:40,811 --> 01:15:45,811
constrained potential know because 
everything is a certain way,

1366
01:15:45,881 --> 01:15:50,881
but everything that is a certain way 
could be a multitude of other ways and 

1367
01:15:50,881 --> 01:15:54,931
almost an infinite multitude of other 
ways and the degree to which something 

1368
01:15:54,931 --> 01:15:58,951
that is could be a multitude of other 
ways is dependent on large part on how 

1369
01:15:58,951 --> 01:15:58,951
you interact with it.

1370
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:04,020
Right.
Even with materials that were very 

1371
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,971
familiar with,
we continue to discover new properties 

1372
01:16:05,971 --> 01:16:08,140
and put them to use.
It's like things are.

1373
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:10,930
Things are compacted into their material
form,

1374
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:16,170
but that doesn't exhaust what they are,
especially not in relationship to other 

1375
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:20,401
things and so it seems to me even if you
can't replace the materialist 

1376
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:24,991
perspective with the perspective that 
it's better to construe the world 

1377
01:16:24,991 --> 01:16:29,520
construe being as if it's made of 
possibility rather than the world as if 

1378
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,001
it's made of matter.
It's at least useful to have that as an 

1379
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:34,300
additional viewpoint.
Is that because you could say,

1380
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:39,301
well the material philosophy is very 
useful as a tool for obtaining certain 

1381
01:16:39,301 --> 01:16:39,640
sorts of benefits,
which it clearly is,

1382
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:42,400
but then this more metaphysical 
perspective,

1383
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:47,460
which I think is more accurate in some 
ways that the world is a place of 

1384
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:50,221
potential is also an extraordinarily 
useful way to approach the world and and

1385
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:52,810
it is practically useful.

1386
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:57,810
You know what we talked last week a 
little bit about doing something as 

1387
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:59,620
simple as trying to organize a room.
It's,

1388
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:02,890
it's by no means obvious how much 
potential there is in a room,

1389
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,460
right?
There's a very large amount of potential

1390
01:17:06,461 --> 01:17:08,950
in any given room.
Tremendous amount of potential,

1391
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,960
especially if it's connected with people
and maybe an inexhaustible amount of 

1392
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,951
potential and maybe there's an 
inexhaustible amount of potential 

1393
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,820
everywhere and that we just don't know 
how to get access to it on.

1394
01:17:19,821 --> 01:17:21,410
That's certainly true.
I mean,

1395
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:26,430
it's certainly true to some degree.
We don't know how to get access to all 

1396
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:26,430
the potential of our children,
for example,

1397
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:31,331
or ourselves or our loved ones or it or,
or the people that we know so well.

1398
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:38,411
So I think the story is trying to hammer
that idea home to which is

1399
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:45,160
don't be so sure that it's impossible or
maybe don't let the assumption that's 

1400
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:46,790
it.
It's impossible.

1401
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:49,910
Stop you from going forth into the 
world.

1402
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:50,860
That would be.
And that's a,

1403
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:55,900
that's uh,
what would you say that's like an 

1404
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:55,900
inoculation against nihilism.
And I'm,

1405
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:58,550
for a long time I understood nihilism 
very well.

1406
01:17:58,551 --> 01:18:03,551
I could,
I could understand its rationale 

1407
01:18:03,551 --> 01:18:06,610
associated with the tragedy of life 
associating with suffering and evil 

1408
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:10,690
associated with the observation of 
finitude and the arbitrary and unjust 

1409
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:12,470
nature of the world.
But the more I've thought about it,

1410
01:18:12,471 --> 01:18:16,460
the less I've come to believe that 
there's any excuse for it whatsoever.

1411
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,480
And I think the reason for that is that 
it forestalls effort.

1412
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:26,200
It forestalls the ability to discover 
for yourself maybe there's no reason to 

1413
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:32,000
be so God damn hopeless except that it's
easier to be useless now.

1414
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:34,910
And believe me,
I'm not making that case.

1415
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:40,570
I'm not saying that that's what's be 
setting people who are clinically 

1416
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,180
depressed,
for example.

1417
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:44,600
That's not my point.
Clinical depression is a terrible thing.

1418
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:49,130
There's lots of reasons to be rendered 
to be,

1419
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:52,460
to be tossed into a catastrophic 
condition that isn't what I mean.

1420
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,710
I mean that kind of cynical,
arrogant,

1421
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:59,950
rational,
hyper-intelligent nihilism that throws 

1422
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:03,641
the world away as if it's of little use 
before it's been properly engaged,

1423
01:19:03,711 --> 01:19:04,040
with

1424
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:11,200
better to engage with it and see what 
happens and better to make the 

1425
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,020
assumption that if the world isn't 
returning to you,

1426
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:17,380
what it is that you need,
then are either you're not doing it 

1427
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:21,320
right or you've conceptualized what you 
need badly.

1428
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:25,880
Why not at least open yourself up to 
that possibility,

1429
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,820
right?
Because you could be wrong.

1430
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:31,010
Hopefully,
if you're suffering,

1431
01:19:31,011 --> 01:19:34,880
this is a great thing to know.
Hopefully if you're suffering,

1432
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:39,881
you're wrong,
because if you're suffering and you're 

1433
01:19:39,881 --> 01:19:39,881
right,
then there's nowhere to go,

1434
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,090
so it's very useful to find out whatever
errors you might be committing.

1435
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:47,150
Another thing that's really interesting 
about the Jews in the Old Testament,

1436
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:52,390
it's a remarkable thing.
Every single time they get flattened by 

1437
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:52,760
God,
it's always their fault.

1438
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:58,420
They never say,
the world that God created was 

1439
01:19:58,841 --> 01:19:59,980
corrupted.
God is evil.

1440
01:19:59,981 --> 01:20:01,720
They never say that.
No matter what happens,

1441
01:20:01,721 --> 01:20:04,030
right,
no matter what catastrophe occurs,

1442
01:20:04,031 --> 01:20:08,160
when they have every reason to at least 
put that hypothesis

1443
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,510
forward,
they don't.

1444
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,930
They say,
we aired,

1445
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,720
we walked off the path.
It's our fault,

1446
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,940
and that's hard,
you know,

1447
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:22,941
because it.
It puts all the weight of human 

1448
01:20:22,941 --> 01:20:22,941
catastrophe on the human being.
That's very hard,

1449
01:20:22,941 --> 01:20:26,880
but the upside is it gives you the 
control.

1450
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:32,480
It opens up the door that it opens up 
the possibility that you could be the 

1451
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,901
person that could set it right.
If you would just let go of what's in 

1452
01:20:35,901 --> 01:20:37,230
your way,
whatever that is,

1453
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,220
and the men rose up from thence and look
toward Sodom,

1454
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:50,630
and Abraham went with them to bring them
on the way and the Lord said,

1455
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:55,640
shall I hide from Abraham?
That thing which I'm about to do.

1456
01:20:56,150 --> 01:21:01,150
Seeing that Abraham shall surely become 
a great mighty nation and all the 

1457
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:01,850
nations of the Earth shall be blessed in
him.

1458
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:07,950
I guess God is talking to himself here 
or maybe he's talking to the angels,

1459
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,660
but I think he's trying to make a 
decision for I know him,

1460
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:18,230
that he will command his children and 
his household after him and they shall 

1461
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:22,431
keep the way of the Lord to do justice 
and judgment that the Lord may bring 

1462
01:21:22,431 --> 01:21:25,830
upon Abraham that which he has spoken of
him and the Lord said,

1463
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:30,480
because of the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah
is great,

1464
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,760
and because of their sin is very 
grievous.

1465
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:38,720
I will go down now and see whether they 
have done altogether according to the 

1466
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,230
cry of it,
which has come to me.

1467
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:41,520
And if not,
I will know.

1468
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:49,380
Well,
we don't know what's happened in Sodom 

1469
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,091
and Gomorrah,
but we know that God's got wind of it 

1470
01:21:51,091 --> 01:21:52,690
and that that's not good and we know 
that sin means to miss the mark,

1471
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:58,380
and so we know that whatever has 
happened in Sodom and Gomorrah means 

1472
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,351
that something about the natural ethical
order of things has been seriously 

1473
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:05,650
violated and there's a strong intimation
in the Old Testament,

1474
01:22:05,651 --> 01:22:07,690
which I think by the way,
is completely correct.

1475
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:12,720
That if the proper order of being is 
violated and that's something like the 

1476
01:22:13,811 --> 01:22:18,811
balance between chaos and order,
say if the proper balance of being is 

1477
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:22,600
violated,
then all hell will break loose.

1478
01:22:22,601 --> 01:22:25,960
And one of the things I can tell you 
from reading a very,

1479
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:32,430
from reading a very comprehensive set of
myths from around the world is that 

1480
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:35,740
that's a conclusion that human beings 
have come to everywhere.

1481
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:42,310
Stay on the God Damn Path and be careful
because if you start to mess around and 

1482
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:47,891
you deviate,
especially if you know that you're 

1483
01:22:47,891 --> 01:22:49,370
deviating,
things are not going to go well for you.

1484
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:52,880
And that idea is everywhere.
And I think it's right.

1485
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:57,881
I think the idea is right because there 
aren't that many ways of doing things 

1486
01:22:57,881 --> 01:22:59,540
right and there's a lot of ways of doing
things wrong and if you do things wrong,

1487
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,930
the consequences of doing them wrong can
be truly catastrophic.

1488
01:23:02,931 --> 01:23:06,130
You know,
one of the things I learned from reading

1489
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,700
Victor Frankl first,
but then Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,

1490
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:14,470
who I think did a deeper job was that 
Vaclav Havel thought the same thing,

1491
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:21,150
that these people were very much trying 
to understand what happened in places 

1492
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:23,990
like Nazi Germany and in the Soviet 
Union Solzhenitsyn's Gulag archipelago.

1493
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:28,330
Calico is a particularly good analysis 
of what happened in the Soviet Union and

1494
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:33,331
his conclusion and it's a 2100 page 
conclusion and it's like hammered home 

1495
01:23:33,611 --> 01:23:34,480
with a hammer.
It's,

1496
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:37,110
it's a book that everyone should read,
you know,

1497
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:42,150
assuming that you can read at 2100 page 
scream because that's basically what it 

1498
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:42,160
is.
You know,

1499
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:47,430
first of all,
what he does is document just how 

1500
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:47,430
terrible things were in the Soviet Union
between 19,

1501
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:52,081
19 in 1959.
And no matter how terrible you think 

1502
01:23:52,081 --> 01:23:52,120
they were,
unless you know the stories,

1503
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:57,270
they were a lot more terrible than that,
and they were terrible personally 

1504
01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:01,740
because everyone lied.
They were terrible in families because 

1505
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,090
two out of five people were government 
informers.

1506
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:07,930
They were terrible among friends because
no one could tell each other the truth.

1507
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:12,990
They were terrible socially because the 
whole system was corrupt and ban on 

1508
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:16,321
slave labor and they were terrible 
philosophically because the doctrine of 

1509
01:24:16,321 --> 01:24:21,031
man upon which the state was founded was
hopeless and nihilistic and they were 

1510
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:25,240
murderous,
destructive and genocidal.

1511
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:30,300
It's like they got it wrong at every 
single level of analysis simultaneously.

1512
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,050
And the question is why?
And Solzhenitsyn's answer,

1513
01:24:35,051 --> 01:24:37,420
and to some degree Victor Frankel's 
answer as well.

1514
01:24:37,421 --> 01:24:41,440
And Vaclav Havel and I would say also 
Nelson Mandela and Gandhi,

1515
01:24:41,441 --> 01:24:45,220
they all,
they all ended up in the same conceptual

1516
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:50,221
sphere.
And the answer was because individual 

1517
01:24:50,221 --> 01:24:52,711
people lived crooked lives because 
individual people swallowed lies and 

1518
01:24:53,141 --> 01:24:55,960
spoke them and didn't stand up for the 
truth.

1519
01:24:56,380 --> 01:25:01,380
And the corruption that spread from each
individual pulled the entire state 

1520
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:04,630
mechanism into that corruption and made 
everything into hell.

1521
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,220
You know,
there are other theories,

1522
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:07,540
a bed once,
right?

1523
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:09,730
That's kind of the milgrim idea from 
that.

1524
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,540
It's easy to make human beings obd,
obedient to people in authority.

1525
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:17,350
And I've explored that idea quite a bit 
with regards to what happens happen,

1526
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:19,330
for example,
in the Nazi concentration camps.

1527
01:25:19,331 --> 01:25:24,331
And yes,
you can set circumstances up so that 

1528
01:25:24,331 --> 01:25:27,580
people are likely to be obedient to 
orders that are pathological.

1529
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,320
There's no doubt about that.
And yes,

1530
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:32,140
sometimes that's indicative of the 
weakness of their character,

1531
01:25:32,141 --> 01:25:37,141
but that's not the issue.
And the idea that what happened in Nazi 

1532
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:38,330
Germany was because uh,
uh,

1533
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:42,130
population of good people listened to a 
tiny minority of bad people.

1534
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,410
That's a really how it's really not a 
good theory.

1535
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:50,160
The,
the Nazi ethos was there at every single

1536
01:25:50,381 --> 01:25:52,720
level of the social organization,
right?

1537
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,780
Right from the personal,
right,

1538
01:25:55,781 --> 01:25:57,070
from the personal,
right,

1539
01:25:57,071 --> 01:25:59,650
from the familial,
all the way up to the leadership.

1540
01:25:59,651 --> 01:26:04,651
It was the same thing all the way up and
all the way down and the same thing in 

1541
01:26:04,651 --> 01:26:04,820
the Soviet Union.

1542
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:10,990
And so we're also,

1543
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:17,810
if you miss the mark,
which is apparently what the people of 

1544
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:17,810
Sodom and Gomorrah,
he had,

1545
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:22,910
their sin was grievous,
then they risk destruction and I just 

1546
01:26:23,131 --> 01:26:28,131
cannot see how after the 20th century,
anybody with any sense could possibly 

1547
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:33,710
not see that as true.
And I think that there's a line in the 

1548
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:38,591
Old Testament,
you know that the fear of God is the 

1549
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:38,591
beginning of wisdom.

1550
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:43,660
I can tell you one of the things that 
frightened me badly was the realization 

1551
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:48,741
from reading soldier nets and under a 
variety of other things that I was 

1552
01:26:48,741 --> 01:26:50,670
reading at the same time that Dostoevsky
as well because he makes the same point.

1553
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,770
He said that a human being is not only 
responsible for everything they do,

1554
01:26:55,771 --> 01:26:57,600
but for everything that everyone else 
does,

1555
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,020
now you know that's crazy.
And he was an epileptic and a mystic.

1556
01:27:01,021 --> 01:27:03,180
And that's a crazy thing to say,
but it's also.

1557
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:06,420
There's something about it that's true.
Because if you were better,

1558
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,210
the people around you would be less 
worse than they are.

1559
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:14,600
And if you were good enough,
you don't know how much better the 

1560
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,100
people around you would be.
And so there's this idea to,

1561
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:20,580
you know that Christ took the sins of 
the world unto himself.

1562
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:22,350
That's a complicated idea,
Matt.

1563
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,510
I wrestled with that one for a very long
time,

1564
01:27:24,511 --> 01:27:27,120
but I think I figured out,
at least in part what it means.

1565
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,140
It meant that

1566
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:35,220
it's something like the realization of 
complete humanity you see,

1567
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:40,250
to take the sins of the world onto 
yourself is to realize that it's to 

1568
01:27:41,371 --> 01:27:44,430
understand the Nazi concentration camp 
guard,

1569
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,600
because that person is human and so are 
you.

1570
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:54,470
And so if you can't see you in that,
then you don't know who you are.

1571
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,930
And if you can see you in that,
well,

1572
01:27:57,931 --> 01:28:02,931
then you've started to take the sins of 
the world onto yourself because you've 

1573
01:28:02,931 --> 01:28:04,260
actually started to take responsibility 
for those terrible things.

1574
01:28:04,261 --> 01:28:09,261
You know,
I think it's the Motif of the motto of 

1575
01:28:09,261 --> 01:28:13,311
the Holocaust Museum in Washington.
We must never forget.

1576
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:16,440
That's close.
And I think,

1577
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:17,910
well,
you can't forget,

1578
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,010
you can't remember what you don't 
understand.

1579
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:21,900
You will forget what you don't 
understand.

1580
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:23,130
And the question is,
well,

1581
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,440
what are you supposed to remember about 
the Holocaust?

1582
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,800
It was a historical event that 6 million
people died.

1583
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:32,900
That's not.
What's to remember,

1584
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,900
wants to remember is that's what people 
can do,

1585
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:41,740
and you're one of them.
And if you don't understand that you 

1586
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:43,820
could do that,
then you don't know who you are.

1587
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:52,940
Thank you.

1588
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:59,820
So go ahead to making a case here.
He's making a case that the people of 

1589
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:02,070
Sodom and Gomorrah have sinned,
and it's making a large

1590
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:07,070
rackets that even God has heard about.
That's a very common mythological motif 

1591
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:09,060
by the way,
that the sins and,

1592
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,650
and,
and,

1593
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:16,510
and what would you call it?
The sins and noise of humanity can read 

1594
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:19,530
such a clamor that even the gods here in
and are forced to intervene.

1595
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:22,320
That comes all the way from the 
Mesopotamian creation story.

1596
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:24,720
So anyways,
it's logical.

1597
01:29:24,721 --> 01:29:25,970
Yeah,
they're sending.

1598
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:26,610
Okay,
well,

1599
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:27,300
so what?
Well,

1600
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:28,260
no,
not so wide.

1601
01:29:28,261 --> 01:29:32,370
It means that God's offended and that 
everything is at risk.

1602
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:35,160
That's what it means.
It's like that's something worth taking.

1603
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:40,161
Seriously.
The men turned their faces from thence 

1604
01:29:40,161 --> 01:29:44,631
and went towards Sodom,
but Abraham stood yet before the Lord 

1605
01:29:44,631 --> 01:29:48,170
and Abraham drew near and said,
will thou also destroy the righteous 

1606
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:52,191
with the wicked?
This is a very interesting part of the 

1607
01:29:52,191 --> 01:29:55,431
story.
A friend of mine took me to task the 

1608
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:58,200
other day when I was writing about 
portraying the old testament.

1609
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:03,200
God is pretty harsh and judgmental and 
the New Testament God is sort of all 

1610
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:03,200
loving,
which,

1611
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,950
which he isn't because there's the whole
book of revelations thing.

1612
01:30:04,951 --> 01:30:09,951
But um,
but I got that partly from reading 

1613
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:11,640
northrop Frye,
but going through the old testament more

1614
01:30:11,641 --> 01:30:13,260
detail,
I realized that that's,

1615
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:18,350
that is too low resolution 
interpretation and that God who is 

1616
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:22,920
dispensing a fair bit of harsh justice 
in the old testament is also someone who

1617
01:30:22,921 --> 01:30:26,670
can be negotiated with weirdly enough.
And that's what happens here.

1618
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:31,730
You know,
Abraham has just been told that 

1619
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:34,430
whatever's going on in Sodom and 
Gomorrah is seriously not good and that 

1620
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:35,490
God's going to do something about it.
And he takes it upon himself.

1621
01:30:35,491 --> 01:30:40,491
This is an act of mercy to to ask God to
be a bit more judicious,

1622
01:30:40,531 --> 01:30:41,190
right?
It's like,

1623
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:41,640
okay,
you're gonna.

1624
01:30:41,641 --> 01:30:42,710
Wipe out the city.
Well,

1625
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,260
bad things are happening there,
but you know,

1626
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:49,350
there's probably a few people in the 
damn city that aren't completely 

1627
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:49,890
corrupted by what's going on there.

1628
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,420
Of course,
that's an open question,

1629
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,220
you know,
because it's an open question.

1630
01:30:53,221 --> 01:30:58,221
For example,
how many people were there were in Nazi 

1631
01:30:58,221 --> 01:30:59,190
Germany who weren't completely corrupted
by what was going on in Nazi Germany and

1632
01:30:59,191 --> 01:31:04,191
the same thing could be said about China
and the same thing could be said about 

1633
01:31:04,191 --> 01:31:04,800
the Soviet Union.
It's like,

1634
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:06,870
well,
perhaps there was a person somewhere who

1635
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:09,180
didn't understand at some level what was
happening,

1636
01:31:09,181 --> 01:31:14,181
but you know,
the whole issue of willful blindness 

1637
01:31:14,181 --> 01:31:14,670
certainly springs to mind if nothing 
else.

1638
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:18,360
Anyways,
Abraham decides to intercede with God on

1639
01:31:18,361 --> 01:31:21,960
behalf of these people who are going to 
be destroyed.

1640
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:25,080
He says,
will also destroy the righteous with the

1641
01:31:25,081 --> 01:31:30,081
wicked.
Perhaps there'll be 50 righteous people 

1642
01:31:30,081 --> 01:31:33,771
within the city will you will also 
destroy and not spare the place for the 

1643
01:31:33,771 --> 01:31:37,131
50 righteous that are there that that'd 
be far from the to do after this manner.

1644
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:40,230
He's Kinda reminding God that he's a 
good guy as far as I can tell,

1645
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:45,440
to slay the righteous with the wicked 
and the righteous should be as the 

1646
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,460
wicked be far from the should not the 
judge of the Earth do right?

1647
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:50,430
And the Lord said,
if I find in Sodom,

1648
01:31:50,431 --> 01:31:53,010
50 right,
he seems a bit taken aback here to me.

1649
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,710
If I find in Sodom,
50 righteous within the city,

1650
01:31:55,711 --> 01:31:57,780
then I will spare the place for their 
sakes.

1651
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:59,890
And Abraham answered and said,
behold,

1652
01:31:59,891 --> 01:32:00,110
now

1653
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:02,650
I have taken upon me to speak upon the 
Lord unto the Lord,

1654
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,090
which,
but I am,

1655
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:09,180
but dust and ashes possibly there shall 
lack five of the 50 righteous will.

1656
01:32:10,611 --> 01:32:13,450
They'll destroy all the city for lack of
five.

1657
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:15,640
And he said,
he said,

1658
01:32:15,641 --> 01:32:17,800
God said,
if I find they're 45,

1659
01:32:17,801 --> 01:32:21,700
I will not destroy it.
And Abraham spoke unto him yet again and

1660
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:26,701
said,
he's kind of sneaking up on God here 

1661
01:32:26,701 --> 01:32:27,820
peradventure there shall be 40 found 
there.

1662
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:30,280
And he said,
I will not do it for 40 sake.

1663
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,830
And he said unto him,
Oh,

1664
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:37,890
let the Lord not be angry and I will 
speak possibly there shall be 30 found 

1665
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:40,870
there.
And God said,

1666
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:45,871
I won't do it if I find 30 there.
And Abraham who seems really to be 

1667
01:32:45,871 --> 01:32:48,160
pushing his luck by this point,
says,

1668
01:32:48,161 --> 01:32:53,161
behold,
I have taken upon me to speak unto the 

1669
01:32:53,161 --> 01:32:53,161
Lord,
possibly there shall be found there.

1670
01:32:53,161 --> 01:32:55,840
And God said I won't destroy it for 
[inaudible] Sake.

1671
01:32:57,350 --> 01:32:59,680
And he said,
Oh,

1672
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:02,380
let the Lord not be angry and I will 
speak yet,

1673
01:33:02,381 --> 01:33:05,650
but this once perhaps 10 shall be found 
there.

1674
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:08,290
And he said,
I will not destroy it for 10 sick.

1675
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:14,370
And the Lord went his way in.
As soon as he had left communing with 

1676
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:14,370
Abraham and Abraham returned unto his 
place.

1677
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:19,770
Well,
there's two ways you can read that part 

1678
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:20,040
of the story.
One is that three,

1679
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:23,530
let's say you can bargain with God even 
if you're kind of annoying about it.

1680
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:28,531
So that's kind of interesting.
The second is that even if there's a 

1681
01:33:29,561 --> 01:33:32,200
minority of good in a place that isn't 
good,

1682
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:35,590
it won't be slated for destruction.
That's kind of a good thing.

1683
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:41,280
And the third is a minority of good in a
place can keep it from being destroyed.

1684
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And that's a really good thing too.
And I believe that as well.

1685
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:51,310
I think that good is more powerful than 
evil naivety isn't.

1686
01:33:51,311 --> 01:33:56,311
But I think that good is.
And I think that in a place that's 

1687
01:33:56,311 --> 01:34:00,241
corrupt,
a minority of people who stand forth 

1688
01:34:00,241 --> 01:34:02,410
against the corruption can prevail.
Now,

1689
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:08,630
you know,
I think,

1690
01:34:08,631 --> 01:34:13,010
I think one of the best examples of that
again was Alexander Solzhenitsyn because

1691
01:34:13,011 --> 01:34:16,520
he was in the terrible work camps when 
he wrote his book.

1692
01:34:16,521 --> 01:34:21,521
He memorized most of it,
which is not an easy thing to do when 

1693
01:34:21,521 --> 01:34:22,040
it's 2100 pages long and set and very 
tiny font.

1694
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:27,490
And he memorized most of it.
And then he wrote it and it was one of 

1695
01:34:28,431 --> 01:34:30,140
the things that brought down the Soviet 
Union.

1696
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:32,210
You know,
it was published in the 19 seventies.

1697
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:35,930
First of all,
in we're in the west and the first thing

1698
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:41,350
that happened,
at least initially was that the 

1699
01:34:42,770 --> 01:34:47,770
communism as an ethical system last 
absolutely all credibility whatsoever 

1700
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:51,701
among anyone who is even vaguely 
educated immediately upon the 

1701
01:34:51,701 --> 01:34:55,091
publication of the Gulag archipelago.
He pulled the moral slots out from 

1702
01:34:55,091 --> 01:34:56,930
underneath it and the book was 
definitely one of the.

1703
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,020
There were many,
but

1704
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:03,020
it was definitely one of the reasons why
the rotten system crumbled and fell 

1705
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:07,930
without a war.
And that's a great example of how one 

1706
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:09,680
person can take on a tyranny and 
prevail.

1707
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:15,580
So and he's not the only person who did 
that sort of thing because what Gandhi 

1708
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:15,580
did,
the same thing.

1709
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:20,321
I mean,
I don't think the English were the 

1710
01:35:20,321 --> 01:35:21,710
Russians,
but things were not so good in India and

1711
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:27,310
what Gandhi did in India under the 
influence by the way of Leo Tolstoy was 

1712
01:35:30,211 --> 01:35:32,980
also a remarkable example of a single 
person intervening in,

1713
01:35:32,981 --> 01:35:37,981
in catastrophe and,
and setting it far more right than it 

1714
01:35:37,981 --> 01:35:37,981
could be.

1715
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:38,640
So,

1716
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:45,610
and there came two angels to Sodom at 
evening and lot.

1717
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:51,210
Remember lot is Abraham's nephew sat in 
the gate of Sodom and lot seeing them 

1718
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:55,051
rose up to meet them and he bowed 
himself with his face toward the ground 

1719
01:35:55,051 --> 01:35:56,380
and he said,
behold my lords turn in.

1720
01:35:56,381 --> 01:36:01,381
I pray you into your servant's house and
Tarry all night and wash your feet and 

1721
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:02,230
you shall rise up early and go on your 
ways.

1722
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:08,160
Oh,
he's Abraham's nephew and kinsmen and 

1723
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:08,160
acting in exactly the manner that 
Abraham does.

1724
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,960
He shows hospitality to these people and
they said,

1725
01:36:10,961 --> 01:36:11,590
no,
no,

1726
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:16,360
we'll stay in the street all night,
and he insisted.

1727
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:21,420
He pressed upon them greatly and they 
turned in unto him and entered into his 

1728
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,530
house and he made them a feast and baked
on leaving bread and they did eat,

1729
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:25,630
but before they lay down the men of the 
city,

1730
01:36:25,631 --> 01:36:27,940
even the men of Sodom Compas the house 
round,

1731
01:36:27,941 --> 01:36:32,941
both old and young,
all the people from every quarter and 

1732
01:36:32,941 --> 01:36:36,631
they called into lot and said unto him,
where are the men which came into the 

1733
01:36:36,631 --> 01:36:39,661
this night?
Bring them out to us that we may know 

1734
01:36:39,661 --> 01:36:39,661
them

1735
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,040
well.
That's

1736
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:46,120
the part of the story that's been used 
as

1737
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:48,690
diatribe,
let's say,

1738
01:36:48,691 --> 01:36:53,691
against homosexuality because to know is
to engage in sexual intercourse and the 

1739
01:36:56,850 --> 01:37:01,850
inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah were 
willing to care for strangers out of 

1740
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:06,210
lot's house and use and abuse them as 
they see fit.

1741
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,040
Right,
and so what are they doing?

1742
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:09,870
Well,
they're violating the principle,

1743
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:13,170
the principles that govern appropriate 
conduct with a stranger,

1744
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:18,620
and maybe the stranger is something you 
shouldn't mess with because you don't 

1745
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,220
know who you're messing with.
So that's like warning number one,

1746
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:25,610
while they're violent and they're 
violating the essential principles of 

1747
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:26,790
hospitality,
and then there's the sexual thing here I

1748
01:37:26,791 --> 01:37:31,791
think is isn't the sexual thing.
Here is something more like the absolute

1749
01:37:33,511 --> 01:37:38,511
danger of immediate gratification,
sexual included outside the constraints 

1750
01:37:39,151 --> 01:37:42,150
of any civilized structure whatsoever,
right?

1751
01:37:42,151 --> 01:37:45,180
Because that's as uncivilized behavior 
as you could possibly hope for,

1752
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:48,060
right?
Strangers come into your city,

1753
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:51,480
they're in the house of someone who's 
part of your city.

1754
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:55,620
They're being shown hospitality.
A mob shows up and says,

1755
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:57,510
for,
come over man,

1756
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:02,960
we're going to do whatever the hell we 
want to them and it's not going to be 

1757
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,840
good,
and if you get in the way,

1758
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,060
things are going to go even worse for 
you.

1759
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:07,680
So,

1760
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:13,990
so that's what it seems to me to be.
It's completely dysregulated behavior.

1761
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:19,260
It's behavior that's outside the,
the confines of any civilized structure 

1762
01:38:21,011 --> 01:38:22,510
whatsoever.
It's an indic.

1763
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:27,540
It's an indication that the insight into
the social structure of the entire 

1764
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:31,801
society has collapsed so that there's 
nothing left for the inhabitants to do 

1765
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:37,530
except to engage in the most brutal of 
immediate gratification and destruction.

1766
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,310
Well,
so what does he do?

1767
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:47,050
I pray the brethren do not do so.
Wickedly behold,

1768
01:38:47,051 --> 01:38:49,210
now I have two daughters which have not 
yet known.

1769
01:38:49,211 --> 01:38:50,350
Man,
let me.

1770
01:38:50,351 --> 01:38:55,351
I pray you bring them out onto you and 
you do to them is as good and your eyes 

1771
01:38:55,351 --> 01:38:59,701
only unto these men do nothing.
And therefore for therefore came they 

1772
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:02,890
the under the shadow of my roof.
Well,

1773
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:05,280
it's hard to know what to make of that.
You know?

1774
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:10,420
I mean,
it doesn't exactly seem like the 

1775
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:13,130
advisable thing for a lot to do

1776
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:14,080
and

1777
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:21,970
but I think at least what it is is an 
indication of the degree to which he 

1778
01:39:21,970 --> 01:39:26,081
took the solemn vow of hospitality 
seriously.

1779
01:39:26,661 --> 01:39:31,661
And I think that's the idea that the 
story is trying to promote.

1780
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:37,940
And the angel said,
stand back.

1781
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:39,470
Oh.
And the man said,

1782
01:39:39,471 --> 01:39:41,630
stand back.
And they said again,

1783
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:46,720
this one fellow came into sojourn to 
talk to us and he will need to be a 

1784
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:47,000
judge.
Now.

1785
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:49,010
We'll deal worse with him than with 
them.

1786
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:52,730
And they press sore upon the man even 
lot and came near to break the door.

1787
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:55,730
Maybe what lot thought was something 
like,

1788
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:56,790
well,
we're,

1789
01:39:56,791 --> 01:40:01,791
we're done.
We're all done with this mop and perhaps

1790
01:40:02,811 --> 01:40:07,811
I can spare some of us.
And they press sore upon the man even 

1791
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:13,711
loud and came near to break the door.
But the man this is the angels put forth

1792
01:40:14,051 --> 01:40:16,330
their hand and a lot into the host to 
them and shut the door.

1793
01:40:16,331 --> 01:40:18,850
And they smote the men that were at the 
door of the house with blindness,

1794
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:23,970
both small and great so that they 
wearied themselves to find the door so 

1795
01:40:24,921 --> 01:40:29,240
they were so corrupt that they were 
blind and could not see now even to find

1796
01:40:29,241 --> 01:40:34,241
the door.
And the man said unto lot has thou here 

1797
01:40:34,241 --> 01:40:35,810
any besides any family member's son in 
law,

1798
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:39,410
and they sons and my daughters and 
whoever thou hast in the city,

1799
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:43,880
get them out of the place for we will 
destroy this place because of the cry of

1800
01:40:43,881 --> 01:40:46,400
them is wax and great before the face of
the Lord.

1801
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:48,800
And the Lord has sent us to destroy it

1802
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,470
and lot went out and spake unto his sons
law.

1803
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:54,590
Yeah.

1804
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:58,350
Which married his daughters and said,
up you get out of this place,

1805
01:40:58,410 --> 01:41:03,410
for the Lord will destroy the city.
But he seemed as one that marked unto 

1806
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:07,280
his sons,
sons in law from in the morning arose 

1807
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:07,480
then the angels hastened,
blot,

1808
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:08,870
saying,
arise.

1809
01:41:08,871 --> 01:41:11,030
Take thy wife and my two daughters which
are here,

1810
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:13,760
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of
the city.

1811
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:17,770
And while he lingered,
lingered,

1812
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:23,430
the men laid hold upon his hands and 
upon the hand of his wife and upon the 

1813
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:26,641
hand of his two daughters,
the Lord Being Merciful unto him and 

1814
01:41:26,641 --> 01:41:26,770
they brought him forth and set him 
without the city.

1815
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:33,050
So he's still.
This is an indication of the danger of 

1816
01:41:33,121 --> 01:41:36,750
not acting with appropriate haste.
When the time has come,

1817
01:41:36,751 --> 01:41:41,310
I mean lots already seen what happened.
He saw that the men came to his door,

1818
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:44,070
he saw that they were murderers,
rapists.

1819
01:41:44,610 --> 01:41:49,610
He saw that the angels took them out and
he's still hesitant to leave that place.

1820
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:57,980
And so I guess one of the things that 
this story requires people to ask 

1821
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:01,821
themselves is,
are you in a place that's so bad that 

1822
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:06,470
you should leave?
Or when are you in a place that's so bad

1823
01:42:06,471 --> 01:42:11,471
that you should leave?
And if you are in a place that's so bad 

1824
01:42:11,471 --> 01:42:14,561
that you should leave,
then the time to leave is now because 

1825
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:14,780
there's no time to waste.

1826
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:19,720
And it came to pass when they had 
brought them forth abroad that he said,

1827
01:42:19,721 --> 01:42:22,420
escape for the life.
Look not behind you.

1828
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:28,500
Neither stay vow and all the plain 
escape to the mountain lest thou be 

1829
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:28,500
consumed,

1830
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:29,700
and Lord said to them,
oh,

1831
01:42:29,701 --> 01:42:34,701
not not so my Lord,
behold now they serve and have found 

1832
01:42:34,701 --> 01:42:35,910
grace in my sight and now has magnified 
thy mercy,

1833
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:38,100
which though has showed me into saving 
my life,

1834
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:42,210
but I cannot escape to the mountain,
less some evil take me and I die.

1835
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:45,930
Behold now there's a city near to flee 
unto and it's a little one,

1836
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,110
which means maybe it's not big and 
corrupt like Sodom and Gomorrah.

1837
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,960
Oh,
let me escape thither is it?

1838
01:42:50,961 --> 01:42:52,980
Is it not a little one?
And my soul shall live.

1839
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:55,120
Matthew Henry said,
lot linger.

1840
01:42:55,130 --> 01:43:00,130
He trifled thus many who are under 
convictions about their spiritual state 

1841
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:02,130
and the necessity of a changed differ 
that needful work.

1842
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,260
And he said unto him,
see,

1843
01:43:07,261 --> 01:43:09,750
I've accepted the angel,
and he said unto him,

1844
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:14,760
see,
I have accepted the concerning this 

1845
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:16,311
thing also that I will not overthrow 
this city for the which thou has spoken 

1846
01:43:16,311 --> 01:43:17,190
to small city,
hasty escape feather for.

1847
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:19,620
I cannot do anything to allow gone 
hither.

1848
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,780
Therefore,
the name of the city was Zaur.

1849
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:24,300
That's where Laura went at,
the sun was rezoned upon the earth wind,

1850
01:43:24,301 --> 01:43:29,301
lot entered into [inaudible],
then the Lord rained upon Sodom and 

1851
01:43:29,301 --> 01:43:33,500
Gomorrah,
brimstone and fire from the Lord out of 

1852
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,691
Heaven,
and he overthrew the cities and all the 

1853
01:43:35,691 --> 01:43:38,361
plane and all the inhabitants of the 
cities and that which grew up on the 

1854
01:43:38,361 --> 01:43:40,230
ground,
but his wife looked back from behind him

1855
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:45,860
and she became a pillar of salt,
known histology for catastrophe.

1856
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:55,490
I think what that means is that when you
leave what's not good,

1857
01:43:56,150 --> 01:44:00,110
you wash the dust off your feet and you 
don't look back,

1858
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:05,920
and that's a very harsh lesson.
This is accurate.

1859
01:44:07,141 --> 01:44:12,141
A bit in the New Testament,
the idea of the necessity for immediate 

1860
01:44:12,241 --> 01:44:14,040
action.
These are some of the harsher words that

1861
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:17,220
Christ said.
This is from Matthew Eight.

1862
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:22,520
Christ is addressing a multitude and 
asking people to follow him,

1863
01:44:23,431 --> 01:44:26,430
and a disciple comes up to him and says,
Lord,

1864
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:29,280
suffer me first to go and bury my 
father.

1865
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:31,440
Seems like a perfectly reasonable 
request,

1866
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,990
but Jesus said unto him,
follow me,

1867
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:36,450
and let the dead bury their dead.

1868
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:41,220
This is from Matthew 12.
Well,

1869
01:44:41,221 --> 01:44:44,430
he had talked to the people,
behold his mother and his brethren stood

1870
01:44:44,431 --> 01:44:47,220
without desiring to speak with him.
Then one said to him,

1871
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:49,170
behold,
thy mother and I,

1872
01:44:49,171 --> 01:44:54,171
brethren,
stand without desiring to speak with 

1873
01:44:54,171 --> 01:44:56,391
the.
But Jesus answered the one who was 

1874
01:44:56,391 --> 01:44:56,910
telling him and said,
who is my mother and who is my brother's

1875
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:01,880
for whosoever shall do the will of my 
father,

1876
01:45:01,881 --> 01:45:06,881
which is in heaven,
the same as my brother and sister and 

1877
01:45:06,881 --> 01:45:06,990
mother.
Well,

1878
01:45:06,991 --> 01:45:11,991
what does all that mean?
It means that there's no excuses 

1879
01:45:13,211 --> 01:45:15,910
whatsoever for not getting up and 
getting out it.

1880
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:19,600
That's what it means.
And it means that

1881
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:25,910
it even means that when people are beset
with a catastrophe,

1882
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:27,710
like let's say the death of their 
father,

1883
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:33,960
that they are prone to use that as an 
excuse for not going about the business 

1884
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,140
that they should be going about because 
they can say to themselves,

1885
01:45:36,141 --> 01:45:38,480
well,
I would except,

1886
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,330
and except there's always good reasons.
I mean,

1887
01:45:41,331 --> 01:45:46,331
believe me,
there's always good reasons for not 

1888
01:45:46,331 --> 01:45:48,011
doing what you should know.
It's for sure the reasons pile up day 

1889
01:45:48,011 --> 01:45:49,370
after day to not do what you should,
especially cause you're,

1890
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:54,500
you're aiming at things in the future.
You can put them off and definitely 

1891
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:57,230
right because of the demands of the day,
but these stories,

1892
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:59,470
they say a variety of things,
you know,

1893
01:45:59,471 --> 01:46:04,471
and especially in combination.
They say when you leave somewhere 

1894
01:46:04,471 --> 01:46:04,471
terrible,
do not look back.

1895
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:09,610
There's known astrologer that's,
that's the letting the dead parts of 

1896
01:46:10,251 --> 01:46:14,770
yourself go and then if you're going to 
follow the good,

1897
01:46:14,771 --> 01:46:19,771
there's no excuse not to do it and that 
means no excuse whatsoever under any 

1898
01:46:19,771 --> 01:46:24,451
circumstances.
And then it's taken even farther with 

1899
01:46:24,451 --> 01:46:24,451
regards to familial relationships,
it is.

1900
01:46:24,451 --> 01:46:26,230
You can't even let them stand in your 
way.

1901
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:32,900
And I think that's all true and I think 
I've seen virtually all of that in my 

1902
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:36,831
clinical practice.
Like there is no excuse whatsoever for 

1903
01:46:37,981 --> 01:46:40,830
not getting at what it is that you 
should be doing.

1904
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:44,070
And I think there's something else 
that's going on here,

1905
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:47,520
especially in the new testament stories 
which has even made maybe worse,

1906
01:46:47,521 --> 01:46:52,521
which is it's absolutely to justify your
inaction with a catastrophe that 

1907
01:46:53,701 --> 01:46:56,730
extracts mercy from other people.
Right?

1908
01:46:56,731 --> 01:46:59,190
There's a tricky,
tricky game that's going well,

1909
01:46:59,191 --> 01:47:04,191
of course I can't do that.
Look at the terrible thing that's just 

1910
01:47:04,191 --> 01:47:04,191
happened to me and say,
okay,

1911
01:47:04,191 --> 01:47:08,330
I understand you're absolved of any 
necessity to move forward because of 

1912
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:09,960
your current catastrophe.
It's like,

1913
01:47:09,961 --> 01:47:11,580
well,
actually you're not,

1914
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:16,910
and it's rather rude of you to use it as
an excuse and it's certainly 

1915
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:20,511
counterproductive.
And Abraham got up early in the morning 

1916
01:47:20,511 --> 01:47:24,981
to the place where he stood before the 
Lord and he looked toward Sodom and 

1917
01:47:24,981 --> 01:47:27,891
Gomorrah,
and toward the land of the plane and 

1918
01:47:27,891 --> 01:47:27,891
behold,
and low,

1919
01:47:27,891 --> 01:47:29,400
the smoke of the country went up as a 
smoke,

1920
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:30,180
have a furnace,

1921
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:38,680
and it came to pass.
When God destroyed the cities of the 

1922
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,971
plain that God remembered Abraham and 
sent lot out of the midst of the 

1923
01:47:40,971 --> 01:47:44,271
overthrow,
when he overthrew the cities in which 

1924
01:47:44,271 --> 01:47:45,180
lot dwelled and lot went out of 
[inaudible] and dwelt in the mountain.

1925
01:47:45,181 --> 01:47:50,181
And his two daughters with him for he 
filler feared to dwell in Zuora and he 

1926
01:47:50,181 --> 01:47:53,811
dwelt in a cave.
He and his two daughters and the 

1927
01:47:53,811 --> 01:47:54,340
firstborn said unto the younger her 
father was,

1928
01:47:55,320 --> 01:48:00,320
and there's not a man in the earth to 
come in to us after the manner of all 

1929
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:03,441
the earth.
Come let us make our father drink wine 

1930
01:48:03,441 --> 01:48:04,170
and we will lie with him that we may 
preserve the seed of our father

1931
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:10,640
and they made their father drink wine 
that night in the firstborn went in and 

1932
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:13,611
lay with her father and he perceived not
when she laid down Norwin sheet rows and

1933
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:16,590
it came to pass on the morrow that the 
firstborn said unto the younger,

1934
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:18,990
behold I lay yesterday night with my 
father.

1935
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,450
Let us make him drink wine this night 
also,

1936
01:48:21,451 --> 01:48:25,080
and gold out in and lie with him that we
may preserve seat of our father.

1937
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:28,020
And they made their father drink wine 
that night also.

1938
01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:33,290
And the younger a and lay with him.
And he perceived not when she laid down 

1939
01:48:33,290 --> 01:48:34,160
Norwin,
she arose that us,

1940
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:36,870
we're both the daughters of lot with 
child by their father.

1941
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:42,530
Well,
it's like the story,

1942
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:48,850
you know,
the stories outlined the catastrophe of 

1943
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:51,531
Sodom and Gomorrah,
essentially the ethical catastrophe of 

1944
01:48:51,531 --> 01:48:55,821
Sodom and Gomorrah,
the disillusion of the civilized 

1945
01:48:55,821 --> 01:48:59,040
constraints that should regulate all 
behavior and then the city is destroyed,

1946
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:00,750
but there's an echo of it afterwards,
right?

1947
01:49:00,751 --> 01:49:05,751
Because law,
it had lived in Sodom and Gomorrah and 

1948
01:49:05,751 --> 01:49:09,950
what happens to him even after his 
escapes is that he gets tangled into an 

1949
01:49:10,231 --> 01:49:14,600
incestuous web,
and so I think that that's a.

1950
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:20,540
it's not foreshadowing,
it's post shadowing if there's such a 

1951
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:21,330
thing.
It's an echo of of what?

1952
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:26,960
It's an echo and a reminder of how 
terrible whatever it was that was 

1953
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,900
happening in Sodom and Gomorrah was that
even after escaping,

1954
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:34,440
the inequity still remained

1955
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:43,310
well.
That's a pretty good place to stop.

1956
01:49:43,490 --> 01:49:47,980
We got through two of three stories,
so that's not too bad.

1957
01:49:47,981 --> 01:49:52,981
Next week I'll talk about the sacrifice 
of Isaac and see if I can get into the 

1958
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:56,980
next stories as well.
And next week is the last lecture,

1959
01:49:57,190 --> 01:50:02,190
except I talked to the theater people 
and it looks like I'll be able to rent 

1960
01:50:02,190 --> 01:50:05,020
the theater once a month at least for 
the next four months.

1961
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:10,530
So I'm going to do that and all 
announced when I'm going to do that and 

1962
01:50:10,530 --> 01:50:14,220
I'll continue doing this probably as 
long as you all continue to come and 

1963
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:14,220
listen.

1964
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:21,970
Thank you.

1965
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:36,390
I could tell you something cool that 
happened too if you want.

1966
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:41,960
So some of you may know that there was a
memo leaked at Google.

1967
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:49,030
How many of you know about that?
How you.

1968
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:57,140
So a colleague of the man who released 
the memo got ahold of me yesterday and 

1969
01:50:58,171 --> 01:51:02,880
said that the man who wrote the memo 
wanted to talk to me.

1970
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:07,380
So I interviewed him today.
I made a youtube video out of it.

1971
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:12,650
We went over his memo,
which was scientifically accurate in my 

1972
01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:16,701
estimation,
and so I'm going to release that 

1973
01:51:16,701 --> 01:51:16,860
hopefully tonight,
so we'll see how that goes.

1974
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:22,540
Thank you.

1975
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:27,380
He got fired last night.
A right.

1976
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,120
He got fired for perpetuating gender 
stereotypes.

1977
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:35,080
He told me today that his last 
performance review,

1978
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:40,380
he had been given superb,
which is the top few percentiles of the 

1979
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:44,150
employee distribution at Google,
right.

1980
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:48,730
Perpetuating gender stereotypes.
I went through his document.

1981
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:54,030
I don't think he said a single thing 
that wasn't substantiated by a fairly 

1982
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:58,411
dense scientific literature.
Not to say that the scientific 

1983
01:51:58,411 --> 01:52:00,340
literature is necessarily 100 percent 
correct because it never is,

1984
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:05,640
but certainly to say that he was not 
merely spouting out misogynistic and 

1985
01:52:06,881 --> 01:52:09,850
ethnically biased opinion.
Quite the contrary.

1986
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:15,270
So we had a nice discussion about that 
today and hopefully the discussion will 

1987
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:15,270
continue.
So.

1988
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:17,800
Alright,
questions.

1989
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:23,680
Hello?
Well,

1990
01:52:23,681 --> 01:52:28,681
it's great.
I mean look at a couple of things about 

1991
01:52:28,681 --> 01:52:28,681
that.
I mean,

1992
01:52:28,681 --> 01:52:32,270
my,
my daughter has had a catastrophic life 

1993
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:35,461
in many ways.
A lot of things went wrong with her 

1994
01:52:35,461 --> 01:52:37,540
physically really bad things and this 
went perfectly,

1995
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:38,950
so like,
thank God.

1996
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:44,360
Thank you.

1997
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,010
So then,
and then the other thing

1998
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,320
is I love kids now infants,
well you know,

1999
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:52,740
it's not that I,
it's not.

2000
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:58,330
Infants are cool and interesting,
but I'm not sure exactly what to do with

2001
01:52:58,491 --> 01:53:03,491
them,
but once they're about six months old 

2002
01:53:03,491 --> 01:53:06,551
and then from then on,
like I love having kids around so I'm 

2003
01:53:06,551 --> 01:53:08,090
thrilled about the fact that this has 
happened,

2004
01:53:08,091 --> 01:53:10,100
so hooray.
Hooray.

2005
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,240
So thanks for.
Yeah,

2006
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:17,910
so more as an aside,
but what you said about not pushing 

2007
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:20,310
aside of the things that day kind of 
made me think of Nike's motto.

2008
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:22,800
Just do it.
I thought cool.

2009
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:28,310
But my question was that when you were 
talking about circumcision being a 

2010
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:32,181
contractual relationship between 
sacrifice and compared it to a girl 

2011
01:53:35,491 --> 01:53:38,340
having a period.
That didn't make a lot of sense to me,

2012
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:43,400
but also it seems to me that it being a 
sacrifice requires some form of 

2013
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:54,510
willingness basically from the one 
having certain decisions that don't 

2014
01:53:54,510 --> 01:53:57,220
necessarily want to put forward what you
didn't.

2015
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:02,260
You said you specifically didn't want to
address as two infants not having any 

2016
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:06,151
choice in the matter,
but more in the context of it being a 

2017
01:54:06,151 --> 01:54:06,740
sacrifice.
How does that.

2018
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:09,110
I think,
I think that's how a modern person would

2019
01:54:09,111 --> 01:54:13,160
see it and I think that there is some,
I think there's some utility in that,

2020
01:54:13,161 --> 01:54:14,600
but,
but it's,

2021
01:54:14,601 --> 01:54:15,780
it's,
it's an incomplete,

2022
01:54:15,830 --> 01:54:17,570
incomplete to some degree,
you know,

2023
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:22,780
because one of the things that happens 
with God and Abraham is that God tells 

2024
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:23,150
Abraham that he has take care of his 
family,

2025
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:28,300
his children.
Now the question is exactly how do you 

2026
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:31,481
take care of your children?
And the answer is sometimes you make 

2027
01:54:31,481 --> 01:54:34,070
decisions for them.
Now you might say,

2028
01:54:34,071 --> 01:54:39,071
well,
it'd be better if they could make the 

2029
01:54:39,071 --> 01:54:39,071
decisions for themselves and that's 
actually the case.

2030
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:40,400
So you might say,
well,

2031
01:54:40,401 --> 01:54:45,401
I won't bring my kids to church because 
it'd be better if they could make the 

2032
01:54:45,401 --> 01:54:46,370
decision for themselves.
And that's what I did with my kids,

2033
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:51,670
you know,
but I'm not so sure that it was a good 

2034
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:51,670
idea.

2035
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:55,390
And the reason I'm not so sure it was a 
good idea was because there are a bunch 

2036
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:58,391
of things they didn't learn.
Now the degree to which your parents 

2037
01:54:58,391 --> 01:55:01,380
should exercise control over his or her 
child is indeterminant.

2038
01:55:01,850 --> 01:55:06,850
But I guess the hope is that you 
exercise the minimum amount of control 

2039
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:09,920
necessary to maximize the child's 
probability of success,

2040
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:15,070
and that certainly requires adopting 
responsibility for making decisions as 

2041
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:16,940
well because the child can't make 
decisions,

2042
01:55:17,150 --> 01:55:22,150
you know,
you can't just let the child lay there 

2043
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:22,150
and make decisions,
right?

2044
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:23,330
That's just not going to happen.
And so you might say,

2045
01:55:23,331 --> 01:55:26,600
well,
Abraham has no right to impose something

2046
01:55:26,601 --> 01:55:31,601
like circumcision on his children and 
because they an be an because it's a 

2047
01:55:31,701 --> 01:55:33,440
sacrifice,
it's something that they should be doing

2048
01:55:33,441 --> 01:55:38,441
themselves.
But the problem with that is that 

2049
01:55:38,441 --> 01:55:41,500
Abraham also has no right to abdicate 
his responsibility to his children in 

2050
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:44,430
the name of some hypothetical merciful 
illness.

2051
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:47,460
And those two things have to be 
balanced.

2052
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:48,540
Well,
this,

2053
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:51,510
according to the story,
Abraham got the balance right because of

2054
01:55:51,511 --> 01:55:56,511
course he's made this covenant with God.
Now exactly what that means in people's 

2055
01:55:56,511 --> 01:55:58,140
day to day lives.
While that's a harder issue,

2056
01:55:58,141 --> 01:55:59,370
but I would say

2057
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:05,560
I think in the modern world,
people err on the side of.

2058
01:56:06,310 --> 01:56:11,310
I don't know,
I think they're more likely to err on 

2059
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:13,510
the side of taking insufficient 
responsibility for their children,

2060
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:17,410
letting them be free in ways that aren't
productive.

2061
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:20,860
That's how it looks to me often because 
they're afraid of their children.

2062
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:25,890
So that's about the best I can do with 
that.

2063
01:56:33,370 --> 01:56:38,370
I was recently,
I've recently started reading maps of 

2064
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:42,331
meaning and I,
there was something in the introduction 

2065
01:56:42,331 --> 01:56:45,061
to that story that I found,
particularly the introduction that you 

2066
01:56:45,061 --> 01:56:45,061
wrote before you went until the,
um,

2067
01:56:45,061 --> 01:56:49,000
that I found particularly compelling,
I guess,

2068
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:54,280
uh,
the part when you're talking about the 

2069
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:54,280
split that developed in your psyche when
you were,

2070
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:55,310
you know,
all your,

2071
01:56:55,780 --> 01:56:57,520
I think you talked about one of the 
earlier lecture,

2072
01:56:57,521 --> 01:57:00,340
I talked about it a little bit today,
a little bit today as well.

2073
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:05,670
Um,
you said something in that paragraph 

2074
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:05,670
there that,
uh,

2075
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:11,010
what you said was you have to earn the 
right to identify with an idea yet 

2076
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:13,120
certain ideas for sure.
Certain ideas for sure.

2077
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:15,760
Um,
so basically my question is how should a

2078
01:57:15,761 --> 01:57:19,900
young person such as myself who doesn't 
have a whole lot of life experience,

2079
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:25,280
uh,
like be able to read literature and 

2080
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:25,280
psychology and interact with,
you know,

2081
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:30,271
the wisdom of culture and then 
incorporate it into a structure that's 

2082
01:57:30,271 --> 01:57:30,271
still authentically their own.

2083
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:32,300
Well,
look,

2084
01:57:32,301 --> 01:57:37,301
I think the way you asked that question 
means that you're actually doing a 

2085
01:57:37,301 --> 01:57:37,301
pretty good job of that.

2086
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,430
Thank you.

2087
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:41,520
Well,
I mean that,

2088
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:44,940
I mean that because that was a very 
carefully formulated question and it was

2089
01:57:44,941 --> 01:57:49,941
obvious that you were actually looking 
for an answer instead of trying to tell 

2090
01:57:49,941 --> 01:57:50,310
the audience a bunch of things that you 
knew,

2091
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,740
which often happens with questions.
Right.

2092
01:57:52,741 --> 01:57:57,741
And so it's often,
it's very annoying for the audience to 

2093
01:57:57,741 --> 01:57:58,080
be subject to questions like that,
right?

2094
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:59,160
Because it's a form of

2095
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:04,060
thank you

2096
01:58:04,140 --> 01:58:06,360
because it's a form of manipulation.
It's like,

2097
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:09,870
well all cap this off with a question,
but actually it's a speech.

2098
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:13,770
So,
so I would say you probably already know

2099
01:58:13,771 --> 01:58:18,771
the answer to that and,
but then I could elaborate on that a 

2100
01:58:18,771 --> 01:58:22,221
little bit is like there are a lot of 
books that people have historically 

2101
01:58:22,221 --> 01:58:24,720
regarded as great.
You might as well start by assuming that

2102
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:28,170
they're at least greater than you,
right?

2103
01:58:28,670 --> 01:58:33,670
And then and to approach them with that 
frame of mind because even if there's 

2104
01:58:34,891 --> 01:58:35,900
much in them that

2105
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:42,060
perhaps is no longer relevant,
often less than people assume there's 

2106
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:46,441
much in the met will be of extreme 
benefit to you and then with regards to 

2107
01:58:46,441 --> 01:58:51,121
making the mirrors,
the kind of wisdom that you get from 

2108
01:58:51,121 --> 01:58:54,841
great books is practical wisdom and you 
act it out and so then what you do is 

2109
01:58:55,481 --> 01:58:58,690
you try to incorporate what you learn 
into your life,

2110
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:01,630
into your practices,
and then if you incorporate it into your

2111
01:59:01,631 --> 01:59:06,631
life and your practices,
you build a bridge between you and the 

2112
01:59:06,631 --> 01:59:06,631
great idea,
right?

2113
01:59:06,631 --> 01:59:11,611
Because you figured out how to manifest 
itself in the conditions of your own 

2114
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:14,941
life.
That's something like making the 

2115
01:59:14,941 --> 01:59:14,941
archetipal personal,
which is,

2116
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:16,960
which is the right thing to do,
right?

2117
01:59:16,961 --> 01:59:21,961
It's the proper thing to do because that
expands your life upward and outward and

2118
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:27,000
ennobles you and brings you up as well.
But so humility is part of it.

2119
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:32,430
It's like approach these books as if 
they have something to teach you and 

2120
01:59:32,430 --> 01:59:37,141
then it's humility again in the second 
place is don't take the ideas to 

2121
01:59:38,591 --> 01:59:43,240
yourself until you lived the,
there'll be lots of time for that.

2122
01:59:43,241 --> 01:59:43,990
And besides,
you know,

2123
01:59:43,991 --> 01:59:46,990
even as a young person,
it's not like you have nothing to say,

2124
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:52,920
but the only things that you have to say
are your things to say and it's not 

2125
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,280
necessarily that easy to figure out what
they are.

2126
01:59:54,281 --> 01:59:59,281
But as I said,
you did a fine job of that when you 

2127
01:59:59,281 --> 01:59:59,281
asked the question.
So I think,

2128
01:59:59,281 --> 02:00:01,270
I think as far as I can tell,
you already know what to do.

2129
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:03,670
So good.
Do it.

2130
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:06,070
Read everything great you can get your 
damn hands on.

2131
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:14,540
Hello.
Dr Peterson.

2132
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:20,500
So a lot of your work,
a lot of your lectures recommend the 

2133
02:00:20,811 --> 02:00:25,100
audience tackle life with a lot of 
attention and intention.

2134
02:00:26,030 --> 02:00:26,960
And,
uh,

2135
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:30,770
you know,
in my kind of personal gateway,

2136
02:00:30,771 --> 02:00:34,700
drug to philosophy has been more eastern
philosophy and,

2137
02:00:34,701 --> 02:00:39,701
uh,
like the Bhagavad Gita and the work of 

2138
02:00:39,701 --> 02:00:43,541
Alan Watts and a tower [inaudible] and 
what I noticed,

2139
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:50,920
I may be wrong,
but this is a common theme in eastern 

2140
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,910
philosophy,
which is more passive non-action.

2141
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:56,570
Um,
don't make as many plans.

2142
02:00:56,690 --> 02:00:58,080
Uh,
I,

2143
02:00:58,081 --> 02:01:03,081
I,
I wonder how you reconcile that and how 

2144
02:01:03,081 --> 02:01:07,001
you are reconciling that because you 
mentioned earlier in previous lectures 

2145
02:01:07,001 --> 02:01:10,691
that you've read the teaching.
How do you reconcile those two different

2146
02:01:10,761 --> 02:01:11,300
views?

2147
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:19,720
Well,
I think first that the Dao de Jing in 

2148
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:23,051
particular reason about inaction,
it's about minimal proper action and 

2149
02:01:23,330 --> 02:01:28,330
it's also about minimal proper action 
after a tremendous amount of sacrifice.

2150
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:34,960
Right?
So the sage that speaking forth in the 

2151
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:38,860
Tao Te Ching has already let go of 
almost everything that he needs to let 

2152
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:42,821
go off.
And a tremendous amount of what you're 

2153
02:01:42,821 --> 02:01:44,360
reading in the eastern philosophies is 
predicated,

2154
02:01:44,361 --> 02:01:49,361
I think,
at least in part on the idea of 

2155
02:01:49,361 --> 02:01:51,311
sacrifice.
There's lots of things that you're 

2156
02:01:51,311 --> 02:01:53,801
grabbing onto like the monkey with the 
jar that's actually causing your misery.

2157
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:58,370
And so sometimes letting go is the right
way of moving ahead,

2158
02:01:58,371 --> 02:02:01,310
but to me that ties into this idea of 
sacrifice.

2159
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:07,030
So now whether there's more than that,
whether there's more intentionality in 

2160
02:02:07,281 --> 02:02:10,070
western philosophy and less 
intentionality in eastern philosophy,

2161
02:02:10,071 --> 02:02:15,071
I'm not exactly sure one way of 
mediating between those two was 

2162
02:02:15,950 --> 02:02:20,950
formulated at least in part by Carl 
young and he pointed out that the 

2163
02:02:21,021 --> 02:02:24,710
archetypal figure for the West died at 
32.

2164
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:30,370
And so to some degree that outgoing,
extroverted,

2165
02:02:30,741 --> 02:02:35,741
let's say nature of the West is a 
consequence of its youthfulness in some 

2166
02:02:37,551 --> 02:02:42,551
sense.
It's useful ethos and that the east 

2167
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:47,780
Buddha died at a fairly ripe old age.
And even in the Hindu practices,

2168
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:51,440
if I remember correctly,
were many Hindu temples.

2169
02:02:51,441 --> 02:02:54,380
There's a lot of erotic sculptures,
idea,

2170
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:57,620
something like if you can't get past the
dam erotic sculptures,

2171
02:02:57,621 --> 02:03:00,860
it's not time to go into the temple,
but it's more than that.

2172
02:03:00,861 --> 02:03:05,861
It might also be that if you're young,
it's not time to get past the erotic 

2173
02:03:05,861 --> 02:03:09,551
sculptures.
So maybe maybe there's a moving forward 

2174
02:03:09,551 --> 02:03:13,781
into life in youth and a letting go in,
in the latter part of life.

2175
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,520
And that's,
well,

2176
02:03:16,521 --> 02:03:20,450
that was [inaudible] way of mediating 
between those two traditions.

2177
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:24,800
I think they're tightly aligned with 
regards to the importance of sacrifice.

2178
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:29,630
It frequently is the case that it's your
desire mile,

2179
02:03:29,631 --> 02:03:34,631
let's say,
your desire that's causing your 

2180
02:03:34,631 --> 02:03:34,631
suffering.

2181
02:03:34,631 --> 02:03:36,650
Right?
And so there's an emphasis in Buddhism,

2182
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:40,310
even more than endowed with some,
I would say on letting go,

2183
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:43,220
letting go of what's making you 
miserable.

2184
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:48,940
And,
but you remember the thing about Buddha 

2185
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:49,940
is that he got enlightened under the bow
tree,

2186
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:54,941
right?
He basically stepped into the city of 

2187
02:03:54,941 --> 02:03:59,261
God.
He stepped into Nirvana and he could 

2188
02:03:59,261 --> 02:04:02,711
have stayed there,
but he chose to come back because he 

2189
02:04:02,711 --> 02:04:06,941
decided that he had a responsibility to 
rectify suffering in the rest of the 

2190
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:11,270
world.
That it was not sufficient for him to be

2191
02:04:11,450 --> 02:04:13,010
enlightened.
Well,

2192
02:04:13,011 --> 02:04:18,011
everything else was left in a state of 
insufficiency and suffering.

2193
02:04:18,530 --> 02:04:21,590
And so I wouldn't call that inaction.
You know,

2194
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:23,710
it's,
uh,

2195
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:27,650
I've,
I've made the mistake myself.

2196
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:31,580
It's inaction versus non-action.
I actually had to look up.

2197
02:04:31,581 --> 02:04:32,990
Yes,
that's good.

2198
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:38,020
That's well not to read.
The Dao de Jing does a very good job of 

2199
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:42,050
distinguishing between those two because
non-action is the minimal necessary 

2200
02:04:42,571 --> 02:04:47,571
action to keep the balance between order
and chaos proper,

2201
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:48,030
right?

2202
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:51,180
That the end in the egg and the Tao Te 
Ching is very,

2203
02:04:51,181 --> 02:04:56,181
very emphatic about this.
You detach and you watch and when it's 

2204
02:04:58,531 --> 02:05:02,880
time to intervene,
you intervene minimally without a lot of

2205
02:05:03,030 --> 02:05:08,030
arrogant self propagandized nation and 
you tap and if you do that properly,

2206
02:05:09,661 --> 02:05:12,930
you hardly have to do it at all and it 
says if you're doing nothing,

2207
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:16,800
and there's.
There's great wisdom in that book.

2208
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:18,840
I really liked the Tao Te Ching.
It's,

2209
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:24,170
it's a remarkable document and I've seen
managers who were like that who were 

2210
02:05:24,901 --> 02:05:29,901
really good at running their company who
did nothing but what they did well,

2211
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:35,570
but first of all,
they set up people to replace them 

2212
02:05:35,570 --> 02:05:36,120
because their idea was,
well,

2213
02:05:36,121 --> 02:05:38,700
if I'm a really good manager then this 
place could run without me.

2214
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:44,210
There's a real humility in that and then
they just kind of wandered around the 

2215
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:47,130
place talking to people and if there was
a bit of a problem then they just,

2216
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:52,160
you know,
turn to norb 10th of a degree and the 

2217
02:05:52,321 --> 02:05:57,321
place ran smoothly and it was as if they
were doing nothing and what they were 

2218
02:05:57,321 --> 02:06:00,771
doing was detaching so they weren't 
being buried by their current concerns.

2219
02:06:01,650 --> 02:06:06,650
They were watching to see what was going
on and then they were minimally 

2220
02:06:06,930 --> 02:06:10,350
interacting and that worked like a 
charm.

2221
02:06:10,710 --> 02:06:15,710
So I think that the,
I don't like the idea that all religious

2222
02:06:16,291 --> 02:06:19,740
traditions are the same because that 
just makes them into like a gray mass,

2223
02:06:20,070 --> 02:06:25,070
but I don't see that there's any 
difference there that can't be bridged.

2224
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:28,920
I think as you look into the details,
the bridges become more clear.

2225
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:41,830
I'll get you to speak into the 
microphone,

2226
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:44,080
especially when you're saying self 
deprecating thing.

2227
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:47,830
Let everybody hear you.
Okay.

2228
02:06:50,990 --> 02:06:54,670
It's my pleasure.
What's happened?

2229
02:06:54,730 --> 02:06:58,400
What's happened to you as a consequence?
Yeah,

2230
02:06:59,850 --> 02:07:02,410
yeah.
What are you seeing it that way anyways?

2231
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:04,030
Well mainly,
um,

2232
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:06,250
I've had,
I've had whatever you say,

2233
02:07:06,310 --> 02:07:11,310
right,
is something I've thought but not have 

2234
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:11,310
been able to,
uh,

2235
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:11,310
articulate.
Right.

2236
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:15,481
So it's been very helpful in that 
regards and kind of saves me a lot of 

2237
02:07:15,481 --> 02:07:15,481
time.
No.

2238
02:07:15,481 --> 02:07:15,580
Yup.
Good,

2239
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:16,360
good,
good,

2240
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:17,730
good.
Uh,

2241
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,390
my,
my main question is actually,

2242
02:07:19,391 --> 02:07:24,391
um,
something you said a couple of lectures 

2243
02:07:24,391 --> 02:07:25,741
ago.
It was something along the lines of a 

2244
02:07:25,741 --> 02:07:28,110
family.
I'm sorry.

2245
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:29,910
I'm like,
God,

2246
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:32,110
this,
the history of your family,

2247
02:07:32,410 --> 02:07:34,160
kind of like the sins of your family,
something like that.

2248
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:35,410
Yeah,
you are,

2249
02:07:35,650 --> 02:07:37,580
you're facing it all the time.
Yup.

2250
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:40,450
What's,
can you expand on that more?

2251
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:49,110
Well,
there's this idea in the old testament 

2252
02:07:49,110 --> 02:07:51,031
that your sins might be visited onto 
your family seven generations down.

2253
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:55,610
Seems kind of harsh,
but you know,

2254
02:07:56,230 --> 02:07:58,930
when you're confronting maybe your 
father's tyrannical.

2255
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:00,790
Yeah.
But you know,

2256
02:08:00,791 --> 02:08:05,791
maybe his father beat the hell out of 
him and maybe his father's father was a 

2257
02:08:05,791 --> 02:08:09,670
vicious alcoholic and he just bloody,
well don't know how far back that goes.

2258
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:15,000
And,
and that means also you don't exactly 

2259
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:15,000
know what you're dealing with,
right?

2260
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,600
To some degree you're dealing with your 
father,

2261
02:08:16,601 --> 02:08:20,740
but only partly what you're dealing with
is the pathological paternal spirit,

2262
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:25,950
something like that and that it's better
to think about that way because it 

2263
02:08:25,950 --> 02:08:26,230
becomes an existential issue at that 
point.

2264
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:31,740
You know,
so you could say that while the father 

2265
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:34,381
has two components,
and I mean this psychologically 

2266
02:08:34,381 --> 02:08:37,231
speaking,
there's the great father that's 

2267
02:08:37,231 --> 02:08:39,090
beneficial and protective that organize 
the society and teaches you how to speak

2268
02:08:39,191 --> 02:08:41,170
and has produced all these wonderful 
things,

2269
02:08:41,171 --> 02:08:44,740
and then there's the tyrannical 
oppressive part of the father,

2270
02:08:45,310 --> 02:08:49,000
just like there's the terrible part of 
mother nature that's destructive and the

2271
02:08:49,001 --> 02:08:54,001
benevolent part of Mother Nature that's 
wonderful and productive and you're 

2272
02:08:54,001 --> 02:08:54,460
stuck with that,
right?

2273
02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:58,510
You're stuck with having to mediate 
between those opposing forces,

2274
02:08:58,511 --> 02:09:03,511
just like you're stuck with the 
adversarial part of yourself in the 

2275
02:09:03,511 --> 02:09:04,990
heroic part of yourself and it's up to 
you to set those things right.

2276
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:09,370
Otherwise they propagate into the future
and it isn't.

2277
02:09:09,371 --> 02:09:11,770
It's a straightforward thing to say how 
to set them.

2278
02:09:11,771 --> 02:09:14,380
Right.
There's quite a good movie about that.

2279
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,150
Oh No,
I won't be Magnolia,

2280
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:21,630
which I really love.
It's by Paul Anderson,

2281
02:09:21,631 --> 02:09:23,700
if I remember correctly.
I hope that's right.

2282
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:27,090
A beautiful movie,
and it's about this part of.

2283
02:09:27,091 --> 02:09:31,080
It's about this kid whose fathers really
pushing them to be a superstar at a,

2284
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:32,640
at a Quistio,
right?

2285
02:09:32,641 --> 02:09:33,750
He's a genius kid.
Hey,

2286
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:34,990
and

2287
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:39,070
the kids studies this guy named Charles 
Sport.

2288
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:44,130
You don't understand this movie if you 
don't know this because you've got to 

2289
02:09:44,130 --> 02:09:44,130
know about Charles fort to understand 
magnolia.

2290
02:09:44,130 --> 02:09:48,570
Charles for was this weird old guy who 
got rich with an inheritance when he was

2291
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:53,760
20 and spent the rest of his life in 
libraries looking up impossible things 

2292
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:57,721
and documenting them.
Impossible things that couldn't happen 

2293
02:09:57,721 --> 02:10:01,261
from a scientific perspective that we're
well attested to by multiple observers 

2294
02:10:01,261 --> 02:10:03,550
and he produced this news paper called 
the 14 times,

2295
02:10:03,551 --> 02:10:08,551
which still runs anyways in Magnolia.
Magnolia begins with this guy who falls 

2296
02:10:09,521 --> 02:10:14,521
out of a building and then it's shot by 
a woman who misses her husband with a 

2297
02:10:14,521 --> 02:10:15,370
rifle as he falls,
and I think she's.

2298
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:21,000
She's charged with murder and the street
names have something to do with the 

2299
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
death sentence fall and all of that 
happened,

2300
02:10:22,001 --> 02:10:27,001
and then in the movie there's a rain of 
frogs and there are rains of frogs from 

2301
02:10:27,641 --> 02:10:28,120
time to time.

2302
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:30,610
Sometimes they're frozen,
sometimes their reins of fish.

2303
02:10:30,611 --> 02:10:31,900
Sometimes they're frozen.
It's like,

2304
02:10:31,901 --> 02:10:33,530
what the hell?
How does that happen?

2305
02:10:33,730 --> 02:10:35,510
Happens quite frequently.
As it turns out,

2306
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:40,750
there's a rain of frogs in the,
in the movie magnolia and this little 

2307
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:45,611
kid see what happened to him is that 
he's on stage and he ends up peeing his 

2308
02:10:46,551 --> 02:10:51,551
pants because of the pressure basically 
and humiliates himself and then there's 

2309
02:10:52,191 --> 02:10:57,191
this reign of frogs,
which he kind of takes us a sign from 

2310
02:10:57,191 --> 02:10:59,090
God and then he goes to his father even 
he's like eight years old,

2311
02:10:59,091 --> 02:11:00,020
this kid,
and he says,

2312
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:04,430
you have to stop doing this to me.
And He's dead serious about it.

2313
02:11:04,431 --> 02:11:06,740
Very careful not being,
you know,

2314
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:09,290
what would you call insubordinate?
Nothing like that.

2315
02:11:09,890 --> 02:11:14,890
He decides that that's coming to an end 
right now and you have to make those 

2316
02:11:14,890 --> 02:11:19,751
decisions in your family because 
otherwise things propagate down the 

2317
02:11:19,751 --> 02:11:19,751
generations,
right,

2318
02:11:19,751 --> 02:11:23,621
and every family is rife with 
pathologies of one form or another and 

2319
02:11:23,621 --> 02:11:28,030
you can learn from that and refuse to 
push it forward and that's part of I 

2320
02:11:28,401 --> 02:11:30,440
think what you do when you,
when you,

2321
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:36,900
when you shoulder your existential 
burden because everyone is the 

2322
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:39,160
beneficiary and the victim of the 
tyrannical father,

2323
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:44,700
just like everyone is the beneficiary 
and the victim of mother nature and of 

2324
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:48,061
themselves and so you lock horns without
and straighten it out one way or another

2325
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:50,890
and you don't move it forward to the 
next generation.

2326
02:11:51,730 --> 02:11:55,990
So and maybe you detach it a bit from 
your parents too because

2327
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:02,440
God only knows what combination of 
catastrophes culminated in their 

2328
02:12:02,690 --> 02:12:07,690
particular forms of pathology.
So good enough.

2329
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:23,030
So this week we've had the google thing,
there was the youtube thing that 

2330
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:26,910
happened last week.
What's going on with censorship and what

2331
02:12:26,911 --> 02:12:27,810
should people do about it?

2332
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:31,220
If you're in a workplace in 
pathological,

2333
02:12:31,221 --> 02:12:33,110
things are happening.
This is easy.

2334
02:12:33,111 --> 02:12:38,111
I can tell you how you know of 
pathological things are happening at 

2335
02:12:38,111 --> 02:12:39,680
your workplace or they're happening with
you one of the two,

2336
02:12:39,681 --> 02:12:44,681
but you can straighten that out if 
you're being required to do things that 

2337
02:12:46,301 --> 02:12:51,040
make you weak and ashamed,
then stop.

2338
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:57,200
Don't do them.
Like one of the things I learned from 

2339
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:00,750
Solzhenitsyn and Frankl was that

2340
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:06,920
systems go terribly under,
out of control when people don't stop 

2341
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:11,241
them,
when they're going mildly out of 

2342
02:13:11,241 --> 02:13:11,241
control.
You know when you might say,

2343
02:13:11,241 --> 02:13:13,470
I should just keep my goddamn head down 
and shut up.

2344
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:15,990
It's like maybe you should like,
that's not bad advice.

2345
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:21,700
You know you don't want to make 
unnecessary enemies and you don't need 

2346
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:25,041
any more trouble than you need,
but you got to ask yourself on a day to 

2347
02:13:25,041 --> 02:13:26,700
day basis what makes you think you're 
not selling your soul.

2348
02:13:27,810 --> 02:13:31,230
You know,
and there's so much foolishness going on

2349
02:13:31,231 --> 02:13:35,460
in the mid level bureaucratic world now.
That's where all the tyranny seems to be

2350
02:13:35,461 --> 02:13:40,461
focused and the reason that it 
multiplies is because sensible people 

2351
02:13:40,711 --> 02:13:44,220
say nothing when they should say 
something.

2352
02:13:44,221 --> 02:13:49,221
And what's so strange about that is that
there are way more sensible people than 

2353
02:13:49,410 --> 02:13:52,170
people who aren't sensible.
They're just not as noisy.

2354
02:13:52,650 --> 02:13:54,760
So what you'll turn out if like,
you know,

2355
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,690
so let's say something's bugging the 
hell out of you at work.

2356
02:13:57,930 --> 02:14:00,420
Well then you have to prepare it to find
another job.

2357
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:05,450
That's the first thing you have to do.
I don't think that you should find 

2358
02:14:05,450 --> 02:14:09,201
another job,
but you should prepare to find another 

2359
02:14:09,201 --> 02:14:12,231
job.
And if possible you should prepare to 

2360
02:14:12,231 --> 02:14:14,661
find a better job.
Because if you can't tell someone to go 

2361
02:14:14,661 --> 02:14:14,910
to hale,
then you can't negotiate with them.

2362
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:17,580
And if and if they've got you over a 
barrel,

2363
02:14:17,581 --> 02:14:19,740
then you can't say anything.
So you gotTa,

2364
02:14:19,890 --> 02:14:22,530
you gotta set yourself up.
So you've got some mobility and actually

2365
02:14:22,531 --> 02:14:24,180
that's a really good principal in your 
life,

2366
02:14:24,181 --> 02:14:29,181
period.
You should set yourself up so that you 

2367
02:14:29,181 --> 02:14:30,810
have a lateral move at hand and then you
should find out,

2368
02:14:30,811 --> 02:14:35,811
well,
are there things at work that are 

2369
02:14:35,811 --> 02:14:35,811
disturbing my soul?

2370
02:14:35,811 --> 02:14:35,970
You know,
and you find that out.

2371
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:37,230
First of all,
you ask yourself,

2372
02:14:37,231 --> 02:14:38,280
okay,
I'm disturbed at work.

2373
02:14:38,281 --> 02:14:43,281
Okay,
I'm probably week and deceitful and 

2374
02:14:43,281 --> 02:14:45,981
useless and lazy.
You might as well start with that and 

2375
02:14:45,981 --> 02:14:46,770
then you talk to some people,
like your wife,

2376
02:14:46,771 --> 02:14:48,300
your friends,
your coworkers,

2377
02:14:48,301 --> 02:14:51,450
and find out are you stupid,
deceitful and lazy,

2378
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:53,970
or is there something not so good going 
on at work?

2379
02:14:53,971 --> 02:14:58,971
And so if you,
if you can then eliminate your own 

2380
02:14:58,971 --> 02:14:59,700
personal pathology as a cause of your 
dissatisfaction,

2381
02:15:00,090 --> 02:15:05,090
then maybe there's something rotten in 
the state of Denmark and maybe you 

2382
02:15:05,090 --> 02:15:08,961
should say something about it before the
whole goddamn thing collapses because 

2383
02:15:08,961 --> 02:15:13,010
that can happen.
It can happen in companies a lot faster 

2384
02:15:13,010 --> 02:15:13,950
than people ever think you know,
and you may find that,

2385
02:15:14,070 --> 02:15:14,700
well,
first of all,

2386
02:15:14,701 --> 02:15:16,740
you may find if you say something,
well first of all,

2387
02:15:16,741 --> 02:15:17,580
that's an adventure.

2388
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:22,580
That's for sure.
That's a bloody adventure and you have 

2389
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:23,130
to do it carefully and,
and you have to be prepared for it,

2390
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:25,080
but it might be the best thing that ever
happened to you.

2391
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:27,660
And the other thing is if you're careful
about it,

2392
02:15:27,661 --> 02:15:29,560
you get your words right.
Like in,

2393
02:15:29,561 --> 02:15:31,950
this is a,
this is strategic battle,

2394
02:15:31,951 --> 02:15:36,951
right?
It's not something you wander into 

2395
02:15:36,951 --> 02:15:38,301
carelessly.
Then you may find that there's lots of 

2396
02:15:38,301 --> 02:15:41,061
people who feel exactly the same way you
do and that you've actually caught and 

2397
02:15:41,061 --> 02:15:44,331
onto something.
You're a canary in a coal mine and not 

2398
02:15:44,331 --> 02:15:47,091
just some psychopathic mouthpiece,
so you got to ask yourself,

2399
02:15:47,671 --> 02:15:50,340
when you go and do what you do like,
is this making you stronger?

2400
02:15:50,341 --> 02:15:53,100
Is this making you weaker?
And if it's making you weaker,

2401
02:15:53,370 --> 02:15:56,310
then you gotta ask yourself,
do you really want to be weaker?

2402
02:15:56,640 --> 02:16:01,640
Because the weaker you get,
the more your tyrannized and then worse 

2403
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:01,640
than that,
like the weaker you get,

2404
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:04,860
the more bitter you get and the more 
you'll work towards terrible things.

2405
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:07,620
The more you'll snap it your wife,
the more you'll kick your kids.

2406
02:16:07,621 --> 02:16:12,621
You know,
like it's no joke to be tyrannized at 

2407
02:16:12,621 --> 02:16:15,411
work.
And so I would say you have an ethical 

2408
02:16:15,411 --> 02:16:18,471
responsibility as a citizen to 
forthrightly confront,

2409
02:16:18,930 --> 02:16:22,200
creeping tyranny,
no matter where it occurs.

2410
02:16:22,530 --> 02:16:25,320
And part of,
part of what we're learning,

2411
02:16:25,321 --> 02:16:28,380
I would say from these stories,
if we're learning anything at all,

2412
02:16:28,381 --> 02:16:33,381
is that if you're aimed at the good,
which is a question you really got to 

2413
02:16:33,641 --> 02:16:34,720
ask yourself,
you know,

2414
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:40,140
if you're genuinely aimed at the good,
then take heart because you're a lot 

2415
02:16:40,140 --> 02:16:42,430
stronger than you think.
So

2416
02:16:43,850 --> 02:16:45,790
I have a followup question,
Kate.

2417
02:16:46,010 --> 02:16:51,010
So I'm speaking to.
There's lots of people who were in this 

2418
02:16:51,010 --> 02:16:51,010
situation like,
you know,

2419
02:16:51,010 --> 02:16:53,180
people at universities and corporations 
all over the place.

2420
02:16:53,190 --> 02:16:58,190
I know Google is not the only company 
that is not the worst repressive freedom

2421
02:17:01,101 --> 02:17:05,600
of speech denying workplace codes and 
everybody feels alone,

2422
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:08,490
right?
They're all like,

2423
02:17:08,730 --> 02:17:11,370
why should I stand up,
be a martyr,

2424
02:17:11,580 --> 02:17:13,590
get fired.
This guy at Google got fired.

2425
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:15,600
Yeah.
What's the point?

2426
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:19,970
I'm asking rhetorically.
No,

2427
02:17:20,770 --> 02:17:22,560
it's a good question.
And how do you.

2428
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:28,040
How do you convince people that there's 
a point to standing up when it appears 

2429
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:28,290
to be futile?

2430
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:35,280
Well,
the first thing I think is you convince 

2431
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:35,620
them that it's not futile.
It might be difficult,

2432
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,540
but it's not futile if you get your 
words right,

2433
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:44,200
you have something to say.
There'll be an impact of those words.

2434
02:17:44,550 --> 02:17:46,600
It might not be the impact that you 
would choose,

2435
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:51,800
but the.
But the other thing you've got to tell 

2436
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:52,660
people is pick your poison.
You don't.

2437
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:55,790
You may be in a situation where you 
don't have a.

2438
02:17:56,650 --> 02:17:59,170
You don't have a cake.
Walk to the garden of Paradise.

2439
02:17:59,260 --> 02:18:02,470
You got tyranny or famine.
Those are your choices,

2440
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:06,010
but you get to pick which one you have,
and I would say if,

2441
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:11,520
if you're being oppressed and I mean in 
your soul by what you're required to 

2442
02:18:12,041 --> 02:18:15,790
swallow at work,
well you think you're not paying a price

2443
02:18:15,791 --> 02:18:19,130
for that.
You've got no self respect and,

2444
02:18:19,131 --> 02:18:19,630
and,
and,

2445
02:18:19,650 --> 02:18:22,120
and rightly so,
but worse than that,

2446
02:18:22,630 --> 02:18:24,940
you're an agent of your own destruction.

2447
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:30,450
You're destroying your own ideal and 
you're letting people who are weak and 

2448
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:34,501
corrupt when and if you stood up and 
stood up properly,

2449
02:18:35,861 --> 02:18:37,780
but you have to put yourself in order to
do this,

2450
02:18:37,781 --> 02:18:38,980
at least to some degree,
right?

2451
02:18:38,981 --> 02:18:43,981
You can't do it casually.
You have to do it from some position of 

2452
02:18:43,981 --> 02:18:48,150
preparedness and strength.
Then what makes you think you couldn't 

2453
02:18:48,150 --> 02:18:51,370
scare them back into the corners and 
that would be a good thing.

2454
02:18:52,180 --> 02:18:57,180
And you know,
the alternative personally is bad 

2455
02:18:57,180 --> 02:18:58,840
because there's a psychological 
degeneration that goes along with it.

2456
02:18:58,841 --> 02:19:01,390
I've seen this with many,
many of the people that I've worked with

2457
02:19:01,690 --> 02:19:06,690
who have been tyrannized in the 
workplace to the absolute detriment of 

2458
02:19:06,690 --> 02:19:07,990
their psychological and physical health,
right?

2459
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:12,370
To the point of collapse confronting 
these crazy,

2460
02:19:12,371 --> 02:19:14,500
crazy things when they were sensible 
people.

2461
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:17,620
Um,
that's a terrible price to pay man.

2462
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:19,870
Like it's,
it's a bad price.

2463
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:24,960
And then if the foolishness isn't dealt 
with at the local level when it's still 

2464
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:32,080
relatively trivial,
then it will multiply until it's dealt 

2465
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:33,770
with at the social level.
And we're seeing signs of that already.

2466
02:19:33,870 --> 02:19:36,700
ANTIFA is a good sign of that,
you know,

2467
02:19:36,701 --> 02:19:41,701
and problems that aren't solved multiply
and soon people fight and you know,

2468
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:43,190
edit,
argue,

2469
02:19:43,191 --> 02:19:46,280
then to fight,
unless you want to fight.

2470
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:49,820
And some people want to fight and I can 
understand why,

2471
02:19:49,821 --> 02:19:51,410
but I wouldn't recommend it because

2472
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,750
that doesn't lead good places.
It really doesn't lead good places.

2473
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:02,550
So I would say you have a duty.
Maybe that's,

2474
02:20:02,610 --> 02:20:07,610
that's where you stand up.
It's because you have a goddamn duty to 

2475
02:20:07,610 --> 02:20:10,210
stand up and say,
just say what you have to say it.

2476
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:12,570
You don't even have to be trying to make
a point.

2477
02:20:12,571 --> 02:20:14,160
Exactly.
You're trying to get something done.

2478
02:20:14,161 --> 02:20:16,740
It's like,
this is how it looks to me.

2479
02:20:16,741 --> 02:20:18,600
That's what that guy had.
Google did.

2480
02:20:18,900 --> 02:20:21,390
He wrote this memo and he said he.
I talked to him today.

2481
02:20:21,391 --> 02:20:21,930
He said,
well,

2482
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:25,080
he went to a diversity training seminar.
And he thought,

2483
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:28,050
no,
I don't agree with that.

2484
02:20:28,290 --> 02:20:32,460
And so then they asked for feedback.
So we wrote this document a month ago.

2485
02:20:32,461 --> 02:20:35,700
This was written a month ago.
Got No real response to it.

2486
02:20:36,030 --> 02:20:41,030
Well,
it bounced around inside Google until a 

2487
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:42,420
lot of people got interested in that.
It escaped into the outside world.

2488
02:20:43,170 --> 02:20:48,170
But all he was doing was,
he was told a bunch of things he didn't 

2489
02:20:48,170 --> 02:20:52,581
think were true.
He wrote down a bunch of things he 

2490
02:20:52,581 --> 02:20:53,040
thought were probably true.
He launched it out and said,

2491
02:20:53,041 --> 02:20:55,470
well,
I think these things are probably true.

2492
02:20:55,530 --> 02:20:56,340
It's like,
well,

2493
02:20:58,190 --> 02:21:01,430
probably their true well,
so he paid a price for it,

2494
02:21:01,431 --> 02:21:03,470
but maybe we'll see what sort of price 
he paid for it.

2495
02:21:03,471 --> 02:21:08,471
Man,
it's going to be a lot tougher in two 

2496
02:21:08,471 --> 02:21:10,091
years than he was two years ago.
So new.

2497
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:13,910
No one.
They didn't answer his feedback.

2498
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:15,770
No,
no,

2499
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:19,370
but you can watch the video,
the stories there.

2500
02:21:19,371 --> 02:21:21,020
But that's kind of the outline of it.

2501
02:21:21,810 --> 02:21:24,960
So sorry to monopolize this.
I have one other question about this and

2502
02:21:24,961 --> 02:21:29,961
I think it's important,
aside from Google just being a 

2503
02:21:29,961 --> 02:21:30,120
workplace,
right?

2504
02:21:30,121 --> 02:21:32,760
It also controls the own youtube,
right?

2505
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:38,200
Which is post a new censorship scheme 
and it controls a huge amount of the 

2506
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:46,580
information that people get and so true 
and so what happens to society when 

2507
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:54,880
companies such as Google,
which control our information start to 

2508
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:59,240
censor not just how about the selves and
maybe the information that's coming out 

2509
02:21:59,251 --> 02:22:04,251
to the rest of the world.
How much is this already happening and 

2510
02:22:04,251 --> 02:22:04,251
how much.

2511
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:07,200
What happens?
If we refuse to find out,

2512
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:09,580
that would be good.
You know,

2513
02:22:09,581 --> 02:22:11,760
like I reviewed this,
this guy's document,

2514
02:22:11,761 --> 02:22:16,761
I did that yesterday and everything he 
said was validated by the scientific 

2515
02:22:17,281 --> 02:22:20,520
literature.
So what has happened is that someone has

2516
02:22:20,521 --> 02:22:24,730
been fired publicly by major corporation
for stating well,

2517
02:22:25,470 --> 02:22:30,470
scientific truths right there.
Exactly the sorts of things that I say 

2518
02:22:30,470 --> 02:22:35,031
in my classes for example,
and the reason that I say to them is 

2519
02:22:35,031 --> 02:22:37,491
because I read the literature,
it's not because I'm personally happy 

2520
02:22:37,491 --> 02:22:40,881
about the facts.
I think Iq research particularly is so 

2521
02:22:40,881 --> 02:22:44,841
dismal that you can't possibly read it 
without being seriously disheartened if 

2522
02:22:44,841 --> 02:22:46,950
I could reconstruct the world.
So that ICU,

2523
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:50,490
the ICU research wasn't true.
Well,

2524
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,740
it sure be tempting,
you know,

2525
02:22:53,370 --> 02:22:57,270
but that's not how science works.
Science doesn't tell you what you,

2526
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:00,210
what you want to hear,
it just tells you the way it bloody well

2527
02:23:00,211 --> 02:23:03,660
is.
And he got pilloried for.

2528
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:08,750
He got pilloried for revealing a good 
fraction of current scientific knowledge

2529
02:23:11,191 --> 02:23:12,960
about gender differences.
Okay.

2530
02:23:13,230 --> 02:23:16,890
That's not good.
And as you said,

2531
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:19,230
that's a big company and it controls our
communication.

2532
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:24,440
It's how about we do what we can to 
ensure that these large communication 

2533
02:23:26,441 --> 02:23:29,290
companies don't get to impose

2534
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:30,190
a

2535
02:23:31,950 --> 02:23:36,950
factually false ideological structure on
the rest of the planet.

2536
02:23:37,710 --> 02:23:41,220
Or you can think about supporting this.
This guy who blew the whistle,

2537
02:23:41,221 --> 02:23:44,400
there's a fundraiser for him online.
He could use some money.

2538
02:23:44,490 --> 02:23:46,800
He wants to sue google.

2539
02:23:47,870 --> 02:23:52,870
Yeah,
maybe we could.

2540
02:23:54,550 --> 02:23:59,550
Maybe we could let them know that hiring
a human resources director who's also 

2541
02:24:00,131 --> 02:24:04,390
concerned with equity is probably not a 
good idea for capitalist company.

2542
02:24:04,870 --> 02:24:07,570
Why in the world would you hire your own
enemies?

2543
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:12,850
I don't understand that so well,
we'll see how the dialogue continues,

2544
02:24:12,851 --> 02:24:15,430
but back to the personal like

2545
02:24:16,630 --> 02:24:21,460
you need to say what you think because 
that's where you come from.

2546
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:24,220
Right?
And if you don't say what you think,

2547
02:24:24,221 --> 02:24:27,460
then you kill your unborn self.
That's what you do.

2548
02:24:27,461 --> 02:24:32,461
That's what Cain did when he killed Abel
and that's why his punishment was 

2549
02:24:32,461 --> 02:24:33,760
unbearable.
You know you have things in you that are

2550
02:24:33,761 --> 02:24:36,100
struggling to come to the light.
That's the truth.

2551
02:24:36,101 --> 02:24:39,310
You need data and you need to either 
that truth because without that truth,

2552
02:24:39,311 --> 02:24:43,450
who cannot live in the world because the
world is real and you need truth to live

2553
02:24:43,451 --> 02:24:45,820
in the world,
and if you stifle your truth,

2554
02:24:45,821 --> 02:24:47,140
well,
how,

2555
02:24:47,290 --> 02:24:50,350
how can that be anything but something 
that brings about hell,

2556
02:24:50,470 --> 02:24:53,170
how could it be any other way?
So you think,

2557
02:24:53,171 --> 02:24:54,430
well,
why should you speak up?

2558
02:24:54,431 --> 02:24:57,220
That's easy because the consequences of 
not speaking up,

2559
02:24:57,580 --> 02:25:01,150
although delayed are far worse.
That's the reason.

2560
02:25:01,390 --> 02:25:04,090
That's the reason.
If it can't be courage,

2561
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:07,060
it could at least be prudent.
So.

2562
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:07,840
Yep.

2563
02:25:15,610 --> 02:25:16,300
One more,

2564
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:17,820
uh,
Dr Peterson.

2565
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:20,790
First of all,
Kudos for mentioning Magnolias one of my

2566
02:25:20,791 --> 02:25:22,200
favorite movie.
It's a great movie,

2567
02:25:22,201 --> 02:25:24,400
man.
So

2568
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:28,630
a few months ago I had a dream and when 
I told someone this dream,

2569
02:25:28,631 --> 02:25:31,120
they suggested that I read the book of 
revelations.

2570
02:25:31,180 --> 02:25:32,590
Oh yeah,
that's a bad dream that,

2571
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:36,090
um,

2572
02:25:36,990 --> 02:25:41,990
the,
there's a lot of interesting stuff in 

2573
02:25:41,990 --> 02:25:41,990
that book.
The thing that really,

2574
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:48,590
that I found really interesting right 
off the bat was the state is 

2575
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:52,720
represented,
uh,

2576
02:25:52,770 --> 02:25:56,490
in two instances as female,
positively and negatively.

2577
02:25:56,491 --> 02:26:01,491
And I was wondering if you had any 
thoughts on that in the context of like 

2578
02:26:01,491 --> 02:26:04,320
in maps of meaning,
you often talk about the state just as a

2579
02:26:04,470 --> 02:26:06,360
as male or as masculine.

2580
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:09,370
Okay.
First of all,

2581
02:26:09,371 --> 02:26:14,371
I'm going to comment on your tee shirt.
That's a lobster hierarchy with horace 

2582
02:26:14,371 --> 02:26:14,371
at the top,
isn't it?

2583
02:26:14,450 --> 02:26:15,240
It's even better.
Yeah,

2584
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:16,900
it's the.
I have a lobster.

2585
02:26:20,650 --> 02:26:23,830
The best one that we found.
That's a good one.

2586
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:29,750
Well,
now in really cracked me up when I saw 

2587
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,750
it.
I really thought that was funny,

2588
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,750
man.
Yeah,

2589
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,970
yeah,
yeah.

2590
02:26:31,010 --> 02:26:32,760
I'm on.
My graduate students used to meet,

2591
02:26:32,761 --> 02:26:35,280
when I first talked about this lobster 
stuff,

2592
02:26:35,550 --> 02:26:38,040
we'd meet for breakfast and they were 
very combative,

2593
02:26:38,041 --> 02:26:43,041
snappy group of graduate students and 
they're always trying to one up each 

2594
02:26:43,041 --> 02:26:45,450
other with jokes and whenever one really
pulled a good joke on another,

2595
02:26:45,451 --> 02:26:50,451
they'd stand up and it was really.
It was really funny.

2596
02:26:52,681 --> 02:26:54,360
It was really funny.
Okay.

2597
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:57,390
Let's see.
Can I answer that question?

2598
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:06,660
You know how if you're looking at a.
If you look at a room,

2599
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:11,640
every color that you see is dependent on
every other color in the room,

2600
02:27:11,670 --> 02:27:13,050
right?
Your eyes adjust to that.

2601
02:27:13,051 --> 02:27:18,051
So for example,
if you're in a room based with red 

2602
02:27:18,051 --> 02:27:20,241
light,
your eyes will in some sense remove the 

2603
02:27:20,241 --> 02:27:21,450
red so you can still see the colors.
Okay,

2604
02:27:22,110 --> 02:27:27,110
so your perception is to some degree on 
call is to some degree dependent on con 

2605
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:33,380
context and that's one of the things 
that makes the symbolic symbolic 

2606
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:37,520
interpretations tricky because to see 
how something is represented 

2607
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:40,140
symbolically,
you actually have to look at the broader

2608
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:43,980
narrative context within which the 
symbols are embedded.

2609
02:27:44,220 --> 02:27:48,630
So for example,
let me see if I can get this right.

2610
02:27:53,190 --> 02:27:55,650
If the.
If the story has an island in an ocean,

2611
02:27:56,640 --> 02:28:01,640
then the ocean is often symbolically 
feminine and the island is symbolically 

2612
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:01,790
masculine.
But if the stories,

2613
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:06,800
the island and the sky,
then the island often become 

2614
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:10,161
symbolically masculine and feminine and 
the Sky Symbolically Masculine and you 

2615
02:28:10,161 --> 02:28:10,161
might think,
well,

2616
02:28:10,161 --> 02:28:13,080
how can the Ireland be masculine and 
feminine at the same time?

2617
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:14,430
And the answer is,
well,

2618
02:28:14,431 --> 02:28:18,120
it depends on what,
what is being contrasted with and why,

2619
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:23,840
and so that's part of the key to the 
change in symbolism in the book of 

2620
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:26,450
revelation.
And so it isn't inevitably the case that

2621
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:30,710
culture is represented with the 
patriarchal symbolism,

2622
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:34,220
but it's most commonly the case.
So you know,

2623
02:28:34,221 --> 02:28:36,140
there is mother,
Russia for example.

2624
02:28:36,350 --> 02:28:41,350
I guess it would depend to some degree 
too on what your metaphor is for the 

2625
02:28:41,350 --> 02:28:44,981
state because the state can be an all 
providing mother or it can be judgmental

2626
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:51,910
father and it,
it seems that we tilt more towards the 

2627
02:28:51,910 --> 02:28:55,550
father with regards to terminology 
relating to the state.

2628
02:28:55,550 --> 02:29:00,550
And I think the reason for that is 
because I think human hierarchies like 

2629
02:29:01,250 --> 02:29:04,550
chimp hierarchies are fundamentally 
masculine.

2630
02:29:04,970 --> 02:29:06,800
The fundamental hierarchies,
masculine.

2631
02:29:07,010 --> 02:29:09,020
Even with chimps,
there's a female hierarchy,

2632
02:29:09,021 --> 02:29:13,880
but it's like the female hierarchy is 
nested within the male hierarchy.

2633
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:18,940
It's not the case with bonobos exactly.
But I think it is the case with human 

2634
02:29:18,940 --> 02:29:22,601
beings.
And so I think we have a strong 

2635
02:29:22,601 --> 02:29:24,581
proclivity to masculinize the state,
but that doesn't mean there aren't 

2636
02:29:24,581 --> 02:29:25,960
exceptions.
That and symbol,

2637
02:29:26,030 --> 02:29:31,030
symbolic representations are very 
slippery that way because you can't 

2638
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:35,290
stamp an entity with assemble because 
that would be the same as just giving it

2639
02:29:35,661 --> 02:29:37,160
a name.
Right,

2640
02:29:37,580 --> 02:29:40,580
and you can't have a dictionary of 
symbols where you say,

2641
02:29:40,581 --> 02:29:41,540
well,
you know,

2642
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:43,850
a house always means the psyche.
It's like,

2643
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:46,160
no.
Sometimes the house means the psyche,

2644
02:29:46,310 --> 02:29:51,310
but it depends on the story and so you 
have to take the entire structure of the

2645
02:29:52,581 --> 02:29:57,581
narrative into account to determine why 
those particular symbolic 

2646
02:29:57,581 --> 02:29:58,310
representations are being used.

2647
02:29:59,150 --> 02:30:01,670
When I offered in maps of meaning was 
kind of a shorthand,

2648
02:30:01,850 --> 02:30:03,800
you know,
generally speaking,

2649
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:06,860
there's nature positive and negative.
Usually feminine.

2650
02:30:07,070 --> 02:30:09,650
Generally speaking,
there's culture positive and negative.

2651
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:12,350
Usually masculine and generally 
speaking,

2652
02:30:12,351 --> 02:30:15,170
there's the individual good and evil,
right?

2653
02:30:15,171 --> 02:30:19,190
Heroic can adversarial often typically 
represented as masculine,

2654
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:24,220
especially in adventure stories,
but it's a ski mountain and it's an 

2655
02:30:24,651 --> 02:30:29,651
interpretive guide and not a set of hard
and fast rules because you're in the 

2656
02:30:29,651 --> 02:30:31,640
domain of metaphor and it's a.
it's a slippery domain.

2657
02:30:32,330 --> 02:30:34,760
So do you have any luck figuring out 
your dream?

2658
02:30:36,670 --> 02:30:41,670
Sorry,
did you have any luck figuring out your 

2659
02:30:41,670 --> 02:30:43,571
dream?
At least in some parts.

2660
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:47,420
I think there's different levels of 
analysis.

2661
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:51,230
I mean one was pretty obvious.
Yeah.

2662
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:52,960
Alright.
Alright.

2663
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:53,870
Well thank you very much.
