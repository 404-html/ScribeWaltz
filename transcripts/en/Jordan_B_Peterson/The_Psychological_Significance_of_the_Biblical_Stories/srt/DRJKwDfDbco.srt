1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,520
Alright,
so the last time I was here,

2
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,180
many of you were as well.
We got halfway through the story of 

3
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,301
Jacob and I've been digging underneath 
the story sporadically since then to try

4
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:36,531
to find out what other themes are being 
developed and I've got some things that 

5
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,500
I think are really interesting to talk 
about.

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,410
So um,
so we'll get right into it.

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,160
So I'm going to review a little bit 
first.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,240
So we were talking about Jacob and I'll 
re update his biography a little bit so 

9
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:57,210
that we can place ourselves in the 
proper context before we go on.

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,750
So his mother,
Rebecca gave birth to twins and the 

11
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,210
twins,
even in her womb,

12
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,150
we're struggling for a while,
what they were struggling.

13
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,210
And of course the story is that they 
were struggling for dominance the older 

14
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,430
or the younger,
against the older.

15
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:16,431
Really because Jacob,
Jacob means you surper and Rebecca had 

16
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:16,900
a,
uh,

17
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,330
what would you call a vision from God 
that said that Jacob would supplant 

18
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,590
Esau.

19
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,630
And so even before her twins were born,
they were in a state of competition.

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,190
And that's a recapitulation of the motif
of the hostile brothers,

21
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,030
right?
It's a very,

22
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:41,031
very,
very common mythological motif and we 

23
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:44,600
already saw that really well developed 
in the story of Cain and Abel and Cain 

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,460
and Abel were essentially the first two 
human beings,

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,760
the first two natural born human beings.
And they were instantly locked in the 

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,781
state of enmity,
which is symbolic of first the enmity 

27
00:01:56,781 --> 00:02:01,671
that exists within people's psyche 
between the part of them you might say 

28
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,460
that saving at the light and the part of
them that's aiming at the darkness.

29
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:08,640
And I think that's a reasonable way of 
portraying it.

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,750
Obviously it's a way that sort of rife 
with symbolism,

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,080
but my experience of people,
especially when you get to know them 

32
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:20,910
seriously or when they're dealing with 
serious issues,

33
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:25,911
is that there is quite clearly a part of
them that's striving to do well in the 

34
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,480
world or even to do good.

35
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,250
And another part that's deeply cynical 
and embittered that it says to hell with

36
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:37,251
it and is self destructive and lashes 
out and really aims at making things 

37
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:43,161
worse.
And so that seems to be a natural part 

38
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:46,800
of the human psyche and that's also 
reflected in the,

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,400
the idea of the fall.
And so those ideas are not easily 

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,640
castaway.
They're associated with the rise of self

41
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,910
consciousness right in,
in the story of the garden of Eden.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And I think that's right because I do 
think that our selfconsciousness 

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,130
produces that division within us because
more than any other creature,

44
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:10,000
we're intensely aware of our finitude 
and suffering.

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,590
And that tends to turn us at least to 
some degree against being itself.

46
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,100
You know,
I was watching a bunch of protesters in 

47
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,961
the US last week scream at the sky.
How about trump?

48
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,740
You know,
and uh,

49
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,100
it was interesting,
like I thought it was an extraordinarily

50
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,590
narcissistic display,
but,

51
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,650
but despite that,
there was something symbolically 

52
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:37,650
appropriate about it.
I also,

53
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,100
there's a movie I really like,
sadly enough called Fubar.

54
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,600
I don't know how many of you have seen 
that.

55
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,550
Yeah.
You know that movie I take it.

56
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,340
Yeah.
It's about the people I grew up with.

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,830
So.
Yeah,

58
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,220
that's true,
man.

59
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:55,450
I'm telling you.
That's true.

60
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,050
So the guy,
the main actor in Fubar,

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
who's quite bright but completely 
uncivilized,

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,800
gets testicular cancer and there's one 
great scene where he gets far too drunk 

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,830
and he's stumbling around the street,
you know,

64
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,760
in,
in,

65
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,890
uh,
virtually comatose state.

66
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:16,891
And of course he's not very thrilled 
with what's happened to him and he's 

67
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:19,950
shaking his fist at the sky.
It's pouring rain and he's cursing God 

68
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:19,950
and you know,
it's like,

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,260
well,
you can kind of understand is 

70
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,971
positioned.
So that Kinda reminded me of these 

71
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:27,130
people who were yelling at the sky,
you know,

72
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,160
they were basically they are at 
dramatizing the idea of in rate they 

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,831
were enraged at while you could say God,
of course most of them wouldn't say 

74
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:40,231
that,
but would they were the ones yelling at 

75
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:40,231
the damn sky.

76
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:40,231
I mean,
you know,

77
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:43,330
so you gotta you gotta look at what 
they're doing rather than what they say.

78
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:48,331
And they were outraged that being was 
constructed such that trump could have 

79
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:51,400
arisen as president.
And so well.

80
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:53,250
So this idea,
you know,

81
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,350
that we can be easily turned against 
being and work for its destruction is a 

82
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,830
really.
It's a really common,

83
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:02,200
common common theme.
It never goes away.

84
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,760
You see it echoed in stories like with 
the new marvel series for example,

85
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:09,790
you see the enmity between thor and 
Loki.

86
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,180
That's a good example of the same thing,
or between Batman and the joker,

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,880
there's superman and Lex luthor.
These.

88
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,310
There's these pairs of a hero against 
villain that's a really dramatic and 

89
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,460
easily what everyone can understand that
dynamic,

90
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:32,461
right?
It's a basic plot and the reason it's a 

91
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:34,960
basic plot is because it's true of the 
battle within our spirits,

92
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,190
our own individual spirits.

93
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,190
It's true within families because 
sibling rivalry can be unbelievably 

94
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,211
brutal.
It's true between human beings who are 

95
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,031
strangers.
It's true between groups of people like 

96
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,080
it's true at every level of analysis and
then in some sense it's.

97
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,410
It's architecturally true at least with 
regards to deep religious symbolism 

98
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:59,180
because you see that echoed in many 
stories as well,

99
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:04,181
so I think the clearest representation 
is probably Christ in St and that's the 

100
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:08,471
closest to a pure archetype.
Although there is in the old Egyptian 

101
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:13,271
stories,
there's Osiris and seth or horus and 

102
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:16,670
seth and seth is a precursor to Satan 
etymologically,

103
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:21,671
so it's a very,
very common motif and so that's what 

104
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:22,640
happens again in Rebecca's womb is that 
this thing,

105
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:26,690
this idea has played out right away and 
the two,

106
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,270
the two twins are actually,
what would you call it there they have a

107
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:38,730
superordinate destiny because one of 
them is destined to become the father of

108
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:44,351
Israel and of course that's a pinnacle 
moment in the Old Testament obviously 

109
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,040
and arguably a pinnacle moment in human 
history.

110
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,070
Now the degree to which the stories in 
the Old Testament actually constitute 

111
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,170
what we would consider empirical history
as a matter of debate,

112
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,510
but it doesn't matter in some sense 
because as I mentioned,

113
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:05,870
I think before in this lecture series 
know there are.

114
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,310
There are forms of fiction that are met.
A true,

115
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,870
which means that they're not necessarily
about a specific individual.

116
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:19,871
Although I generally think they are 
based on the life of specific 

117
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:19,871
individuals.
It's the simplest theory,

118
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:20,960
but who knows,
right?

119
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,650
But there are more real than reality 
itself because they abstract out the 

120
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:31,070
most relevant elements of reality and 
present them to you.

121
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,770
And that's why you watch fiction.
You know you don't want.

122
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,110
You want your fiction boiled down,
right?

123
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,710
You want to boil down to the essence.
That's what makes good fiction and that 

124
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,080
essence is something that's truer than 
than plain old truth.

125
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,380
If it's handled well.
And so you know,

126
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:53,381
if you watch a shakespeare play,
half a lifetime of events can go by in a

127
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:58,571
shakespeare play and it covers a wide 
range of scenes and so on and and so 

128
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:05,471
it's,
it's cut and edited and compressed all 

129
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:06,070
at once.
But because of that blasts you with with

130
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,230
a kind of emotional and ethical force 
that just the mirror videotaping of 

131
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:17,531
someone's daily life wouldn't even,
wouldn't even come close to 

132
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:21,521
approximating.
So then this motif of the hostile 

133
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:21,740
brothers,
that's a,

134
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,420
that's a deep,
deep archetipal truth.

135
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,110
And God says to Rachel,
two nations are in thy womb,

136
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:37,160
and two manner of people shall be 
separated from the bowels and one people

137
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:40,730
shall be stronger than the other,
and the elder shall serve the younger.

138
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,520
And so there's a inversion there,
right?

139
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:48,521
Because as we've discussed historically 
speaking in traditionally speaking,

140
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:55,661
it's the elder son that to whom the 
disproportionate blessings flow.

141
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,010
There's some truth in that too.
Even more.

142
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,970
What would you say more empirically?
Iq tends to decrease as the number of 

143
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,290
children in the family increase the 
younger.

144
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,750
The oldest is the smartest.
Generally speaking,

145
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,140
it isn't clear why that is,
but it might be that they get more 

146
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,140
attention,
but who knows?

147
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,330
So those of you who are younger can be 
very unhappy about that fact.

148
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,170
Now Jacob.
Okay,

149
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:29,580
so there's another,
there's another plot line here too,

150
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:34,581
because I'm a Abraham and and Rebecca 
are at odds at.

151
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:43,641
Sorry,
Isaac and Rebecca are at odds about the 

152
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:43,641
children.
Right?

153
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:46,320
So there's a,
there's an eatable twist to it too,

154
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:48,210
because.
Well,

155
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,110
Isaac is allied with Esau who turns out 
to be the hunter type.

156
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,500
So he's your basic rough and tumble 
character,

157
00:09:55,501 --> 00:10:00,501
you know,
and he's kind of a wild looking guy 

158
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:00,930
called Harry and he likes to be outside.
He lives in tents,

159
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:03,030
he likes to hunt.
He's a man's man.

160
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:06,770
That's one way of thinking about it.
Whereas Jacob dwells intense,

161
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,070
you know,
he doesn't go outside much.

162
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:10,830
He's more,
well maybe he's more introverted,

163
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:15,831
but he's certainly the sort of kid 
adolescent say who hangs around home and

164
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,860
there's some intimation that he's as 
well.

165
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,870
He's clearly as mother's favorite and 
with all the advantages and I suppose 

166
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,110
disadvantaged that go along with that.

167
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,440
And Isaac and Rebecca don't see eye to 
eye about who should have predominance 

168
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:36,621
among the sons.
And Rebecca is quite complicit with 

169
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Jacob in inverting the social order.
So the first thing that happens that's 

170
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:48,201
crooked is that Esau comes in from 
hunting and he's,

171
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,240
you know,
maybe he's been out for a number of days

172
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:54,270
and he's ravenous and he's kind of an 
impulsive guy,

173
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:57,540
doesn't really seem to think about the 
longterm very much.

174
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,840
And Jacob was cooking some lentil stew 
and Esau wants some of it and Jacob 

175
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,400
refuses.
And then says that he'll trade his,

176
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,560
his birthright for it,
and uh,

177
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,380
Esau agrees,
which is a bad deal,

178
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,880
right?
It's a bad deal.

179
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,540
And so you,
you could say that Esau actually 

180
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,361
deserves what's coming to them,
although at minimum you'd have to think 

181
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:31,020
of them both as being equally culpable.
It's a nasty trick.

182
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,020
And so that's Jacob's first trick.

183
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,060
And then the second trick is that it's 
later and Isaac is old and blind and you

184
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,360
know,
close to death and it's time for him to 

185
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,641
bestow a blessing on his sons,
which is a very important event 

186
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:56,331
apparently among these ancient people.
And Esau again is out hunting and Rachel

187
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:03,460
dress dresses.
Jacob in a hairy puts a goat skin on his

188
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:08,461
arm.
So he's Kinda hairy like Esol and 

189
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:08,461
dresses.
A Minnesota was closed so he smells like

190
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:13,351
Esau.
And Isaac Tells Esau to go out and hunt 

191
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:17,260
him up some,
some venison I think it is.

192
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,980
And which is a favorite of his.
And Rebecca has Jacob Cook up a couple 

193
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,031
of goat kids and serve that to Isaac and
play the role of Esl.

194
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:31,930
And so he does that.
It's pretty damn nasty.

195
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,350
Really all things considered,
you know,

196
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,360
to play a trick like that both on your 
brother and on your blind father and in 

197
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,990
collusion with your mother.

198
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,140
It's not the sort of thing that's really
designed to promote lot of familial 

199
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,771
harmony and so especially because you've
already screwed them over in a big way.

200
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:55,501
Once you know,
you'd think you'd think that would be 

201
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:56,110
sufficient.
So anyways,

202
00:12:56,111 --> 00:13:01,111
he's successful and ESL loses his 
father's blessing and so that Jacob ends

203
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,610
up really in the position of the first 
born.

204
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:05,600
And it's quite interesting because you 
know,

205
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,650
God tells Rachel that Jacob is going to 
be the dominant twin and you'd think 

206
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,511
again with God's blessing or at least 
the prophecy that Jacob would end up 

207
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:20,101
being in a good guy,
but he certainly not presented that way 

208
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:23,941
to begin with,
which is also quite interesting given 

209
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:23,941
that he's the eventual founder of 
Israel.

210
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:26,860
And it's another indication of the 
realism of these old stories.

211
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:27,870
You know,
and it's,

212
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,090
it's quite amazing to me.
It's always been quite amazing to me how

213
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,420
unprinted fight these stories have 
remained.

214
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,690
You know,
because you'd think that if you're even 

215
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,241
the least bit cynical,
especially if you had the kind of 

216
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:43,570
Marxist religion is the opiate of the 
masses kind of viewpoint,

217
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,640
which,
which is a credible viewpoint,

218
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,350
you know,
although it's wrong,

219
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,550
but it's.
Well,

220
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,160
I think it's a shallow.
I think it's a shallow interpretation 

221
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,870
and a part of the reason I think it's a 
shallow interpretation is because the 

222
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,800
stories would be a lot prettier if that 
was the case.

223
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,890
These characters wouldn't have this 
strange,

224
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,460
realistic,
moral ambiguity about them.

225
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,760
You know,
if you're going to feed people a 

226
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,661
fantasy,
then if you want it to be like a 

227
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:13,661
harlequin novel or,
or,

228
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:15,520
or our greeting card or something like 
that,

229
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,790
you don't want it to be a story that's 
full of betrayal and deceit and murder 

230
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,920
and mayhem and genocide and all of that.
That just doesn't seem all that.

231
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,880
What would you say?
Calming I guess would be the right 

232
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:29,980
answer.
So anyways,

233
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,680
Jacob gets away with this,
but Esau is not happy and,

234
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,660
and Jacob is quite convinced that he 
might kill them.

235
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:42,661
And I think that was a reasonable fear 
because Esau was a tough guy and he was 

236
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:46,111
used to being outside and he knew how to
hunt and he knew how to kill and he 

237
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:49,540
actually wasn't very happy about getting
seriously screwed over by his,

238
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,580
you know,
stay at home brother twice.

239
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,470
And so Jacob runs off and goes to visit 
his uncle and on the way.

240
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:59,600
And this is a very interesting part of 
this story.

241
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:05,170
He stops and to sleep and he takes a 
stone for a pillow and then he has this 

242
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:08,390
vision.
It's called a dream,

243
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,020
but the context makes it look like a 
vision of a ladder reaching up to heaven

244
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,130
and with angels moving up and down the 
ladder,

245
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:19,820
let's say.

246
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,550
And there's some representations of 
that.

247
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:24,800
I showed you some of them the last time 
we met,

248
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:29,801
but I'll read it to you first.
He lighted upon a certain place and 

249
00:15:29,801 --> 00:15:33,911
tarried there all night because the sun 
was set and he took of the stones of 

250
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:35,870
that place and put them for his pillows 
and lay down in that place to sleep.

251
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,710
And he dreamed and beheld a ladder set 
up on the earth,

252
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,890
and the top of it reached to heaven and 
behold the angels of God ascending and 

253
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,001
descending on it.
And behold the lord stood above it and 

254
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:49,001
said,
I am the Lord God of Abraham,

255
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:51,950
thy father and the god of Isaac,
the land.

256
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,220
We're on the Elias to the I will give it
Nti seed.

257
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,640
And I see job as the dust of the earth.
And now schultes spread abroad to the 

258
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,160
west and to the east and to the north 
and the south.

259
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,890
So that lays out the canonical 
directions,

260
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:08,891
right?
So now there's a center with the 

261
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:08,891
canonical directions,
like the thing that you see,

262
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:13,540
that little symbol you see on maps,
it's the same thing that symbolically 

263
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,950
placed upon the earth.
So a center has been established with 

264
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,580
radiating well with,
with what?

265
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,730
With with directional lines radiating 
from it.

266
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:27,731
So it establishes as,
as a place and in the seed shall all the

267
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:31,850
families of the earth be blessed.
So that's pretty good news for Jacob.

268
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:36,851
And it's not self evident why God is 
rewarding him for running away after 

269
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:38,900
screwing over his brother.
But that seems to be what happens.

270
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,960
And so here's a couple of 
representations,

271
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:46,961
classic representations.
The one on the right is William Blake 

272
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:49,310
has one I particularly like,
you know,

273
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,350
on Blake assimilates God with the sun 
when with light,

274
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:59,410
right?
So that's quite a common mythological 

275
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,540
idea that God is associated with light 
and the day

276
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,170
behold I am with thee and will keep the 
in all places,

277
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:15,171
whether thou go list and we'll bring the
again into this land for I will not 

278
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:18,561
leave thee until I have done that,
which I have spoken to the of and Jacob 

279
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:19,140
awaked out of his sleep.
And he said,

280
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,870
surely the Lord is in this place.
And I knew what not.

281
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,470
And he was afraid,
which is exactly the right response.

282
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,960
And said,
how dreadful is this place?

283
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,380
It is none other than the house of God 
and this is the gate of heaven.

284
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,100
And Jacob rose up early in the morning 
and took the stone that he had put for 

285
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,071
his pillows and set it up for a pillar.
And poured oil on the top of it and 

286
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:44,170
that's,
that's a more important thing than you 

287
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,011
think.
And what will go into that a little bit 

288
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:46,380
more deeply because up to this point in 
the story,

289
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,120
there isn't anything really.

290
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,450
There isn't.
That's really emerged to mark a sacred 

291
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:53,450
space,
right?

292
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:53,940
There's no,
there's no cathedral,

293
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,770
there's no church,
there's nothing like that.

294
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,070
But here's this idea that emerges that 
you can mark the center of something 

295
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,850
that and that's important and you mark 
it with a stone and a stone is a good 

296
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,011
way to mark things that,
that are important because the stone is 

297
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:10,011
permanent,
right?

298
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:13,820
And we mark things with stones now like 
we marked graves with stones for 

299
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,061
example,
because we want to make a memory and to 

300
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:17,340
carve something into stone,
to carve a stone.

301
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:22,341
And then to carve something into stone 
is to make a memory and to use stone is 

302
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:23,490
to make a memory because stone is 
permanent.

303
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,970
And to set it upright as to indicate a 
center.

304
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,020
And so that's what happens in pours oil 
on the top of it,

305
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:36,021
which is kind of offering.
And he called the name of that place 

306
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:38,990
Bethel,
but the name of the city was called 

307
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,870
[inaudible] at the first and Jacob vowed
a vow saying,

308
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,150
if God will be with me and will keep me 
in this way,

309
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:45,000
that I go and will give me bread to eat 
and Raymond to put on

310
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,800
than a 10th of what I earn,
I will give him.

311
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,670
I missed that.
That's interesting too,

312
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,220
because now there's a transformation of 
sacrifice,

313
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:03,050
right?
Because until that point,

314
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,380
sacrifices have had been pretty 
concretized.

315
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:08,840
It was the burning of something.
Whereas here,

316
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:11,480
all of a sudden it's the offering of,
of,

317
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,290
of,
of productive labor per se,

318
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,320
like a tie.
This tie is a form of sacrifice.

319
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,750
And so there's an abstraction of the 
idea of sacrifice,

320
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,080
sacrifice.
It's really important that the idea of 

321
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,660
sacrifice gets abstracted,
right?

322
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,660
Because it should be abstracted to the 
point where it's,

323
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,720
it's used the way that we use it today,
which is,

324
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:37,721
you know,
we make sacrifices to get ahead and 

325
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:40,121
everyone understands what that means.
But the sacrifices are generally some 

326
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:44,360
combination of psychological end and,
and practical.

327
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,660
So we're not acting them out.
We're precisely,

328
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:51,050
we're not dramatizing the Mer 
ritualizing and we actually act them out

329
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,080
in our,
in the covenant that we make with the 

330
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,361
future,
and we do that well unless we're 

331
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:01,091
extraordinarily impulsive and aimless in
our lives and have really no conception 

332
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:04,820
whatsoever of the future and are likely 
to sacrifice the future for the present,

333
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:06,950
which is what Esau does,
right?

334
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,220
Then we make sacrifices and you gotta 
think like the idea of making sacrifices

335
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,270
to make the future better is an 
extraordinarily difficult lesson to 

336
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,270
learn.
It took people,

337
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,490
God only knows how long to learn that,
you know,

338
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,200
like we,
we have no idea.

339
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,660
It's not something that animals do 
easily.

340
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,060
Chimpanzees don't store leftover meat,
you know,

341
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,010
they just needed to wolves,
they just,

342
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:36,860
a wolf can eat about 30 pounds of meat 
in one city and that's where the idea of

343
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,230
wolfing it down comes from.
They're not hiding it,

344
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:40,580
saving it for later,
you know,

345
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:45,581
they can't do that,
so they can't sacrifice the present for 

346
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:47,120
the future.
So this is a big deal.

347
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:47,730
This,
that,

348
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,490
this happens.

349
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Now I want to tell you a little bit 
about the idea of the pillar because 

350
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,321
it's,
it's an unbelievably deep idea and it 

351
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:03,151
orients us in ways that we still don't.
It's still orienting us in ways that we 

352
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:05,440
don't understand.
In fact,

353
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:09,490
it's actually the mechanism by which 
we're oriented or,

354
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,460
and if it's lacking then we become 
disoriented.

355
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,460
And so I'll show you some pictures and 
describe them first.

356
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,840
Okay.
So first of all,

357
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,690
there's a walled city.
So let,

358
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:24,691
let me tell you that you could think 
about that as an archetypal human 

359
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:28,291
habitation.
Maybe it's a reflection of something 

360
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,991
like a fire in the middle of the plane 
or the forest or the jungle for that 

361
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:33,370
matter.
Although it's kind of hard to get a fire

362
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:38,371
going there.
Imagine a fire ringed around with logs 

363
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:39,910
and perhaps ringed around with 
dwellings,

364
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:44,911
right?
So the fires in the center and the fire 

365
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:45,610
defines the center and then as you move 
away from the fire,

366
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:47,260
you move out into the darkness,
right?

367
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,670
So the fire is light and communion and 
safety.

368
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,270
And as you move away from the fire,
you move out into the darkness.

369
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,580
And what's terrifying out beyond the 
perimeter.

370
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,380
So what's beyond the perimeter is 
terrifying.

371
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,350
You can feel that if you go camping 
somewhere that's wild,

372
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,140
you know you're pretty damn happy,
especially if the wolves are howling,

373
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,380
you're pretty damn happy to be sitting 
by the fire because you can see there 

374
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,120
the fire keeps the animals away and you 
know if you do wander into the bush,

375
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,370
into the darkness,
then you're on alert and you know your 

376
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,341
Predator detection systems are on alert.
And so you could think about the 

377
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:26,680
classical human habitation as two 
places.

378
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,860
One where your Predator detection system
isn't on alert and another where your 

379
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,450
Predator tech detection system is alert 
on alert.

380
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,720
And you can think about that roughly as 
the distinction between unexplored 

381
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,080
territory and unexplored territory.

382
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:45,490
And really the founding of a place is 
precisely.

383
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,220
This is a lot of this I got from reading
virtually Eliana.

384
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,700
The founding of a place is precisely the
definition of a explored center set 

385
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:59,971
against the unexplored periphery.
And you know what's interesting about 

386
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:01,060
that,
so you can kind of think about that with

387
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:02,500
regards to the walled city,
right?

388
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Everything in the wall is cosmos and 
everything outside the wall is chaos and

389
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,320
you know,
but it also extends to the conceptual 

390
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,500
realm because imagine that you're the 
master of a field of study,

391
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,820
and so that's an interesting metaphor 
because the field is that a geographical

392
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:22,690
metaphor,
right?

393
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:28,050
And if in the center of the field are 
those things that everyone knows really 

394
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,701
well,
the axioms that everyone abides by in 

395
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:36,841
the field,
and then as you move towards the 

396
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:36,841
fringes,
you get to work towards the unknown,

397
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:41,410
towards the frontier of the discipline,
and as you become expert,

398
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:45,830
you move from the center to the frontier
and so then you're on the border.

399
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,880
When you're,
when you're,

400
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,140
when you're a scholar,
a competence call,

401
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:54,050
you're on the border between the 
unexplored or the explored an unexplored

402
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,910
and you're trying to further that 
border.

403
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:58,070
So even if you're just doing this 
abstractly,

404
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,490
it's the same thing and it's a 
reflection of the fact that every human 

405
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,650
environment,
concrete or abstract,

406
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:11,651
it makes no difference recapitulates the
cosmos chaos dichotomy or the order 

407
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:16,870
chaos dichotomy.
And that's why endow isn't.

408
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,890
For example,
it's the union of chaos.

409
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:23,810
And order that constitutes being itself 
and that you stand on the border between

410
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,750
chaos and order because that's the 
proper place to be,

411
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,900
to orderly too much in the explored.
You're not learning anything too much 

412
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:37,361
out there where the predators lurk,
then you're frozen with terror and 

413
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:39,440
neither of those positions are 
desirable.

414
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,200
So.
And that's what you know.

415
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:45,860
And so you think,
and this is a concrete reality obviously

416
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:49,610
as well as a psychological reality,
there were reasons for those walls,

417
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:50,660
right?

418
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,380
Because inside the walls were all the 
people like us.

419
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,830
And so that begs the question,
what does it mean for people to be like 

420
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,700
us?
And then outside the wall of the rows,

421
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,710
all of those people because they were 
the worst forms of predators because 

422
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,920
people are actually the worst forms of 
predators who aren't like us.

423
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,930
And the wall is there to draw a 
distinction between like us and not like

424
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,460
us.
And so,

425
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:20,600
and that was a matter of life and death.
You can tell that because I mean look at

426
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,210
those walls,
they had to build those by hand.

427
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,390
And you know,
you do see walled cities that have three

428
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:31,391
rings of walls,
so these people were terrified but not 

429
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:33,680
so terrified as the people who built 
three walls,

430
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,860
they were really terrified and they had 
their reasons.

431
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,460
So okay,
so now there's an idea that's,

432
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,790
that's reflected in the Jacob's ladder 
story,

433
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,300
that the center where you put the pillar
is also the place where heaven and earth

434
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:56,840
touch.

435
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,560
And so that's,
that's a complicated idea I think that 

436
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,460
you can.
I'm trying to look at these stories from

437
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:09,461
a psychological perspective and so then 
you could say that that's a symbolic 

438
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:11,660
place where the lowest and the highest 
come together.

439
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,320
And so it's a place where earthly being 
stretches up to the highest possible 

440
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:23,420
ethical abstraction.
And that's the center because one of the

441
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:27,080
things that defines us say,
as opposed to them,

442
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,160
is that we're all united within a 
certain ethic.

443
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,060
That's what makes us the same.
This is a complicated line of reasoning 

444
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,580
and,
but I'll go back to it after I show you 

445
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:42,950
some more pictures.
But.

446
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,510
So that's,
that's the first idea is that the center

447
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,010
is the place where the lowest and the 
highest touch simultaneously.

448
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,250
And so you could say that in some sense 
it specifies the aim of a group of 

449
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,250
people.

450
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,050
That's another way.
You know if you get together with people

451
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:03,051
to make a group even at work,
you group yourself around a project and 

452
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:05,850
that unites you and the United States 
because we all have the same name.

453
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:09,960
You're all pointing to the same thing 
and that makes you the same in some ways

454
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,480
because if you're after the same thing I
am,

455
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,780
then the same things are going to be 
important to you that are important to 

456
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,361
me.
And the same things are going to be 

457
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:20,361
negative to you that are negative to me 
because our emotions work out that way.

458
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,390
And that means I can instantly predict 
you know how you're going to behave.

459
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,410
And so our aim,
which is basically our ethical amy,

460
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,220
it's because we're aiming at something 
better.

461
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,760
At least in principle,
we're aiming at something better.

462
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,910
So our ethical aim that unites our 
perceptions and that's what aligns our 

463
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:37,910
emotions.

464
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,470
And so that sort of begs the question,
if you're going to build a community 

465
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,370
around what aim should the community 
congregate?

466
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,970
Okay.
So the idea here is that the center of 

467
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,070
the community is the pillar that Unites 
Heaven and earth.

468
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:51,810
So it unites the lowest with the 
highest.

469
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,050
So there was some intimation of the idea
that it's the highest that unites the 

470
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:58,800
community.
Okay.

471
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,360
And so keep that in mind.
And that's a very old idea as well.

472
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,720
That's the idea of the Axis Mundi,
which is the center pole that Unites 

473
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,780
Heaven and earth.
It's an unbelievably old idea.

474
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:15,050
Tens of thousands of years old.
It might even stretch back to whatever 

475
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,880
our archaic memories,
memories,

476
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,980
I don't know how,
what you would describe them,

477
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:24,981
archetipal memories of are excessively 
old ancestry and trees when the tree 

478
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:30,951
itself was in fact the center of the 
world and that it was ringed by snakes 

479
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:31,920
and chaos.

480
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,790
And so while we have no idea how old 
these ideas are,

481
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:39,540
but they're very,
very old and evolution is a conservative

482
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:42,060
business.
Once it builds a gadget,

483
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,660
then it builds new things on top of that
gadgets,

484
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:47,090
like a medieval town,
right?

485
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,800
The center of the town is really old and
new,

486
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,220
newer areas of the town get built around
it,

487
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:56,400
but the center is still really old and 
that's what we're like.

488
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,630
You know,
our,

489
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,010
our platforms like our,
our basic physiological structure.

490
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,030
This,
this skeletal body is some tens of 

491
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,610
millions of years old or older than 
that.

492
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,940
If you think about vertebrates,
it's much older than that and that's all

493
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:16,941
conserved.
So everything's built on top of 

494
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:17,880
everything else.
All right,

495
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,881
so there's a kind of a classic town and 
there's the idea I showed you this,

496
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:28,521
this Scandinavian world tree,
same idea unites heaven and earth and 

497
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:31,320
around the roots of that tree are snakes
that eat this tree constantly.

498
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,320
So that's the idea that there's 
stability,

499
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:37,710
but there's constant transformation 
around that stability.

500
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,860
And at the same time the snakes are 
knowing and the roots,

501
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,470
there's streams that are nourishing it.
So it's sort of,

502
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,590
it's sort of an echo of the idea that 
life depends on death and renewal 

503
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,230
constantly because your cells are dying.
And being renewed constantly,

504
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:55,540
right?
If they are just proliferating,

505
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,910
then you have cancer.
If they're just dying then you dye it.

506
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,300
You have to get the balance between 
death and life.

507
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,550
Exactly right.
So that you can actually live,

508
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,580
which is also a very strange thing.
So.

509
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,910
And that tree is something that reaches 
from the bottom layers of being maybe 

510
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,480
the microcosm all the way to the 
macrocosm.

511
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,100
That's the idea.
Anyways.

512
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,710
So then there's,
okay,

513
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:22,711
so there's,
there's a Jacob and his is pillar.

514
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,840
He's got this idea that you can mark the
center with this stone.

515
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,600
Like it sort of symbolizes what he was 
laying on when he dreamt,

516
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:32,200
but now he's got this idea,
you put something erect and it marks the

517
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:36,430
center and it symbolizes his vision of 
the highest good.

518
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,880
Something like that.
And the promise that's been made to him.

519
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,120
And then this is an Egyptian obelisk,
the pyramid on top of it that's in 

520
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:51,211
Paris.
It was taken from Luxor and put in 

521
00:30:51,211 --> 00:30:53,461
Paris.
And so that's a much more sophisticated 

522
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,920
instance of the same idea.
Okay.

523
00:30:57,921 --> 00:31:02,921
And there was a stone age culture is 
across Eurasia that put up these huge 

524
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,270
obelisks everywhere.
These huge,

525
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:06,250
like the stonehenge is a good example of
that,

526
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:11,251
although it's very sophisticated and 
there are also markers of places we 

527
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:12,460
don't know exactly what their function 
is,

528
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:17,290
but they're very much akin to this some 
permanent marker of place.

529
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,060
There's a good one.
So that's in St Peter's and I really 

530
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,391
liked this one because you can see the 
echoes of Jacob's vision for the 

531
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:31,330
establishment of a territory there,
right?

532
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,620
You've got the obelisk in the middle and
then you've got the directions radiating

533
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:38,780
from the center.
And of course St Peters.

534
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:43,781
This is the St Peter's Basilica in Rome,
which is an absolutely unbelievable 

535
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:45,670
place.
It's just jaw dropping.

536
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,390
And so there's the cathedral at the back
of it.

537
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:52,540
And then there's this circle of pillars 
that surrounds it.

538
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,340
You can just see them a little bit on 
the,

539
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,930
on the middle left there.
That goes all the way around that entire

540
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:00,640
enclosure.
And uh,

541
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,940
you know,
very large number of people can gather 

542
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:05,940
there.
And then.

543
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,980
So that pillar marks the center and that
would be the center of Catholicism,

544
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:10,810
essentially.
That's what that represents,

545
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:13,450
right?
The symbolic center of Catholicism.

546
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,570
Although you could make the case that 
the cathedral is the center,

547
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,300
it doesn't really matter.
They're very close together and it's.

548
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,880
It's half a dozen of one in six of the 
other.

549
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,140
And then here's another representation 
of the same idea,

550
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:31,141
right?
Is that this is why people don't like 

551
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:33,301
the flag to be burned because 
conservative people see the flag as the 

552
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:38,281
sacred thing that binds people together 
and so they're not happy when that 

553
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:43,141
sacred thing is,
even if it's destroyed in the name of 

554
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:46,691
protest.
Whereas the people who burned flags 

555
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:48,641
thank well there are times to dramatize 
the idea that the center has been 

556
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:52,640
corrupt and you can demonstrate that by 
putting it to the torch,

557
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,850
you know as a representation that,
that this,

558
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:01,050
that the corrupt center now has to be 
burned and transformed.

559
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,640
And the thing is they're both right.
They're both right all the time because 

560
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,480
the center is absolutely necessary and 
is sacred and is almost always also 

561
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,341
corrupt and in need of reparation.
That's also an archetypal idea and,

562
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,400
and that's a useful thing to know 
because you know,

563
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,370
it's easy for young people in particular
to think that while the world's going to

564
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:26,300
hell in a hand basket and it's the fault
of the last generation,

565
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:31,301
they've left us this terrible mess and 
leave feeling pretty betrayed about 

566
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:31,301
that.

567
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,060
Now we have to clean it up.
It's like,

568
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:32,510
yeah,
yeah,

569
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,210
people have been thinking that for like 
35,000

570
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:37,040
years.
It's not new.

571
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,500
And,
and the reason it's not new,

572
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,220
it's because it's always true.
You know,

573
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,960
what you're handed is a sacred center 
with flaws always,

574
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:49,700
always as partly because it's the 
creation of the dead right in the dead.

575
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:54,790
Can't see and they can't communicate.
And so they're not in touch with the 

576
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,580
present.
And so what they've bequeath to you,

577
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,460
apart from the fact that it might 
actually be corrupt,

578
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:02,000
which is a slightly different thing,
is at least blind in dead.

579
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,450
And so what the hell can you expect from
something that's blind in dead?

580
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:10,870
No,
you're lucky if it just doesn't stomp 

581
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:10,870
you out of existence.
So.

582
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:10,870
So that's,
uh,

583
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:15,311
a lovely photograph obviously.
And that's the establishment of a new 

584
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:19,061
center.
Then the center can be a cathedral to 

585
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:23,210
and often is of course in classic 
counts,

586
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:28,390
European towns in particular,
although it's not only European towns 

587
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:32,711
that are like this,
there's a center that's made out of 

588
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:32,711
stone.

589
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:36,070
So that would be the cathedral and it's 
got the highest tower on top of the 

590
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,821
tower.
There's often across and that's the 

591
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:42,221
symbolic center.
So people are are drawn together around 

592
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:46,331
whatever the cross represents.
Now that the cross obviously represents 

593
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,690
a center because it's an x,
right?

594
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:52,691
X marks the spot.
So the center of the Cross is the 

595
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:55,691
center.
And then the cathedral is often in a 

596
00:34:55,691 --> 00:34:58,330
cross shape which also marks the center.
And then in the cathedral there's a dome

597
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:03,521
often in that's the sky.
And that's that ladder that reaches from

598
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:08,591
Earth to heaven.
So it's a recapitulation of the same 

599
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:08,591
idea.
So,

600
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,020
and people are drawn to that center and 
the center is the symbol of what unites 

601
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:19,481
them.
And what unites them is the faith that 

602
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:21,920
the cathedral is the embodiment of.
And you think,

603
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,780
well what does the faith mean?
And again,

604
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:27,350
we're approaching this psychologically,
and what it means is that we,

605
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,770
everyone who's a member of that group,
accepts the transcendent ideal of the 

606
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:32,770
group.

607
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,150
Now the thing is,
if you're the member of a group,

608
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:37,560
you accept the transcendent ideal of the
group.

609
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,200
That's what it means to be a member of a
group.

610
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,960
So if you're in a work team and you're 
all working on a project,

611
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:47,961
what you've essentially done is decided 
that you're going to make the goal 

612
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:49,350
unquestionable,
right?

613
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:51,000
I mean you might argue about the 
details,

614
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,910
but if you're tasked with something,
you know,

615
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:58,010
here's a job for you.
10 people organize yourself around the 

616
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,951
job.
You can argue about how you're going to 

617
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:01,200
do the job,
but you can't argue about the job.

618
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,440
Then the group falls apart.
And so there's an act of faith in some 

619
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,791
sense.
The reason that the act of faith is 

620
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:14,181
necessary is because it's very,
very difficult to specify without error 

621
00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:17,400
what that central aim should be.
Given that there's any number of aims,

622
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:17,640
right?

623
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,040
And it's a very,
very difficult thing to figure out.

624
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:23,640
And this is something we're going to do 
a little bit tonight is like what should

625
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:27,120
the aim be around which a group would 
congregate?

626
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:33,420
So especially if it's a large group and 
it's a large group that has to stay 

627
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,701
together across very large swaths of 
time and the group is an incredibly 

628
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:38,850
diverse,
you know,

629
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:43,851
what possible kind of ideal could unite 
a large group of diverse people across a

630
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:46,830
very large stretch of time.
That's a really,

631
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:51,831
really hard question and I think part of
the way that question has been answered 

632
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:55,851
is it's been answered symbolically and 
in the images because it's so damn 

633
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:59,370
complicated that it's almost impossible 
to articulate so.

634
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,520
But obviously you need to have a center 
around which everyone can unite because 

635
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,540
if you don't then everyone is at odds 
with one another.

636
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,360
Like if I don't know what you're up to 
and you don't know what he's up to.

637
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:14,100
We have no were just strangers and we 
don't know that our ethics match at all.

638
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Then the probability that we're going to
be able to exist harmoniously decreases 

639
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,530
rapidly to zero.
And that's obviously just no good.

640
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,830
That's a state of total chaos,
so we can't have that.

641
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:30,831
It's not possible to exist without a 
central ideal.

642
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,720
It's not possible and it's deeper than 
that.

643
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:37,140
It's deeper than that.
Partly because it's.

644
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,510
I'll try to get this right.
This is the sort of thing that I was 

645
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,020
arguing with Sam Harris about.
You see,

646
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,040
your category system is a product of 
your aims.

647
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,300
That's the thing,
like if you have a set of facts at hand,

648
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:57,930
the facts don't tell you how to 
categorize the facts because there's too

649
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:02,931
damn many facts.
There's a trillion fact and there's no 

650
00:38:02,931 --> 00:38:07,521
way without imposing some a priority 
order on them of determining how it is 

651
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:09,600
that you should order them.
So how do you order them?

652
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,740
Well,
that's easy.

653
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,340
You decide what you're aiming at.
Now,

654
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:15,600
how do you do that?
Well,

655
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,520
I'm not answering that question at the 
moment.

656
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,730
I'm just saying that in order to 
organize those facts,

657
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:25,380
you need it aim and then the aim 
instantly organizes the facts into those

658
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:30,381
things relevant to the ame tools.
Let's say those things that get in the 

659
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:34,461
way and a very large number of things 
that you don't have to pay attention to 

660
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:34,860
at all.
Right?

661
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:38,620
It excludes vert like if you're working 
on an engineering problem,

662
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,860
you don't have to worry about a 
practicing medicine in your 

663
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:46,720
neighborhood.
You don't.

664
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,360
There's a bunch of like if you're 
focusing on a particular,

665
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,620
what would you say?

666
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,510
Any,
any job,

667
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:03,511
any,
any set of skills implies that you're 

668
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,541
good at a small set of things and then 
not good at an incredibly large number 

669
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:10,681
of other skills.
It simplifies things and so you can use 

670
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,671
your aim as the basis of a category 
structure and so you also have to keep 

671
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:20,011
that in mind because what it means is,
as far as I can tell that what it means 

672
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:23,791
is that your category system itself,
which is what structures your 

673
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:26,680
perceptions is actually dependent on the
ethics of your aim.

674
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,440
It's directly,
it's a moral thing.

675
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,590
It's directly dependent on your aim and 
that's a stunning idea if it happens to 

676
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:39,991
be true.
It's not how people think about 

677
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:39,991
thinking.
We don't think that way.

678
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:42,490
We think that we think deterministically
let's say,

679
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:47,910
or that we think empirically or that we 
think rationally and none of that 

680
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,910
appears to be the case.

681
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,890
What we do is we pause it a valid aim 
and then we organize the world around 

682
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,710
the aim and there's plenty of evidence 
from that in in psychological studies of

683
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:57,610
perception,
right?

684
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,900
That that does look like how the 
perceptual systems work.

685
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,110
Mostly they ignore because the world's 
too complicated.

686
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:10,410
They focus on a small set of phenomena 
deemed relevant to whatever the aim is,

687
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,120
and then of course the aim is 
problematic.

688
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:18,330
Again,
it's complex because the aim I have has 

689
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,271
to be an aim that some of you at share 
or at least don't object to because 

690
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,650
otherwise I'm not going to get anywhere 
with my damn aim.

691
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,410
It has to actually be implementable in 
the world.

692
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,280
It has to be sustainable across at least
some amount of time.

693
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,390
It can't kill me like it's really hedged
in this aim.

694
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,430
It's.
It isn't any old thing.

695
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,890
There's hardly any things that it can 
be.

696
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,260
So you know,
Jacob's aim,

697
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:46,261
for example,
in undermining Esau almost gets him 

698
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:49,390
killed and you can understand why that's
the other thing you think,

699
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:49,840
well,
that,

700
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,470
that was a nasty bit of work.
You can understand [inaudible] rage.

701
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:57,820
It's even though we're separated from 
the people in these stories by what,

702
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:58,870
4,000
years,

703
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:00,610
3000 years,
something like that,

704
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:05,970
you know,
in immediately why everyone feels the 

705
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,180
way they do.
At least once you understand the context

706
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:10,270
of the story that none of that 
mysterious in the least.

707
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,080
So,
so there's the church and the church is 

708
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,660
underneath the cross,
right?

709
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,480
So that St Peter's Basilica.
And so there's the cross on the globe,

710
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,830
on top of the basilica,
and then there's the cross on the,

711
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,170
uh,
obelisk as well.

712
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:34,620
And so what that means is that,
and this is where things get insanely 

713
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,161
complicated,
is that the center is defined by 

714
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:40,430
whatever the cross represents.

715
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,670
Now the cross represents a crossing 
point.

716
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:48,671
Geographically,
it's certainly that the cross probably 

717
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,911
represents the body to some degree,
but then the cross also represents the 

718
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:55,010
place of suffering obviously.
And more importantly,

719
00:41:55,011 --> 00:42:00,011
it,
it represents the place of voluntary 

720
00:42:00,011 --> 00:42:01,100
suffering transcended.
I'm speaking psychologically,

721
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,840
right?
Not Theologically.

722
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,870
That's what it represents.
And so you might say,

723
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:10,871
so here's the idea behind putting down 
the obelisk with the cross and saying 

724
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:15,821
that that's the center.
So that's the thing that everyone's 

725
00:42:15,821 --> 00:42:15,821
aiming at.
And so the I,

726
00:42:15,821 --> 00:42:16,310
the idea would be,
well,

727
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:19,820
if you're going to be a member of the 
group defined by this obelisk,

728
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:24,821
then what you do is accept your position
at the center of suffering voluntarily 

729
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:28,760
and therefore transcended.
That's the idea.

730
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:32,180
And that is one hell of an idea.
It really is,

731
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:37,181
man,
that is a killer idea because it's 

732
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:39,971
actually a signal.
It's a really clear signal of 

733
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:39,971
psychological health,
you know,

734
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:44,711
because one of the things you do if 
you're a clinical psychologist and 

735
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:47,500
someone is paralyzed by fear,
is what you do is you break their fears 

736
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,851
down into relatively manageable bits and
then you have them voluntarily confront 

737
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,540
their fears.

738
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,150
And it might also be things that they're
disgusted by,

739
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,250
say if they have obsessive compulsive 
disorder,

740
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,740
but it produces very strong negative 
emotion,

741
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:05,741
whatever it is.
And then you have them voluntarily 

742
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:08,381
confront whatever it is that produces 
that overwhelming negative emotion and 

743
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:10,700
that makes them stronger.
That's what happens.

744
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:15,910
It doesn't make them less afraid.
It makes them more courageous and 

745
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,570
stronger.
And that is not the same thing.

746
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:20,270
It's seriously not.
It doesn't decrease the fear.

747
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,510
It increases the courage.
And so that's a mind boggling idea and 

748
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:27,470
it's deeper.
You know,

749
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,440
one of the things that's really 
interesting about these archetipal ideas

750
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,040
is that maybe it's partly because of the
hyperlink nature of the Bible.

751
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,780
That's part of it,
but it's not.

752
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,360
The whole thing is that no matter how 
deep you dig into them,

753
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,530
you'll never get to the bottom.
You know,

754
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,780
you hit a bottom,
you think,

755
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:43,970
God,
that's so unbelievably profound.

756
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,220
And then if you excavate a little 
underneath that,

757
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:48,770
you find something else that's even more
profound and you think,

758
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:50,360
wow,
that's got to be the bottom.

759
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,180
And then you dig under that.
It's like there's no bottom.

760
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,940
You can just keep digging down while as 
far as I can tell,

761
00:43:55,941 --> 00:44:00,941
you can keep digging down layer after 
layer and we'll talk a little bit about 

762
00:44:00,941 --> 00:44:04,871
more,
a little more about what the cross 

763
00:44:04,871 --> 00:44:07,210
signifies as the center because you see 
what people were trying to figure out is

764
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,060
what is it that we need to unite under,
right?

765
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:14,510
What's the proper thing to unite under?
I can give you another example,

766
00:44:14,511 --> 00:44:18,530
so in the Mesopotamian societies,
the emperor,

767
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,240
you know who was more or less than an 
absolute monarch,

768
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:28,330
he lived inside what was essentially a 
walled city and the god of the 

769
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:33,911
Mesopotamians was Martin and Martin was 
the figure who had eyes all the way 

770
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:35,990
around his head and he spoke magic 
words.

771
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,040
So he's very attentive and very 
articulate,

772
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,540
and it was Martin who went out and 
confronted the goddess of chaos,

773
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:47,541
the dragon of chaos,
and cut her into pieces and made up the 

774
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:47,541
world.
Okay,

775
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:48,450
so you can kind of understand what that 
means.

776
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:53,451
So Marta goes beyond the frontier into 
the place of predatory chaos and 

777
00:44:55,501 --> 00:45:00,501
encounters the thing that's terrifying 
and then make something productive out 

778
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:04,911
of it.
So it's a hero myth and Martech is 

779
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:08,151
elected to the position of preeminent 
God by all the other Mesopotamian gods 

780
00:45:08,151 --> 00:45:12,381
because he manages that.
So the Martech idea emerges up the holy 

781
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:18,830
dominance hierarchy and hits the 
pinnacle so that and God only knows how 

782
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:22,641
long that took.
It would be the amalgamation of many 

783
00:45:22,641 --> 00:45:24,000
tribes and then the,
the what,

784
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:29,980
the distillation of all the tribal myths
to produce this emergent story of what 

785
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:35,721
constitutes top God.
And then the job of the emperor was to 

786
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:35,721
act out Martik.

787
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,910
That's what gave him sovereignty.
So the reason that he was the center 

788
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,631
around which people organize themselves 
wasn't because he was when he was being 

789
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:46,110
a proper emperor,
wasn't because there was something super

790
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:51,111
special about him,
like the power didn't exactly reside in 

791
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:54,561
him,
which is a really useful thing to 

792
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:54,561
separate,
right?

793
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:55,260
You want the power,
which is why it's kind of Nice to have a

794
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:00,890
symbolic monarch.
You get the symbolic power separated 

795
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:01,470
from the personality power,
right?

796
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,260
Because otherwise they get conflated.
That's what happened in Rome.

797
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:09,590
It's a very.
And you can see attending to happen now 

798
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,561
and then in theu ,
s like with the Kennedy dynasties and 

799
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,051
that sort of thing.
So the idea was the emperor had 

800
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:18,921
sovereignty as long as he was acting out
Marta properly and going out into the 

801
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:21,690
chaos and cutting it into pieces and 
making order.

802
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:26,750
That was his jobs they used to take 
about side the city on the New Year's 

803
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,621
festival and strip him of all his 
emperor garments and humiliate them and 

804
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:35,961
then force him to to confess all the 
ways that year he hadn't been a good 

805
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:42,951
martik so he wasn't a good ruler.
And so that was supposed to clue him in 

806
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:43,650
and way come up.
Right.

807
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,040
And then they would ritually reenact the
battle of Marduk against Pi about the 

808
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:54,570
chaos monster using statues.
And then if that all went well,

809
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:59,571
then the emperor would go back in and 
the city would be renewed for another 

810
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:03,800
year.
And we still have echoes of that in our 

811
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:03,800
New Year's celebration.
Right.

812
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,460
It's the same idea that's echoed down 
all those all those centuries,

813
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:09,330
thousands of years.
So it says such a staggeringly brilliant

814
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:09,990
idea,
right?

815
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:13,770
Because so part of the idea is that the 
thing that sovereign,

816
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:15,630
so that's the pillar at the center,
that,

817
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:19,380
that everyone gathers around his,
at least in part,

818
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:24,381
the thing that courageously goes out 
into the unknown and make something 

819
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:25,440
useful out of it for the community.

820
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,760
So that's very,
very smart.

821
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,410
It's very smart.
So this is another example of a center.

822
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:36,790
So these,
this is the flag,

823
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:41,791
this is the Union Jack.
And so it's made up of a bunch of 

824
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:41,791
crosses,
right?

825
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:44,080
And so the first cross,
the English cross,

826
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,540
that's the flag of St George.
That's the flag of England.

827
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,130
And say,
what does St George Do?

828
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,370
Slays the Dragon.
Exactly.

829
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,420
Same idea,
right?

830
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:57,421
So St George,
patron saint of England goes out and 

831
00:47:57,421 --> 00:47:58,150
slays the dragon and freeze the virgin 
from the grip of the Dragon.

832
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,590
Same idea,
right?

833
00:47:59,591 --> 00:48:04,591
So that's the center.
And then the second cross is called a,

834
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,720
a Saltier,
but it's another crucifix.

835
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,050
So it's the cross on which St Andrew was
crucified.

836
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,820
Set.
So it's the same idea.

837
00:48:12,821 --> 00:48:17,821
It's the,
the center is the center of suffering 

838
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:19,210
voluntarily undertaken because St Andrew
was a martyr.

839
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,920
And then St Patrick is the third cross.
What did St Patrick do in Ireland?

840
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,700
Chased out all the snakes,
right?

841
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:29,710
So it's the same thing.
Right?

842
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,920
And so the flag of Great Britain is the 
combination of all of these three 

843
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,540
crosses that defines the center and 
that's what the flag is.

844
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,250
So that symbolizes all of that.
So that's,

845
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,020
you know,
completely mind boggling.

846
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,980
So.
And there's more about St Patrick too,

847
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:50,980
so he banishes this snakes after a 40 
day fast.

848
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:55,981
And so that's an illusion to the 40 
years that Moses spends in the desert 

849
00:48:55,981 --> 00:49:00,481
and also the 40 days that Christ fasts 
in the New Testament and his walking 

850
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:02,800
stick when he plants it grows into a 
tree.

851
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,060
So that echos all of the ideas about the
center that we just described.

852
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:10,810
And he also speaks with the ancient 
Irish ancestors,

853
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:15,811
which if you remember,
is a characteristic of the shamanic 

854
00:49:15,811 --> 00:49:18,850
rituals where we're.
So in the typical shamonic ritual,

855
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:23,851
which seems to be elicited by 
psychedelic use.

856
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:29,190
The Sharman dissolve down past their 
bones and then they go up into heaven 

857
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:34,830
and speak with the ancestors,
and then they're introduced into the 

858
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,161
heavenly kingdom and then the flesh is 
put back on their bones and they come 

859
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:43,120
back and tell everybody what happened,
and that's a repeatable experience,

860
00:49:43,121 --> 00:49:48,121
right?
The shamanic tradition is unbelievably 

861
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:49,600
widespread,
so all over Europe,

862
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:54,660
ancient Europe and Asia,
and perhaps as far down as South 

863
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:54,660
America,
right?

864
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,681
It's highly conserved and it's out of 
that tradition in all likelihood that 

865
00:49:58,681 --> 00:50:03,361
are religious ideation and merged so and
you can see echoes of that here so,

866
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,870
so back to the story of Jacob and his 
ladder so that I can come again to my 

867
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:16,441
father's house in peace.
Then shall the Lord be my God and this 

868
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:19,621
stone,
which I've said for a pillar shall be 

869
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:19,621
God's house and of all that,
that thou shalt give me.

870
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:22,620
I will surely give the 10th on the.
So that's.

871
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,370
That's also an echo,
I would say,

872
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:29,371
of the obligation of those who climb the
power hierarchy hierarchy to attend to 

873
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:35,291
those who are at the bottom right.
Because if you think about the tithing 

874
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:38,270
as a form of wealth distribution,
which is essentially what it is,

875
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:44,130
the part of the ethic that defines the 
proper moral endeavor that's related to 

876
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:49,241
that center is not to advance yourself 
at the expense of the entire community.

877
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:56,080
So if you're,
if you're fortunate enough so that you 

878
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,711
can rise in authority and power and 
competence within the confines of a 

879
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:04,571
community,
you still have a obligation to maintain 

880
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:09,101
the structure,
maintain and further the structure of 

881
00:51:09,101 --> 00:51:09,590
the community within which you rose.
And that's obvious,

882
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:11,480
right?
Because if people didn't do that,

883
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:14,030
after a couple of generations,
the whole thing would fall apart.

884
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:15,260
So you know,
you,

885
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,510
you,
you,

886
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,930
it's not reasonable to destroy the game 
that you're winning.

887
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,900
It's reasonable to strengthen the game 
that you're winning.

888
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:29,380
And so that's another thing because that
also describes the ethic that should 

889
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,480
allow you to be an active member of the 
community around which,

890
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:36,110
that,
that gathers around that center.

891
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:37,250
So,
so,

892
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:41,150
so one of the things I've learned about 
the hero mythology that I really,

893
00:51:41,151 --> 00:51:46,151
really liked his.
So you see this pretty clearly in the 

894
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:49,301
figure of Christ,
but because two things are conjoined in 

895
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:52,220
in that story,
but Christ is also the here.

896
00:51:52,221 --> 00:51:57,221
There's two kinds of heroes.
Say there's the hero that goes out into 

897
00:51:57,221 --> 00:51:59,621
chaos and confronts the dragon of chaos 
and gathers the treasure as a 

898
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,210
consequence,
and then shares it with the community.

899
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:07,630
That's one.
The other form of hero is the hero who 

900
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:10,751
stands up against the corrupt state and 
rattles the foundation of the state,

901
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,640
has it collapsed,
and then reconstructs it,

902
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:13,940
right?

903
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,940
So because the two great dangers to 
human beings are an protected exposure 

904
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:23,420
to the catastrophes of the natural world
and subjugation to tyranny,

905
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,760
right?
Those are the two major dangers.

906
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:30,761
And so hero is the ultimate hero is the 
person who reconstructs the structure of

907
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:37,451
the state by using the information that 
he gathered by going out into the 

908
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:39,740
unknown that unites them both.
And so what that means,

909
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,600
here's the,
here's the rub as far as I can tell.

910
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:49,750
So a structure,
a center has to risks associated with 

911
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:55,061
it.
One is that it will degenerate into 

912
00:52:55,061 --> 00:52:57,191
chaos and the other is that will 
rigidified into tyranny and it'll 

913
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,680
degenerate into chaos even if it just 
stays doing what it's doing,

914
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,230
so if it just does exactly what it's 
doing and it doesn't change,

915
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:11,410
it will degenerate because things change
and if it doesn't change to keep up,

916
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:16,810
then it gets farther and farther away 
from the environment and it'll 

917
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:20,111
precipitously collapse and so and then 
if it just changes willy nilly so that 

918
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,840
nobody can establish a stable 
centralize,

919
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:28,410
a game that it into chaos immediately 
and no one can get along.

920
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,040
So there's a rule for being longing to 
the community and the rule has to be 

921
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:39,830
that you have to act in a manner that 
sustains and that sustains the community

922
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:45,531
and increases its competence.
That's the fundamental moral obligation 

923
00:53:45,531 --> 00:53:47,970
for belonging while an obviously so 
right,

924
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:52,971
because why would you belong to a.
Why would you walk into a club House 

925
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:54,750
that was on fire?
Like that's just not smart,

926
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:57,060
right?
If you're going to be part of the game,

927
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,480
if you've decided that being part of the
game is worthwhile,

928
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:05,630
you've also taken on the moral.
You've also decided even if you didn't 

929
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:11,271
notice it,
that you have to work to support that 

930
00:54:11,271 --> 00:54:11,370
game because by deciding to play that 
game,

931
00:54:11,371 --> 00:54:14,700
you said that it's valuable and if it's 
valuable,

932
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:18,990
then obviously you should work to 
sustain and expand it because that's the

933
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:23,991
definition of having a relationship with
something that's valuable and so that's 

934
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:29,091
the criteria for membership in the 
community and that's partly why.

935
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
If you regard the cross,
say as the symbol of voluntary 

936
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,120
suffering,
two suffering,

937
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:38,310
excepted voluntarily,
something like that,

938
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:44,060
which is means that there's another 
element of that too that's worth 

939
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,130
thinking about.
So you know,

940
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,160
the reason that cain gets so out of hand
is because he's suffering and he won't 

941
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,030
accept it.
He certainly won't accept responsibility

942
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:56,031
for it.
He's angry and bitter about it and no 

943
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:56,031
wonder,
right?

944
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:57,770
I mean we have to be realistic about 
these sorts of things there.

945
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,910
Your guys,
all of you people are going to suffer at

946
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:04,200
some point in your life to the point 
where you're angry and bitter about it.

947
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:09,201
I mean,
there's just absolutely no doubt about 

948
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:09,201
that and you're even going to think,
well,

949
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:11,040
it's no bloody wonder that I'm angry and
bitter about it.

950
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:16,020
Everyone would be and things are so god 
awful that there's no excuse for them to

951
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:20,190
even exist,
and that's a powerful argument.

952
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:23,490
Although I think it's ultimately self 
defeating.

953
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:28,730
Well,
that's kind of what the story of Cain 

954
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,201
and Abel,
that's kind of what the story of Cain 

955
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:30,600
and Abel.
What would you say?

956
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,630
That's the moral of the story of Cain 
and Abel essentially.

957
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:41,510
So what that means instead is that even 
under those conditions of relatively 

958
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:45,111
intense suffering,
you have to accept it voluntarily 

959
00:55:45,111 --> 00:55:47,931
because otherwise it turns you against 
being and then you start to act in this 

960
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,400
terrible manner that makes everything 
worse.

961
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,070
And it seems to me that there's a 
contradiction in that if,

962
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,950
if the reason you're complaining is that
things are bad,

963
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,510
then it isn't reasonable for you to act 
in a manner that makes them worse.

964
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,010
Right.
I mean,

965
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,440
even if it's no wonder that people do 
that,

966
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:07,590
but it's degenerating game and so 
that's,

967
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,280
so the idea,
part of the idea of the cross and the 

968
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,700
suffering that it represents is that if 
you could accept that voluntarily,

969
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,910
regardless of its intensity,
then you won't become embittered and 

970
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:28,621
resentful and vengeful to the point 
where you pose a danger to the stability

971
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:30,840
of the community.
So,

972
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,490
or to your own stability for that matter
because it's,

973
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,260
you know,
it might be your own stability,

974
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:40,261
the stability of your family,
the stability of the community and the 

975
00:56:40,261 --> 00:56:40,390
stability of the world.
It might be all of that.

976
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,120
And increasingly I think it is all of 
that.

977
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,050
So.

978
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,580
Okay,
so now Jacob,

979
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:53,170
we get the second part of Jacob's story.

980
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:03,060
He goes to meet his uncle laband and he 
meets Rachel there again by a well.

981
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,330
He falls in love and goes to live with 
Lebanon.

982
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,090
There are two daughters there,
Leah,

983
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,600
as well as Rachel.
Leah is not a particularly attractive 

984
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,440
person.
It isn't exactly clear why,

985
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:22,441
but the story makes it quite clear.
She's definitely the least desirable of 

986
00:57:22,441 --> 00:57:26,470
the two daughters and the story makes 
reference to her eyes and it isn't clear

987
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:31,471
if there's something wrong with her 
physiologically or if there's something 

988
00:57:31,471 --> 00:57:34,051
wrong with her attitude.
It's not obvious but doesn't really 

989
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:37,051
matter.
The point is she's the older daughter 

990
00:57:37,051 --> 00:57:39,220
but she's the less desirable one.
Jacob stays a month,

991
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,690
which is the limit of hospitality in in 
that time,

992
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,900
if you stayed for a month,
you were welcomed but you had to work 

993
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:48,900
for your keep.
I think after about three days,

994
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:53,761
something like that,
which seems rather reasonable and so he 

995
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:57,370
stays a month and then he has a chat 
with Le and he says he's.

996
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,980
He's fallen in love with Rachel by this 
time and he says,

997
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,150
I'll stay with you and work for seven 
years.

998
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:09,151
And then all we had Rachel and Liban 
says that's fine deal,

999
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,520
and then the seven years passes and 
there's a wedding ceremony.

1000
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:17,440
It's quite a long thing and the bride is
veiled and

1001
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:27,220
the bride goes into the tent with,
with Jacob and if I remember the story 

1002
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,881
correctly,
I haven't looked at it for a month or 

1003
00:58:31,881 --> 00:58:34,041
so.
Rachel is outside the tent speaking,

1004
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:40,730
but Leah is inside the tent and so Jacob
thinks he's getting married to Rachel,

1005
00:58:41,491 --> 00:58:44,670
but he's actually getting married to 
Leah and this is,

1006
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:49,810
it's an inversion a because he's in the 
dark like Isaac was when he fooled 

1007
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:54,201
Isaac,
so now it's jacobs turned to be in the 

1008
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:56,901
dark and he gets betrayed by his uncle 
and his bride to be Rachel and her 

1009
00:58:58,111 --> 00:59:03,111
sister in a manner that's broadly 
parallel to the trick that he pulled on 

1010
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:08,450
Esol.
And so there's a Karma notion there 

1011
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:08,450
which I,
which I'd like,

1012
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:08,850
you know,
I mean,

1013
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:13,380
you might think of Karma as a 
superstitious idea,

1014
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:18,780
but.
And there are ways of interpreting it 

1015
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,820
that might make it the case,
but I don't think that's what it is.

1016
00:59:20,821 --> 00:59:25,310
It's no bad deed goes unpunished at 
something like that.

1017
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:34,610
You know,
maybe you've done something bad to 

1018
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,501
someone and therefore there's part of 
you that feels quite guilty about that 

1019
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:40,910
hopefully,
and that part is looking for punishment 

1020
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,680
to set the stage.
Right,

1021
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,510
and you might think,
well no,

1022
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,890
but things are yes,
unless you're a psychopath.

1023
00:59:49,891 --> 00:59:54,891
That's how things work.
If you're interested in that kind of 

1024
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,621
thing,
you should read Dostoyevsky's crime and 

1025
00:59:57,621 --> 00:59:57,720
punishment because it's the definitive 
study of that sort of phenomena.

1026
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,460
Right?
Because in that book,

1027
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,760
the main protagonists risk,
all cough gets away with murder,

1028
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:07,790
like he does it successfully.
No one suspects him and he drives 

1029
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:12,231
himself so crazy with guilt that he 
basically falls into the hands of the 

1030
01:00:12,631 --> 01:00:17,631
police.
He drives himself into the hands of the 

1031
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:17,631
police because he can't tolerate what he
did.

1032
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,050
It's very,
it's amazing.

1033
01:00:19,051 --> 01:00:20,820
It's an amazing book.
But anyways,

1034
01:00:20,821 --> 01:00:25,821
the point is here Jacob falls prey to 
the same sort of crookedness that he 

1035
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:33,440
used to ratchet himself up the ladder 
and that happens far more often in life 

1036
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:35,280
than people think.

1037
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:38,170
And it's really not like he can complain
about it right now.

1038
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:40,110
If he has any sense.
It's like he does.

1039
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:44,040
He brings Leah out to see Lebaron and he
says,

1040
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,580
what's,
what's with this sister?

1041
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:52,710
You know,
and Lebaron basically says to him in our

1042
01:00:52,711 --> 01:00:57,711
culture,
it's the custom to marry the eldest 

1043
01:00:57,711 --> 01:00:59,100
daughter first,
which is exactly right.

1044
01:00:59,101 --> 01:00:59,730
And he said,
well,

1045
01:00:59,731 --> 01:01:00,780
it would bring,
you know,

1046
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:05,890
he's rationalizing obviously because 
he's just screwed over Jacob in a major 

1047
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:09,390
way,
but it's a little late to take it back.

1048
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,860
The marriage has been consummated and 
the ceremony has been complete and all 

1049
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:19,551
hell would break out if there was any 
attempt to sever the relationships.

1050
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:24,671
So that's how it is.
So Leah's married and Jacob has the 

1051
01:01:26,011 --> 01:01:28,230
wrong wife.
So then,

1052
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,560
so this is Jacob area,
you see on the left,

1053
01:01:31,561 --> 01:01:36,090
he's got the little flowery hat and he's
pointing to Leah and he's saying like,

1054
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,710
what?
What's up here?

1055
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,600
And loved the band.
The band is coupled goat and he's not 

1056
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,930
really all that sad about it.
In fact,

1057
01:01:48,931 --> 01:01:51,400
you can imagine that he's going to go 
so,

1058
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:58,640
so okay.
Then he asked to work another seven 

1059
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:58,640
years,

1060
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:03,310
any gains Rachel,
but because God is a tricky character,

1061
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:09,520
there was another twist in this story.
Rachel turns out not to be very good at 

1062
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:14,410
having children or Rachel and Jacob 
turned out not to be very good in having

1063
01:02:14,411 --> 01:02:15,820
children,
but Leah,

1064
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:21,750
she's really good at having kids,
so she provides Jacob with Reuben,

1065
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:25,290
simeon,
Levi,

1066
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,570
Levi,
believe and Judah,

1067
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,110
and the names of those meanings of those
names are there.

1068
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:34,600
Reuben means see a son.
Simeon means hearing that.

1069
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,510
I think that was the Lord heard my 
prayer.

1070
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:39,440
I think that's what that was a Levi 
means joined.

1071
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,070
Judah means praise to yeah,
Yahuah,

1072
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:46,660
um,
and it's Judah from WHO's tried Christ 

1073
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,481
arises.
Judah is essentially promoted to the 

1074
01:02:50,481 --> 01:02:50,520
status of first born.
Later in the story.

1075
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:55,670
This is important because Ruben,
simeon and Levy all do something 

1076
01:02:56,281 --> 01:02:59,100
reprehensible.
And so Judah gets,

1077
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:04,790
gets promoted to firstborn.
And that's partly why in the logic of 

1078
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:09,450
the narrative that it's from the tribe 
of Judah that Christ arises.

1079
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,580
So,
so now while this is going on,

1080
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:17,340
Rachel is like suicidally desperate for 
children's.

1081
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:21,360
She's jealous of her older sister who's 
rather ill favored as we pointed out,

1082
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:26,361
but who seems to be damn good at 
producing sons and she's really not 

1083
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:32,061
happy with Jacob.
And so she chose him out and Jacob 

1084
01:03:32,061 --> 01:03:32,190
basically says like,
what do you want me to do about it?

1085
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:35,160
I'm not gone,
which is a reasonable response,

1086
01:03:35,161 --> 01:03:38,880
I would say.
And so in her desperation,

1087
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:42,270
she gives Jacob Bella,
who's her maid servant.

1088
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,340
We've seen that sort of thing happened 
before.

1089
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:50,450
And to bill up produces two children,
Dan and NAF telly.

1090
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:54,390
I'm the reason I'm detaining out all 
these sons.

1091
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:59,420
It's important because Jacob is the 
founder of Israel and his sons are the 

1092
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:04,560
founder of the 12 tribes.
So it's a pivotal moment in the story,

1093
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:05,970
right?
It's because he's the,

1094
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:11,030
he's the fundamental patriarch of,
of those who wrestle with God because as

1095
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:13,620
we'll see,
that's what the name Israel means.

1096
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,590
He gets the name Israel.
You'll see why in a while.

1097
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,600
But,
but it's in the,

1098
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:23,620
you need to know these genealogies in 
this situation because they play an 

1099
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,530
important role in everything that 
happens afterwards.

1100
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:30,690
So Nafta,
Lee is the second,

1101
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:36,140
uh,
and her name or his name means with 

1102
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:36,360
great wrestling's.
I've wrestled with my sister,

1103
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,860
right,
contended with her,

1104
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:42,960
and have prevailed.
So that gives you some indication of the

1105
01:04:42,961 --> 01:04:47,700
tension in the household.
Now Leah is now past bearing children.

1106
01:04:47,701 --> 01:04:52,701
She gives Jake Jacob,
her maid servant to Silpada to keep up 

1107
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:54,360
with her sister,
I guess.

1108
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:59,780
And uh,
now Zilpah bears to children for Jacob.

1109
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:03,810
So he's piling up the kids left right 
and center here.

1110
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:09,160
I'm one of them is named Gad,
good fortune and the other is named 

1111
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:09,780
Asher,
happy or blessed.

1112
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:14,520
So there's more rivalry going on between
the sisters.

1113
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:16,710
This is quite an interesting little 
story.

1114
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,650
So Ruben,

1115
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,870
who's Leah's daughter,
goes out and looks for mandrakes.

1116
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,560
Now mandrakes have aphrodisiac 
properties,

1117
01:05:25,561 --> 01:05:29,080
so that's a little odd to begin with,
but it doesn't matter.

1118
01:05:29,081 --> 01:05:34,081
That's what happens.
And Rachel is Rachel wants the mandrakes

1119
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:38,380
because she's still interested in having
some children.

1120
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:43,381
And so she bargains with Leah to give 
her a night with Jacob in exchange for 

1121
01:05:43,381 --> 01:05:48,181
the mandrakes and sons emerge as a 
consequence of that.

1122
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,660
So.
And Rachel find the gifts.

1123
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:57,661
Birth Joseph and Joseph plays a key role
in the last story in Genesis,

1124
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:02,980
which I hope we'll get to in the next 
lecture.

1125
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:06,370
And then we can close off genesis.
That's the plan anyways,

1126
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:12,150
so now Jacob isn't really very happy 
about the whole arrangement because he.

1127
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,490
He's been there 14 years and he's got 
two wives.

1128
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:16,830
It's not too bad,
but he,

1129
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,840
you know,
he got he the bargain wasn't exactly 

1130
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:21,840
clean.
He doesn't really trust law,

1131
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,160
Bannon,
and there's no reason for him to do so.

1132
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:31,210
Lebanon was poor before Jacob came.
Jacob turns out to be a very useful 

1133
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:36,480
person to have around and so he tells 
labounty he wants to leave and go back 

1134
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,090
to his home country and that he'll take 
the speckled and spotted cattle,

1135
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:43,720
the brown sheep and the spotted and 
speckled goats from the flock,

1136
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:46,120
and they're in the minority.
So that's the idea.

1137
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:50,980
And so la ban or lab and takes all those
animals out of his flock.

1138
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:56,220
So the.
There was an idea that the speckled 

1139
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:56,470
goats and the brown sheep would breed 
true.

1140
01:06:56,530 --> 01:07:01,530
So if you have two male goat and a 
female goat and they're both speckled,

1141
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:04,180
they'll have speckled kits.
That's the theory.

1142
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:07,480
And the same with brown sheep.
And so what [inaudible] does is he takes

1143
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:11,140
all the speckled animals out of the 
flocks,

1144
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,470
gives them to his son,
and they go three days away with them so

1145
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:17,710
that Jacob is left with the flock,
but with no,

1146
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,270
with none of these animals.

1147
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:22,360
Now the idea was that all the newborns,
we're going to be his.

1148
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:26,900
And so what Liban is basically done is 
set it up so that in principle I'm,

1149
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,470
Jacob is going to get nothing for his 
work.

1150
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:34,750
So that's another time when Jacob 
experiences betrayal,

1151
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:40,260
you know,
it's almost as if God isn't done with 

1152
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,320
reminding him of the magnitude of what 
he did in the past,

1153
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:44,350
that that's the moral of the story in 
some sense.

1154
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,560
Now,
there's a weird little twist in the 

1155
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,511
story here.
So what Jacob does is some sympathetic 

1156
01:07:51,511 --> 01:07:52,570
magic.
And so when the animals are rotting,

1157
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,360
he puts speckled objects in front of 
them,

1158
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:57,040
speckled branches,
and so forth,

1159
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,130
I guess to remind them about what 
they're supposed to be producing,

1160
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,320
something like that.
And it works.

1161
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:05,410
And so all these animals that live band 
left are,

1162
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:06,370
are,
uh,

1163
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:10,080
producing spotted animals like mad.
And so that's,

1164
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:15,300
I guess God's changed his mind and let 
Jacob off the hook slightly here.

1165
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,220
So

1166
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:20,860
Sooni was very wealthy,
much cattle maid servants,

1167
01:08:20,861 --> 01:08:21,470
men,
servants,

1168
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:23,600
Campbell's analysis,
laband son,

1169
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,510
sons become jealous.
And laband is outraged.

1170
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:27,000
Well,
you know,

1171
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:30,020
obviously there's some competition there
between Jacob and the sons,

1172
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:35,021
which is hardly surprising.
And the band played this trick to strip 

1173
01:08:35,021 --> 01:08:37,490
Jacob of all his property and instead he
got far more than he was going to get to

1174
01:08:37,491 --> 01:08:42,491
begin with.
So you can imagine that spit a bit 

1175
01:08:42,491 --> 01:08:44,650
annoying.
So Jacob thinks he better get out of 

1176
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:45,890
there.
So we tell Rachel and Leah and said unto

1177
01:08:45,891 --> 01:08:50,891
them,
I see your father's countenance that 

1178
01:08:50,891 --> 01:08:53,021
it's not toward me as before,
but the god of my father has been with 

1179
01:08:53,021 --> 01:08:53,660
me and you know,
with all my power,

1180
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:58,661
I've served your father and your father 
is deceived me and changed my wages 10 

1181
01:08:58,661 --> 01:09:02,561
times.
But God so far has suffered him not to 

1182
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:05,381
hurt me if he said,
thus the speckled shall be thy wages 

1183
01:09:05,381 --> 01:09:06,800
than all the cattle bore speckled.

1184
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:12,010
And if he said,
thus the ring straight shall be thy 

1185
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:12,020
higher than all the cattle board ring 
straight,

1186
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:17,260
thus God has taken away the cattle of 
your father and given them to me and 

1187
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:21,170
they decided to sneak away and they're 
unhappy with the inheritance.

1188
01:09:21,171 --> 01:09:23,930
That lack of inheritance from labatt.
So as they sneak away,

1189
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:29,170
Rachel steals the idols that her father 
has in his house and it's not exactly 

1190
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:34,541
obvious why.
There's a lot of contention about why 

1191
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:37,451
she's doing that.
Some of them is to punish him to bring 

1192
01:09:37,451 --> 01:09:38,480
with her the images of her ancestors.
You know,

1193
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:42,860
maybe she's loaned some moving away from
home just out of spite to show them that

1194
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:47,861
the idols were actually powerless for 
protection to stop her father from 

1195
01:09:47,861 --> 01:09:52,751
dividing the root of their escape.
That last one is the strangest one 

1196
01:09:52,751 --> 01:09:56,201
because the idea would be that the ban 
would have used some sort of ritual with

1197
01:09:57,321 --> 01:10:02,321
the idols that would help them infer 
their escape route and men could chase 

1198
01:10:02,321 --> 01:10:02,321
them.

1199
01:10:02,321 --> 01:10:06,310
So anyways,
that's the range of speculation about 

1200
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:06,310
that.
I think.

1201
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:09,910
It sounds to me mostly like a little act
of revenge maybe with a bit of 

1202
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:14,600
loneliness mixed in Lebaron pursues 
them,

1203
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,650
but God comes into dream to tell him to 
leave Jacob unharmed.

1204
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,760
Lavonne catches up with them and 
reproaches Jacob saying that he would 

1205
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,731
have thrown a great party if he would 
have known that they were going to 

1206
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:27,731
leave,
you know,

1207
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:32,640
he didn't want them to sneak away in the
night and eat a can't tell from the 

1208
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,050
story whether that's true or not.
And you know,

1209
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:36,890
these people were pretty rough and 
impulsive I would say.

1210
01:10:36,891 --> 01:10:41,891
And maybe there was a 50 percent chance 
of a slaughter and a 50 percent chance 

1211
01:10:41,891 --> 01:10:42,380
of a party.
Who knows.

1212
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:47,440
I've been to parties like that actually.
So laband complains that his gods are 

1213
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:51,530
gone and Jacob says that whoever has 
them,

1214
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:56,531
he will have them killed.
And Rachel who's really quite a sneaky 

1215
01:10:56,531 --> 01:11:00,701
character,
all things consider basically claims 

1216
01:11:00,701 --> 01:11:04,331
that she's having her period and she's 
sitting on the carpet with all the idols

1217
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:10,511
underneath and she can't move.
And so they search everywhere and can't 

1218
01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:13,481
find them.
And she's like laughing away behind her 

1219
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:14,070
hand about that sneaky little maneuver,
but

1220
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,750
she,
she doesn't die.

1221
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:20,280
So that's probably a good thing.
So the laband,

1222
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,650
she checks everything out,
checks the camp out,

1223
01:11:22,651 --> 01:11:25,290
and he can't find anything.
So they reconcile.

1224
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:29,990
And so that's the first reconciliation 
that Jacob engages in.

1225
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,930
It's sort of like

1226
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:32,480
the,

1227
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:39,420
what would you say the Karmic debt has 
been paid.

1228
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,480
That's one way of thinking about it.
That's so he got punished for his 

1229
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,580
wrongdoing.
He's learned his lesson perhaps.

1230
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:50,010
And it's,
it's,

1231
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,740
that's good enough as far as he's 
concerned,

1232
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:57,770
you know,
he got away good enough and they make 

1233
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:00,051
peace.
So then the next thing that happens as 

1234
01:12:02,091 --> 01:12:06,020
they're traveling is that Jacob was left
alone and there wrestled a man,

1235
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:08,990
man,
Angel God.

1236
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:14,200
It's not clear.
We'll go with angel with him until the 

1237
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:20,211
breaking of the day or God.
And when he saw that he prevailed not 

1238
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:23,631
against him.
He touched the hollow of his thigh in 

1239
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:23,631
the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of 
joint.

1240
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:26,070
As he wrestled with him and he said,
let me go for the day breaks.

1241
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:31,460
And Jacob said,
I will not let you go unless you bless 

1242
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:31,460
me.
And the Angel said unto him,

1243
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,240
what is the name?
And Jacob said,

1244
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:33,990
Jacob,

1245
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,240
and the Angel said,
thy name shall no more be called Jacob 

1246
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:50,240
supplanter,
right?

1247
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:55,181
The overthrow thrower with that kind of 
intonation of or implication of 

1248
01:12:55,681 --> 01:13:00,681
crookedness but Israel,
which means he who wrestles or strive 

1249
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:04,831
successfully with God for as a prince,
hast thou power with God and with men 

1250
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:07,710
and have prevailed.
That's quite a story.

1251
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,160
Like I don't know exactly what to make 
of it.

1252
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:14,280
There's obviously a symbolic level of 
meaning,

1253
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:19,281
which is that that is what human beings 
do in some senses they they wrestle.

1254
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:25,010
I would say they wrestle with the divine
even with the concept of the divine for 

1255
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,220
that matter.
And

1256
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:30,950
but the question is,
do they prevail?

1257
01:13:30,951 --> 01:13:35,480
Like it's of odd thing that Jacob 
actually seems to win this battle,

1258
01:13:35,481 --> 01:13:40,481
right?
Or at least he wins it enough so that 

1259
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:42,050
whoever he's wrestling this divine 
figure that he's wrestling is willing to

1260
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:47,051
bestow a blessing on them.
I guess maybe that's a testament to his 

1261
01:13:47,051 --> 01:13:47,180
courage.
It's something like that.

1262
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:52,390
Maybe it's an indication that he has 
paid for his sin sufficiently so that he

1263
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:55,470
sort of back on the moral high ground,
but,

1264
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:01,300
but I think it's really telling that the
transformation of the name from Jacob 

1265
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:06,340
Israel and what Israel means is he who 
wrestles with God or who struggles with 

1266
01:14:06,831 --> 01:14:11,831
God and perhaps successfully,
but it's also so interesting that 

1267
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:12,820
actually emerges victorious.

1268
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,940
You wouldn't necessarily think that that
would be a possibility,

1269
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:20,941
especially given you know,
God's rather hot headed nature in the 

1270
01:14:20,941 --> 01:14:24,811
Old Testament.
You don't want to mess with him too 

1271
01:14:24,811 --> 01:14:24,811
much,
but.

1272
01:14:24,811 --> 01:14:28,500
But Jacob does it successfully,
but even more importantly is the idea 

1273
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,330
that whatever Israel constitutes,
which would be the say,

1274
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:36,331
the land that Jacob found is actually 
composed of those who wrestle with God.

1275
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:42,690
I think that's an amazing idea because 
it also seems to me to shed some light 

1276
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:47,050
on perhaps what was meant by belief in 
those days.

1277
01:14:47,051 --> 01:14:52,051
You know,
like I've often thought of rep of 

1278
01:14:52,051 --> 01:14:52,051
marriage as a wrestling match,
right?

1279
01:14:52,051 --> 01:14:53,290
If you're lucky,
the person that you marry,

1280
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:56,020
someone you contend with,
it's not exactly.

1281
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:59,140
I don't think it's exactly.
It's not tranquil.

1282
01:14:59,141 --> 01:15:01,420
Precisely,
you know,

1283
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,720
you might have noticed that some of you 
and,

1284
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:09,810
but,
but the thing is if you have something 

1285
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:11,641
to contend against,
then that strengthens you and that's 

1286
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:14,590
actually better than having nothing to 
contend against.

1287
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:19,590
And so Jacob is the person who's also 
strengthened by the necessity of this 

1288
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:25,711
contending and that seems to be the 
proper relationship with God or the 

1289
01:15:25,711 --> 01:15:28,630
angel is that contending the battling,
right?

1290
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:33,990
Rather than some sort of kind of loose,
weak statement of belief.

1291
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:41,210
I mean,
I'm not trying to denigrate that to any 

1292
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:43,291
great degree.
It just doesn't seem like the right 

1293
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:43,291
motive conceptualization,
right?

1294
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:47,461
Because human beings aren't,
aren't like that were were contentious 

1295
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:51,760
creatures and that's actually seems to 
be something that meets with God's favor

1296
01:15:51,761 --> 01:15:54,940
in this situation.
So especially given that that's actually

1297
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:59,941
what he names the while the whole 
kingdom of the chosen people is the idea

1298
01:16:00,151 --> 01:16:03,760
is that that's composed of those who 
contend with God.

1299
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:07,720
So that's a hell of an idea that that's 
for sure.

1300
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:10,700
And Jacob ask

1301
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,560
him and said,
tell me I pray thee thy name.

1302
01:16:14,561 --> 01:16:16,480
And he said,
we're force it though.

1303
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,600
Dos Ask after by name.
So there's no that's not happening,

1304
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:24,810
and he blessed him there and Jacob 
called the place of the name of the 

1305
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:27,961
place.
Peniel for I or Peniel for I have seen 

1306
01:16:27,961 --> 01:16:30,580
God face to face in my life is preserved
and passed over denial.

1307
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:32,980
The Sun rose upon him and he halted upon
his thigh.

1308
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:38,190
Now Jacob does walk away injured from 
this right?

1309
01:16:38,831 --> 01:16:43,510
So he has a permanent limp after that.
And so that's also an indication of just

1310
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:45,820
how dangerous that contention actually 
is.

1311
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,590
Like he gets blast,
he wins,

1312
01:16:47,591 --> 01:16:52,540
but he doesn't get away Scot free.
And so now.

1313
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:57,810
So Jacob goes back to East Esau and he's
terrified even though it's been 14 

1314
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:00,130
years,
he thinks maybe his heart headed brother

1315
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:05,131
hasn't calmed down yet and he has good 
reason to think that I would say so.

1316
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:09,560
He sends messengers,
Esau,

1317
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:10,250
who then sets

1318
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:15,250
out with 400 men and so Jacob is not 
very happy with this whole idea and he 

1319
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,920
breaks his people into two bands so that
maybe half of them can not be killed.

1320
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,520
And then he takes from his large flocks,
a bunch of animals and a bunch of 

1321
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,720
servants.
And He sends them out to me that you saw

1322
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,790
basically to say,
look,

1323
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,800
I'm,
I'm a jerk and sorry about the whole 

1324
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,860
birthright thing and,
and here's some animals and you know,

1325
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:40,880
maybe maybe that's the beginnings of,
of an apology.

1326
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:42,830
It's something like that.
And so,

1327
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:46,550
but he's not very convinced that that's 
actually going to work.

1328
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:52,300
But Esau who actually turns out to 
perhaps have matured in the interim,

1329
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,530
perhaps that's one way of thinking about
it,

1330
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:59,030
meets Jacob and says that just seeing 
him is enough.

1331
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:04,300
But Jacob insists that he takes the gift
and Esl accepts and which is probably a 

1332
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:10,571
wise thing because even if Esau is 95 
percent convinced that just seeing his 

1333
01:18:11,451 --> 01:18:16,451
brother is enough,
there's probably five percent of them 

1334
01:18:16,451 --> 01:18:16,451
that's still really not all that happy.

1335
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,590
And so you have to be careful,
you know,

1336
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:23,640
when you say that you forgive someone 
because there might be a part of you 

1337
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:27,791
that really doesn't,
that really needs something else before 

1338
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:27,791
you can actually say,
okay,

1339
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,030
look,
fight.

1340
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:34,570
You know,
and you don't want to fool yourself 

1341
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:36,011
about that because that five percent 
that hasn't been completely convinced 

1342
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:40,481
will find its voice at some point and 
then maybe undermine the whole 

1343
01:18:40,481 --> 01:18:44,500
reconciliation process.
So you don't want to think that you're 

1344
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,050
any better than you are any nicer than 
you are.

1345
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:48,410
It's not helpful.
And so Esau is smart.

1346
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:52,100
I think so while Jacob smart to say no,
no like thanks a lot,

1347
01:18:52,101 --> 01:18:57,101
but take the damn goats and Jacob and 
Esau is smart enough to accept that and 

1348
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:05,051
he might do that maybe to you know,
to please Jacob.

1349
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:10,320
But also I think so that there really is
the possibility of establishing peace 

1350
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,800
because hypothetically the gift that's 
being offered is of sufficient magnitude

1351
01:19:14,801 --> 01:19:18,970
to erase the debt of the loss of the 
birthright at something like that.

1352
01:19:18,971 --> 01:19:19,390
Right?
It's,

1353
01:19:19,391 --> 01:19:19,970
it's,
it's,

1354
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,930
it's,
it's the payment of the real debt.

1355
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:29,340
And Esau said,
what Mina style by all this drove which 

1356
01:19:30,191 --> 01:19:35,191
I met and Jacob said,
these are to find grace in the sight of 

1357
01:19:35,191 --> 01:19:35,890
my Lord,
and Esau says,

1358
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:37,720
I have enough brother.
Keep Thou,

1359
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:40,060
keep that,
that thou hast unto myself.

1360
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:50,180
And Jacob said,
this is interesting statement,

1361
01:19:50,181 --> 01:19:51,090
I think,
no,

1362
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:56,110
I pray you.
If if I have now found grace in thy 

1363
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:58,741
sight,
take the president at my hand for 

1364
01:19:58,741 --> 01:20:02,471
therefore I have seen my face as though 
I had seen the face of God and now it 

1365
01:20:02,471 --> 01:20:04,670
was pleased with me and so that's so 
he's.

1366
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,880
He's taking the honorable judgment of 
his brother because it is honorable 

1367
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:15,201
because Esau did get betrayed,
so he has a right to be standing in 

1368
01:20:15,201 --> 01:20:19,491
judgment and he equates that judgment 
with with what would you say,

1369
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:26,001
with the highest virtues.
It's appropriate judgment and so he 

1370
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:30,261
wants to make complete amends to Esau as
if Esau as a representative of the 

1371
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:34,290
divine element of justice.
And

1372
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,320
I guess that's convincing to Esl.
It's quite a thing to say,

1373
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:44,860
you know,
that I need to be reconciled to you 

1374
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:44,860
because that would simultaneously 
reconciled with God.

1375
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:47,870
It's like it's crucial.
This is between us,

1376
01:20:47,871 --> 01:20:52,871
but it's.
There's a higher principle at stake 

1377
01:20:52,871 --> 01:20:53,030
that's vital and I think that is the 
case with betrayal.

1378
01:20:53,031 --> 01:20:55,910
That's very frequently the case because 
if you betray someone,

1379
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:59,180
you really have violated,
you've deeply violated.

1380
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:03,200
What can only be called a sacred trust.
It's the right terminology for that.

1381
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:08,560
Take it.
I pray the blessing that is brought to 

1382
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,820
the because God has dealt graciously 
with me and because I have enough and he

1383
01:21:10,821 --> 01:21:14,600
urged him and he took it.
So you know,

1384
01:21:14,601 --> 01:21:17,900
the story seems to be something like,
well,

1385
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:22,880
Jacob was kind of an arrogant,
crooked,

1386
01:21:22,881 --> 01:21:27,881
deceitful character,
maybe over impressed with his own 

1387
01:21:27,881 --> 01:21:28,910
ability.
He thought it was pretty amusing to pull

1388
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:32,990
a fast trick or two on his brother.
Then he ran off,

1389
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:38,020
which is not all that brave.
And then he got wall up a lot and 

1390
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:40,790
perhaps learn something.
And then when he came back,

1391
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:42,170
you know,
he was a different person.

1392
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:47,650
And so that's,
that's a reasonable story.

1393
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,920
And you know,
he,

1394
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,610
he has to repent completely of

1395
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:59,200
about what he did before he can rectify 
the situation properly.

1396
01:21:59,201 --> 01:22:04,201
And he's willing to do that.
So that's an interesting idea too 

1397
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:04,850
because it's,
it's,

1398
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:08,410
it's the early reflection of the idea 
that it is,

1399
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:12,910
if you do something wrong in the past,
a that you can learn from it,

1400
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:18,090
right?
So that you're actually capable of 

1401
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:18,090
learning.
And B,

1402
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:20,050
that you can set the balance right in 
the present.

1403
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,450
Those are very optimistic ideas,
you know,

1404
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:24,220
because you might say,
well,

1405
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,470
once you've committed some sort of 
crime,

1406
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:28,390
that's it.
There's no hope for you,

1407
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:33,391
but that's pretty rough because the 
probability that you've done unethical 

1408
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:35,710
things at some point in your life is a 
hundred percent.

1409
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:41,010
And so if there was no way of setting 
the balance right after that,

1410
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,990
then everybody would be.
And so,

1411
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:50,590
so then the story gets rough again.
Jacob settles in.

1412
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:55,591
Sholom sholom.
Diana has daughter goes looking around 

1413
01:22:55,591 --> 01:22:56,740
for France,
Czech,

1414
01:22:56,741 --> 01:22:58,660
I'm the son of Hamor,
lays with her.

1415
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:04,490
And then once her for his wife,
he actually has the order reversed 

1416
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:04,490
there.
That turns out to be a problem.

1417
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:09,900
Jacob hears of this,
the fathers talk and so they make an 

1418
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,670
agreement.
The agreement is,

1419
01:23:12,671 --> 01:23:17,671
is that if all of hammers,
men including hammer and his son are 

1420
01:23:17,671 --> 01:23:20,230
circumcised.
So that's the proper offering,

1421
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:24,300
I guess that brings them into the 
familial fold and indicates that they're

1422
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:28,760
willing to make a sacrifice to do so.
Especially after you know,

1423
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:33,470
check and put the cart before the horse.
Let's say the man of Hammer,

1424
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:35,410
circumcised,
they agree to do so.

1425
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:40,620
That turns out to be a big mistake,
so while they're laying around the next 

1426
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,340
day,
suffering Madley from the circumcision,

1427
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:48,510
simeon and Levi come in and they sneak 
in and kill all of them and take their 

1428
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:50,770
wealth and their women and children.
That's rough.

1429
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,090
It's rough.

1430
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,610
Yeah.
I guess you guys noticed that a so,

1431
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,410
so their honor societies,
right?

1432
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:07,730
There's still lots of honor societies in
the world and so they don't take kindly 

1433
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:08,950
to what happened to their,
to their sister,

1434
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:14,370
although they don't kill her,
so now it turns out that,

1435
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:16,830
yeah,
it says,

1436
01:24:16,831 --> 01:24:19,360
as it came to pass on the third day when
they were sore,

1437
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:22,000
the two of the sons of Jacob,
simeon and Levi,

1438
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:27,430
Diana's brother and took each man his 
sword and came upon the city boldly and 

1439
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:29,110
slew all the males and they slew hammer 
and check them.

1440
01:24:29,111 --> 01:24:34,111
His son with the edge of the sword and 
took dine out of Shechem's house and 

1441
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:37,981
went out.
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain 

1442
01:24:37,981 --> 01:24:38,860
and spoiled the city because they had 
defiled their sister.

1443
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:45,140
It took the sheep and the oxen and the 
assets and that which was in the city 

1444
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:48,361
and that was which was in the field and 
all their wealth and all their little 

1445
01:24:48,361 --> 01:24:51,070
ones and their wives took vacate,
captive and spoiled everything else that

1446
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:56,071
was in the House and Jacob actually 
turns out not to be very happy about 

1447
01:24:56,071 --> 01:25:00,031
that because he'd met with hammer and 
they hammered out a deal and that and 

1448
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:02,920
that's where they were living and so he 
figured,

1449
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:05,860
well that he was making the best of a 
bad lot,

1450
01:25:05,861 --> 01:25:10,861
let's say,
and his sons went behind his back and 

1451
01:25:10,861 --> 01:25:14,080
Jacob says to Simeon and Levi,
you have troubled me to make me,

1452
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:16,630
to make me stink among the inhabitants 
of the land,

1453
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:20,350
among the Canaanites and the parasites 
and I being few in number.

1454
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:25,680
They shall gather themselves now 
together against me and slay me and I 

1455
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,940
shall be destroyed.
I had my house and they said,

1456
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,850
should he deal with our sister as with a
harlot?

1457
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:38,570
And God said Unto Jacob,
and this is where we get back to the 

1458
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:39,010
idea of the center.
God says to Jacob,

1459
01:25:39,011 --> 01:25:40,210
arise,
go to Bethel.

1460
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,080
And dwell there.
So Bethel was where Jacob had originally

1461
01:25:44,081 --> 01:25:46,660
put that pillar.
So now it's back.

1462
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:47,870
So it's.
It's,

1463
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,750
it's a real hero's journey,
right?

1464
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:54,751
There's,
there's the place that he has a set 

1465
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:55,720
place.
He goes out and has these adventures and

1466
01:25:55,810 --> 01:26:00,580
and undergoes a moral transformation 
reconciles and then he comes back to the

1467
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:05,581
same place,
right as a transformed person that's a 

1468
01:26:05,581 --> 01:26:06,110
full hero's cycle.
Arise,

1469
01:26:06,111 --> 01:26:08,650
go to Bethel and dwell there and make an
hour there.

1470
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:12,740
An Altar unto God that appeared to the 
Windale fled is from the face of Esau.

1471
01:26:12,741 --> 01:26:17,741
Die Brother and Jacob said to his 
household and to all that were with 

1472
01:26:17,741 --> 01:26:19,280
them,
put away the strange gods that are among

1473
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:24,281
you and be clean and change your 
garments and let us arise and go up to 

1474
01:26:24,861 --> 01:26:29,861
Bethel and I will make an altar unto God
who answered me in the day of my 

1475
01:26:29,861 --> 01:26:34,241
distress and was with me in the way 
which I went and they gave unto Jacob 

1476
01:26:34,881 --> 01:26:39,881
all the strange gods which were in their
hand and all their earrings which were 

1477
01:26:39,881 --> 01:26:39,881
in their ears.

1478
01:26:39,881 --> 01:26:42,020
And Jacob had them under the oak,
which was by a checkup.

1479
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:47,110
And they journeyed and the terror of God
was upon the cities that were round 

1480
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:51,431
roundabout them,
and they did not pursue after the sons 

1481
01:26:51,431 --> 01:26:53,831
of Jacob.
So Jacob came to laws which is in the 

1482
01:26:53,831 --> 01:26:56,861
land of Canaan that is Bethel.
So that's the place where he put up the 

1483
01:26:56,861 --> 01:27:00,551
pillar to begin with.
He and all the people that were there 

1484
01:27:00,551 --> 01:27:03,131
with him and he built there an altar and
called the place l Bethel because their 

1485
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:07,700
God appeared to him when he fled from 
the face of his brother and God appeared

1486
01:27:07,701 --> 01:27:09,940
to Jacob again when he came out of pet 
dander,

1487
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,150
Ram and blessed him and God sent unto 
him [inaudible].

1488
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,270
My name is Jacob.
Thy name shall not be called anymore.

1489
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:19,490
Jacob,
which he remembered means usurper,

1490
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:24,050
but Israel shall be thy name.
He who wrestles with God

1491
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:27,990
had he called his name Israel.
And God said to him,

1492
01:27:27,991 --> 01:27:32,991
I am God Almighty.
Be fruitful and multiply a nation and a 

1493
01:27:32,991 --> 01:27:35,160
company of Nations shall be of the Kings
shall come out of my loins.

1494
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:40,700
And the land which I gave Abraham and 
Isaac to the I will give it and device 

1495
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:44,451
seed after the will I give the land.
And God went up from him in the place 

1496
01:27:44,451 --> 01:27:45,980
where he talked with them.
And God says,

1497
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:51,290
Jacob setup a pillar in the place where 
he talked with them a pillar of stone 

1498
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:53,700
and he poured a drink offering their on 
any poured oil they're on.

1499
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:57,600
And Jacob called the name of the place 
where God spake with him Bethel.

1500
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:09,440
So He's,
he's returned to the central place which

1501
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:14,441
had been given to him as his territory.
Rachel dies in Labor in the process,

1502
01:28:17,031 --> 01:28:20,720
giving birth to an only son of my 
sorrow,

1503
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:24,110
whose name was then changed to Benjamin 
son of the right hand.

1504
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,750
Now Ruben.

1505
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:33,890
So Simeon and Levi have already done 
something unforgivable.

1506
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,570
Now,
Ruben Reuben's term,

1507
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,950
he sleeps with Bill [inaudible],
who's Jacob Israel's concubine.

1508
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:43,460
So he's the third of the sons to make an
unforgivable error.

1509
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:48,230
And Jacob Slash Israel gets wind of it.
So Robin is no longer.

1510
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:53,680
He would have been the premier son given
that the two older sons were put out of 

1511
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,340
the running.
So to speak,

1512
01:28:55,341 --> 01:28:58,400
because of their disobedience and 
impulsive,

1513
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:02,860
vengeful cruelty,
and then rubin can't keep his.

1514
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:05,100
What do they say?
Well,

1515
01:29:05,101 --> 01:29:07,820
you get the idea.
Yeah.

1516
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:11,190
Yeah.
Seems to be something that's still quite

1517
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:16,191
surprisingly common.
So then we have the story that basically

1518
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:23,040
ends with the establishment of the 12 
tribes of Israel.

1519
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:25,350
From Leah.
There's Reuben,

1520
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:26,250
simeon,
Levi,

1521
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:29,650
Judah is a car and Zebulon from zillow 
powders,

1522
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:34,740
Gad Asher from Bella.
There's Dan and Naphtali and from 

1523
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:38,661
Rachel.
There's Joseph who figures 

1524
01:29:38,661 --> 01:29:39,390
extraordinarily importantly in the next 
story that we're going to cover,

1525
01:29:39,391 --> 01:29:43,710
which hopefully we'll wrap up genesis 
and Benjamin,

1526
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:48,950
and so now Israel itself is established 
and so then we turn to actually going to

1527
01:29:55,761 --> 01:29:58,430
end this early tonight.
That's quite bloody miracle.

1528
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:04,030
So this story then turns to Joseph and

1529
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:11,770
the story begins essentially now Israel 
loved Joseph more than all his children 

1530
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:15,881
because he was the son of his old age 
and he made him a coat of many colors 

1531
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:21,340
and so that seems to me to indicate no 
coats in dreams very often seems to be 

1532
01:30:22,281 --> 01:30:24,350
particularly true of women's dreams.
That's,

1533
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:26,270
that's been my,
my clinical observation.

1534
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:31,960
Clothing footwear in particular 
symbolizes a role and that makes sense,

1535
01:30:33,801 --> 01:30:35,190
right?
Because you dress for the role.

1536
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:38,510
It's not that big a mystery,
but so then you might say,

1537
01:30:38,511 --> 01:30:41,000
well,
what does a coat of many colors indicate

1538
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:46,190
and know if you think of that 
multiplicity there,

1539
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:49,550
it's something like the mastery of 
multiple domains,

1540
01:30:49,551 --> 01:30:54,551
right?
Or or maybe something like plural 

1541
01:30:54,551 --> 01:30:56,441
potentiality and so Jacob is is Israel's
are Joseph is Israel's favorite and 

1542
01:30:58,970 --> 01:31:03,970
because he sees in this access 
possibility and he basically tells his 

1543
01:31:04,071 --> 01:31:08,390
other sons that Jacob is going to be the
head son,

1544
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:10,310
which they are not happy with,
right?

1545
01:31:10,311 --> 01:31:14,300
Because he's just this young punk 
fundamentally these clearly his father's

1546
01:31:14,301 --> 01:31:18,440
favorite and he gets this coat that's 
sort of indicative of this higher status

1547
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:23,650
and so Israel inadvertently sets up a 
tremendous amount of sibling rivalry in 

1548
01:31:26,571 --> 01:31:28,640
the household again,
and that

1549
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:35,010
that's the,
the understructure of the last story in 

1550
01:31:35,561 --> 01:31:40,561
genesis.
And so in the last of this lecture 

1551
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:44,791
series for 2017,
we'll cover the story of Joseph and his 

1552
01:31:46,211 --> 01:31:49,330
coat of many colors and what happens as 
a consequence of his,

1553
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:53,110
of the favoritism shown to him by his 
father,

1554
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:58,480
and we'll track what happens as a 
consequence of that.

1555
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,080
And so I'm going to stop there because 
I'm finished.

1556
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:02,770
So

1557
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:07,690
thank you.

1558
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:09,280
Hello,
Dr Pearson.

1559
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:12,370
Um,
this is an idea I've been wrestling with

1560
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,060
for quite some time now.
Um,

1561
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:20,700
this idea of a lot of the greatest 
sources of wisdom that we've received 

1562
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:26,450
throughout human history,
either through text experiences or 

1563
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:31,120
scriptures,
seems to always come from people going 

1564
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:35,441
into isolation and then coming back.
So I've had a hard time trying to figure

1565
01:32:35,921 --> 01:32:39,850
out from a scientific point of view or 
evolutionary point of view,

1566
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:45,630
what would it compel an organism to that
is that is centered around it's 

1567
01:32:46,421 --> 01:32:51,421
behavior.
It's behavior centered around surviving 

1568
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:51,880
in,
especially for humans as social groups,

1569
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:56,020
as well as reproducing to want to go 
into isolation.

1570
01:32:56,500 --> 01:33:01,500
And then not only that,
but obtaining some level of information 

1571
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,640
that actually helps the group in coming 
back.

1572
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:06,430
That's a really good question.
Um,

1573
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:12,020
okay.
So there's this neuroscientist 

1574
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,070
neuropsychologist named El Conan 
Goldberg,

1575
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:20,150
and Goldberg was a student of Alexander 
Luria and Alexander Luria was a Russian 

1576
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:24,771
neuropsychologist,
perhaps the foremost neuropsychologist 

1577
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:28,510
of the mid to late 20th century,
and he had students soaked in vinegar 

1578
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:33,030
Dova who discovered the orienting 
reflex.

1579
01:33:33,031 --> 01:33:34,770
For example,
the orienting reflex is the,

1580
01:33:34,771 --> 01:33:37,200
reflects that orients you win something 
anomalous,

1581
01:33:37,201 --> 01:33:41,100
interferes with your goal.
Directed behavior is a major discovery,

1582
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:46,190
like one of the,
one of the four or five most important 

1583
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:46,860
discoveries that have ever been made in,
in,

1584
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:48,780
in,
in psychology,

1585
01:33:48,781 --> 01:33:53,420
I would say certainly in neuroscience.
So lauria was a big deal and he,

1586
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,520
he was the first person who really 
established the functional role of the 

1587
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:58,920
prefrontal Cortex as well.
So,

1588
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:03,870
and had it very nice overall view of how
the brain functioned.

1589
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:06,300
His book was written in 1980 and it's 
still,

1590
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:08,970
there's still lots in it that's really 
useful,

1591
01:34:08,971 --> 01:34:11,790
which is pretty strange for a science 
that's advanced that quickly.

1592
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:16,050
Anyways,
so Goldberg came from a great pedigree,

1593
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:20,520
I believe Larry,
his teacher was Pavlov,

1594
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:23,790
if I remember correctly.
So anyways,

1595
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:30,150
Goldberg,

1596
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:35,300
you know,
you hear some of you may have heard the 

1597
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:38,271
idea that the left hemisphere is more 
linguistic than the right hemisphere is 

1598
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:44,841
that left hemisphere is specialized for 
language and the right hemisphere 

1599
01:34:44,841 --> 01:34:47,430
specialized for nonverbal imagistic 
communication.

1600
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:52,730
The left hemisphere has a pretty well 
organized microstructure and the right 

1601
01:34:52,951 --> 01:34:57,951
hemisphere is more diffuse as well,
and that's true in lefthanded males in 

1602
01:34:59,691 --> 01:35:04,691
particular,
so the circuitry can be switched around 

1603
01:35:04,691 --> 01:35:04,691
a bit,
but it's okay.

1604
01:35:04,691 --> 01:35:07,070
The modules are basically the same,
although they can be moved a little bit,

1605
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,180
but Goldberg thought that it isn't 
language versus non language,

1606
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:16,480
it's routine versus novelty.
And so the left hemisphere and there's a

1607
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:22,510
neuropsychologist physician named Rama 
Shaundra who's done some very 

1608
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:25,850
interesting work that's pertinent to 
this.

1609
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:28,670
Maybe I'll tell you a story about him.
Anyways.

1610
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:34,210
Goldberg believed that the right 
hemisphere say you have very old systems

1611
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:41,290
underneath boast both cortical 
hemispheres that do things like respond 

1612
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:44,720
to anomaly to the thing that doesn't fit
to the Predator in the distance.

1613
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:50,560
Some of that's extraordinarily fast,
so that would be like a snake reflects 

1614
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,071
that can move you away from a snake in 
less time than it takes the snake to 

1615
01:35:54,071 --> 01:35:54,140
bite,
and it's really a reflex.

1616
01:35:54,141 --> 01:35:56,840
It doesn't even hit your brain.
It's really super fast.

1617
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,540
And then there's a defensive crouch 
that's,

1618
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,110
that's instantiated higher up in the 
nervous system,

1619
01:36:03,111 --> 01:36:08,111
but that's still remarkably fast.
And then there's fear as an emotion and 

1620
01:36:08,111 --> 01:36:12,770
and the orientation of attention.
And then there's the cognitive 

1621
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:14,420
processing and that all streams out 
across a time span,

1622
01:36:14,421 --> 01:36:19,421
right?
And maybe that time span is half a 

1623
01:36:19,421 --> 01:36:19,421
second.
So,

1624
01:36:19,421 --> 01:36:19,760
and that's really a long time if 
something is attacking you.

1625
01:36:19,761 --> 01:36:23,390
So you got those initial responses are 
quite primitive,

1626
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:26,270
but they're extraordinarily fast.
All right?

1627
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:31,271
So there's subcortical structures that 
orient you towards novelty and prepare 

1628
01:36:31,271 --> 01:36:34,580
you for,
for freezing or for attending.

1629
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:38,510
And the right hemisphere seems to be 
dominated by those systems.

1630
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,980
So imagine that.
What happens is that something threatens

1631
01:36:42,981 --> 01:36:44,540
you.
You Orient towards it.

1632
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:47,960
The right hemisphere produces a bunch of
images about what it might be.

1633
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:51,170
So imagine that's what happens when a 
child is afraid of the dark,

1634
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:53,810
the child's on the bed,
they're afraid of the dark,

1635
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:56,330
they're crouched because they're frozen 
like a prey animal.

1636
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:00,080
And their right hemisphere is producing 
monsters to inhabit the,

1637
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:05,620
the darkness that are the child's 
hypotheses about what might be out 

1638
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,860
there.
Okay?

1639
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:09,230
Because that's what you want to know,
right?

1640
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:14,800
You want to know what's out there and 
then you want to know what to do about 

1641
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,280
it.
I can tell you two kids' dreams that are

1642
01:37:16,281 --> 01:37:20,930
sort of relevant to that.
So when my daughter was about three,

1643
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:26,140
she came into the bedroom that my wife 
and I had and she was crying,

1644
01:37:26,871 --> 01:37:31,871
she'd had a nightmare and she said that 
she saw stream and there was garbage all

1645
01:37:32,751 --> 01:37:35,450
over the street and she didn't like 
that.

1646
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:37,070
And so I sat her down and I said,
okay,

1647
01:37:37,071 --> 01:37:40,190
so imagine the stream with the garbage 
in it.

1648
01:37:40,191 --> 01:37:45,191
Now imagine that you're taking the 
garbage out and throwing it in the 

1649
01:37:45,191 --> 01:37:47,561
garbage bin.
And so she and I got her to like 

1650
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:49,790
visualize that because that kind of puts
her back in the semi dream state.

1651
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:52,970
And then she cleaned up the mess and 
then she could go off to sleep.

1652
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:55,980
Now you could tell the child,
don't worry about the dream isn't

1653
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,980
real.
That's not true because it's not real 

1654
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:03,240
like other day time things are,
but it's not like it's not real.

1655
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:07,860
It's a dream like a dream is real.
It's just not the same kind of real.

1656
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:13,220
And so what I did with her was to 
indicate to her practically that if she 

1657
01:38:14,581 --> 01:38:17,550
saw something anomalous,
something that was out of place,

1658
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,080
right?
Something that was a mess,

1659
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:22,470
that it was within her capacity to set 
it right.

1660
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:24,150
Okay.
And so,

1661
01:38:24,151 --> 01:38:29,151
okay,
so now your right hemisphere tells you 

1662
01:38:29,151 --> 01:38:30,960
what monster's might inhabit the,
the darkness.

1663
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:36,650
Now what you have to do is figure out.
There's two things you have to figure 

1664
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:38,430
out.
One is what to do about a given monster.

1665
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,750
And the other is to do.
What about is to figure out what to do 

1666
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:45,150
about the class of all possible 
monsters,

1667
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,180
right?
That's a whole different thing.

1668
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:53,180
That's something that only human beings 
are capable of that level of 

1669
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:53,180
abstraction,
right?

1670
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:57,270
And so what you might do about a 
particular monster is hide or go out and

1671
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,630
get rid of it if it was just an actual 
animal,

1672
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:05,660
right?
But that doesn't help because there's 

1673
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:05,660
all the other potential predators that 
are still there.

1674
01:39:05,730 --> 01:39:09,500
And so maybe you can go hunt them down,
but that doesn't help either because you

1675
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:11,700
can't hunt them all down.
It's not our,

1676
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:15,270
it's not very likely anyways.
So instead what you have to do is figure

1677
01:39:15,271 --> 01:39:20,271
out how to configure yourself so that 
you're in the best possible position to 

1678
01:39:20,271 --> 01:39:22,200
fight off the monsters when they come.
That's your best bet.

1679
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:27,760
All right,
so now people are trying to figure this 

1680
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,661
out forever.
They're trying to figure out what's the 

1681
01:39:29,661 --> 01:39:32,160
answer to the problem of the class of 
all possible monsters.

1682
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:36,000
Part of that sacrifice.
So there are routines.

1683
01:39:36,001 --> 01:39:40,800
For example,
in Hinduism with the goddess Kelly,

1684
01:39:40,801 --> 01:39:43,920
you make offerings to Kelly,
who's this devouring goddess,

1685
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,980
and then she turns into her benevolent 
counterpart.

1686
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:51,240
And so sacrifice is actually one way 
that you can tame the monsters.

1687
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:56,700
If you think about the monster has the 
set of all negative future 

1688
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:58,500
potentialities,
you make the proper sacrifices.

1689
01:39:58,501 --> 01:40:03,501
Those monsters stay at bay,
but then there's heroism as an 

1690
01:40:03,501 --> 01:40:06,801
alternative to which,
which means the act of confrontation of 

1691
01:40:06,801 --> 01:40:11,541
the class,
of all possible monsters and the 

1692
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:11,850
building of yourself up into this sort 
of courageous person that can do that.

1693
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:17,420
It took a tremendous amount of 
meditation to transform those images,

1694
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:23,750
say of the monsters in,
into it,

1695
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:27,530
or to solve the problem of the class of 
those monsters.

1696
01:40:27,531 --> 01:40:32,531
So,
so now I'll tell you another child 

1697
01:40:32,531 --> 01:40:34,131
street.
So some of you have probably heard this 

1698
01:40:34,131 --> 01:40:37,131
before,
but it's such a great dream that it's 

1699
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:37,131
worth.
It's worth telling.

1700
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:43,730
So you know,
is that my sister in law's house once 

1701
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:46,050
and her son was running around is about 
four very precocious,

1702
01:40:46,051 --> 01:40:47,550
very verbal,
very intelligent,

1703
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:51,180
running around with a night hat on and 
his sword.

1704
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:55,210
So he's engaged in this pretty intense 
play world.

1705
01:40:55,600 --> 01:41:00,600
And when he goes to sleep,
he puts the night hat on his pillow and 

1706
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,691
the sword bias pillow.
And at the same time he's having night 

1707
01:41:03,691 --> 01:41:08,041
terrors.
So he's waking up and it had been for a 

1708
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:08,041
number of weeks,
nate waking up,

1709
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:10,450
screaming and then,
but he doesn't know why.

1710
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:16,460
There's some things that aren't going so
well in the household and the parents 

1711
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:17,920
get divorced shortly afterwards.
Okay.

1712
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:18,960
So that's,
that's,

1713
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:21,250
that's what's going on underneath.
Right.

1714
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:26,820
And he's also going to go to 
kindergarten and so he's about to go 

1715
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:27,400
into the world and so he's coping with 
this,

1716
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:28,600
you know.

1717
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:33,990
So I'm watching them zoom around as this
night and thinking that's pretty cool.

1718
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:39,990
And that night he woke up and had a.
everyone was screaming and so we're all 

1719
01:41:40,301 --> 01:41:43,420
at breakfast the next morning and I 
said,

1720
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,290
did you dream anything?
And he got really intense.

1721
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:48,790
And he said,
yes,

1722
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:50,920
I had a dream.
And I said,

1723
01:41:50,921 --> 01:41:51,820
well,
what was the dream?

1724
01:41:51,821 --> 01:41:52,690
And he said,
well,

1725
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:58,080
I was out on this field and all these 
like dwarfs came up to me.

1726
01:41:59,411 --> 01:42:03,040
They're only about as high as my knees 
and they didn't have any arms.

1727
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:08,550
They have powerful legs.
And they were covered with Harry 

1728
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:11,770
feathers in Greece and there was cross 
carved into the top of their head.

1729
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:17,040
And they had beaks and whenever he moved
anywhere they would jump out and with 

1730
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:18,400
his,
with their beaks.

1731
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:23,110
And there were lots of them and everyone
like just said nothing at breakfast.

1732
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:27,760
It was like,
because he was right into this story.

1733
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,350
And so we're all like,
yeah,

1734
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:34,351
well that accounts for all the screaming
and so.

1735
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:35,870
And then he said,
yeah.

1736
01:42:35,871 --> 01:42:40,871
And then in the background there was a 
dragon and every time the dragon puffed 

1737
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:45,070
out smoke,
it would turn into these dwarves.

1738
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:46,830
It's like,
Oh man,

1739
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:48,310
kid,
you already got a problem there.

1740
01:42:48,311 --> 01:42:53,311
You got,
you got beat things that are biting you 

1741
01:42:53,311 --> 01:42:53,830
and you can kill them.
And that's fine.

1742
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:57,400
But then there's the dragon just puffing
out new ones.

1743
01:42:57,401 --> 01:42:59,140
So it's like a Hydra problem,
right?

1744
01:42:59,141 --> 01:43:01,180
The old hydro is the serpent.
You cut off one head,

1745
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:03,460
seven more grow.
It's not a good thing.

1746
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:08,461
And it's such a cool dream because it 
really portrayed this class of all 

1747
01:43:08,531 --> 01:43:13,531
possible monsters problem.
So you've got the specific monsters and 

1748
01:43:13,531 --> 01:43:14,710
that's a problem.
So you've got to get rid of them.

1749
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,150
But that's not the problem.
The problem is is that there's a,

1750
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:22,550
there's something in the background 
that's just generating monsters like 

1751
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:22,930
Matt.
And so I said to him,

1752
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:25,660
what do you think you could do about 
that?

1753
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:28,570
And that's a,
that's a loaded question,

1754
01:43:28,571 --> 01:43:33,571
right?
That's like leading the witness in a 

1755
01:43:33,571 --> 01:43:35,461
trial.
You don't get to ask a question like 

1756
01:43:35,461 --> 01:43:36,280
that because it implies that it implies 
the answer.

1757
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:41,490
What could you do about that is not any 
different than saying you could do 

1758
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:43,180
something about that.
Right.

1759
01:43:43,181 --> 01:43:44,580
So,
so I,

1760
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:48,610
I hinted at that as a possibility and 
his eyes lit up.

1761
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:51,070
Now you remember he's already running 
around as at night.

1762
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:56,080
Hey.
So we kind of already knew what to do 

1763
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:56,690
because he had the whole sword in the 
hat and with that,

1764
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:58,610
you know that you can go after the 
dragon.

1765
01:43:58,611 --> 01:44:03,611
He kinda got that and he said I'd get my
dad and then I jump up on top of the 

1766
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:10,331
dragon and I poke out both of its eyes 
with my sword and then it go right down 

1767
01:44:10,331 --> 01:44:14,900
its throat to the firebox where the fire
comes out and I carve out a piece of the

1768
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:15,650
firebox.

1769
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:19,910
And then I'd use that as a shield and I 
thought yes,

1770
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,720
right,
right.

1771
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:26,600
Man is so smart.
Hey,

1772
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:30,080
because he got the thing instantly he 
knew that he knew.

1773
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:31,790
So imagine first of all,
he thought,

1774
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:36,791
okay,
I have to go to the heart of the 

1775
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:36,791
problem.
Right?

1776
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:36,791
And really to the heart,
not to the dragon,

1777
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:41,770
but right down the damn things gullet 
right to the place where the fire was 

1778
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:46,061
actually being was actually being 
created because there was there you 

1779
01:44:46,061 --> 01:44:49,460
could find the shield and that he'd take
this thing that was fireproof and make a

1780
01:44:49,461 --> 01:44:53,690
shield out of it.
And so that was just get bloody perfect.

1781
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:55,340
It was so cool.
And you think,

1782
01:44:55,341 --> 01:44:58,700
well how could a kid come up with that?
And there's a bunch of answers.

1783
01:44:58,701 --> 01:45:01,190
I mean,
one is we know snake fear is innate.

1784
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:03,720
We knew that now there's been recent 
research data that,

1785
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:04,360
that,
that,

1786
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:06,590
that has demonstrated that okay,
so.

1787
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:11,970
And we've been preyed on and being 
predators for a very long period of 

1788
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:12,230
time.
So the idea that,

1789
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:17,650
and I found something else interesting 
about the brain out out about the brain 

1790
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:22,151
recently too,
in Book I was reading by Ray Kurtzweil 

1791
01:45:22,151 --> 01:45:22,280
called how to build a mind.
I think that's what it was called.

1792
01:45:22,281 --> 01:45:26,810
It was quite a good book.
So I think it was in that book or it was

1793
01:45:26,811 --> 01:45:29,090
in the neuroscience paper I was reading.
It doesn't matter,

1794
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:33,950
but it was one of those two places.
So you know that scanning technology has

1795
01:45:33,951 --> 01:45:36,500
got more and more high resolution over 
the last few years.

1796
01:45:36,501 --> 01:45:41,501
Right.
It just gets more and more high 

1797
01:45:41,501 --> 01:45:42,701
resolution all the time and so people 
are now able to look at the micro 

1798
01:45:42,701 --> 01:45:45,110
structures of the brain in a way that 
hasn't been possible before.

1799
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:50,111
And so the old idea with the cortex 
basically was the cortex was full of a 

1800
01:45:50,111 --> 01:45:54,581
bunch of neurons and then when one 
neuron and another fired at the same 

1801
01:45:54,581 --> 01:45:56,170
time,
they would wire together and that's kind

1802
01:45:56,171 --> 01:45:58,250
of how your brain learns to make 
connections.

1803
01:45:59,030 --> 01:46:01,220
It's a bit more complicated than that,
but that will do.

1804
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:06,340
And then it was found that it wasn't 
quite that simple because what your 

1805
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:10,670
cortex is made out of are these columns 
of neurons that are duplicated,

1806
01:46:10,671 --> 01:46:13,130
sorta like a,
like a centipedes legs,

1807
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,100
you know,
it's very simple genetic code data,

1808
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:21,110
another leg set of legs to ascend to 
pete is sort of like that with your 

1809
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:24,581
brain.
It's made out of all these columns and 

1810
01:46:24,581 --> 01:46:25,070
the columns are basically already quite 
wired up.

1811
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,160
And then as you learn the columns wired 
together.

1812
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:33,580
Okay,
so there's some preexisting structure 

1813
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:33,580
there,
but there's more preexistent structure.

1814
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,300
Then that was thought.
So it's,

1815
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:40,560
it's basically that there are already 
tracked that link columns together that 

1816
01:46:41,721 --> 01:46:44,690
are in different parts of the brain and 
the columns,

1817
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:50,170
the columns themselves can send out 
invites to these highways which are 

1818
01:46:51,001 --> 01:46:56,001
already there.
And then the super highway is there and 

1819
01:46:56,001 --> 01:46:57,870
then it can generate connections to the 
columns at the end of the super highway.

1820
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:02,870
So what that means is that there's a 
tremendous amount of cortical structure 

1821
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:04,410
already in place,
but there's plasticity around that.

1822
01:47:04,411 --> 01:47:05,460
And when I read that,
I thought,

1823
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:07,140
well that's part of the source of the 
archetypes.

1824
01:47:07,141 --> 01:47:12,141
There's already an archetypal structure 
there that as well as the subcortical 

1825
01:47:12,141 --> 01:47:15,771
structures,
so you could say that like the kid 

1826
01:47:15,771 --> 01:47:18,831
already had within him,
not only the capacity to represent not 

1827
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:24,411
only the monster,
but the class of all possible monsters 

1828
01:47:24,411 --> 01:47:24,900
and the fact that the problem wasn't 
monsters.

1829
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:27,960
The problem was that monsters could 
continually be generated,

1830
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:33,350
which is way worse problem,
and then the answer to that isn't to 

1831
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:36,471
kill an individual monster.
The answer to that is go to the source 

1832
01:47:36,471 --> 01:47:39,861
of the monstrous itself and defeat it.
So it's absolutely staggering and you 

1833
01:47:40,231 --> 01:47:45,231
could imagine that it would take a 
tremendous amount of meditative effort 

1834
01:47:45,231 --> 01:47:49,040
for people to have come up with that 
solution over a very long period of 

1835
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:49,040
time.

1836
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:53,360
So now the point of the representation 
is to formulate a picture of what it is 

1837
01:47:55,441 --> 01:48:00,441
that's the threat so that you can then 
formulate a general purpose solution.

1838
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:06,230
And so there's this image of Kelly which
I really like because Kelly is sort of 

1839
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:07,860
the goddess of the darkness,
let's say,

1840
01:48:07,861 --> 01:48:09,570
and destruction.
And so Kelly is.

1841
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:15,950
She has a headdress of fire,
her hair is on fire and she has a 

1842
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:19,671
headdress of skulls and she has hands 
cut off all around her neck and she has 

1843
01:48:19,671 --> 01:48:24,021
a belt that's often snakes,
but it's sometimes she sometimes eating 

1844
01:48:24,021 --> 01:48:28,431
the intestines of this guy that she's 
just given birth to and that she's 

1845
01:48:28,431 --> 01:48:31,560
sitting on and she has eight legs like a
spider and she's in a web of fire and so

1846
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:36,740
she's a monster in some sense that 
represents everything that might terrify

1847
01:48:37,201 --> 01:48:39,270
and devour you.
And the question is,

1848
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:44,390
so you come up with that representation,
has an image to represent the class of 

1849
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:48,621
all terrifying things and then you have 
to generate a solution in the face of 

1850
01:48:48,621 --> 01:48:48,750
that class.

1851
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:53,870
And sacrifice is one of the solutions.
But that heroic encounter is another one

1852
01:48:53,971 --> 01:48:57,180
of the solutions.
And that's the one that he catalyzed.

1853
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:59,220
Now.
He'd been read lots of books.

1854
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,950
He'd watched lots of Disney movies,
you know,

1855
01:49:01,970 --> 01:49:05,730
and he'd seen the heroic pattern 
portrayed many,

1856
01:49:05,731 --> 01:49:10,731
many places and his little brain was 
working like mad to extract out the 

1857
01:49:10,861 --> 01:49:14,730
essence of that and who embody it.
And when I asked them that question,

1858
01:49:14,731 --> 01:49:19,731
it just went snap and all those things 
lined up and his night terrors went 

1859
01:49:19,731 --> 01:49:21,330
away.
That was it.

1860
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:24,540
And I followed up with his mum because 
it was really quite remarkable,

1861
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:27,040
the whole set of occurrences,
you know,

1862
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:32,080
and he didn't have night terrors that 
night even though he'd been having the 

1863
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,090
nightly and that was the end of them 
because he solved his problem.

1864
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:38,130
Like he needed to be the courageous 
night that went after the dragon.

1865
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:43,430
And so that is what people need to be.
So I think when we go into solitude,

1866
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:52,080
we shut off the external stimulation and
we let the dreaming part of our mind 

1867
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:57,390
emerge.
And that's this nonverbal pattern 

1868
01:49:57,390 --> 01:50:00,220
detector that thinks in images.
And it's,

1869
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:05,970
it's the thing that mediates between 
what we don't understand and what we do 

1870
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:06,760
understand.
If you understand it completely,

1871
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:10,120
you can say it and you can act it out if
you don't understand it.

1872
01:50:10,121 --> 01:50:12,620
You represented in images and they're 
like,

1873
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:15,100
it's the emotion.
Fear,

1874
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:17,410
withdrawal,
paralysis.

1875
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,830
And then that manifests itself in an 
image of what that might be.

1876
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,760
And that image is the basis for the 
story and it's the basis for further 

1877
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:30,451
development of the idea and to go into 
isolation is to let those images emerge 

1878
01:50:30,851 --> 01:50:33,880
and to dream a little bit,
and then that moves you,

1879
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,730
that moves you ahead into the future.
So to use your

1880
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:42,980
which they used before,
it's not enough just to map out the 

1881
01:50:43,051 --> 01:50:48,051
danger that is imminent in front of you,
but all the potential dangers that you 

1882
01:50:48,051 --> 01:50:49,260
could come up with an abstract form.

1883
01:50:49,790 --> 01:50:54,790
Yeah,
well remember what happens when God 

1884
01:50:54,790 --> 01:50:57,110
throws Adam and Eve out of out of 
paradise,

1885
01:50:57,410 --> 01:50:59,480
they become aware that they're going to 
die,

1886
01:50:59,481 --> 01:51:02,870
right?
The future becomes a problem because you

1887
01:51:02,871 --> 01:51:05,780
could say the future is the place of all
potential monsters.

1888
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:11,440
Right?
And so just the monster that you have 

1889
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:11,440
right in front of you.
It's like,

1890
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:11,440
yeah,
well you get rid of that,

1891
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,350
but that doesn't solve your problem,
does it?

1892
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:16,340
The problem is how do you exist in a 
world full of monsters?

1893
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:19,910
And part of that answer is why you 
become a monster yourself.

1894
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:24,680
That's a big part of the answer,
but it's an incomplete answer because if

1895
01:51:24,681 --> 01:51:27,560
you're just a monster then you're just 
as bad as the monsters,

1896
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:32,890
so you have to transfer,
you have to be a monstrous enough to 

1897
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:33,950
contend with the monsters,
but then you have to be civilized enough

1898
01:51:33,951 --> 01:51:38,951
so that you're not a monster yourself 
and that's more or less equivalent to 

1899
01:51:38,951 --> 01:51:40,460
the union inter integration of the 
shadow.

1900
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:43,050
So.
Yep.

1901
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:49,430
Thank you.

1902
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:52,920
Hi,
Dr Peterson.

1903
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:57,030
I've been wanting to ask you this for 
awhile now since I started watching your

1904
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:02,060
lectures.
After I started reading and Nietzsche's 

1905
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:05,630
beyond good and evil,
I came upon a paragraph in his chapter 

1906
01:52:06,361 --> 01:52:11,361
on scholars that really,
really bothered me and it's actually 

1907
01:52:11,361 --> 01:52:11,361
bothers me to this day.
Uh,

1908
01:52:11,361 --> 01:52:13,230
he,
he talked about this kind of person,

1909
01:52:13,231 --> 01:52:16,740
like they were just a mirror,
like they stretched,

1910
01:52:16,741 --> 01:52:21,741
he said every part of their skin 
basically to allow every new piece of 

1911
01:52:21,741 --> 01:52:25,791
information that they took on.
And then all they ever were was just an 

1912
01:52:25,791 --> 01:52:30,141
instrument.
They were just a mirror on reflecting 

1913
01:52:30,141 --> 01:52:31,260
what they had learned.
Never actually having generated anything

1914
01:52:31,261 --> 01:52:34,050
on their own.
And it's bothered me because I feel like

1915
01:52:34,051 --> 01:52:36,230
in a way it sort of like,
it's,

1916
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:41,260
it's,
it's impacted my identity a lot because 

1917
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:43,731
I don't know,
how are you supposed to create 

1918
01:52:43,731 --> 01:52:43,731
something,
you know?

1919
01:52:43,731 --> 01:52:43,731
So.

1920
01:52:43,731 --> 01:52:44,380
Okay,
well that's okay that,

1921
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:45,920
that's a really good.
I mean,

1922
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:49,430
nature is often clashed with the 
existentialists right?

1923
01:52:49,431 --> 01:52:51,890
And so one of the tenants of 
existential,

1924
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:56,891
it's,
there's two real tenants of 

1925
01:52:56,891 --> 01:52:56,891
existentialism.
There's more,

1926
01:52:56,891 --> 01:53:00,320
but obviously we're oversimplifying,
but one is that life is a problem.

1927
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:03,050
It isn't because there's something wrong
with you,

1928
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:08,910
it's that life is a problem.
And so that's often contrasted with the 

1929
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:10,700
Friday and view,
which is that if you have a problem,

1930
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:13,730
it's because something went wrong during
your development.

1931
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:15,290
The existentialist said,
no,

1932
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:18,350
no.
It's like life is a problem.

1933
01:53:18,351 --> 01:53:20,870
Make no mistake about it.
And that

1934
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:34,570
the purpose of the purpose of 
scholarship is in some sense to solve 

1935
01:53:35,151 --> 01:53:38,630
that problem.
And so for Nisha,

1936
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,210
like he said,
all truths are bloody truth to me.

1937
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:46,780
And what he meant by that was that if an
idea didn't incarnate itself in you and 

1938
01:53:47,781 --> 01:53:50,240
transform your perceptions and your 
actions,

1939
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:52,550
then you were merely possessed by the 
idea.

1940
01:53:52,551 --> 01:53:54,980
You're merely a spokesperson for the 
idea.

1941
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:57,290
Or You could say that the idea possessed
you.

1942
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:00,980
You're a puppet for the idea.
It's not you,

1943
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:06,640
it's the idea is in you and it has you.
You haven't taken the idea and 

1944
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,570
incorporated with you and made it part 
of your life.

1945
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:12,080
And so there's a romanticism that's 
associated with that,

1946
01:54:12,081 --> 01:54:13,760
right?
That's the passionate scholar.

1947
01:54:13,761 --> 01:54:16,370
The person for whom ideas are not 
merely,

1948
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:23,430
they're not merely,
what would you call abstracted 

1949
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:26,940
representations that can be tossed about
as if they're commodities.

1950
01:54:28,150 --> 01:54:29,020
They're,
they're,

1951
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:31,330
they're more like,
they're more like personalities.

1952
01:54:31,331 --> 01:54:33,280
That might be another way of thinking 
about it.

1953
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:37,130
And so if you're,
if,

1954
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:41,650
if those ideas are compelling,
then you don't like.

1955
01:54:41,651 --> 01:54:45,610
One thing I learned along time ago,
and I think this is probably relevant.

1956
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:51,360
I know when I was a kid,
I liked to argue and I like to win 

1957
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:51,360
arguments or,
or,

1958
01:54:51,450 --> 01:54:56,450
or lose them.
Although I liked winning them a lot 

1959
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:58,501
better.
But I didn't really mind so much what 

1960
01:54:58,501 --> 01:54:59,080
the content of the argument was,
you know,

1961
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:04,090
I,
I could engage in it like a sparring 

1962
01:55:04,090 --> 01:55:05,170
match and it was in some sense to 
establish dominance,

1963
01:55:05,171 --> 01:55:06,820
right?
To establish intellectual dominance.

1964
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I quit doing that when I was in my mid 
twenties because I thought that that was

1965
01:55:12,971 --> 01:55:15,160
too shallow and approach to the ideas.

1966
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:20,500
They're not commodities of that sort.
They're there,

1967
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:24,010
they have tendrils that reached down 
into the living.

1968
01:55:24,011 --> 01:55:26,830
That's the right way to think about it.
And so niches,

1969
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:29,230
criticism of scholars.
And he did this a lot,

1970
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:32,380
was that they were bloodless,
you know,

1971
01:55:32,381 --> 01:55:37,381
they didn't,
they were full of performative 

1972
01:55:37,381 --> 01:55:37,381
contradictions.
That's another way of thinking about,

1973
01:55:37,381 --> 01:55:42,060
they'd say one thing and do another 
because their intellect was completely 

1974
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:42,940
dissociated from their,
from their actions.

1975
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,700
And he,
he,

1976
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:49,820
he thought that was a very bad idea.
And I think that that's a good 

1977
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:51,690
criticism.
I think it is a bad idea.

1978
01:55:51,691 --> 01:55:54,870
I also think it makes for an 
extraordinarily boring lecturer,

1979
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:57,150
you know,
because you can tell if you're listening

1980
01:55:57,151 --> 01:56:02,151
to someone,
whether the ideas that you're hearing 

1981
01:56:02,151 --> 01:56:03,510
are merely being passed through the 
person as if they're being memorized,

1982
01:56:03,511 --> 01:56:08,511
say,
or whether they're part of the dynamic 

1983
01:56:08,511 --> 01:56:10,650
core of the person and if they're part 
of the dynamic core of the person,

1984
01:56:10,651 --> 01:56:15,651
then they're almost always engaging in 
gripping and so he wasn't a fan of 

1985
01:56:15,651 --> 01:56:19,020
bloodless scholars and I think that's 
correct because one of the things that I

1986
01:56:19,021 --> 01:56:19,500
see,

1987
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:26,280
it's not a good idea to have ideas 
possess you unless you know what the 

1988
01:56:26,531 --> 01:56:31,531
ideas are up to and lots of people are 
possessed by ideas rather than 

1989
01:56:31,631 --> 01:56:32,530
possessing them.
Not.

1990
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,250
What that means is they haven't taken 
the ideas and integrated them into their

1991
01:56:36,251 --> 01:56:38,260
own being.
They haven't.

1992
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:43,800
It's like an incarnation in a sense.
They have an incarnated the ideas in 

1993
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:48,300
embodied form and so they're incomplete.
You know,

1994
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:53,490
nature also in thus spake Zarathustra.
When zero booster comes down the 

1995
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:57,451
mountain,
he sees a bunch of people gathered 

1996
01:56:57,451 --> 01:56:59,881
around a famous individual.
I think maybe a scholar but doesn't 

1997
01:56:59,881 --> 01:57:01,590
really matter and when zero theaster 
goes and looks at the person,

1998
01:57:01,591 --> 01:57:06,591
only sees his little tiny midget with a 
gigantic ear and so he's a hyper 

1999
01:57:06,591 --> 01:57:07,180
specialist.
Right.

2000
01:57:07,450 --> 01:57:12,450
And so he has a pretty impressive ear,
but he's only this big and that was 

2001
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:12,730
niches,
images,

2002
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:17,200
stick commentary on the danger of hyper 
specialization and also on the danger of

2003
01:57:17,201 --> 01:57:22,030
adulation for hyper specialization and 
because he thought about it as a kind of

2004
01:57:22,031 --> 01:57:25,150
deformity now nature was a pretty harsh 
guy,

2005
01:57:25,151 --> 01:57:30,151
but,
but he did address the issue of the 

2006
01:57:30,731 --> 01:57:35,731
relationship between intellectual 
knowledge and an action because for 

2007
01:57:35,731 --> 01:57:39,430
nature those things are not to be 
separated in some sense.

2008
01:57:40,090 --> 01:57:42,430
So yeah.
So maybe,

2009
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:45,010
I don't know why.
Maybe it bothered you.

2010
01:57:46,450 --> 01:57:47,920
Like it's hard to say why it bothered 
you.

2011
01:57:47,921 --> 01:57:52,240
It might have bothered you because it's 
sort of undermine the idea of scholar.

2012
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:57,480
But the other possibility,
and this isn't an accusation because 

2013
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:57,480
obviously I don't know anything about 
you,

2014
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:59,350
but it might also be that it struck a 
chord,

2015
01:57:59,351 --> 01:58:04,351
you know,
and that maybe you were doubtful or 

2016
01:58:04,351 --> 01:58:07,501
questioning how tightly associated your 
intellectual endeavor was with your 

2017
01:58:11,591 --> 01:58:16,180
actual character and your practice.
So that's another possibility.

2018
01:58:16,181 --> 01:58:21,181
I mean,
that's a really good thing to think 

2019
01:58:21,181 --> 01:58:21,640
about because generally speaking,
that integration is very much lacking.

2020
01:58:22,030 --> 01:58:27,030
People are a lot smarter and fluid with 
their ideas that they are ethical and 

2021
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:30,670
consistent and characterized by 
integrity.

2022
01:58:31,150 --> 01:58:31,600
So,

2023
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:43,760
hey,
um,

2024
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:48,780
so last week you talked about how you 
hated people asking you if you believe 

2025
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:50,140
in God or do you believe miracles are 
you disliked those questions,

2026
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:52,870
leds,
but you also talked about how,

2027
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:58,000
and I want to put words in your mouth,
but I think he said something about the 

2028
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,571
idea of an empirical evidence for 
religious experiences or spiritual 

2029
01:59:00,571 --> 01:59:04,531
experiences.
And I wonder how those two ideas can a 

2030
01:59:04,531 --> 01:59:08,280
spiritual existence or can a spiritual 
experience exists without God or how did

2031
01:59:08,281 --> 01:59:09,440
I,
I had trouble reading.

2032
01:59:09,630 --> 01:59:11,790
Who knows?
Who knows?

2033
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:13,440
You know,
I don't know what.

2034
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:15,510
I don't know what to make of that.
I mean you could.

2035
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:18,420
It depends on what you're willing to 
accept as proof.

2036
01:59:18,421 --> 01:59:21,270
I suppose that's where things get 
tricky,

2037
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,330
you know,
if you have to demonstrate the existence

2038
01:59:24,331 --> 01:59:29,331
of God objectively than subjective 
experiences of the transcendent are 

2039
01:59:29,331 --> 01:59:30,540
irrelevant.
Right?

2040
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:35,870
But,
and that's a perfectly reasonable 

2041
01:59:35,870 --> 01:59:38,751
standpoint.
If your initial presupposition is the 

2042
01:59:38,751 --> 01:59:41,931
only thing that has actual existence is 
those things that can be demonstrated 

2043
01:59:41,931 --> 01:59:43,230
objectively and I'm not putting that 
down,

2044
01:59:43,231 --> 01:59:47,880
like that's a powerful methodology.
Our technology is basically dependent on

2045
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:53,090
the acceptance,
at least a partial acceptance of those 

2046
01:59:53,090 --> 01:59:56,001
axioms,
but I also think that it's difficult for

2047
01:59:56,221 --> 02:00:01,221
me to deny the existence of these 
patterns of thinking that seemed to 

2048
02:00:02,101 --> 02:00:06,270
exist cross culturally,
like the existence of the representation

2049
02:00:06,271 --> 02:00:07,740
of the Dragon,
for example.

2050
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:12,660
Especially given that I can see an 
evolutionary rationale for the emergence

2051
02:00:12,661 --> 02:00:14,040
of these representations.

2052
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:19,880
So and then there's also the 
indisputable fact that religious 

2053
02:00:20,371 --> 02:00:25,371
experiences are accessible to people 
through a number of different avenues.

2054
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:31,110
Now and one of the things I mentioned 
when I discussed this before as well,

2055
02:00:31,111 --> 02:00:36,111
you could say,
well those are no different than 

2056
02:00:36,111 --> 02:00:39,020
experiences of psychopathology,
but they are different because the 

2057
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:41,070
experiences of psychopathology damage 
people.

2058
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:46,640
Whereas the evidence is that the 
transcendent experiences actually help 

2059
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:47,310
people.
So unless you can,

2060
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:48,720
unless you're willing to say,
well,

2061
02:00:48,721 --> 02:00:53,721
there are some forms of 
psychopathological experience that 

2062
02:00:53,721 --> 02:00:55,260
actually facilitate health,
which is a possibility,

2063
02:00:55,261 --> 02:00:56,550
but you know,
I think you're.

2064
02:00:56,730 --> 02:00:59,010
You're pushing your hypo yearly 
hypothesis.

2065
02:00:59,011 --> 02:00:59,670
At that point.

2066
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:02,760
Would it hurt to define what a religious
experience is in this case?

2067
02:01:02,761 --> 02:01:04,920
Then?
Because I feel like the semantics,

2068
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:06,720
like I.
I'm not sure if what you're saying about

2069
02:01:06,721 --> 02:01:09,270
a religious experience is what I'm 
understanding.

2070
02:01:10,370 --> 02:01:12,460
Well,
generally a religious experiences,

2071
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:17,000
something like an experience of the,
of the renewal of the world.

2072
02:01:17,001 --> 02:01:22,001
That might be one way of thinking about 
it so that everything sort of leaps 

2073
02:01:22,001 --> 02:01:25,871
forward as crystal clean and perfect as 
if you had been viewing it from behind a

2074
02:01:26,541 --> 02:01:31,190
mask before.
Another would be a sense of the Union of

2075
02:01:31,191 --> 02:01:36,191
everything.
And so you're a singular being and 

2076
02:01:36,191 --> 02:01:36,680
you're isolated and in religious 
experiences.

2077
02:01:36,681 --> 02:01:41,681
So for example,
there's a book written recently by a 

2078
02:01:41,681 --> 02:01:42,680
neuroscientist,
my stroke of,

2079
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:47,450
what's it called?
My stroke of insight.

2080
02:01:47,451 --> 02:01:48,200
Yeah,
that's right.

2081
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:51,650
And I believe she had a left hemisphere 
stroke,

2082
02:01:51,651 --> 02:01:56,651
if I remember correctly,
and she was sufficiently well developed 

2083
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:02,360
neuroscientists to understand what was 
happening as she had the stroke and,

2084
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:07,580
and she had intense religious experience
as a consequence of that and she 

2085
02:02:08,661 --> 02:02:13,661
experienced it as a dissolution of the 
ego into this state of union with 

2086
02:02:13,661 --> 02:02:17,000
everything and this transcendent 
experience of law and,

2087
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:18,320
and the open.

2088
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,240
Well,
I don't remember the rest of it.

2089
02:02:20,241 --> 02:02:25,241
I mean there are other elements of 
religious experience that are quite 

2090
02:02:25,241 --> 02:02:25,241
common.
The idea of the opening of the heavens,

2091
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:28,010
that's one.
The communion with the ancestors,

2092
02:02:28,011 --> 02:02:31,730
that's another,
the reduction of the body to a skeleton,

2093
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:35,350
that's another,
the movement up into heaven there.

2094
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:39,170
These are well documented phenomena and 
lot of them are associated,

2095
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:42,620
well a fair number of them are 
associated with psychedelic use,

2096
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:45,680
but that's not the only avenue to 
experiences like that.

2097
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:48,680
And epilepsy can produce experiences 
like that too.

2098
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:51,870
And people usually report near death 
experiences.

2099
02:02:51,890 --> 02:02:52,790
Well,
you know,

2100
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:57,820
people usually report that those 
experiences have life altering 

2101
02:02:57,820 --> 02:02:58,400
significance.
Now,

2102
02:02:58,850 --> 02:03:03,850
that in and of itself only proves that 
people are capable of having subjective 

2103
02:03:03,861 --> 02:03:05,540
religious experiences,
right?

2104
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:10,430
It doesn't definitively prove that 
there's anything outside of that.

2105
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:12,470
So Young Carl Young,
for example,

2106
02:03:12,471 --> 02:03:14,870
most of the time he didn't talk about 
God,

2107
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:20,200
he talked about the God image,
which is not the same thing because you 

2108
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:24,020
could have a god image that was even 
evolutionarily instantiated without that

2109
02:03:24,021 --> 02:03:29,021
necessarily being related to any 
transcendent being beyond the image.

2110
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:33,290
Right?
So who knows,

2111
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,920
who knows?
Um,

2112
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:40,600
again,
I think it depends on what you're 

2113
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,330
willing to accept as proof.
Now the proof,

2114
02:03:41,530 --> 02:03:46,530
the is beyond question that people can 
have life changing religious 

2115
02:03:46,791 --> 02:03:50,420
experiences.
Another example of that is that the best

2116
02:03:50,421 --> 02:03:52,760
treatment for alcoholism is religious 
conversion.

2117
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:58,390
It's well documented in the literature,
and I studied alcoholism for a long 

2118
02:03:58,390 --> 02:04:01,601
time.
So one of the cures that sticks is 

2119
02:04:01,601 --> 02:04:05,681
religious conversion and the 12 step 
programs essentially attempt to 

2120
02:04:05,681 --> 02:04:09,161
instantiate religious conversion and 
it's hard to document their success 

2121
02:04:09,161 --> 02:04:12,200
because they succeed for the people who 
stick with it.

2122
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:14,840
But that's not a very good measure,
right?

2123
02:04:14,841 --> 02:04:18,680
It's sort of,
it's sort of self evident that they work

2124
02:04:18,681 --> 02:04:23,681
for the people who stick with it.
I'm not cynical about about alcoholics 

2125
02:04:23,681 --> 02:04:24,850
anonymous or anything,
but we don't have good data on,

2126
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:29,900
on outcome,
but there is good data showing that 

2127
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:32,480
religious transformation is a good cure 
for alcoholism.

2128
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:38,110
So.
And that's an interesting phenomena to 

2129
02:04:38,110 --> 02:04:38,110
um,

2130
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:43,910
it's too complicated.
I probably can't.

2131
02:04:47,050 --> 02:04:47,710
Okay,
I'll try.

2132
02:04:47,711 --> 02:04:52,711
I'll try this for a second.
So here's how I think religious 

2133
02:04:52,711 --> 02:04:55,321
conversion might work.
So imagine you've got the left 

2134
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:57,490
hemisphere and it's the place where your
habitual interpretations reside.

2135
02:04:58,120 --> 02:05:01,270
So I can give you a quick example of 
this.

2136
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:05,660
So this Guy Ramachandran who,
who's a neurophysiologist,

2137
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:08,620
I think that's his,
that's his field of study.

2138
02:05:09,070 --> 02:05:12,910
I think he's at Ucla.
He studied people who had neglect.

2139
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:16,030
Neglect is a very,
very bizarre phenomena.

2140
02:05:16,270 --> 02:05:19,360
So if you have a stroke that damages 
your right parietal lobe,

2141
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:23,830
you'll lose the left part of your being,
not just your body.

2142
02:05:23,831 --> 02:05:25,270
It's really weird.
It's like.

2143
02:05:25,330 --> 02:05:30,330
So for example,
if you have a right parietal stroke and 

2144
02:05:30,330 --> 02:05:32,140
you look at a clock,
you only see you only,

2145
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:37,170
only half the clock exists for you.
It's not like you only see half the 

2146
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:37,540
clock.
It's weirder than that.

2147
02:05:37,541 --> 02:05:40,750
It's that there's only the right side of
the clock.

2148
02:05:40,780 --> 02:05:44,230
There's only the right side of you.
There's only the right side of my body.

2149
02:05:44,530 --> 02:05:49,530
I don't know that this exists.
And so sometimes people with right 

2150
02:05:49,530 --> 02:05:53,281
parietal damage will wake up after the 
stroke and grabbed their left arm and 

2151
02:05:53,281 --> 02:05:57,841
throw it out of bed and or their leg and
throw it out of bed because it's not 

2152
02:05:57,841 --> 02:05:58,540
theirs.
And then of course they fall out of bed,

2153
02:05:58,541 --> 02:06:03,541
which is quite a shock to them.
So and so they'll only eat half the food

2154
02:06:03,821 --> 02:06:08,821
on the plate.
Nobody can really understand this for 

2155
02:06:08,821 --> 02:06:08,821
Norman logically,
right?

2156
02:06:08,821 --> 02:06:10,000
Because we can't imagine what that must 
be like.

2157
02:06:10,001 --> 02:06:15,001
I think it must be like,
you know how you know there's things 

2158
02:06:15,001 --> 02:06:16,330
behind you,
but you don't not see them.

2159
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:21,660
They're just not there.
It's not like it's black or anything or 

2160
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:22,060
there's a space,
it's just not there.

2161
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:27,480
And so I think what happens is the not 
there extends to three quarters of the 

2162
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:28,960
field instead of half the field.

2163
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,090
That's a guess.
Anyway.

2164
02:06:31,091 --> 02:06:36,091
So now the funny thing about people with
neglect is that if you tell them,

2165
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:38,080
if you pointed out,
you say,

2166
02:06:38,110 --> 02:06:43,110
well,
I noticed that you're not moving your 

2167
02:06:43,110 --> 02:06:43,110
left foot today.
They'll say,

2168
02:06:43,110 --> 02:06:47,041
well it's,
it's arthritic and I can't move it and 

2169
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:47,041
say,
well what are you?

2170
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:47,290
Just try to move it.
So No,

2171
02:06:47,291 --> 02:06:52,291
look,
Dr already told you it's in too much 

2172
02:06:52,291 --> 02:06:52,291
pain to move.
It was working fine this morning.

2173
02:06:52,291 --> 02:06:53,950
Now it can be months after the the 
accident.

2174
02:06:53,951 --> 02:06:58,951
So it's a denial.
And people thought actually that that 

2175
02:06:58,951 --> 02:07:02,311
was trauma induced denial for a long 
time before they figured it out was 

2176
02:07:02,311 --> 02:07:03,220
actually a consequence of the 
neurophysiological damage.

2177
02:07:03,550 --> 02:07:08,550
Now Ramachandra and found that if you 
irrigated the contralateral ear,

2178
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:14,740
say now if you pour cold water in 
someone's ear,

2179
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:18,250
it upsets their vestibular system and 
their eyes will move back and forth like

2180
02:07:18,251 --> 02:07:18,640
this.

2181
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:23,660
You can try that at a party if you want.
And anyways,

2182
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:28,790
Ramachandra was testing vestibular 
function on these patients and the 

2183
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:31,510
irrigated the right ear with cold water 
and they woke up.

2184
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:35,080
Maybe what happened was that that was 
shocking.

2185
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:40,740
So imagine the networks in the right 
hemisphere were degraded but not 

2186
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:44,821
completely gone,
and they needed a really high threshold 

2187
02:07:44,821 --> 02:07:46,540
of activation to snap into function.
So here's an example of that.

2188
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:49,630
If you have Parkinson's disease,
imagine you're frozen there,

2189
02:07:49,870 --> 02:07:51,550
okay?
And I throw a ball at you.

2190
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:56,580
You'll go like this and catch it,
but you can't throw it back so you can.

2191
02:07:57,580 --> 02:08:02,580
The stimulus is enough.
That's enough to push you past 

2192
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:02,920
threshold,
but you can't do it voluntarily.

2193
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:06,190
Now if you have Parkinson's,
like right to the nth degree,

2194
02:08:06,340 --> 02:08:11,340
you won't even be able to catch it.
But there's a stage where you could 

2195
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:11,340
still do that.

2196
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:14,050
There's a great case study where this 
grandpa was in a wheelchair,

2197
02:08:14,051 --> 02:08:17,980
he had Parkinson's and his young 
grandson was playing out on the dock and

2198
02:08:17,981 --> 02:08:21,490
fell in the water and started to drown 
and he got out of his wheelchair,

2199
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:24,340
went into the ocean,
rescued him,

2200
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:29,520
brought him onto the beach,
sat back down in his wheelchair and was 

2201
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:30,010
paralyzed again.
So that was enough.

2202
02:08:30,011 --> 02:08:32,440
So you can imagine there was enough 
network left.

2203
02:08:32,441 --> 02:08:37,441
So if the emotional tension became high 
enough that the degraded circuits could 

2204
02:08:37,781 --> 02:08:40,030
still function.
So okay,

2205
02:08:40,031 --> 02:08:42,570
so back to Ramachandran.
So you irrigate the year.

2206
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:46,170
All of a sudden the right hemisphere 
connections flashed,

2207
02:08:46,190 --> 02:08:49,540
the remainders managed to connect and 
the person goes,

2208
02:08:49,630 --> 02:08:51,400
oh my God,
I've had a terrible stroke.

2209
02:08:51,401 --> 02:08:54,100
I've lost the left side of my body.
They're crying.

2210
02:08:54,101 --> 02:08:57,730
They're like completely catastrophic,
really overwhelmed by it.

2211
02:08:58,060 --> 02:09:03,060
And then 20 minutes later the day 
effects wear off and they snap back in 

2212
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:05,320
and now they,
they've lost her left side again.

2213
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:10,320
They don't remember it.
And so what seems to happen is that the 

2214
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:14,380
right hemisphere is collecting anomalous
information.

2215
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:19,710
That's what it does.
That's what it does when you're 

2216
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:19,710
dreaming.
It's,

2217
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:19,710
it's,
it's,

2218
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:23,970
it's representing that anomalous 
information in image form and sort of 

2219
02:09:23,970 --> 02:09:28,621
slowly passing it to the left hemisphere
so it doesn't overwhelm it and maybe if 

2220
02:09:28,621 --> 02:09:33,421
it gets overwhelming,
you wake up and you're afraid and you 

2221
02:09:33,421 --> 02:09:33,640
tell someone about the dream that helps 
you figure out what it was,

2222
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:38,910
but anyways,
so that the right hemisphere is always 

2223
02:09:38,910 --> 02:09:40,630
trying to tap the left hemisphere into 
transformation.

2224
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:45,900
Right?
So now imagine that that can happen a 

2225
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:49,561
little bit or a lot,
so maybe you're just ignoring a little 

2226
02:09:49,561 --> 02:09:53,911
bit of anomalous information.
You just have some mildly frightening 

2227
02:09:53,911 --> 02:09:58,021
dreams or maybe you've just stacked up a
whole bunch of things that you're 

2228
02:09:58,021 --> 02:10:01,381
ignoring and there's some major league 
monsters that you haven't contended 

2229
02:10:01,381 --> 02:10:03,940
with.
Maybe there's situations where the right

2230
02:10:03,941 --> 02:10:08,941
hemisphere is stored up enough,
counter enough of a counter hypothesis,

2231
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:13,480
let's say about how the world works out,
make making sense.

2232
02:10:13,481 --> 02:10:18,481
Out of all those things that you've 
ignored that one day it just goes snap 

2233
02:10:18,481 --> 02:10:23,340
and you're a new personality and maybe 
the new personality isn't addicted.

2234
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:27,310
So it's something like it's something 
like that.

2235
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,330
I think so,
yeah.

2236
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:42,090
Joke.
Good Morning Citizen Peters.

2237
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:49,900
I've prepared a real doozy for you here.
It's a good thing you've got extra time 

2238
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:54,471
to handle this one.
I'd even say it's rehearsed a little 

2239
02:10:54,471 --> 02:10:54,840
bit,
so it's going to be ultra ineffective,

2240
02:10:54,841 --> 02:10:59,841
you know.
Now I understand that a lecture on the 

2241
02:11:01,411 --> 02:11:06,411
psychological significance of anything 
really is going to induce notably wander

2242
02:11:06,601 --> 02:11:11,601
off into an anthropocentric worldview,
but as a practitioner of the hard 

2243
02:11:14,131 --> 02:11:17,670
sciences,
I wanted to dig a little bit deeper,

2244
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:22,970
you know,
so I sought out I guess a religious 

2245
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:26,001
interpretation of both creative freedom 
and I guess the very nature of time 

2246
02:11:30,911 --> 02:11:35,911
itself and I found it obviously that's 
why I'm here.

2247
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:39,970
And if you think you have an 
anthropocentric worldview,

2248
02:11:39,971 --> 02:11:43,140
it's nothing compared to Joseph Cardinal
Ratzinger's.

2249
02:11:45,670 --> 02:11:49,900
Now I like to think that this microphone
here,

2250
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:52,990
the one that you keep muting out on me,
you know,

2251
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:58,320
this microphone is an object which 
exists outside of our individual 

2252
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:02,731
perceptions.
That's just the way I like to look at 

2253
02:12:02,731 --> 02:12:02,731
it.

2254
02:12:02,731 --> 02:12:02,731
Hmm.

2255
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:07,890
But then I think about the concept.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and

2256
02:12:08,231 --> 02:12:11,860
certainly,
I mean when you're talking about art,

2257
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:16,950
the appreciation of art,
there has to be some sort of subjective 

2258
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:20,221
element integrated into them,
but there also must be a limit as well.

2259
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:26,280
I mean certain works of art.
We appreciate as absolute masterpieces,

2260
02:12:27,191 --> 02:12:32,191
like Michelangelo's Pieta for example,
what you bring up frequently because it 

2261
02:12:32,381 --> 02:12:37,381
really is that good.
But there's other things which are just 

2262
02:12:37,381 --> 02:12:39,250
by comparison to like vandalism,
you know,

2263
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:41,150
um,

2264
02:12:42,010 --> 02:12:47,010
now there's always a temptation to 
invoke the principle of a non 

2265
02:12:48,041 --> 02:12:52,600
overlapping magisterial.
But that seems like sort of a Capo,

2266
02:12:52,630 --> 02:12:54,220
right?
So I formulated,

2267
02:12:54,221 --> 02:12:57,100
I guess for myself,
for standards of measure,

2268
02:12:57,101 --> 02:13:02,101
which helped me separate what's the 
difference between art and mediocrity?

2269
02:13:02,410 --> 02:13:04,870
And here's the four.
Number One,

2270
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:07,780
education,
number two,

2271
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:10,480
time commitment.
You got to put in the time.

2272
02:13:10,481 --> 02:13:15,481
If you're an artist,
it's probably going to become your full 

2273
02:13:15,481 --> 02:13:16,330
time occupation is that you have to be 
that passionate about it.

2274
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:21,900
Number three,
public display art isn't something that 

2275
02:13:21,900 --> 02:13:23,710
you own for yourself.
You hide it in your basement,

2276
02:13:23,711 --> 02:13:28,711
then it's not.
Art is something that you have to 

2277
02:13:28,711 --> 02:13:28,711
express,
you know,

2278
02:13:28,711 --> 02:13:29,950
something which you've got to share,
and number four,

2279
02:13:29,951 --> 02:13:34,951
and I think this is the most one,
efficacy of vision.

2280
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:42,470
If you're an artist,
you've got to have a vision and we talk 

2281
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:43,500
about the dream state here a lot.
You go into the dream state,

2282
02:13:43,501 --> 02:13:48,501
you have inspiration,
but it's not enough to just have the 

2283
02:13:48,501 --> 02:13:49,110
inspiration because that's totally 
subjective for you.

2284
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:54,710
The Art,
the art part of it is having the 

2285
02:13:54,710 --> 02:13:58,280
techniques and the skill and the intent 
and I guess the capacity to turn that 

2286
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:02,451
into something real.
You know that you can then express or 

2287
02:14:02,451 --> 02:14:04,230
share.
So can you read Cardinal Ratzinger,

2288
02:14:04,231 --> 02:14:09,231
his explanation for the nature of time 
and then address the concept of beauty 

2289
02:14:09,231 --> 02:14:14,061
in the eye of the beholder with specific
reference to the body positivity 

2290
02:14:14,671 --> 02:14:15,120
movement.

2291
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:20,590
How speech?

2292
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:58,600
No,
I don't think I can.

2293
02:15:09,210 --> 02:15:10,080
I think that's

2294
02:15:12,450 --> 02:15:12,780
right.

2295
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:20,210
I think that you,
you tangled together so many things and 

2296
02:15:20,210 --> 02:15:24,340
this is also a tangle of things.
Not that that's a criticism that I can't

2297
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:29,820
pull them all together with sufficient 
rapidity not to bore the audience to 

2298
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:31,850
death.
So I'm gonna,

2299
02:15:31,870 --> 02:15:32,590
I'm gonna.
Wait,

2300
02:15:32,710 --> 02:15:37,710
I'm going to rate Dr Peterson.

2301
02:15:39,830 --> 02:15:44,180
I'm fascinated by the idea of faith,
what faith means.

2302
02:15:44,660 --> 02:15:47,810
Jacob listens to a voice and believes 
it.

2303
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:54,340
He probably heard other voices.
Why did he believe this one?

2304
02:15:55,340 --> 02:15:59,330
Why what?
There must have been an a priori sort of

2305
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:04,360
functional necessity for him to believe 
the voice that told him one thing or 

2306
02:16:06,381 --> 02:16:11,381
another.
And I think that that's a string that 

2307
02:16:11,381 --> 02:16:14,171
runs through the Bible and then through 
the new testament we are expected as 

2308
02:16:14,171 --> 02:16:15,160
well.
I confess I'm a Christian.

2309
02:16:15,170 --> 02:16:20,170
I'm I act like I believe God is real.
And and so there is this a call of faith

2310
02:16:22,071 --> 02:16:27,071
and also the in every hero story we,
we see now there is always a moment in 

2311
02:16:28,101 --> 02:16:30,220
that story where the hero

2312
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:34,420
must believe something beyond the 
evidence that is before then,

2313
02:16:34,421 --> 02:16:36,190
which is to say they must take a leap of
faith.

2314
02:16:36,191 --> 02:16:41,191
So I'm wondering if you could just kind 
of unpack that experience of faith in 

2315
02:16:41,191 --> 02:16:44,650
the understanding of how a human being 
makes the choice to believe one thing or

2316
02:16:44,651 --> 02:16:45,730
another.
God,

2317
02:16:45,731 --> 02:16:47,260
that's a great question.
I mean,

2318
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:52,630
is this still on?
Is this still working?

2319
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:54,310
Okay.
Okay,

2320
02:16:54,311 --> 02:16:55,480
good.
Um,

2321
02:16:56,020 --> 02:17:01,020
I don't,
I don't precisely know the answer that 

2322
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:02,710
it's a very peculiar thing because we 
think many things,

2323
02:17:02,711 --> 02:17:07,711
or you could say many voices appear in 
our minds because when Nisha took 

2324
02:17:08,231 --> 02:17:10,300
descartes,
I think therefore I am a part.

2325
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:10,900
And he said,
well,

2326
02:17:10,901 --> 02:17:13,930
it isn't so obvious that there's an eye,
first of all,

2327
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:18,640
that it's a unity,
like a unity transparent unto itself,

2328
02:17:18,641 --> 02:17:23,641
which of course the psychoanalysts 
picked up in a big way and then he 

2329
02:17:23,641 --> 02:17:26,140
wasn't sure that it was the eye who 
thought in some causal manner.

2330
02:17:26,141 --> 02:17:26,650
He said,
well,

2331
02:17:26,651 --> 02:17:28,450
no,
it's more like thoughts.

2332
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:33,510
It's something like thoughts appear in 
the phenomenal field and maybe you 

2333
02:17:33,510 --> 02:17:34,570
choose between them or maybe they 
possess you.

2334
02:17:34,571 --> 02:17:36,280
Like there's lots of other ways of 
thinking about it.

2335
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:41,700
It isn't exactly obvious to me why we 
choose to take one pathway rather than 

2336
02:17:41,981 --> 02:17:46,981
another when so many of them could offer
themselves to us.

2337
02:17:47,261 --> 02:17:52,261
You know,
people tend to talk about that as 

2338
02:17:52,261 --> 02:17:52,390
something like conscience,
right?

2339
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:54,530
And now maybe it's that

2340
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:05,880
it's gotta have something to do.
I think it's an endless regress because 

2341
02:18:06,251 --> 02:18:10,570
you can always ask why the why any 
assumption became primary,

2342
02:18:10,930 --> 02:18:15,930
but I'll put that aside for a moment.
It seems to me to have something to do 

2343
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:19,981
with your aims.
You know that you're more likely to 

2344
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:25,770
listen to a voice that is in keeping 
with your most fundamental aims and then

2345
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:29,410
the question is where do your most 
fundamental aims come from?

2346
02:18:29,411 --> 02:18:31,490
And from what I've been able to 
determine,

2347
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:35,410
and I'll speak psychologically again,
is that to begin with,

2348
02:18:35,411 --> 02:18:38,560
you're a concatenation of rather 
primitive,

2349
02:18:38,561 --> 02:18:41,170
subpersonalities hungry.
One's tired,

2350
02:18:41,171 --> 02:18:44,530
one's upset ones laughing one.
So you can see that in babies,

2351
02:18:44,531 --> 02:18:49,531
you know,
they cycle through those states very 

2352
02:18:49,531 --> 02:18:51,241
rapidly.
There's a infantile unity above all 

2353
02:18:51,241 --> 02:18:52,570
that,
but it doesn't have control.

2354
02:18:52,630 --> 02:18:57,630
Right?
And so then the developing individual 

2355
02:18:57,630 --> 02:18:58,300
has to figure out how to integrate those

2356
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:03,090
primitive subpersonalities into a 
unified personality.

2357
02:19:04,110 --> 02:19:09,110
At the same time,
they integrate the unified personality 

2358
02:19:09,110 --> 02:19:11,961
into a social unity.
So it's partly individual integration,

2359
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:19,160
but it's fed by social forces.
I mean even when you watch an infant 

2360
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:22,410
breastfeed,
it's established a relationship with its

2361
02:19:22,411 --> 02:19:25,830
mother and there's a reciprocity that's 
already at play there,

2362
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:31,400
so then that underlying multiplicity 
starts to form itself into a unity and 

2363
02:19:32,451 --> 02:19:37,451
then the question,
and I would say that something like 

2364
02:19:37,451 --> 02:19:40,870
that's something like the emergence of 
the individual out of out of the titans.

2365
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:43,910
That's a reasonable way of thinking 
about it,

2366
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:47,300
like a sovereign out of the titans at 
something like that,

2367
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:53,200
but then there's another division which 
seems to me to parallel a parallel that 

2368
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:57,790
the Cain and Abel Division is that that 
integration can be oriented towards 

2369
02:19:57,790 --> 02:20:02,401
something that's positive,
but it can also be oriented towards 

2370
02:20:02,401 --> 02:20:04,931
something that's negative and that's the
split of the world into good and evil.

2371
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:08,150
I think.
And then it looks like you're navigating

2372
02:20:08,151 --> 02:20:13,151
between those.
And I can only account for that with 

2373
02:20:13,151 --> 02:20:13,151
something like choice.
Like I think the free choice,

2374
02:20:13,550 --> 02:20:18,550
even though I don't understand it,
I'm unwilling to deny the existence of 

2375
02:20:18,831 --> 02:20:23,831
free choice merely because I don't 
understand it because it looks to me 

2376
02:20:23,831 --> 02:20:26,960
like that's how people are.
That's how the expect to be treated.

2377
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:32,140
And that societies who that structure 
themselves in accordance with the idea 

2378
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:36,250
that people have free choice actually 
work now that doesn't prove that there's

2379
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:41,260
free choice,
but people have been arguing about that 

2380
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:41,260
forever.
So,

2381
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:45,070
but it looks to me.
So those are two possible means of 

2382
02:20:45,070 --> 02:20:47,771
integration and that I think what you're
doing is feeding one or the other 

2383
02:20:47,771 --> 02:20:52,540
constantly.
And I think you probably choose which 

2384
02:20:52,540 --> 02:20:53,930
one to feed.
I think that's an.

2385
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:56,540
I mean that's how it feels that way to 
me as well.

2386
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:58,850
Like when I look at my own,
you know,

2387
02:20:59,750 --> 02:21:02,330
maybe you're really aggravated with 
something,

2388
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:04,400
maybe you're aggravated with your wife,
you know,

2389
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:05,590
or,
or,

2390
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:07,640
or your child or something like that,
you know,

2391
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:12,880
and you're feeling kind of nasty and 
maybe even know that you're in the 

2392
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:14,480
wrong.
And an idea comes into your head.

2393
02:21:14,481 --> 02:21:17,450
You can think,
I could say that and you know,

2394
02:21:17,451 --> 02:21:19,520
you could say it and you know what it 
would do,

2395
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:24,830
but then you pause and you think,
would that make it better or worse?

2396
02:21:24,831 --> 02:21:28,280
And then maybe you go to hell with it.
Which is quite the thing to say.

2397
02:21:28,281 --> 02:21:32,600
I've got a little story about that in a 
minute and then you say it,

2398
02:21:32,930 --> 02:21:36,740
but you knew,
you knew that you took the low road,

2399
02:21:36,770 --> 02:21:38,480
right,
and you know it,

2400
02:21:38,510 --> 02:21:43,510
and then you're guilty about that and 
defensive and that makes the fight way 

2401
02:21:43,510 --> 02:21:46,511
works because then there's no damn way 
you're going to admit that you actually 

2402
02:21:46,511 --> 02:21:48,320
did that and so things do go to hell and
so.

2403
02:21:48,650 --> 02:21:50,540
So here's,
here's an ugly little idea.

2404
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:52,880
So that's,
that's,

2405
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:57,940
that's relevant to the question.
So imagine you're playing around with 

2406
02:21:58,041 --> 02:22:03,041
cocaine.
Now I'm using cocaine because it's very 

2407
02:22:03,041 --> 02:22:07,541
addictive,
but it's a very interesting chemical 

2408
02:22:07,541 --> 02:22:07,980
because it's a dopaminergic agonist.
And what?

2409
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:11,750
What dopamine does is two things.
It makes you feel like what you're doing

2410
02:22:11,751 --> 02:22:15,530
is worthwhile,
but it also imagine that there's a bunch

2411
02:22:15,531 --> 02:22:20,531
of neurocircuits that are active and 
then they get a hit of dopamine or you 

2412
02:22:20,531 --> 02:22:23,210
do in those neurocircuits get a little 
bit more powerful.

2413
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:24,680
Okay?
So it,

2414
02:22:24,860 --> 02:22:26,070
it has a rewarding

2415
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:31,610
property,
which is that it makes you feel like 

2416
02:22:31,610 --> 02:22:32,690
what you're doing is important and it 
has a reinforcing property which is,

2417
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:37,700
it makes neurocircuits grow.
So now what that means is that whatever 

2418
02:22:39,511 --> 02:22:42,090
you were doing just before you took 
cocaine,

2419
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:44,330
grows,
okay?

2420
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:47,640
So now imagine there's a bunch of 
different things that you do just before

2421
02:22:47,641 --> 02:22:51,710
you take cocaine,
but there's a string of decisions and it

2422
02:22:52,050 --> 02:22:55,860
one decision point is the same for all 
of those different occurrences.

2423
02:22:55,861 --> 02:22:59,670
And that decision point is because you 
know you're in trouble and that decision

2424
02:22:59,671 --> 02:23:03,300
point is well to hell with it.
Okay?

2425
02:23:03,301 --> 02:23:08,040
So then you think that each of the 200 
times that you take cocaine,

2426
02:23:08,041 --> 02:23:13,041
even though you do it different places,
but that one thought is there all the 

2427
02:23:13,041 --> 02:23:16,860
time and that thing grows because you're
reinforcing it and it grows and it grows

2428
02:23:16,861 --> 02:23:17,550
and it grows.

2429
02:23:17,730 --> 02:23:19,270
And so now that's in you.
That's,

2430
02:23:19,300 --> 02:23:24,300
that's part of you.
And it's the thing that says to hell 

2431
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:24,300
with it.
Okay,

2432
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:28,851
so now,
and maybe that's not such a good thing 

2433
02:23:28,851 --> 02:23:30,120
to grow inside your brain.
So then you,

2434
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:35,360
you're addicted and they take you to a 
cocaine treatment center and after a 

2435
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:37,140
week you're no longer physically,
physiologically addicted.

2436
02:23:37,460 --> 02:23:42,460
You're not craving.
You don't have a problem as long as 

2437
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:45,771
you're there.
But then they take you back to your 

2438
02:23:45,771 --> 02:23:45,930
normal environment and you see like 
cocaine,

2439
02:23:45,931 --> 02:23:47,010
Joe,
your friend,

2440
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:50,760
and as soon as you see him up,
that thing comes in,

2441
02:23:50,761 --> 02:23:53,280
Bang,
you're back on your back,

2442
02:23:54,300 --> 02:23:59,300
on the trail with a track and that's 
while you're in where you will end up 

2443
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:03,711
too,
if you reinforce that particular 

2444
02:24:03,711 --> 02:24:07,011
perspective long enough.
So that's akin in a sense to the 

2445
02:24:07,011 --> 02:24:08,160
decision making process.
You know,

2446
02:24:08,580 --> 02:24:10,620
if you,
if you take the low road,

2447
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:16,190
then that winds and it gets a little 
stronger because everything that wins 

2448
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:20,550
neurologically gets a little stronger.
It's like a Darwinian competition.

2449
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:25,880
So one rule is don't practice what you 
don't want to become because you really 

2450
02:24:25,891 --> 02:24:27,690
do become that.
It builds,

2451
02:24:27,810 --> 02:24:30,540
it builds itself right into your neural 
architecture.

2452
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:33,000
And that's one of the terrifying things 
about addiction,

2453
02:24:33,001 --> 02:24:33,690
you know,
because you think,

2454
02:24:33,691 --> 02:24:35,190
well,
it's kind of psychological.

2455
02:24:35,191 --> 02:24:36,180
It's like,
yeah,

2456
02:24:36,181 --> 02:24:39,090
kind of.
It's also kind of neurophysiological and

2457
02:24:39,091 --> 02:24:44,091
you build a one eyed cocaine monster in 
your head if you hit yourself enough 

2458
02:24:44,091 --> 02:24:49,071
with something that reinforcing.
So yeah.

2459
02:24:52,610 --> 02:24:55,480
Thanks.

2460
02:24:55,620 --> 02:24:57,240
Last question,
I guess.

2461
02:24:57,870 --> 02:25:02,870
Hallelujah.
I'm just a really simple question then 

2462
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:06,860
take that long suffering when it,
one of the things though is noticing 

2463
02:25:09,301 --> 02:25:13,830
from the stories of Jacob and a lot of 
these biblical narratives is you do have

2464
02:25:13,831 --> 02:25:18,831
this all powerful God who is able to 
kind of essentially be the hidden 

2465
02:25:18,831 --> 02:25:23,241
protagonist in the narrative.
But then the funny thing is that he's 

2466
02:25:23,241 --> 02:25:25,690
kind of revealing some of his qualities 
throughout the course of the story.

2467
02:25:25,691 --> 02:25:27,890
So you were talking about,
um,

2468
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:33,660
the weird paradox of the fact that God's
somehow alive as Jacob Israel to win the

2469
02:25:34,631 --> 02:25:37,000
fight.
He does that with Abraham to.

2470
02:25:37,070 --> 02:25:40,030
Yeah.
So my question is relating to penn steps

2471
02:25:40,031 --> 02:25:45,031
thing about the rats that you told like 
three or four times and the number of 

2472
02:25:45,031 --> 02:25:45,580
occasions I saw one of your more recent 
videos.

2473
02:25:45,581 --> 02:25:48,820
You've talked about it where the bigger 
rat lets the smaller Rhett when,

2474
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:51,640
because then the other smaller rat won't
engage in the game.

2475
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:54,160
So the question is twofold.
For me.

2476
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:58,180
One is God allowing humanity to when 
periodically.

2477
02:25:58,330 --> 02:26:02,740
So that's to allow us to actually engage
in the dialogue through these stories.

2478
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:07,950
And two,
is it a much more primitive version of 

2479
02:26:07,950 --> 02:26:09,850
the virtue of humility,
which you wouldn't normally characterize

2480
02:26:09,851 --> 02:26:12,910
of an of an of an omnipotent deity?

2481
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:13,770
Hmm.

2482
02:26:15,030 --> 02:26:20,030
Well,
those are excellent questions that I 

2483
02:26:20,030 --> 02:26:22,551
really liked.
The second one in particular that that 

2484
02:26:22,551 --> 02:26:25,760
God's decision to allow human victory 
from time to time is actually a 

2485
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:29,760
manifestation of something approximating
humility or at least mercy.

2486
02:26:30,090 --> 02:26:32,340
But humility is an interesting take on 
it.

2487
02:26:32,470 --> 02:26:37,470
Well,
it's also connected to Paul's image of 

2488
02:26:37,470 --> 02:26:40,891
how Christ handed them hands himself 
over and allows himself to be defeated 

2489
02:26:40,891 --> 02:26:44,440
by men and therefore a conquers sin,
which is man's enemy.

2490
02:26:44,470 --> 02:26:49,470
It's a weird.
It's the same paradox where God enters 

2491
02:26:49,470 --> 02:26:52,210
into that dynamic with people and loses 
and willingly loses.

2492
02:26:53,550 --> 02:26:56,130
Yeah.
Well that's okay.

2493
02:26:56,131 --> 02:26:59,730
So the first thing I would say is that.
That's a really interesting analogy.

2494
02:27:00,230 --> 02:27:01,300
I,
I,

2495
02:27:03,170 --> 02:27:08,170
I can't.
It's complicated enough questions so 

2496
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:10,581
that I can't go be.
I don't think I can go beyond the 

2497
02:27:10,581 --> 02:27:14,121
question actually because it's so 
complicated that I don't think I can 

2498
02:27:14,121 --> 02:27:14,340
formulate it any better than you already
did.

2499
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:16,890
Like it's an interesting string of 
ideas.

2500
02:27:16,891 --> 02:27:19,710
I'd have to play with it a while to see 
it does.

2501
02:27:20,070 --> 02:27:25,070
She had an interesting light on why God 
is amenable to negotiation in the Old 

2502
02:27:26,431 --> 02:27:27,960
Testament,
which is really a strange.

2503
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:29,880
As you pointed out,
it's really a strange thing.

2504
02:27:29,881 --> 02:27:34,881
It's like this is omnipotent God who 
obviously can do whatever he wants and 

2505
02:27:34,881 --> 02:27:39,471
yet he allow,
he can be bargained with and then that 

2506
02:27:39,471 --> 02:27:41,430
also opens up the question of why like 
your hypothesis as well.

2507
02:27:41,431 --> 02:27:43,550
If you don't let the little rat win now 
and then,

2508
02:27:43,551 --> 02:27:46,940
then they get dejected and quit playing.
And that's.

2509
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:47,530
I mean,
that's,

2510
02:27:47,660 --> 02:27:51,660
that's a pretty good observation if 
people don't get to win now and then you

2511
02:27:51,661 --> 02:27:53,700
know,
that's Kinda what happens to cane.

2512
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:55,170
God says,
well,

2513
02:27:55,171 --> 02:27:57,660
you're not playing a straight game.
That's why you're not winning.

2514
02:27:58,020 --> 02:27:58,380
But

2515
02:28:01,710 --> 02:28:02,170
I don't know.

2516
02:28:06,220 --> 02:28:11,220
There's an intimation in the old 
testament and I think it's more 

2517
02:28:11,220 --> 02:28:14,041
developed in the New Testament.
Maybe not that the straighter the game 

2518
02:28:14,041 --> 02:28:15,280
you play,
the more likely you are to win.

2519
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:21,630
And so maybe part of the reason that God
lets Abraham Bargain and and even Jacob 

2520
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:26,000
is because they've started to play very 
straight games.

2521
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:31,750
And so maybe you do when in you're 
wrestling with God if you play a 

2522
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:31,750
straight gay.
I mean,

2523
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:33,110
I think.
I actually think that's.

2524
02:28:33,140 --> 02:28:38,140
I think the reason that's true is 
because that's actually why we would 

2525
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:41,030
define it as a street gate now.
Then we could speak psychologically.

2526
02:28:41,031 --> 02:28:46,031
Again,
I think that what we've come to 

2527
02:28:46,031 --> 02:28:48,371
recognize as a straight game is the game
that in the broadest number of 

2528
02:28:48,591 --> 02:28:53,591
situations across the widest range of 
time spans is most likely to produce a 

2529
02:28:54,231 --> 02:28:55,830
positive outcome.
And that's,

2530
02:28:55,860 --> 02:29:00,860
that's actually the grounds for our 
sense of ethics that it's really 

2531
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:00,860
practical.

2532
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:02,700
Not to Belabor it too much because there
was,

2533
02:29:02,730 --> 02:29:07,730
there was an interesting insight from 
Chesterton's demand who was Thursday 

2534
02:29:07,730 --> 02:29:11,360
where God sets himself up as the 
benevolent antagonist so as to 

2535
02:29:11,820 --> 02:29:12,400
accelerate

2536
02:29:12,580 --> 02:29:14,800
game.
Yeah.

2537
02:29:14,801 --> 02:29:19,801
Well,
I think that's a really interesting 

2538
02:29:19,801 --> 02:29:19,801
idea.
I mean,

2539
02:29:19,801 --> 02:29:20,020
there is,
there is hints,

2540
02:29:20,021 --> 02:29:25,021
I would say throughout the biblical 
stories that the reason that God 

2541
02:29:25,270 --> 02:29:30,270
tolerates Satan,
let's say is because without an 

2542
02:29:30,270 --> 02:29:32,410
adversary,
you're soft and that's,

2543
02:29:32,480 --> 02:29:34,840
I mean,
that's tied in with the notion that life

2544
02:29:34,841 --> 02:29:37,310
is something like a moral struggle.
You know,

2545
02:29:37,311 --> 02:29:40,480
that that's the fundamental essence of 
being a moral struggle.

2546
02:29:40,990 --> 02:29:45,990
Now I think that that's phenomenal.
Logically a reasonable observation.

2547
02:29:46,121 --> 02:29:48,730
Maybe it's maybe other people don't 
experience it that way,

2548
02:29:48,731 --> 02:29:53,050
but it seems to me like within my own 
experience that that's accurate.

2549
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:58,560
Now I don't know what Dan,
I don't know what that says about the 

2550
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:01,081
fundamental nature of reality,
but I had a vision at one point that I 

2551
02:30:01,081 --> 02:30:05,350
was in a ring with Satan actually,
believe it or not,

2552
02:30:05,710 --> 02:30:10,710
and it was like a Roman coliseum and I 
was rather upset to find myself there,

2553
02:30:15,071 --> 02:30:20,071
but I won and I asked God afterwards why
he would do such a thing and his answer 

2554
02:30:22,181 --> 02:30:24,790
was he knew I could win.

2555
02:30:25,550 --> 02:30:26,740
That's interesting,
you know,

2556
02:30:26,741 --> 02:30:28,810
because like,
I don't know what to make of that.

2557
02:30:28,811 --> 02:30:30,670
Believe me,
I have no idea what to make of that.

2558
02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:36,030
But the idea was that if you're trying 
to encourage someone rather than protect

2559
02:30:38,261 --> 02:30:43,261
them,
because those are really different 

2560
02:30:43,261 --> 02:30:43,261
things,
right?

2561
02:30:43,261 --> 02:30:43,261
To protect someone isn't to make them 
strong,

2562
02:30:43,261 --> 02:30:43,900
to encourage them is to make them 
strong.

2563
02:30:44,350 --> 02:30:47,680
Then you set them a series of 
challenges,

2564
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:50,860
right?
Right.

2565
02:30:50,861 --> 02:30:55,861
At the point where they may win and 
maybe you could make a case that that's 

2566
02:30:55,861 --> 02:30:58,060
what you do if you really care for 
someone.

2567
02:30:58,390 --> 02:31:03,390
Now I know that that's it.
I'm not saying that that interpretation 

2568
02:31:03,390 --> 02:31:06,811
is correct,
but there's something mean you 

2569
02:31:06,811 --> 02:31:11,761
definitely with your children,
you know when you're wrestling with 

2570
02:31:11,761 --> 02:31:11,761
them,
say when you're playing with them,

2571
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:17,040
you use,
you push them to the limit of their 

2572
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:21,060
ability because otherwise they don't 
transcend their current abilities.

2573
02:31:22,050 --> 02:31:22,680
So.

2574
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:30,620
Yep.
Thank you.

2575
02:31:39,380 --> 02:31:44,380
So we'll see some of you,
perhaps most of you in December and I 

2576
02:31:44,571 --> 02:31:47,330
think we'll finish off genesis at that 
point.

2577
02:31:47,870 --> 02:31:50,900
And then in the new year,
probably not till the spring,

2578
02:31:51,530 --> 02:31:56,530
I'll start with exodus,
which I'm really looking forward to 

2579
02:31:56,530 --> 02:31:59,810
because I really liked the exodus story.
It's an amazing story and unbelievably 

2580
02:31:59,810 --> 02:32:00,350
deep.
Not well.

2581
02:32:00,351 --> 02:32:03,680
The ones we've covered so far have been 
pretty good as well,

2582
02:32:03,681 --> 02:32:07,400
but so thank you all for coming and will
perhaps see you in about a month.
